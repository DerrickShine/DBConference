A hierarchical approach to model web query interfaces for web source integration,Eduard C Dragut; Thomas Kabisch; Clement Yu; Ulf Leser,Abstract Much data in the Web is hidden behind Web query interfaces. In most cases theonly means to" surface" the content of a Web database is by formulating complex queries onsuch interfaces. Applications such as Deep Web crawling and Web database integrationrequire an automatic usage of these interfaces. Therefore; an important problem to beaddressed is the automatic extraction of query interfaces into an appropriate model. Wehypothesize the existence of a set of domain-independent" commonsense design rules" thatguides the creation of Web query interfaces. These rules transform query interfaces intoschema trees. In this paper we describe a Web query interface extraction algorithm; whichcombines HTML tokens and the geometric layout of these tokens within a Web page. Tokensare classified into several classes out of which the most significant ones are text tokens …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,88
Composing mappings between schemas using a reference ontology,Eduard Dragut; Ramon Lawrence,Abstract Large-scale database integration requires a significant cost in developing a globalschema and finding mappings between the global and local schemas. Developing theglobal schema requires matching and merging the concepts in the data sources and is abottleneck in the process. In this paper we propose a strategy for computing the mappingbetween schemas by performing a composition of the mappings between individualschemas and a reference ontology. Our premise is that many organizations have standardontologies that; although they may not be suitable as a global schema; are useful inproviding standard terminology and naming conventions for concepts and relationships. It isvaluable to leverage these existing ontological resources to help automate the constructionof a global schema and mappings between schemas. Our system semi-automates the …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2004,70
Stop word and related problems in web interface integration,Eduard Dragut; Fang Fang; Prasad Sistla; Clement Yu; Weiyi Meng,Abstract The goal of recent research projects on integrating Web databases has been toenable uniform access to the large amount of data behind query interfaces. Among the tasksaddressed are: source discovery; query interface extraction; schema matching; etc. Thereare also a number of tasks that are commonly ignored or assumed to be apriori solved eithermanually or by some oracle. These tasks include (1) finding the set of stop words and (2)handling occurrences of" semantic enrichment words" within labels. These two subproblemshave a direct impact on determining the synonymy and hyponymy relationships betweenlabels. In (1); a word like" from" is a stop word in general but it is a content word in domainssuch as Airline and Real Estate. We formulate the stop word problem; prove its complexityand provide an approximation algorithm. In (2); we study the impact of words like AND …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,53
Construction of a sentimental word dictionary,Eduard C Dragut; Clement Yu; Prasad Sistla; Weiyi Meng,Abstract The Web has plenty of reviews; comments and reports about products; services;government policies; institutions; etc. The opinions expressed in these reviews influencehow people regard these entities. For example; a product with consistently good reviews islikely to sell well; while a product with numerous bad reviews is likely to sell poorly. Our aimis to build a sentimental word dictionary; which is larger than existing sentimental worddictionaries and has high accuracy. We introduce rules for deduction; which take words withknown polarities as input and produce synsets (a set of synonyms with a definition) withpolarities. The synsets with deduced polarities can then be used to further deduce thepolarities of other words. Experimental results show that for a given sentimental worddictionary with D words; approximately an additional 50% of D words with polarities can …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,49
Merging source query interfaces onweb databases,Eduard Dragut; Wensheng Wu; Prasad Sistla; Clement Yu; Weiyi Meng,Recently; there are many e-commerce search engines that return information from Webdatabases. Unlike text search engines; these e-commerce search engines have morecomplicated user interfaces. Our aim is to construct automatically a natural query userinterface that integrates a set of interfaces over a given domain of interest. For example;each airline company has a query interface for ticket reservation and our system canconstruct an integrated interface for all these companies. This will permit users to accessinformation uniformly from multiple sources. Each query interface from an e-commercesearch engine is designed so as to facilitate users to provide necessary information.Specifically;(1) related pieces of information such as first name and last name are groupedtogether and (2) certain hierarchical relationships are maintained. In this paper; we …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,46
Deep web integration with visqi,Thomas Kabisch; Eduard C Dragut; Clement Yu; Ulf Leser,Abstract In this paper; we present VisQI (VISual Query interface Integration system); a DeepWeb integration system. VisQI is capable of (1) transforming Web query interfaces intohierarchically structured representations;(2) of classifying them into application domains and(3) of matching the elements of different interfaces. Thus VisQI contains solutions for themajor challenges in building Deep Web integration systems.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,33
Meaningful labeling of integrated query interfaces,Eduard C Dragut; Clement Yu; Weiyi Meng,Abstract The contents of Web databases are accessed through queries formulated oncomplex user interfaces. In many domains of interest (eg Auto) users are interested inobtaining information from alternative sources. Thus; they have to access many individualWeb databases via query interfaces. We aim to construct automatically a well-designedquery interface that integrates a set of interfaces in the same domain. This will permit usersto access information uniformly from multiple sources. Earlier research in this area includesmatching attributes across multiple query interfaces in the same domain and groupingrelated attributes. In this paper; we investigate the naming of the attributes in the integratedquery interface. We provide a set of properties which are required in order to have consistentlabels for the attributes within an integrated interface so that users have no difficulty in …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,26
Deep web query interface understanding and integration,Eduard C Dragut; Weiyi Meng; Clement T Yu,Abstract There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extenttheir contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormousinterest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily twogeneral approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of thesesources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines.The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integratedaccess to them. In this book; we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting;understanding; and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. Thesetechniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. Theinterface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2012,20
Building a terabyte NEXRAD radar database for hydrometeorology research,Anton Kruger; Ramon Lawrence; Eduard Constantin Dragut,Abstract The management and processing of terabyte-scale radar data sets is time-consuming; costly; and an impediment to research. Researchers require rapid andtransparent access to the data without being encumbered with the technical challenges ofdata management. In this paper; we describe a database architecture that manages over 12TB (and growing) of Archive Level II data that is produced by the United States NationalWeather Service's network of WSR-88D weather radars. The contribution of this work is anautomatic system for archiving and analyzing radar data that isolates geoscientists from thecomplexities of data storage and retrieval. Data access transparency is achieved by using arelational database to store metadata on the raw data; which enables simple SQL queries toretrieve data subsets of interest. The second component is a distributed web platform that …,Computers & Geosciences,2006,17
Polarity consistency checking for sentiment dictionaries,Eduard Dragut; Hong Wang; Clement Yu; Prasad Sistla; Weiyi Meng,Abstract Polarity classification of words is important for applications such as Opinion Miningand Sentiment Analysis. A number of sentiment word/sense dictionaries have beenmanually or (semi) automatically constructed. The dictionaries have substantialinaccuracies. Besides obvious instances; where the same word appears with differentpolarities in different dictionaries; the dictionaries exhibit complex cases; which cannot bedetected by mere manual inspection. We introduce the concept of polarity consistency ofwords/senses in sentiment dictionaries in this paper. We show that the consistency problemis NP-complete.

Author disambiguation by hierarchical agglomerative clustering with adaptive stopping criterion,Lei Cen; Eduard C Dragut; Luo Si; Mourad Ouzzani,Abstract Entity disambiguation is an important step in many information retrievalapplications. This paper proposes new research for entity disambiguation with the focus ofname disambiguation in digital libraries. In particular; pairwise similarity is first learned forpublications that share the same author name string (ANS) and then a novel HierarchicalAgglomerative Clustering approach with Adaptive Stopping Criterion (HACASC) is proposedto adaptively cluster a set of publications that share a same ANS to individual clusters ofpublications with different author identities. The HACASC approach utilizes a mixture ofkernel ridge regressions to intelligently determine the threshold in clustering. This obtainsmore appropriate clustering granularity than non-adaptive stopping criterion.

Query-time record linkage and fusion over web databases,Eduard C Dragut; Mourad Ouzzani; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Data-intensive Web applications usually require integrating data from Web sources at querytime. The sources may refer to the same real-world entity in different ways and some mayeven provide outdated or erroneous data. An important task is to recognize and merge therecords that refer to the same real world entity at query time. Most existing duplicatedetection and fusion techniques work in the off-line setting and do not meet the onlineconstraint. There are at least two aspects that differentiate online duplicate detection andfusion from its off-line counterpart.(i) The latter assumes that the entire data is available;while the former cannot make such an assumption.(ii) Several query submissions may berequired to compute the “ideal” representation of an entity in the online setting.

The role of adverbs in sentiment analysis,Eduard Dragut; Christiane Fellbaum,Abstract Sentiment Analysis; an important area of Natural Language Understanding; oftenrelies on the assumption that lexemes carry inherent sentiment values; as reflected inspecialized resources. We examine and measure the contribution that eight intensifyingadverbs make to the sentiment value of sentences; as judged by human annotators. Ourresults show; first; that the intensifying adverbs are not themselves sentiment-laden butstrengthen the sentiment conveyed by words in their contexts to different degrees. Weconsider the consequences for appropriate modifications of the representation of theadverbs in sentiment lexicons.,Proceedings of Frame Semantics in NLP: A Workshop in Honor of Chuck Fillmore (1929-2014),2014,7
Deriving customized integrated web query interfaces,Eduard C Dragut; Fang Fang; Clement Yu; Weiyi Meng,Abstract Given a set of query interfaces from providers in the same domain (eg; car rental);the goal is to build automatically an integrated interface that makes the access to individualsources transparent to users. Our goal is to allow users to choose their preferred providers.Consequently; the integrated interface should reflect only the query interfaces of thesesources. The problem scrutinized in this work is deriving customized integrated interfaces.On the hypothesis that query interfaces on the Web are easily understood by ordinary users(well-designed assumption); mainly because of the way their attributes are organized(structural property) and named (lexical property); we develop algorithms to constructcustomized integrated interfaces. Experiments are performed to validate our analyticalstudies; including a user survey.,Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology-Volume 01,2009,5
Merging query results from local search engines for georeferenced objects,Eduard C Dragut; Bhaskar Dasgupta; Brian P Beirne; Ali Neyestani; Badr Atassi; Clement Yu; Weiyi Meng,Abstract The emergence of numerous online sources about local services presents a needfor more automatic yet accurate data integration techniques. Local services aregeoreferenced objects and can be queried by their locations on a map; for instance;neighborhoods. Typical local service queries (eg;“French Restaurant in The Loop”) includenot only information about “what”(“French Restaurant”) a user is searching for (such ascuisine) but also “where” information; such as neighborhood (“The Loop”). In this article; weaddress three key problems: query translation; result merging and ranking. Most localsearch engines provide a (hierarchical) organization of (large) cities into neighborhoods. Aneighborhood in one local search engine may correspond to sets of neighborhoods in otherlocal search engines. These make the query translation challenging.

CRIS—Computational research infrastructure for science,Eduard C Dragut; Peter Baker; Jia Xu; Muhammad I Sarfraz; Elisa Bertino; Amgad Madhkour; Raghu Agarwal; Ahmed Mahmood; Sangchun Han,The challenges facing the scientific community are common and real: conduct relevant andverifiable research in a rapidly changing collaborative landscape with an ever increasingscale of data. It has come to a point where research activities cannot scale at the raterequired without improved cyberinfrastructure (CI). In this paper we describe CRIS (TheComputational Research Infrastructure for Science); with its primary tenets to provide aneasy to use; scalable; and collaborative scientific data management and workflowcyberinfrastructure for scientists lacking extensive computational expertise. Some of the keyfeatures of CRIS are: 1) semantic definition of scientific data using domain vocabularies; 2)embedded provenance for all levels of research activity (data; workflows; tools etc.); 3) easyintegration of existing heterogeneous data and computational tools on local or remote …,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,4
The Palm-tree Index: Indexing with the crowd,Aamer Mahmood; Walid G Aref; Eduard Dragut; Saleh Basalamah,Abstract Crowdsourcing services allow employing human intelligence in tasks that aredifficult to accomplish with computers such as image tagging and data collection. At arelatively low monetary cost and through web interfaces such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk(AMT); humans can act as a computational operator in large systems. Recent work has beenconducted to build database management systems that can harness the crowd power indatabase operators; such as sort; join; count; etc. The fundamental problem of indexingwithin crowdsourced databases has not been studied. In this paper; we study the problem oftree-based indexing within crowd-nabled databases. We investigate the effect of various treeand crowdsourcing parameters on the quality of index operations. We propose newalgorithms for index search; insert; and update.,*,2013,3
Reflections on Data Integration for SDN,Anduo Wang; Jason Croft; Eduard Dragut,Abstract Software-defined networking (SDN) provides an unprecedented opportunity toexercise computing principles in networking practice. This paper investigates dataintegration; a under-explored discipline from the database community. We propose tomanage the various SDN control applications that collectively drive a shared dataplaneusing a data integration system. First; we develop a baseline design and study its feasibilityon two networking challenges not adequately addressed in classic data integration systems:the extensibility requirement to add new controls on demand; and the performancerequirement to cope with fast dataplane updates. Central to our baseline design is arelational model; where the entire SDN is represented as relational data (values in tables)with distinct roles. The control applications act as data sources generating network state …,Proceedings of the ACM International Workshop on Security in Software Defined Networks & Network Function Virtualization,2017,2
FLORIN: a system to support (near) real-time applications on user generated content on daily news,Qingyuan Liu; Eduard C Dragut; Arjun Mukherjee; Weiyi Meng,Abstract In this paper; we propose a system; FLORIN; which provides support for near real-time applications on user generated content on daily news. FLORIN continuously crawlsnews outlets for articles and user comments accompanying them. It attaches the articles andcomments to daily event stories. It identifies the opinionated content in user comments andperforms named entity recognition on news articles. All these pieces of information areorganized hierarchically and exportable to other applications. Multiple applications can bebuilt on this data. We have implemented a sentiment analysis system that runs on top of it.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,2
Towards debugging sentiment lexicons,Andrew Schneider; Eduard Dragut,Abstract Central to many sentiment analysis tasks are sentiment lexicons (SLs). SLs exhibitpolarity inconsistencies. Previous work studied the problem of checking the consistency ofan SL for the case when the entries have categorical labels (positive; negative or neutral)and showed that it is NP-hard. In this paper; we address the more general problem; in whichpolarity tags take the form of a continuous distribution in the interval [0; 1]. We show that thisproblem is polynomial. We develop a general framework for addressing the consistencyproblem using linear programming (LP) theory. LP tools allow us to uncover inconsistenciesefficiently; paving the way to building SL debugging tools. We show that previous workcorresponds to 0-1 integer programming; a particular case of LP.

Result merging for structured queries on the deep web with active relevance weight estimation,Jing Yuan; Lihong He; Eduard C Dragut; Weiyi Meng; Clement Yu,Abstract Data integration systems on the Deep Web offer a transparent means to querymultiple data sources at once. Result merging–the generation of an overall ranked list ofresults from different sources in response to a query–is a key component of a dataintegration system. In this work we present a result merging model; called Active RelevanceWeight Estimation model. Different from the existing techniques for result merging; weestimate the relevance of a data source in answering a query at query time. The relevancesfor a set of data sources are expressed with a (normalized) weighting scheme: the larger theweight for a data source the more relevant the source is in answering a query. We estimatethe weights of a data source in each subset of the data sources involved in a training query.Because an online query may not exactly match any training query; we devise methods to …,Information Systems,2017,1
ORLF: A flexible framework for online record linkage and fusion,Eduard C Dragut; Mourad Ouzzani; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Walid G Aref,With the exponential growth of data on the Web comes the opportunity to integrate multiplesources to give more accurate answers to user queries. Upon retrieving records frommultiple Web databases; a key task is to merge records that refer to the same real-worldentity. We demonstrate ORLF (Online Record Linkage and Fusion); a flexible query-timerecord linkage and fusion framework. ORLF deduplicates newly arriving query results jointlywith previously processed query results. We use an iterative caching solution that leveragesquery locality to effectively deduplicate newly incoming records with cached records. ORLFaims to deliver timely query answers that are duplicate-free and reflect knowledge collectedfrom previous queries.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,1

10th international workshop on quality in databases: QDB 2012,Xin Luna Dong; Eduard Constantin Dragut,The problem of low-quality data in databases; data warehouses; and information systemssignificantly and indistinctly affects every application domain. Many data processing tasks(such as information integration; data sharing; information retrieval; and knowledgediscovery from databases) require various forms of data preparation and consolidation withcomplex data processing techniques. These tasks usually assume that the data inputconforms to nice data distributions; containing no missing; inconsistent or incorrect values.This leaves a large gap between the available “dirty” data and the available machinery toeffectively process the data for the application purposes.

A framework for transparently accessing deep web sources,Eduard Constantin Dragut,Abstract An increasing number of Web sites expose their content via query interfaces; manyof them offering the same type of products/services (eg; flight tickets; car rental/purchasing).They constitute the so-called" Deep Web". Accessing the content on the Deep Web hasbeen a long-standing challenge for the database community. For a user interested inobtaining information about products from alternative Web sites it is a daunting task tomanually access them. Providing a uniform access to these sources is therefore of practicalimportance as it facilitates users to search and compare services/products of multipleproviders. We aim to construct an integrated system that makes the access to individualsources transparent to users. To achieve this goal a number of problems need to beaddressed. First; for a certain domain of discourse (eg; real estate) a uniform query …,*,2010,1
Satirical News Detection and Analysis using Attention Mechanism and Linguistic Features,Fan Yang; Arjun Mukherjee; Eduard Dragut,Abstract: Satirical news is considered to be entertainment; but it is potentially deceptive andharmful. Despite the embedded genre in the article; not everyone can recognize the satiricalcues and therefore believe the news as true news. We observe that satirical cues are oftenreflected in certain paragraphs rather than the whole document. Existing works onlyconsider document-level features to detect the satire; which could be limited. We considerparagraph-level linguistic features to unveil the satire by incorporating neural network andattention mechanism. We investigate the difference between paragraph-level features anddocument-level features; and analyze them on a large satirical news dataset. The evaluationshows that the proposed model detects satirical news effectively and reveals what featuresare important at which level.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.01189,2017,*
Spatial-temporal campus crime pattern mining from historical alert messages,Shela Wu; John Male; Eduard Dragut,A recent slew of violence-related events have incited a flood of discussions revolving aroundissues such as gun control and domestic safety abroad. An issue that hits close to home isthe concern of safety at urban universities. Studying the geo-temporal distribution of crimewithin and around a university setting is important for understanding crime type occurrencepatterns. These patterns can be mined from alert messages posted by universities onvarious media outlets; such as email; Twitter; and Facebook. We believe that the knowledgeinferred from this data can be a crucial factor in creating a safe environment to protectstudents; faculty members; and administration.

PSH: A probabilistic signature hash method with hash neighborhood candidate generation for fast edit-distance string comparison on big data,Joseph Jupin; Justin Y Shi; Eduard C Dragut,Approximate string matching is essential because data entry errors are unavoidable.Approximately 80% of data entry errors are a single edit distance from the correct entry. Weintroduce Probabilistic Signature Hashing (PSH); a hash-based filter and verify method toenhance the performance of edit distance comparison of relatively short strings with provenno loss to accuracy. Our experiments show that the proposed method is almost 6800 ordersof magnitude faster than Damerau-Levenshtein (DL) edit distance and produces the sameexact results. This method combines prefix pruning; string bit signatures and hashing toprovide very fast edit-distance comparison with no loss of true positive matches.

Reducing the cost of validating mapping compositions by exploiting semantic relationships,Eduard Dragut; Ramon Lawrence,Abstract Defining and composing mappings are fundamental operations required in anydata sharing architecture (eg data warehouse; data integration). Mapping composition isused to generate new mappings from existing ones and is useful when no direct mapping isavailable. The complexity of mapping composition depends on the amount of syntactic andsemantic information in the mapping. The composition of mappings has proven to beinefficient to compute in many situations unless the mappings are simplified to binaryrelationships that represent “similarity” between concepts. Our contribution is an algorithmfor composing metadata mappings that capture explicit semantics in terms of binaryrelationships. Our approach allows the hard cases of mapping composition to be detectedand semi-automatically resolved; and thus reduces the manual effort required during …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2006,*
