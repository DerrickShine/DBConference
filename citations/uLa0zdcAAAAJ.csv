Finding bursty topics from microblogs,Qiming Diao; Jing Jiang; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract Microblogs such as Twitter reflect the general public's reactions to major events.Bursty topics from microblogs reveal what events have attracted the most online attention.Although bursty event detection from text streams has been studied before; previous workmay not be suitable for microblogs because compared with other text streams such as newsarticles and scientific publications; microblog posts are particularly diverse and noisy. To findtopics that have bursty patterns on microblogs; we propose a topic model thatsimultaneously captures two observations:(1) posts published around the same time aremore likely to have the same topic; and (2) posts published by the same user are more likelyto have the same topic. The former helps find event-driven posts while the latter helpsidentify and filter out" personal" posts. Our experiments on a large Twitter dataset show …,Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Long Papers-Volume 1,2012,215
Graph OLAP: Towards online analytical processing on graphs,Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) is an important notion in data analysis. Recently;more and more graph or networked data sources come into being. There exists a similarneed to deploy graph analysis from different perspectives and with multiple granularities.However; traditional OLAP technology cannot handle such demands because it does notconsider the links among individual data tuples. In this paper; we develop a novel graphOLAP framework; which presents a multi-dimensional and multi-level view over graphs. Thecontributions of this work are two-fold. First; starting from basic definitions; ie; what aredimensions and measures in the graph OLAP scenario; we develop a conceptual frameworkfor data cubes on graphs. We also look into different semantics of OLAP operations; andclassify the framework into two major subcases: informational OLAP and topological …,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08.

Cqarank: jointly model topics and expertise in community question answering,Liu Yang; Minghui Qiu; Swapna Gottipati; Feida Zhu; Jing Jiang; Huiping Sun; Zhong Chen,Abstract Community Question Answering (CQA) websites; where people share expertise onopen platforms; have become large repositories of valuable knowledge. To bring the bestvalue out of these knowledge repositories; it is critically important for CQA services to knowhow to find the right experts; retrieve archived similar questions and recommend bestanswers to new questions. To tackle this cluster of closely related problems in a principledapproach; we proposed Topic Expertise Model (TEM); a novel probabilistic generativemodel with GMM hybrid; to jointly model topics and expertise by integrating textual contentmodel and link structure analysis. Based on TEM results; we proposed CQARank tomeasure user interests and expertise score under different topics.

Text cube: Computing ir measures for multidimensional text database analysis,Cindy Xide Lin; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han; Feida Zhu; Bo Zhao,Since Jim Gray introduced the concept of” data cube” in 1997; data cube; associated withonline analytical processing (OLAP); has become a driving engine in data warehouseindustry. Because the boom of Internet has given rise to an ever increasing amount of textdata associated with other multidimensional information; it is natural to propose a data cubemodel that integrates the power of traditional OLAP and IR techniques for text. In this paper;we propose a Text-Cube model on multidimensional text database and study effective OLAPover such data. Two kinds of hierarchies are distinguishable inside: dimensional hierarchyand term hierarchy. By incorporating these hierarchies; we conduct systematic studies onefficient text-cube implementation; OLAP execution and query processing. Our performancestudy shows the high promise of our methods.,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on,2008,105
Mining colossal frequent patterns by core pattern fusion,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip; Hong Cheng,Extensive research for frequent-pattern mining in the past decade has brought forth anumber of pattern mining algorithms that are both effective and efficient. However; theexisting frequent-pattern mining algorithms encounter challenges at mining rather largepatterns; called colossal frequent patterns; in the presence of an explosive number offrequent patterns. Colossal patterns are critical to many applications; especially in domainslike bioinformatics. In this study; we investigate a novel mining approach called pattern-fusion to efficiently find a good approximation to the colossal patterns. With Pattern-Fusion; acolossal pattern is discovered by fusing its small core patterns in one step; whereas theincremental pattern-growth mining strategies; such as those adopted in Apriori and FP-growth; have to examine a large number of mid-sized ones.

On recommending hashtags in twitter networks,Su Mon Kywe; Tuan-Anh Hoang; Ee-Peng Lim; Feida Zhu,Abstract Twitter network is currently overwhelmed by massive amount of tweets generatedby its users. To effectively organize and search tweets; users have to depend on appropriatehashtags inserted into tweets. We begin our research on hashtags by first analyzing aTwitter dataset generated by more than 150;000 Singapore users over a three-month period.Among several interesting findings about hashtag usage by this user community; we havefound a consistent and significant use of new hashtags on a daily basis. This suggests thatmost hashtags have very short life span. We further propose a novel hashtagrecommendation method based on collaborative filtering and the method recommendshashtags found in the previous month's data. Our method considers both user preferencesand tweet content in selecting hashtags to be recommended. Our experiments show that …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2012,95
gPrune: a constraint pushing framework for graph pattern mining,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,Abstract In graph mining applications; there has been an increasingly strong urge forimposing user-specified constraints on the mining results. However; unlike most traditionalitemset constraints; structural constraints; such as density and diameter of a graph; are veryhard to be pushed deep into the mining process. In this paper; we give the firstcomprehensive study on the pruning properties of both traditional and structural constraintsaiming to reduce not only the pattern search space but the data search space as well. A newgeneral framework; called gPrune; is proposed to incorporate all the constraints in such away that they recursively reinforce each other through the entire mining process. A newconcept; Pattern-inseparable Data-antimonotonicity; is proposed to handle the structuralconstraints unique in the context of graph; which; combined with known pruning …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2007,89
gapprox: Mining frequent approximate patterns from a massive network,Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han,Recently; there arise a large number of graphs with massive sizes and complex structures inmany new applications; such as biological networks; social networks; and the Web;demanding powerful data mining methods. Due to inherent noise or data diversity; it iscrucial to address the issue of approximation; if one wants to mine patterns that arepotentially interesting with tolerable variations. In this paper; we investigate the problem ofmining frequent approximate patterns from a massive network and propose a method calledgApprox. gApprox not only finds approximate network patterns; which is the key for manyknowledge discovery applications on structural data; but also enriches the library of graphmining methodologies by introducing several novel techniques such as:(1) a complete andredundancy-free strategy to explore the new pattern space faced by gApprox; and (2) …,Data Mining; 2007.

Topicsketch: Real-time bursty topic detection from twitter,Wei Xie; Feida Zhu; Jing Jiang; Ee-Peng Lim; Ke Wang,Twitter has become one of the largest microblogging platforms for users around the world toshare anything happening around them with friends and beyond. A bursty topic in Twitter isone that triggers a surge of relevant tweets within a short period of time; which often reflectsimportant events of mass interest. How to leverage Twitter for early detection of bursty topicshas therefore become an important research problem with immense practical value. Despitethe wealth of research work on topic modelling and analysis in Twitter; it remains achallenge to detect bursty topics in real-time. As existing methods can hardly scale to handlethe task with the tweet stream in real-time; we propose in this paper $\sf {TopicSketch} $; asketch-based topic model together with a set of techniques to achieve real-time detection.We evaluate our solution on a tweet stream with over 30 million tweets.

Link mining: Models; algorithms; and applications,S Yu Philip; Jiawei Han; Christos Faloutsos,With the recent flourishing research activities on Web search and mining; social networkanalysis; information network analysis; information retrieval; link analysis; and structural datamining; research on link mining has been rapidly growing; forming a new field of datamining. Traditional data mining focuses on “flat” or “isolated” data in which each data objectis represented as an independent attribute vector. However; many real-world data sets areinter-connected; much richer in structure; involving objects of heterogeneous types andcomplex links. Hence; the study of link mining will have a high impact on various importantapplications such as Web and text mining; social network analysis; collaborative filtering;and bioinformatics. As an emerging research field; there are currently no books focusing onthe theory and techniques as well as the related applications for link mining; especially …,*,2010,73
Graph OLAP: a multi-dimensional framework for graph data analysis,Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,Abstract Databases and data warehouse systems have been evolving from handlingnormalized spreadsheets stored in relational databases; to managing and analyzing diverseapplication-oriented data with complex interconnecting structures. Responding to thisemerging trend; graphs have been growing rapidly and showing their critical importance inmany applications; such as the analysis of XML; social networks; Web; biological data;multimedia data and spatiotemporal data. Can we extend useful functions of databases anddata warehouse systems to handle graph structured data? In particular; OLAP (On-LineAnalytical Processing) has been a popular tool for fast and user-friendly multi-dimensionalanalysis of data warehouses. Can we OLAP graphs?

Searching substructures with superimposed distance,Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Efficient indexing techniques have been developed for the exact and approximatesubstructure search in large scale graph databases. Unfortunately; the retrieval problem ofstructures with categorical or geometric distance constraints is not solved yet. In this paper;we develop a method called PIS (Partition-based Graph Index and Search) to supportsimilarity search on substructures with superimposed distance constraints. PIS selectsdiscriminative fragments in a query graph and uses an index to prune the graphs that violatethe distance constraints. We identify a criterion to distinguish the selectivity of fragments inmultiple graphs and develop a partition method to obtain a set of highly selective fragments;which is able to improve the pruning performance. Experimental results show that PIS iseffective in processing real graph queries.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,68
Feature-based similarity search in graph structures,Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Similarity search of complex structures is an important operation in graph-relatedapplications since exact matching is often too restrictive. In this article; we investigate theissues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. Bytransforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed featuremisses; our structural filtering algorithm can filter graphs without performing pairwisesimilarity computation. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features canresult in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature setselection strategy that could maximize the filtering capability. We prove that the complexity ofoptimal feature set selection is Ω (2 m) in the worst case; where m is the number of featuresfor selection. In practice; we identify several criteria to build effective feature sets for …,ACM Transactions on Database systems (TODS),2006,61
A survey of recommender systems in twitter,Su Mon Kywe; Ee-Peng Lim; Feida Zhu,Abstract Twitter is a social information network where short messages or tweets are sharedamong a large number of users through a very simple messaging mechanism. With apopulation of more than 100M users generating more than 300M tweets each day; Twitterusers can be easily overwhelmed by the massive amount of information available and thehuge number of people they can interact with. To overcome the above information overloadproblem; recommender systems can be introduced to help users make the appropriateselection. Researchers have began to study recommendation problems in Twitter but theirworks usually address individual recommendation tasks. There is so far no comprehensivesurvey for the realm of recommendation in Twitter to categorize the existing works as well asto identify areas that need to be further studied. The paper therefore aims to fill this gap by …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2012,57
Mining top-k large structural patterns in a massive network,Feida Zhu; Qiang Qu; David Lo; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,ABSTRACT With ever-growing popularity of social networks; web and bio-networks; mininglarge frequent patterns from a single huge network has become increasingly important. Yetthe existing pattern mining methods cannot offer the efficiency desirable for large patterndiscovery. We propose Spider-Mine; a novel algorithm to efficiently mine top-K largestfrequent patterns from a single massive network with any user-specified probability of 1− ϵ.Deviating from the existing edge-by-edge (ie; incremental) pattern-growth framework;SpiderMine achieves its efficiency by unleashing the power of small patterns of a boundeddiameter; which we call “spiders”. With the spider structure; our approach adopts aprobabilistic mining framework to find the top-k largest patterns by (i) identifying anaffordable set of promising growth paths toward large patterns;(ii) generating large …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,56
Efficient topological OLAP on information networks,Qiang Qu; Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip; Hongyan Li,Abstract We propose a framework for efficient OLAP on information networks with a focus onthe most interesting kind; the topological OLAP (called “T-OLAP”); which incurs topologicalchanges in the underlying networks. T-OLAP operations generate new networks from theoriginal ones by rolling up a subset of nodes chosen by certain constraint criteria. The keychallenge is to efficiently compute measures for the newly generated networks and handleuser queries with varied constraints. Two effective computational techniques; T-Distributiveness and T-Monotonicity are proposed to achieve efficient query processing andcube materialization. We also provide a T-OLAP query processing framework into whichthese techniques are weaved. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work to give aframework study for topological OLAP on information networks.

Efficient discovery of frequent approximate sequential patterns,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,We propose an efficient algorithm for mining frequent approximate sequential patterns underthe Hamming distance model. Our algorithm gains its efficiency by adopting a" break-down-and-build-up" methodology. The" breakdown" is based on the observation that alloccurrences of a frequent pattern can be classified into groups; which we call strands. Wedeveloped efficient algorithms to quickly mine out all strands by iterative growth. In the" build-up" stage; these strands are grouped up to form the support sets from which all approximatepatterns would be identified. A salient feature of our algorithm is its ability to grow thefrequent patterns by iteratively assembling building blocks of significant sizes in a localsearch fashion. By avoiding incremental growth and global search; we achieve greaterefficiency without losing the completeness of the mining result. Our experimental studies …,Data Mining; 2007. ICDM 2007.

Interestingness-driven diffusion process summarization in dynamic networks,Qiang Qu; Siyuan Liu; Christian S Jensen; Feida Zhu; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract The widespread use of social networks enables the rapid diffusion of information;eg; news; among users in very large communities. It is a substantial challenge to be able toobserve and understand such diffusion processes; which may be modeled as networks thatare both large and dynamic. A key tool in this regard is data summarization. However; fewexisting studies aim to summarize graphs/networks for dynamics. Dynamic networks raisenew challenges not found in static settings; including time sensitivity and the needs foronline interestingness evaluation and summary traceability; which render existingtechniques inapplicable.

It is not just what we say; but how we say them: Lda-based behavior-topic model,Minghui Qiu; Feida Zhu; Jing Jiang,Abstract Textual information exchanged among users on online social network platformsprovides deep understanding into users' interest and behavioral patterns. However; unliketraditional text-dominant settings such as offline publishing; one distinct feature for onlinesocial network is users' rich interactions with the textual content; which; unfortunately; hasnot yet been well incorporated in the existing topic modeling frameworks. In this paper; wepropose an LDA-based behavior-topic model (B-LDA) which jointly models user topicinterests and behavioral patterns. We focus the study of the model on online social networksettings such as microblogs like Twitter where the textual content is relatively short but userinteractions on them are rich.

Real time event detection in twitter,Xun Wang; Feida Zhu; Jing Jiang; Sujian Li,Abstract Event detection has been an important task for a long time. When it comes toTwitter; new problems are presented. Twitter data is a huge temporal data flow with muchnoise and various kinds of topics. Traditional sophisticated methods with a highcomputational complexity aren't designed to handle such data flow efficiently. In this paper;we propose a mixture Gaussian model for bursty word extraction in Twitter and then employa novel time-dependent HDP model for new topic detection. Our model can grasp newevents; the location and the time an event becomes bursty promptly and accurately.Experiments show the effectiveness of our model in real time event detection in Twitter.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2013,30
Collective churn prediction in social network,Richard J Oentaryo; Ee-Peng Lim; David Lo; Feida Zhu; Philips K Prasetyo,Abstract In service-based industries; churn poses a significant threat to the integrity of theuser communities and profitability of the service providers. As such; research on churnprediction methods has been actively pursued; involving either intrinsic; user profile factorsor extrinsic; social factors. However; existing approaches often address each type of factorsseparately; thus lacking a comprehensive view of churn behaviors. In this paper; we proposea new churn prediction approach based on collective classification (CC); which accounts forboth the intrinsic and extrinsic factors by utilizing the local features of; and dependenciesamong; individuals during prediction steps. We evaluate our CC approach using real dataprovided by an established mobile social networking site; with a primary focus on predictionof churn in chat activities.

Top-k aggregation queries over large networks,Xifeng Yan; Bin He; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han,Searching and mining large graphs today is critical to a variety of application domains;ranging from personalized recommendation in social networks; to searches for functionalassociations in biological pathways. In these domains; there is a need to performaggregation operations on large-scale networks. Unfortunately the existing implementationof aggregation operations on relational databases does not guarantee superior performancein network space; especially when it involves edge traversals and joins of gigantic tables. Inthis paper; we investigate the neighborhood aggregation queries: Find nodes that have top-k highest aggregate values over their h-hop neighbors. While these basic queries arecommon in a wide range of search and recommendation tasks; surprisingly they have notbeen studied systematically.

When a friend in twitter is a friend in life,Wei Xie; Cheng Li; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim; Xueqing Gong,Abstract Twitter is a fast-growing online social network service (SNS) where users can"follow" any other user to receive his or her mini-blogs which are called" tweets". In thispaper; we study the problem of identifying a user's off-line real-life social community; whichwe call the user's Twitter off-line community; purely from examining Twitter network structure.Based on observations from our user-verified Twitter data and results from previous works;we propose three principles about Twitter off-line communities. Incorporating theseprinciples; we develop a novel algorithm to iteratively discover the Twitter off-line communitybased on a new way of measuring user closeness. According to ground truth provided byreal Twitter users; our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with both highprecision and recall in most cases.,Proceedings of the 4th Annual ACM Web Science Conference,2012,27
Characterizing Silent Users in Social Media Communities.,Wei Gong; Ee-Peng Lim; Feida Zhu,Abstract Silent users often constitute a significant proportion of an online user-generatedcontent system. In the context of social media such as Twitter; users can opt to be silent all ormost of the time. They are often called the invisible participants or lurkers. As lurkerscontribute little to the online content; existing analysis often overlooks their presence andvoices. However; we argue that understanding lurkers is important in many applicationssuch as recommender systems; targeted advertising; and social sensing. This researchtherefore seeks to characterize lurkers in social media and propose methods to profile them.We examine 18 weeks of tweets generated by two Twitter communities consisting of morethan 110K and 114K users respectively. We find that there are many lurkers in the twocommunities; and the proportion of lurkers in each community changes with time. We also …,ICWSM,2015,23

Although theseplatforms bring new opportunities for users to seek help or provide solutions; they also posemany challenges with the ever growing size of the community. The sheer number ofquestions posted everyday motivates the problem of routing questions to the appropriateusers who can answer them. In this paper; we propose an approach to predict the bestanswerer for a new question on CQA site.

Detecting anomalies in bipartite graphs with mutual dependency principles,Hanbo Dai; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim; HweeHwa Pang,Bipartite graphs can model many real life applications including users-rating-products inonline marketplaces; users-clicking-webpages on the World Wide Web and users referring-users in social networks. In these graphs; the anomalousness of nodes in one partite oftendepends on that of their connected nodes in the other partite. Previous studies have shownthat this dependency can be positive (the anomalousness of a node in one partite increasesor decreases along with that of its connected nodes in the other partite) or negative (theanomalousness of a node in one partite rises or falls in opposite direction to that of itsconnected nodes in the other partite). In this paper; we unify both positive and negativemutual dependency relationships in an unsupervised framework for detecting anomalousnodes in bipartite graphs.

In essence; miningrequests with explicitly-specified constraints cannot be handled in a way that is direct andprecise.

Diversified social influence maximization,Fangshuang Tang; Qi Liu; Hengshu Zhu; Enhong Chen; Feida Zhu,For better viral marketing; there has been a lot of research on social influence maximization.However; the problem that who is influenced and how diverse the influenced population is;which is important in real-world marketing; has largely been neglected. To that end; in thispaper; we propose to consider the magnitude of influence and the diversity of the influencedcrowd simultaneously. Specifically; we formulate it as an optimization problem; ie; diversifiedsocial influence maximization. First; we present a general framework for this problem; underwhich we construct a class of diversity measures to quantify the diversity of the influencedcrowd. Meanwhile; we prove that a simple greedy algorithm guarantees to provide a near-optimal solution to the optimization problem. Furthermore; we relax the problem by focusingon the diversity of the nodes targeted for initial activation; and show how this relaxed form …,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on,2014,14
A probabilistic graphical model for topic and preference discovery on social media,Lu Liu; Feida Zhu; Lei Zhang; Shiqiang Yang,Abstract Many web applications today thrive on offering services for large-scale multimediadata; eg; Flickr for photos and YouTube for videos. However; these data; while rich incontent; are usually sparse in textual descriptive information. For example; a video clip isoften associated with only a few tags. Moreover; the textual descriptions are often overlyspecific to the video content. Such characteristics make it very challenging to discover topicsat a satisfactory granularity on this kind of data. In this paper; we propose a generativeprobabilistic model named Preference-Topic Model (PTM) to introduce the dimension ofuser preferences to enhance the insufficient textual information. PTM is a unified frameworkto combine the tasks of user preference discovery and document topic mining together.Through modeling user-document interactions; PTM cannot only discover topics and …,Neurocomputing,2012,14

User identity linkage by latent user space modelling,Xin Mu; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim; Jing Xiao; Jianzong Wang; Zhi-Hua Zhou,Abstract User identity linkage across social platforms is an important problem of greatresearch challenge and practical value. In real applications; the task often assumes an extradegree of difficulty by requiring linkage across multiple platforms. While pair-wise userlinkage between two platforms; which has been the focus of most existing solutions;provides reasonably convincing linkage; the result depends by nature on the order ofplatform pairs in execution with no theoretical guarantee on its stability. In this paper; weexplore a new concept of``Latent User Space''to more naturally model the relationshipbetween the underlying real users and their observed projections onto the varied socialplatforms; such that the more similar the real users; the closer their profiles in the latent userspace. We propose two effective algorithms; a batch model (ULink) and an online model …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2016,10
Exploring heterogeneous features for query-focused summarization of categorized community answers,Wei Wei; ZhaoYan Ming; Liqiang Nie; Guohui Li; Jianjun Li; Feida Zhu; Tianfeng Shang; Changyin Luo,Abstract Community-based question answering (cQA) is a popular type of online knowledge-sharing web service where users ask questions and obtain answers contributed by others.To enhance knowledge sharing; cQA also provides users with a retrieval function to accessthe historical question-answer pairs (QAs). However; it is still ineffective in that the retrievalresult is typically a ranking list of potentially relevant QAs; rather than a succinct andinformative answer. To alleviate the problem; this paper proposes a three-level scheme;which aims to generate a query-focused summary-style answer in terms of two factors; ie;novelty and redundancy. Specifically; we first retrieve a set of QAs to the given query; andthen develop a smoothed Naive Bayes model to identify the topics of answers; by exploitingtheir associated category information. Next; to compute the global ranking scores of …,Information Sciences,2016,8

Detecting extreme rank anomalous collections,Hanbo Dai; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim; Hwee Hwa Pang,Abstract Anomaly or outlier detection has a wide range of applications; including fraud andspam detection. Most existing studies focus on detecting point anomalies; ie; individual;isolated entities. However; there is an increasing number of applications in which anomaliesdo not occur individually; but in small collections. Unlike the majority; entities in ananomalous collection tend to share certain extreme behavioral traits. The knowledgeessential in understanding why and how the set of entities becomes outliers would only berevealed by examining at the collection level. A good example is web spammers adoptingcommon spamming techniques. To discover this kind of anomalous collections; weintroduce a novel definition of anomaly; called Extreme Rank Anomalous Collection. Wepropose a statistical model to quantify the anomalousness of such a collection; and …,*,2012,8
Mining diversity on networks,Lu Liu; Feida Zhu; Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip; Shiqiang Yang,Abstract Despite the recent emergence of many large-scale networks in different applicationdomains; an important measure that captures a participant's diversity in the network hasbeen largely neglected in previous studies. Namely; diversity characterizes how diverse agiven node connects with its peers. In this paper; we give a comprehensive study of thisconcept. We first lay out two criteria that capture the semantic meaning of diversity; and thenpropose a compliant definition which is simple enough to embed the idea. An efficient top-kdiversity ranking algorithm is developed for computation on dynamic networks. Experimentson both synthetic and real datasets give interesting results; where individual nodes identifiedwith high diversities are intuitive.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,8
Learning to find topic experts in Twitter via different relations,Wei Wei; Gao Cong; Chunyan Miao; Feida Zhu; Guohui Li,Expert finding has become a hot topic along with the flourishing of social networks; such asmicro-blogging services like Twitter. Finding experts in Twitter is an important problembecause tweets from experts are valuable sources that carry rich information (eg; trends) invarious domains. However; previous methods cannot be directly applied to Twitter expertfinding problem. Recently; several attempts use the relations among users and Twitter Listsfor expert finding. Nevertheless; these approaches only partially utilize such relations. Tothis end; we develop a probabilistic method to jointly exploit three types of relations (ie;follower relation; user-list relation; and list-list relation) for finding experts. Specifically; wepropose a Semi-Supervised Graph-based Ranking approach (SSGR) to offline calculate theglobal authority of users. In SSGR; we employ a normalized Laplacian regularization term …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,7
Reviving Dormant Ties in an Online Social Network Experiment.,Ee-Peng Lim; Denzil Correa; David Lo; Michael Finegold; Feida Zhu,Abstract Social network users connect and interact with one another to fulfil different kinds ofsocial and information needs. When interaction ceases between two users; we say that theirtie becomes dormant. While there are different underlying reasons of dormant ties; it isimportant to find means to revive such ties so as to maintain vibrancy in the relationships. Inthis work; we thus focus on designing an online experiment to evaluate the effectiveness ofpersonalized social messages to revive dormant ties. The experiment carefully selects userswith dormant ties so that no user gets mixed treatments and be affected by the responses ofother users undergoing treatment. Our results show that personalized message contentplays an important part in reviving dormant ties. Specifically; we find the message containingfriend's recent activity information is more effective than that containing inter-friend activity …,ICWSM,2013,7
High utility episode mining made practical and fast,Guangming Guo; Lei Zhang; Qi Liu; Enhong Chen; Feida Zhu; Chu Guan,Abstract This paper focuses on the problem of mining high utility episodes from complexevent sequences. Episode mining; one of the fundamental problems of sequential patternmining; has been continuously drawing attention over the past decade. Meanwhile; there isalso tremendous interest in the problem of high utility mining. Recently; the problem of highutility episode mining comes into view from the interface of these two research areas.Although prior work [11] has proposed algorithm UP-Span to tackle this problem; theirmethod suffers from several performance drawbacks. To that end; firstly; we explicitlyinterpret the high utility episode mining problem as a complete traversal of the lexicographicprefix tree. Secondly; under the framework of lexicographic prefix tree; we examine theoriginal UP-Span algorithm and present several improvements on it.

Mining coherent anomaly collections on web data,Hanbo Dai; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim; HweeHwa Pang,Abstract The recent boom of weblogs and social media has attached increasing importanceto the identification of suspicious users with unusual behavior; such as spammers orfraudulent reviewers. A typical spamming strategy is to employ multiple dummy accounts tocollectively promote a target; be it a URL or a product. Consequently; these suspiciousaccounts exhibit certain coherent anomalous behavior identifiable as a collection. In thispaper; we propose the concept of Coherent Anomaly Collection (CAC) to capture this kind ofcollections; and put forward an efficient algorithm to simultaneously find the top-K disjointCACs together with their anomalous behavior patterns. Compared with existing approaches;our new algorithm can find disjoint anomaly collections with coherent extreme behaviorwithout having to specify either their number or sizes.

Factored similarity models with social trust for top-N item recommendation,Guibing Guo; Jie Zhang; Feida Zhu; Xingwei Wang,Abstract Trust-aware recommender systems have attracted much attention recently due tothe prevalence of social networks. However; most existing trust-based approaches aredesigned for the recommendation task of rating prediction. Only few trust-aware methodshave attempted to recommend users an ordered list of interesting items; ie; itemrecommendation. In this article; we propose three factored similarity models with theincorporation of social trust for item recommendation based on implicit user feedback.Specifically; we introduce a matrix factorization technique to recover user preferencesbetween rated items and unrated ones in the light of both user-user and item-itemsimilarities. In addition; we claim that social trust relationships also have an important impacton a user's preference for a specific item.

Multilingual subjectivity detection using deep multiple kernel learning,Iti Chaturvedi; Erik Cambria; Feida Zhu; Lin Qiu; Wee Keong Ng,ABSTRACT Subjectivity detection can prevent a sentiment classifier from consideringirrelevant or potentially misleading text. Since; different attributes may correspond to differentopinions in the lexicon of different languages; we resort to multiple kernel learning (MKL) tosimultaneously optimize the different modalities. Previous approaches to MKL for sentenceclassifiers are computationally slow and lack any hierarchy when grouping features intodifferent kernels. In this paper; we consider deep recurrent convolution neural networks toreduce the dimensionality of the problem. Further; the lower layers in a deep model areabstract and the higher layers become more detailed connecting attributes to opinions.Hence; the features learned automatically in the multiple intermediate layers can be used totrain MKL classifiers depending on the application.

DelayFlow centrality for identifying critical nodes in transportation networks,Yew-Yih Cheng; Roy Ka-Wei Lee; Ee-Peng Lim; Feida Zhu,In an urban city; its transportation network supports efficient flow of people between differentparts of the city. Failures in the network can cause major disruptions to commuter andbusiness activities which can result in both significant economic and time losses. In thispaper; we investigate the use of centrality measures to determine critical nodes in atransportation network so as to improve the design of the network as well as to devise plansfor coping with network failures. Most centrality measures in social network analysisresearch unfortunately consider only topological structure of the network and are oblivious oftransportation factors.

CNL: collective network linkage across heterogeneous social platforms,Ming Gao; Ee-Peng Lim; David Lo; Feida Zhu; Philips Kokoh Prasetyo; Aoying Zhou,The popularity of social media has led many users to create accounts with different onlinesocial networks. Identifying these multiple accounts belonging to same user is of criticalimportance to user profiling; community detection; user behavior understanding and productrecommendation. Nevertheless; linking users across heterogeneous social networks ischallenging due to large network sizes; heterogeneous user attributes and behaviors indifferent networks; and noises in user generated data. In this paper; we propose anunsupervised method; Collective Network Linkage (CNL); to link users acrossheterogeneous social networks. CNL incorporates heterogeneous attributes and socialfeatures unique to social network users; handles missing data; and performs in a collectivemanner. CNL is highly accurate and efficient even without training data. We evaluate CNL …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,4

Despite the significant progress towards buildingsuch query interfaces to simplify visual subgraph query formulation task; construction ofcurrent generation visual interfaces is not data-driven. That is; it does not exploit theunderlying data graphs to automatically generate the contents of various panels in theinterface.

Online community transition detection,Biying Tan; Feida Zhu; Qiang Qu; Siyuan Liu,Abstract Mining user behavior patterns in social networks is of great importance in userbehavior analysis; targeted marketing; churn prediction and other applications. However;less effort has been made to study the evolution of user behavior in social communities. Inparticular; users join and leave communities over time. How to automatically detect theonline community transitions of individual users is a research problem of immense practicalvalue yet with great technical challenges. In this paper; we propose an algorithm based onthe Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to trace the evolution of communitytransition of individual users; adaptive to the noisy behavior.

An integrated model for user attribute discovery: A case study on political affiliation identification,Swapna Gottipati; Minghui Qiu; Liu Yang; Feida Zhu; Jing Jiang,Abstract Discovering user demographic attributes from social media is a problem ofconsiderable interest. The problem setting can be generalized to include three components—users; topics and behaviors. In recent studies on this problem; however; the behaviorbetween users and topics are not effectively incorporated. In our work; we proposed anintegrated unsupervised model which takes into consideration all the three componentsintegral to the task. Furthermore; our model incorporates collaborative filtering withprobabilistic matrix factorization to solve the data sparsity problem; a computationalchallenge common to all such tasks. We evaluated our method on a case study of userpolitical affiliation identification; and compared against state-of-the-art baselines.

Who am i on twitter?: A cross-country comparison,Wei Dong; Minghui Qiu; Feida Zhu,Abstract Users often manage which aspects of their personal identities to be manifested onsocial network sites (SNS). Thus; the content of personal information disclosed on users'profiles can be influenced by a number of factors; such as motivation of using SNS andprivacy concerns; both of which may vary depending on where users reside in. In this study;we compared the content of 2800 United States (US) and Singapore (SG) Twitter users' bioson their profile pages. We found US Twitter users were far more likely to disclose personalinformation that may reveal their true identity than SG users. The between country differenceremained after we took bio length and user activity level into account.

Information vs interaction: An alternative user ranking model for social networks,Wei Xie; Ai Phuong Hoang; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract The recent years have seen an unprecedented boom of social network services;such as Twitter; which boasts over 200 million users. In such big social platforms; theinfluential users are ideal targets for viral marketing to potentially reach an audience ofmaximal size. Most proposed algorithms use the linkage structure of the underlying networkto measure the information flow and hence evaluate a users' influence. Yet that is not the fullstory for social networks. In this paper; we propose to examine users' influence from a socialinteraction perspective. We built a ranking model based on the dynamic user interactionstaking place on top of these underlying linkage structures. In particular; in the Twitter settingwe supposed a principle of balanced retweet reciprocity; and then formulated it to re-evaluate the value of Twitter users.

In-game action list segmentation and labeling in real-time strategy games,Wei Gong; Ee-Peng Lim; Palakorn Achananuparp; Feida Zhu; David Lo; Freddy Chong Tat Chua,In-game actions of real-time strategy (RTS) games are extremely useful in determining theplayers' strategies; analyzing their behaviors and recommending ways to improve their playskills. Unfortunately; unstructured sequences of in-game actions are hardly informativeenough for these analyses. The inconsistency we observed in human annotation of in-gamedata makes the analytical task even more challenging. In this paper; we propose anintegrated system for in-game action segmentation and semantic label assignment based ona Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model with essential features extracted from the in-game actions. Our experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of our solution can be as highas 98.9%.,Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG); 2012 IEEE Conference on,2012,4
Mining frequent approximate sequential patterns,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Frequent sequential pattern mining remains one of the most important data-mining taskssince its introduction in Ref.[1]. With the ubiquity of sequential data; it has found broadapplications in customer analysis; query log analysis; financial stream data analysis; andpattern discovery in genomic DNA sequences in bioinformatics. Extensive research on thetopic has brought about general sequential pattern mining algorithms like Refs.[2–7] andconstraint-based ones like Refs.[8; 9]. Periodic pattern mining in temporal data sequenceshas also been studied [10; 11]. However; all these mining algorithms follow the exactmatching sequential pattern definition.

Discovering burst patterns of burst topic in twitter,Guozhong Dong; Wu Yang; Feida Zhu; Wei Wang,Abstract Twitter has become one of largest social networks for users to broadcast bursttopics. There have been many studies on how to detect burst topics. However; mining burstpatterns in burst topics has not been solved by the existing works. In this paper; weinvestigate the problem of mining burst patterns of burst topic in Twitter. A burst topic usergraph model is proposed; which can represent the topology structure of burst topicpropagation across a large number of Twitter users. Based on the model; hierarchicalclustering is applied to cluster burst topics and reveal burst patterns from the macroperspective. Frequent sub-graph mining is used to discover the information flow patterns ofburst topic from the micro perspective.

However; the methodologies and approaches adopted by the existingsolutions; most of which involve massive distance calculation; have so far fallen short ofsuccessfully addressing a real-time requested task.

Efficient online summarization of large-scale dynamic networks,Qiang Qu; Siyuan Liu; Feida Zhu; Christian S Jensen,Information diffusion in social networks is often characterized by huge participatingcommunities and viral cascades of high dynamicity. To observe; summarize; and understandthe evolution of dynamic diffusion processes in an informative and insightful way is achallenge of high practical value. However; few existing studies aim to summarize networksfor interesting dynamic patterns.

A Bayesian recommender model for user rating and review profiling,Mingming Jiang; Dandan Song; Lejian Liao; Feida Zhu,Intuitively; not only do ratings include abundant information for learning user preferences;but also reviews accompanied by ratings. However; most existing recommender systemstake rating scores for granted and discard the wealth of information in accompanyingreviews. In this paper; in order to exploit user profiles' information embedded in both ratingsand reviews exhaustively; we propose a Bayesian model that links a traditionalCollaborative Filtering (CF) technique with a topic model seamlessly. By employing a topicmodel with the review text and aligning user review topics with “user attitudes”(ie; abstractrating patterns) over the same distribution; our method achieves greater accuracy than thetraditional approach on the rating prediction task. Moreover; with review text informationinvolved; latent user rating attitudes are interpretable and “cold-start” problem can be …,Tsinghua Science and Technology,2015,3
Information source detection via maximum a posteriori estimation,Biao Chang; Feida Zhu; Enhong Chen; Qi Liu,The problem of information source detection; whose goal is to identify the source of a pieceof information from a diffusion process (eg; computer virus; rumor; epidemic; and so on); hasattracted ever-increasing attention from research community in recent years.

Crowdlink: An error-tolerant model for linking complex records,Chen Zhang; Rui Meng; Lei Chen; Feida Zhu,Abstract Record linkage (RL) refers to the task of finding records in a data set that refer to thesame entity across different data sources (eg; data files; books; websites; databases); whichis a long-standing challenge in database management. Algorithmic approaches have beenproposed to improve RL quality; but remain far from perfect. Crowdsourcing offers a moreaccurate but expensive (and slow) way to bring human insight into the process. In this paper;we propose a new probabilistic model; namely CrowdLink; to tackle the above limitations. Inparticular; our model gracefully handles the crowd error and the correlation among differentpairs; as well as enables us to decompose the records into small pieces (ie attributes) sothat crowdsourcing workers can easily verify.

Among different kinds of user profilingapproaches; one line of work has taken advantage of the high level of label similarity that isoften observed among users in one's friendship network. In this work; we identify one criticalpoint that has been so far neglected—different users in one's friendship network playdifferent roles in user profiling. In particular; we categorize all users in one's friendshipnetwork into (I) close friends whom the user knows in real life and (II) online friends withwhom the user forms connection through online interaction.

Detecting anomaly collections using extreme feature ranks,Hanbo Dai; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim; HweeHwa Pang,Abstract Detecting anomaly collections is an important task with many applications;including spam and fraud detection. In an anomaly collection; entities often operate incollusion and hold different agendas to normal entities. As a result; they usually manifestcollective extreme traits; ie; members of an anomaly collection are consistently clusteredtoward the top or bottom ranks on certain features. We therefore propose to detect theseanomaly collections by extreme feature ranks. We introduce a novel anomaly definitioncalled Extreme Rank Anomalous Collection or ERAC. We propose a new measure ofanomalousness capturing collective extreme traits based on a statistical model. As there canbe a large number of ERACs of various sizes; for simplicity; we first investigate the ERACdetection problem of finding top-K K ERACs of a predefined size limit.

Dynamic label propagation in social networks,Juan Du; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract Label propagation has been studied for many years; starting from a set of nodeswith labels and then propagating to those without labels. In social networks; buildingcomplete user profiles like interests and affiliations contributes to the systems like linkprediction; personalized feeding; etc. Since the labels for each user are mostly not filled; weoften employ some people to label these users. And therefore; the cost of human labeling ishigh if the data set is large. To reduce the expense; we need to select the optimal data set forlabeling; which produces the best propagation result. In this paper; we proposed twoalgorithms for the selection of the optimal data set for labeling; which is the greedy andgreedyMax algorithms according to different user input. We select the data set according totwo scenarios; which are 1) finding top-K nodes for labeling and then propagating as …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,2
Time-aware conversion prediction,Wendi Ji; Xiaoling Wang; Feida Zhu,Abstract The importance of product recommendation has been well recognized as a centraltask in business intelligence for e-commerce websites. Interestingly; what has been lessaware of is the fact that different products take different time periods for conversion. The“conversion” here refers to actually a more general set of pre-defined actions; including forexample purchases or registrations in recommendation and advertising systems. Themismatch between the product's actual conversion period and the application's targetconversion period has been the subtle culprit compromising many existing recommendationalgorithms. The challenging question: what products should be recommended for a giventime period to maximize conversion—is what has motivated us in this paper to propose arank-based time-aware conversion prediction model (rTCP); which considers both …,Frontiers of Computer Science,2017,1
Mining social ties beyond homophily,Hongwei Liang; Ke Wang; Feida Zhu,Summarizing patterns of connections or social ties in a social network; in terms of attributesinformation on nodes and edges; holds a key to the understanding of how the actors interactand form relationships. We formalize this problem as mining top-k group relationships (GRs);which captures strong social ties between groups of actors.

Personal credit profiling via latent user behavior dimensions on social media,Guangming Guo; Feida Zhu; Enhong Chen; Le Wu; Qi Liu; Yingling Liu; Minghui Qiu,Abstract Consumer credit scoring and credit risk management have been the core researchproblem in financial industry for decades. In this paper; we target at inferring this particularuser attribute called credit; ie; whether a user is of the good credit class or not; from onlinesocial data. However; existing credit scoring methods; mainly relying on financial data; facesevere challenges when tackling the heterogeneous social data. Moreover; social data onlycontains extremely weak signals about users' credit label. To that end; we put forward aLatent User Behavior Dimension based Credit Model (LUBD-CM) to capture these smallsignals for personal credit profiling. LUBD-CM learns users' hidden behavior habits andtopic distributions simultaneously; and represents each user at a much finer granularity.Specifically; we take a real-world Sina Weibo dataset as the testbed for personal credit …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2016,1
When Peculiarity Makes a Difference: Object Characterisation in Heterogeneous Information Networks,Wei Chen; Feida Zhu; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract A central task in heterogeneous information networks (HIN) is how to characterisean entity; which underlies a wide range of applications such as similarity search; entityprofiling and linkage. Most existing work focus on using the main features common to all.While this approach makes sense in settings where commonality is of primary interest; thereare many scenarios as important where uncommon and discriminative features are moreuseful. To address the problem; a novel model COHIN (Characterize Objects inHeterogeneous Information Networks) is proposed; where each object is characterized as aset of feature paths that contain both main and discriminative features. In addition; wedevelop an effective pruning strategy to achieve greater query performance. Extensiveexperiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve high …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2016,1
A Comparison of Fundamental Network Formation Principles Between Offline and Online Friends on Twitter,Felicia Natali; Feida Zhu,Abstract We investigate the differences between how some of the fundamental principles ofnetwork formation apply among offline friends and how they apply among online friends onTwitter. We consider three fundamental principles of network formation proposed bySchaefer et al.: reciprocity; popularity; and triadic closure. Overall; we discover that theseprinciples mainly apply to offline friends on Twitter. Based on how these principles apply tooffline versus online friends; we formulate rules to predict offline friendship on Twitter. Wecompare our algorithm with popular machine learning algorithms and Xiewei's random walkalgorithm. Our algorithm beats the machine learning algorithms on average by 15% in termsof f-score. Although our algorithm loses 6% to Xiewei's random walk algorithm in terms of f-score; it still performs well (f-score above 70%); and it reduces prediction time complexity …,International Conference and School on Network Science,2016,1
Posting Topics $ $\ne $ $≠ Reading Topics: On Discovering Posting and Reading Topics in Social Media,Wei Gong; Ee-Peng Lim; Feida Zhu,Abstract Social media users make decisions about what content to post and read. As postedcontent is often visible to others; users are likely to impose self-censorship when decidingwhat content to post. On the other hand; such a concern may not apply to reading socialmedia content. As a result; the topics of content that a user posted and read can be differentand this has major implications to the applications that require personalization. To betterdetermine and profile social media users' topic interests; we conduct a user survey in Twitter.In this survey; participants chose the topics they like to post (posting topics) and the topicsthey like to read (reading topics). We observe that users' posting topics differ from theirreading topics significantly. We find that some topics such as “Religion”;“Business” and“Politics” attract much more users to read than to post.

On Unravelling Opinions of Issue Specific-Silent Users in Social Media,Wei Gong; Ee-Peng Lim; Feida Zhu; Pei Hua XU CHER,Abstract Social media has become a popular platform for people to share opinions. Amongthe social media mining research projects that study user opinions and issues; most focuson analyzing posted and shared content. They could run into the danger of non-representative findings as the opinions of users who do not post content are overlooked;which often happens in today's marketing; recommendation; and social sensing research.For a more complete and representative profiling of user opinions on various topical issues;we need to investigate the opinions of the users even when they stay silent on these issues.We call these users the issue specific-silent users (i-silent users). To study them and theiropinions; we conduct an opinion survey on a set of users for two popular social mediaplatforms; Twitter and Facebook.

On finding the point where there is no return: Turning point mining on game data,Wei Gong; Ee-Peng Lim; Feida Zhu; Palakorn Achananuparp; David Lo,Abstract Gaming expertise is usually accumulated through playing or watching many gameinstances; and identifying critical moments in these game instances called turning points.Turning point rules (shorten as TPRs) are game patterns that almost always lead to someirreversible outcomes. In this paper; we formulate the notion of irreversible outcome propertywhich can be combined with pattern mining so as to automatically extract TPRs from anygiven game datasets. We specifically extend the well-known PrefixSpan sequence miningalgorithm by incorporating the irreversible outcome property. To show the usefulness ofTPRs; we apply them to Tetris; a popular game. We mine TPRs from Tetris games andgenerate challenging game sequences so as to help training an intelligent Tetris algorithm.Our experiment results show that 1) TPRs can be found from historical game data …,*,2014,1

Twicube: A real-time twitter off-line community analysis tool,Juan Du; Wei Xie; Cheng Li; Feida Zhu; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract As a micro-blogging service; Twitter differs from other social network services in twoways: 1) the absence of mutual consent in establishing follow links and 2) being a mixture ofnews media and social network. A key question to ask in better understanding Twitter userbehavior is which part of a user's Twitter network reflects one's real-life social network.TwiCube is an online tool that employs a novel algorithm capable of identifying a user's real-life social community; which we call the user's off-line community; purely from examining thelink structure among the user's followers and followees. Based on the identified off-linecommunity; TwiCube provides a summary of the user's interests; tweeting habits andneighborhood popularity analysis. Evaluations from real Twitter users demonstrate that ouroff-line community detection approach achieves high precision and recall in most cases.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,1

Follow Link Seeking Strategy: A Pattern Based Approach,Agus Trisnajaya Kwee; Ee-Peng Lim; Palakorn Achananuparp; Feida Zhu,ABSTRACT The way Twitter and other microblogging networks work is to have users createfollow links among one another; and create short messages to their followers. Most of thetime; the creation of follow links to other users does not require approval from the latter.Therefore; it is very easy for a user to create such links. On the other hand; the same cannotbe said for seeking incoming follow links which is useful in some application scenarios. Inthis paper; we therefore study the Follow Link Seeking Problem that aims to find thestrategies for a source user to maximize the likelihood of receiving a follow link from a targetuser. We formulate this problem as a recommendation task and generate a set of strategiesfrom well known follow link patterns. Using the confidence scores of follow link patterns; wederive the success probability of each strategy.

PCCF: Periodic and Continual Temporal Co-Factorization for Recommender Systems,Guibing Guo; Feida Zhu; Shilin Qu; Xingwei Wang,Abstract Rating-only collaborative filtering has been extensively studied for decades withgreat improvements achieved in predicting a user's preference on a target item at aparticular time point. Yet; it remains a research challenge on how to capture users' ratingpatterns which may drift over time. In this article; we propose a time-aware matrix co-factorization model; called PCCF; which considers two types of temporal effects; ie; periodicand continual. Specifically; periodic effects refer to the impact of discrete periodic time sliceswith which users' preferences may be associated; and continual effects refer to the impact ofcontinuous gradual time over which users' preference patterns may change. The fact thatusers exhibit different preference patterns with respect to different time aspect has beenfurther confirmed by our analysis on three real-world data sets.

Modelling cascades over time in microblogs,Wei Xie; Feida Zhu; Siyuan Liu; Ke Wang,One of the most important features of microblogging services such as Twitter is how easy it isto re-share a piece of information across the network through various user connections;forming what we call a" cascade". Business applications such as viral marketing have drivena tremendous amount of research effort predicting whether a certain cascade will go viral.Yet the rarity of viral cascades in real data poses a challenge to all existing predictionmethods. One solution is to simulate cascades that well fit the real viral ones; which requiresour ability to tell how a certain cascade grows over time. In this paper; we build a generaltime-aware cascade model for each particular cascade; in which the chance of one user's re-sharing behaviour over time is modelled as a hazard function of time. Based on two keyobservations on user retweeting behaviour; we design an appropriate hazard function …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,*

Detecting Anomalous Twitter Users by Extreme Group Behaviors,Hanbo Dai; Ee-Peng Lim; Feida Zhu; Hwee Hwa PANG,Abstract Twitter has enjoyed tremendous popularity in the recent years. To help categorizingand search tweets; Twitter users assign hashtags to their tweets. Given that hashtagassignment is the primary way to semantically categorizing and search tweets; it is highlysusceptible to abuse by spammers and other anomalous users [1]. Popular hashtags suchas# Obama and# ladygaga could be hijacked by having them added to unrelated tweetswith the intent of misleading many other users or promoting specific agenda to the users.The users performing this act are known as the hashtag hijackers. As the hijackers usuallyabuse common sets of hashtags; they demonstrate common extreme group behaviors whichcan be used for detection.,*,2012,*

Thetraditional exact model for frequent pattern requires that every item occurs in eachsupporting transaction. However; real application data is usually subject to random noise ormeasurement error; which poses new challenges for the efficient discovery of frequentpattern from the noisy data. Mining approximate frequent pattern in the presence of noiseinvolves two key issues: the definition of a noise-tolerant mining model and the design of anefficient mining algorithm.
