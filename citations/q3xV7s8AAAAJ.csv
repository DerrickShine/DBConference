HERMES: aggregative LBS via a trajectory DB engine,Nikos Pelekis; Elias Frentzos; Nikos Giatrakos; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract We present HERMES; a prototype system based on a powerful query language fortrajectory databases; which enables the support of aggregative Location-Based Services(LBS). The key observation that motivates HERMES is that the more the knowledge in handabout the trajectory of a mobile user; the better the exploitation of the advances in spatio-temporal query processing for providing intelligent LBS. HERMES is fully incorporated into astate-of-the-art Object-Relational DBMS; and its demonstration illustrates its flexibility andusefulness for delivering custom-defined LBS.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,83
Prediction-based geometric monitoring over distributed data streams,Nikos Giatrakos; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis; Izchak Sharfman; Assaf Schuster,Abstract Many modern streaming applications; such as online analysis of financial; network;sensor and other forms of data are inherently distributed in nature. An important query typethat is the focal point in such application scenarios regards actuation queries; where properaction is dictated based on a trigger condition placed upon the current value that amonitored function receives. Recent work studies the problem of (non-linear) sophisticatedfunction tracking in a distributed manner. The main concept behind the geometric monitoringapproach proposed there; is for each distributed site to perform the function monitoring overan appropriate subset of the input domain. In the current work; we examine whether thedistributed monitoring mechanism can become more efficient; in terms of the number ofcommunicated messages; by extending the geometric monitoring framework to utilize …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,56

As it usuallyhappens in the data management world; the challenge after storing the data is theimplementation of appropriate analytics for extracting useful knowledge. However;traditional data warehousing systems and techniques were not designed for analyzingtrajectory data.

SeTraStream: semantic-aware trajectory construction over streaming movement data,Zhixian Yan; Nikos Giatrakos; Vangelis Katsikaros; Nikos Pelekis; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract Location data generated from GPS equipped moving objects are typically collectedas streams of spatiotemporal< x; y; t> points that when put together form correspondingtrajectories. Most existing studies focus on building ad-hoc querying; analysis; as well asdata mining techniques on formed trajectories. As a prior step; trajectory construction isevidently necessary for mobility data processing and understanding; including tasks liketrajectory data cleaning; compression; and segmentation so as to identify semantic trajectoryepisodes like stops (eg while sitting and standing) and moves (while jogging; walking;driving etc). However; semantic trajectory construction methods in the current literature aretypically based on offline procedures; which is not sufficient for real life trajectoryapplications that rely on timely delivery of computed trajectories to serve real-time query …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,30

TACO: tunable approximate computation of outliers in wireless sensor networks,Nikos Giatrakos; Yannis Kotidis; Antonios Deligiannakis; Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract Wireless sensor networks are becoming increasingly popular for a variety ofapplications. Users are frequently faced with the surprising discovery that readingsproduced by the sensing elements of their motes are often contaminated with outliers.Outlier readings can severely affect applications that rely on timely and reliable sensory datain order to provide the desired functionality. As a consequence; there is a recent trend toexplore how techniques that identify outlier values can be applied to sensory data cleaning.Unfortunately; most of these approaches incur an overwhelming communication overhead;which limits their practicality. In this paper we introduce an in-network outlier detectionframework; based on locality sensitive hashing; extended with a novel boosting process aswell as efficient load balancing and comparison pruning mechanisms.

Issues in complex event processing: Status and prospects in the Big Data era,Ioannis Flouris; Nikos Giatrakos; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis; Michael Kamp; Michael Mock,Abstract Many Big Data technologies were built to enable the processing of humangenerated data; setting aside the enormous amount of data generated from Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interactions and Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. Such interactions createreal-time data streams that are much more structured; often in the form of series of eventoccurrences.

PAO: power-efficient attribution of outliers in wireless sensor networks,Nikos Giatrakos; Yannis Kotidis; Antonios Deligiannakis,Abstract Sensor nodes constitute inexpensive; disposable devices that are often scattered inharsh environments of interest so as to collect and communicate desired measurements ofmonitored quantities. Due to the commodity hardware used in the construction of sensornodes; the readings of sensors are frequently tainted with outliers. Given the presence ofoutliers; decision making in sensor networks becomes much harder. In this work; weintroduce PAO; a framework that can reliably and efficiently detect outliers in wireless sensornetworks. PAO significantly reduces the bandwidth consumption during the outlier detectionprocedure; while being able to operate over multiple window types. Moreover; ourframework possesses the ability to operate in either an exact mode; or an approximate onethat further reduces the communication cost; thus covering a wide variety of application …,Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Data Management for Sensor Networks,2010,7

Scalable Approximate Query Tracking over Highly Distributed Data Streams,Nikos Giatrakos; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract The recently-proposed Geometric Monitoring (GM) method has provided a generaltool for the distributed monitoring of arbitrary non-linear queries over streaming dataobserved by a collection of remote sites; with numerous practical applications. Unfortunately;GM-based techniques can suffer from serious scalability issues with increasing numbers ofremote sites. In this paper; we propose novel techniques that effectively tackle theaforementioned scalability problems by exploiting a carefully designed sample of the remotesites for efficient approximate query tracking. Our novel sampling-based scheme utilizes asample of cardinality proportional to√ N (compared to N for the original GM); where $ N $ isthe number of sites in the network; to perform the monitoring process. Our experimentalevaluation over a variety of real-life data streams demonstrates that our sampling-based …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,3

Complex Event Recognition in the Big Data Era,Nikos Giatrakos; Alexander Artikis; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract The concept of event processing is established as a generic computationalparadigm in various application fields; ranging from data processing in Web environments;over maritime and transport; to finance and medicine. Events report on state changes of asystem and its environment. Complex Event Recognition (CER) in turn; refers to theidentification of complex/composite events of interest; which are collections of simple eventsthat satisfy some pattern; thereby providing the opportunity for reactive and proactivemeasures. Examples include the recognition of attacks in computer network nodes; humanactivities on video content; emerging stories and trends on the Social Web; traffic andtransport incidents in smart cities; fraud in electronic marketplaces; cardiac arrhythmias; andepidemic spread. In each scenario; CER allows to make sense of Big event Data streams …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1

Although recent technologicaladvancements have led to much more reliable and safer Medical Devices (MDs); potentialrisks of failure and the associated adverse incidents cannot be ignored. To create a saferenvironment for the patient in terms of technology; it is necessary to provide rapid andaccurate information on adverse events; in order to avoid their repetition. The traditionalapproach of MD Vigilance based only on official user reports of adverse incidents has beenproven inadequate today. A modern approach; also used in this work; to the problem isbased on the introduction of additional means; such as data mining; extraction;standardization and codification of the information; from different direct and indirect …,*,2015,1
