Chord: a scalable peer-to-peer lookup protocol for internet applications,Ion Stoica; Robert Morris; David Liben-Nowell; David R Karger; M Frans Kaashoek; Frank Dabek; Hari Balakrishnan,Abstract A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is the efficientlocation of the node that stores a desired data item. This paper presents Chord; a distributedlookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation:given a key; it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top ofChord by associating a key with each data item; and storing the key/data pair at the node towhich the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system; and cananswer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoreticalanalysis and simulations show that Chord is scalable: Communication cost and the statemaintained by each node scale logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2003,16851

Spark: Cluster computing with working sets.,Matei Zaharia; Mosharaf Chowdhury; Michael J Franklin; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract MapReduce and its variants have been highly successful in implementing large-scale data-intensive applications on commodity clusters. However; most of these systemsare built around an acyclic data flow model that is not suitable for other popular applications.This paper focuses on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of dataacross multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learningalgorithms; as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new framework calledSpark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance ofMapReduce. To achieve these goals; Spark introduces an abstraction called resilientdistributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across aset of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by …,HotCloud,2010,3064
Resilient distributed datasets: A fault-tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing,Matei Zaharia; Mosharaf Chowdhury; Tathagata Das; Ankur Dave; Justin Ma; Murphy McCauley; Michael J Franklin; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract We present Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs); a distributed memory abstractionthat lets programmers perform in-memory computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerantmanner. RDDs are motivated by two types of applications that current computing frameworkshandle inefficiently: iterative algorithms and interactive data mining tools. In both cases;keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of magnitude. To achievefault tolerance efficiently; RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory; based oncoarse-grained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However;we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations;including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs; such as Pregel; and newapplications that these models do not capture. We have implemented RDDs in a system …,Proceedings of the 9th USENIX conference on Networked Systems Design and Implementation,2012,2692
Wide-area cooperative storage with CFS,Frank Dabek; M Frans Kaashoek; David Karger; Robert Morris; Ion Stoica,Abstract The Cooperative File System (CFS) is a new peer-to-peer read-only storage systemthat provides provable guarantees for the efficiency; robustness; and load-balance of filestorage and retrieval. CFS does this with a completely decentralized architecture that canscale to large systems. CFS servers provide a distributed hash table (DHash) for blockstorage. CFS clients interpret DHash blocks as a file system. DHash distributes and cachesblocks at a fine granularity to achieve load balance; uses replication for robustness; anddecreases latency with server selection. DHash finds blocks using the Chord locationprotocol; which operates in time logarithmic in the number of servers. CFS is implementedusing the SFS file system toolkit and runs on Linux; OpenBSD; and FreeBSD. Experience ona globally deployed prototype shows that CFS delivers data to clients as fast as FTP …,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,2001,2247
A data-oriented (and beyond) network architecture,Teemu Koponen; Mohit Chawla; Byung-Gon Chun; Andrey Ermolinskiy; Kye Hyun Kim; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract The Internet has evolved greatly from its original incarnation. For instance; the vastmajority of current Internet usage is data retrieval and service access; whereas thearchitecture was designed around host-to-host applications such as telnet and ftp. Moreover;the original Internet was a purely transparent carrier of packets; but now the various networkstakeholders use middleboxes to improve security and accelerate applications. To adapt tothese changes; we propose the Data-Oriented Network Architecture (DONA); which involvesa clean-slate redesign of Internet naming and name resolution.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2007,1672
Improving MapReduce performance in heterogeneous environments.,Matei Zaharia; Andy Konwinski; Anthony D Joseph; Randy H Katz; Ion Stoica,Abstract MapReduce is emerging as an important programming model for large-scale data-parallel applications such as web indexing; data mining; and scientific simulation. Hadoop isan open-source implementation of MapReduce enjoying wide adoption and is often used forshort jobs where low response time is critical. Hadoop's performance is closely tied to itstask scheduler; which implicitly assumes that cluster nodes are homogeneous and tasksmake progress linearly; and uses these assumptions to decide when to speculatively re-execute tasks that appear to be stragglers. In practice; the homogeneity assumptions do notalways hold. An especially compelling setting where this occurs is a virtualized data center;such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). We show that Hadoop's scheduler cancause severe performance degradation in heterogeneous environments. We design a …,Osdi,2008,1651
Delay scheduling: a simple technique for achieving locality and fairness in cluster scheduling,Matei Zaharia; Dhruba Borthakur; Joydeep Sen Sarma; Khaled Elmeleegy; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract As organizations start to use data-intensive cluster computing systems like Hadoopand Dryad for more applications; there is a growing need to share clusters between users.However; there is a conflict between fairness in scheduling and data locality (placing taskson nodes that contain their input data). We illustrate this problem through our experiencedesigning a fair scheduler for a 600-node Hadoop cluster at Facebook. To address theconflict between locality and fairness; we propose a simple algorithm called delayscheduling: when the job that should be scheduled next according to fairness cannot launcha local task; it waits for a small amount of time; letting other jobs launch tasks instead. Wefind that delay scheduling achieves nearly optimal data locality in a variety of workloads andcan increase throughput by up to 2x while preserving fairness. In addition; the simplicity of …,Proceedings of the 5th European conference on Computer systems,2010,1230
Core-stateless fair queueing: Achieving approximately fair bandwidth allocations in high speed networks,Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker; Hui Zhang,Abstract Router mechanisms designed to achieve fair bandwidth allocations; like FairQueueing; have many desirable properties for congestion control in the Internet. However;such mechanisms usually need to maintain state; manage buffers; and/or perform packetscheduling on a per flow basis; and this complexity may prevent them from being cost-effectively implemented and widely deployed. In this paper; we propose an architecture thatsignificantly reduces this implementation complexity yet still achieves approximately fairbandwidth allocations. We apply this approach to an island of routers---that is; a contiguousregion of the network---and we distinguish between edge routers and core routers. Edgerouters maintain per flow state; they estimate the incoming rate of each flow and insert alabel into each packet header based on this estimate. Core routers maintain no per flow …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,1998,1138
Internet indirection infrastructure,Ion Stoica; Daniel Adkins; Shelley Zhuang; Scott Shenker; Sonesh Surana,Abstract Attempts to generalize the Internet's point-to-point communication abstraction toprovide services like multicast; anycast; and mobility have faced challenging technicalproblems and deployment barriers. To ease the deployment of such services; this paperproposes an overlay-based Internet Indirection Infrastructure (I3) that offers a rendezvous-based communication abstraction. Instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination;each packet is associated with an identifier; this identifier is then used by the receiver toobtain delivery of the packet. This level of indirection decouples the act of sending from theact of receiving; and allows I3 to efficiently support a wide variety of fundamentalcommunication services. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach; we have designedand built a prototype based on the Chord lookup protocol.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2002,1107
Mesos: A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center.,Benjamin Hindman; Andy Konwinski; Matei Zaharia; Ali Ghodsi; Anthony D Joseph; Randy H Katz; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract We present Mesos; a platform for sharing commodity clusters between multiplediverse cluster computing frameworks; such as Hadoop and MPI. Sharing improves clusterutilization and avoids per-framework data replication. Mesos shares resources in a fine-grained manner; allowing frameworks to achieve data locality by taking turns reading datastored on each machine. To support the sophisticated schedulers of today's frameworks;Mesos introduces a distributed two-level scheduling mechanism called resource offers.Mesos decides how many resources to offer each framework; while frameworks decidewhich resources to accept and which computations to run on them. Our results show thatMesos can achieve near-optimal data locality when sharing the cluster among diverseframeworks; can scale to 50;000 (emulated) nodes; and is resilient to failures.,NSDI,2011,1072
Geographic routing without location information,Ananth Rao; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Christos Papadimitriou; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract For many years; scalable routing for wireless communication systems was acompelling but elusive goal. Recently; several routing algorithms that exploit geographicinformation (eg GPSR) have been proposed to achieve this goal. These algorithms refer tonodes by their location; not address; and use those coordinates to route greedily; whenpossible; towards the destination. However; there are many situations where locationinformation is not available at the nodes; and so geographic methods cannot be used. In thispaper we define a scalable coordinate-based routing algorithm that does not rely on locationinformation; and thus can be used in a wide variety of ad hoc and sensornet environments.,Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking,2003,992

The impact of DHT routing geometry on resilience and proximity,Krishna Gummadi; Ramakrishna Gummadi; Steven Gribble; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract The various proposed DHT routing algorithms embody several different underlyingrouting geometries. These geometries include hypercubes; rings; tree-like structures; andbutterfly networks. In this paper we focus on how these basic geometric approaches affectthe resilience and proximity properties of DHTs. One factor that distinguishes thesegeometries is the degree of flexibility they provide in the selection of neighbors and routes.Flexibility is an important factor in achieving good static resilience and effective proximityneighbor and route selection. Our basic finding is that; despite our initial preference for morecomplex geometries; the ring geometry allows the greatest flexibility; and hence achievesthe best resilience and proximity performance.,Proceedings of the 2003 conference on Applications; technologies; architectures; and protocols for computer communications,2003,761

In doing so; wehope to facilitate independent innovation in overlay protocols; services; and applications; toallow direct experimental comparisons; and to encourage application development by thirdparties.

Robust incentive techniques for peer-to-peer networks,Michal Feldman; Kevin Lai; Ion Stoica; John Chuang,Abstract Lack of cooperation (free riding) is one of the key problems that confronts today'sP2P systems. What makes this problem particularly difficult is the unique set of challengesthat P2P systems pose: large populations; high turnover; a symmetry of interest; collusion;zero-cost identities; and traitors. To tackle these challenges we model the P2P system usingthe Generalized Prisoner's Dilemma (GPD); and propose the Reciprocative decisionfunction as the basis of a family of incentives techniques. These techniques arefullydistributed and include: discriminating server selection; maxflow-based subjectivereputation; and adaptive stranger policies. Through simulation; we show that thesetechniques can drive a system of strategic users to nearly optimal levels of cooperation.,Proceedings of the 5th ACM conference on Electronic commerce,2004,742
Providing guaranteed services without per flow management,Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract Existing approaches for providing guaranteed services require routers to manageper flow states and perform per flow operations [9; 21]. Such a stateful network architectureis less scalable and robust than stateless network architectures like the original IP and therecently proposed Diffserv [3]. However; services provided with current stateless solutions;Diffserv included; have lower flexibility; utilization; and/or assurance level as compared tothe services that can be provided with per flow mechanisms. In this paper; we proposetechniques that do not require per flow management (either control or data planes) at corerouters; but can implement guaranteed services with levels of flexibility; utilization; andassurance similar to those that can be provided with per flow mechanisms. In this way wecan simultaneously achieve high quality of service; high scalability and robustness. The …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,1999,705

Dominant Resource Fairness: Fair Allocation of Multiple Resource Types.,Ali Ghodsi; Matei Zaharia; Benjamin Hindman; Andy Konwinski; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract We consider the problem of fair resource allocation in a system containing differentresource types; where each user may have different demands for each resource. To addressthis problem; we propose Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF); a generalization of max-minfairness to multiple resource types. We show that DRF; unlike other possible policies;satisfies several highly desirable properties. First; DRF incentivizes users to shareresources; by ensuring that no user is better off if resources are equally partitioned amongthem. Second; DRF is strategy-proof; as a user cannot increase her allocation by lying abouther requirements. Third; DRF is envyfree; as no user would want to trade her allocation withthat of another user. Finally; DRF allocations are Pareto efficient; as it is not possible toimprove the allocation of a user without decreasing the allocation of another user. We …,Nsdi,2011,681
OpenDHT: a public DHT service and its uses,Sean Rhea; Brighten Godfrey; Brad Karp; John Kubiatowicz; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; Harlan Yu,Abstract Large-scale distributed systems are hard to deploy; and distributed hash tables(DHTs) are no exception. To lower the barriers facing DHT-based applications; we havecreated a public DHT service called OpenDHT. Designing a DHT that can be widely shared;both among mutually untrusting clients and among a variety of applications; poses twodistinct challenges. First; there must be adequate control over storage allocation so thatgreedy or malicious clients do not use more than their fair share. Second; the interface to theDHT should make it easy to write simple clients; yet be sufficiently general to meet a broadspectrum of application requirements. In this paper we describe our solutions to thesedesign challenges. We also report our early deployment experience with OpenDHT anddescribe the variety of applications already using the system.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2005,646
Free-riding and whitewashing in peer-to-peer systems,Michal Feldman; Christos Papadimitriou; John Chuang; Ion Stoica,We devise a model to study the phenomenon of free-riding and free-identities in peer-to-peer systems. At the heart of our model is a user of a certain type; an intrinsic and privateparameter that reflects the user's willingness to contribute resources to the system. A userdecides whether to contribute or free-ride based on how the current contribution cost in thesystem compares to her type. We study the impact of mechanisms that exclude low typeusers or; more realistically; penalize free-riders with degraded service. We also considerdynamic scenarios with arrivals and departures of users; and with whitewashers-users wholeave the system and rejoin with new identities to avoid reputational penalties. We find thatimposing penalty on all users that join the system is effective under many scenarios. Inparticular; system performance degrades significantly only when the turnover rate among …,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2006,620
Packet fair queueing algorithms for wireless networks with location-dependent errors,TS Eugene Ng; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,While packet fair queueing (PFQ) algorithms provide both bounded delay and fairness inwired networks; they cannot be applied directly to wireless networks. The key difficulty is thatin wireless networks sessions can experience location-dependent channel errors. This maylead to situations in which a session receives significantly less service than it is supposed to;while another receives more. This results in large discrepancies between the sessions'virtual times; making it difficult to provide both delay-guarantees and fairnesssimultaneously. Our contribution is twofold. First; we identify a set of properties; calledchannel-condition independent fair (CIF); that a packet fair queueing algorithm should havein a wireless environment:(1) delay and throughput guarantees for error-free sessions;(2)long term fairness for error sessions;(3) short term fairness for error-free sessions; and (4) …,INFOCOM'98.

Acting based on the causes and theresource and opportunity cost of actions lets Mantri improve over prior work that only …,OSDI,2010,582
Load balancing in structured P2P systems,Ananth Rao; Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Sonesh Surana; Richard Karp; Ion Stoica,Abstract Most P2P systems that provide a DHT abstraction distribute objects among “peernodes” by choosing random identifiers for the objects. This could result in an O (log N)imbalance. Besides; P2P systems can be highly heterogeneous; ie they may consist ofpeers that range from old desktops behind modem lines to powerful servers connected tothe Internet through high-bandwidth lines. In this paper; we address the problem of loadbalancing in such P2P systems. We explore the space of designing load-balancingalgorithms that uses the notion of “virtual servers”. We present three schemes that differprimarily in the amount of information used to decide how to re-arrange load. Our simulationresults show that even the simplest scheme is able to balance the load within 80% of theoptimal value; while the most complex scheme is able to balance the load within 95% of …,International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems,2003,582
Discretized streams: Fault-tolerant streaming computation at scale,Matei Zaharia; Tathagata Das; Haoyuan Li; Timothy Hunter; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Many" big data" applications must act on data in real time. Running theseapplications at ever-larger scales requires parallel platforms that automatically handle faultsand stragglers. Unfortunately; current distributed stream processing models provide faultrecovery in an expensive manner; requiring hot replication or long recovery times; and donot handle stragglers. We propose a new processing model; discretized streams (D-Streams); that overcomes these challenges. D-Streams enable a parallel recoverymechanism that improves efficiency over traditional replication and backup schemes; andtolerates stragglers. We show that they support a rich set of operators while attaining highper-node throughput similar to single-node systems; linear scaling to 100 nodes; sub-second latency; and sub-second fault recovery.

Thus; it is extremely important that these systems bescalable.

Understanding the impact of video quality on user engagement,Florin Dobrian; Vyas Sekar; Asad Awan; Ion Stoica; Dilip Joseph; Aditya Ganjam; Jibin Zhan; Hui Zhang,Abstract As the distribution of the video over the Internet becomes main-stream and itsconsumption moves from the computer to the TV screen; user expectation for high quality isconstantly increasing. In this context; it is crucial for content providers to understand if andhow video quality affects user engagement and how to best invest their resources tooptimize video quality. This paper is a first step towards addressing these questions. We usea unique dataset that spans different content types; including short video on demand (VoD);long VoD; and live content from popular video con-tent providers. Using client-sideinstrumentation; we measure quality metrics such as the join time; buffering ratio; averagebitrate; rendering quality; and rate of buffering events. We quantify user engagement both ata per-video (or view) level and a per-user (or viewer) level. In particular; we find that the …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2011,489

GraphX: Graph Processing in a Distributed Dataflow Framework.,Joseph E Gonzalez; Reynold S Xin; Ankur Dave; Daniel Crankshaw; Michael J Franklin; Ion Stoica,Abstract In pursuit of graph processing performance; the systems community has largelyabandoned general-purpose distributed dataflow frameworks in favor of specialized graphprocessing systems that provide tailored programming abstractions and accelerate theexecution of iterative graph algorithms. In this paper we argue that many of the advantagesof specialized graph processing systems can be recovered in a modern general-purposedistributed dataflow system. We introduce GraphX; an embedded graph processingframework built on top of Apache Spark; a widely used distributed dataflow system. GraphXpresents a familiar composable graph abstraction that is sufficient to express existing graphAPIs; yet can be implemented using only a few basic dataflow operators (eg; join; map;group-by).

Endpoint admission control: Architectural issues and performance,Lee Breslau; Edward W Knightly; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract The traditional approach to implementing admission control; as exemplified by theIntegrated Services proposal in the IETF; uses a signalling protocol to establish reservationsat all routers along the path. While providing excellent quality-of-service; this approach haslimited scalability because it requires routers to keep per-flow state and to process per-flowreservation messages. In an attempt to implement admission control without these scalabilityproblems; several recent papers have proposed various forms of endpoint admissioncontrol. In these designs; the hosts (the endpoints) probe the network to detect the level ofcongestion; the host admits the flow only if the detected level of congestion is sufficiently low.This paper is devoted to the study of endpoint admission control. We first consider severalarchitectural issues that guide (and constrain) the design of such systems. We then use …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2000,470
A proportional share resource allocation algorithm for real-time; time-shared systems,Ion Stoica; Hussein Abdel-Wahab; Kevin Jeffay; Sanjoy K Baruah; Johannes E Gehrke; C Greg Plaxton,We propose and analyze a proportional share resource allocation algorithm for realizingreal-time performance in time-shared operating systems. Processes are assigned a weightwhich determines a share (percentage) of the resource they are to receive. The resource isthen allocated in discrete-sized time quanta in such a manner that each process makesprogress at a precise; uniform rate. Proportional share allocation algorithms are of interestbecause: they provide a natural means of seamlessly integrating real and non-real-timeprocessing; they are easy to implement; they provide a simple and effective means ofprecisely controlling the real-time performance of a process; and they provide a naturalmeans of policing so that processes that use more of a resource than they request have noill-effect on well-behaved processes.

Beacon vector routing: Scalable point-to-point routing in wireless sensornets,Rodrigo Fonseca; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Jerry Zhao; Cheng Tien Ee; David Culler; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract We propose a practical and scalable technique for point-to-point routing in wirelesssensornets. This method; called Beacon Vector Routing (BVR); assigns coordinates tonodes based on the vector of hop count distances to a small set of beacons; and thendefines a distance metric on these coordinates. BVR routes packets greedily; forwarding tothe next hop that is the closest (according to this beacon vector distance metric) to thedestination. We evaluate this approach through a combination of high-level simulation toinvestigate scaling and design tradeoffs; and a prototype implementation over real testbedsas a necessary reality check.,Proceedings of the 2nd Conference on Symposium on Networked Systems Design & Implementation-Volume 2,2005,443
Job scheduling for multi-user mapreduce clusters,Matei Zaharia; Dhruba Borthakur; J Sen Sarma; Khaled Elmeleegy; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Sharing a MapReduce cluster between users is attractive because it enablesstatistical multiplexing (lowering costs) and allows users to share a common large data set.However; we find that traditional scheduling algorithms can perform very poorly inMapReduce due to two aspects of the MapReduce setting: the need for data locality(running computation where the data is) and the dependence between map and reducetasks. We illustrate these problems through our experience designing a fair scheduler forMapReduce at Facebook; which runs a 600-node multiuser data warehouse on Hadoop. Wedeveloped two simple techniques; delay scheduling and copy-compute splitting; whichimprove throughput and response times by factors of 2 to 10. Although we focus on multi-user workloads; our techniques can also raise throughput in a single-user; FIFO workload …,*,2009,430
Implementing declarative overlays,Boon Thau Loo; Tyson Condie; Joseph M Hellerstein; Petros Maniatis; Timothy Roscoe; Ion Stoica,Abstract Overlay networks are used today in a variety of distributed systems ranging from file-sharing and storage systems to communication infrastructures. However; designing; buildingand adapting these overlays to the intended application and the target environment is adifficult and time consuming process. To ease the development and the deployment of suchoverlay networks we have implemented P2; a system that uses a declarative logic languageto express overlay networks in a highly compact and reusable form. P2 can express aNarada-style mesh network in 16 rules; and the Chord structured overlay in only 47 rules. P2directly parses and executes such specifications using a dataflow architecture to constructand maintain overlay networks.

Load balancing in dynamic structured P2P systems,Brighten Godfrey; Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Sonesh Surana; Richard Karp; Ion Stoica,Most P2P systems that provide a DHT abstraction distribute objects randomly among" peernodes" in a way that results in some nodes having/spl theta/(log N) times as many objects asthe average node. Further imbalance may result due to non-uniform distribution of objects inthe identifier space and a high degree of heterogeneity in object loads and node capacities.Additionally; a node's load may vary greatly over time since the system can be expected toexperience continuous insertions and deletions of objects; skewed object arrival patterns;and continuous arrival and departure of nodes.

Graphx: A resilient distributed graph system on spark,Reynold S Xin; Joseph E Gonzalez; Michael J Franklin; Ion Stoica,Abstract From social networks to targeted advertising; big graphs capture the structure indata and are central to recent advances in machine learning and data mining. Unfortunately;directly applying existing data-parallel tools to graph computation tasks can be cumbersomeand inefficient. The need for intuitive; scalable tools for graph computation has lead to thedevelopment of new graph-parallel systems (eg.; Pregel; PowerGraph) which are designedto efficiently execute graph algorithms. Unfortunately; these new graph-parallel systems donot address the challenges of graph construction and transformation which are often just asproblematic as the subsequent computation. Furthermore; existing graph-parallel systemsprovide limited fault-tolerance and support for interactive data mining. We introduce GraphX;which combines the advantages of both data-parallel and graph-parallel systems by …,First International Workshop on Graph Data Management Experiences and Systems,2013,415
Shark: SQL and rich analytics at scale,Reynold S Xin; Josh Rosen; Matei Zaharia; Michael J Franklin; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Shark is a new data analysis system that marries query processing with complexanalytics on large clusters. It leverages a novel distributed memory abstraction to provide aunified engine that can run SQL queries and sophisticated analytics functions (eg iterativemachine learning) at scale; and efficiently recovers from failures mid-query. This allowsShark to run SQL queries up to 100X faster than Apache Hive; and machine learningprograms more than 100X faster than Hadoop. Unlike previous systems; Shark shows that itis possible to achieve these speedups while retaining a MapReduce-like execution engine;and the fine-grained fault tolerance properties that such engine provides. It extends such anengine in several ways; including column-oriented in-memory storage and dynamic mid-query replanning; to effectively execute SQL. The result is a system that matches the …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2013,411
X-trace: A pervasive network tracing framework,Rodrigo Fonseca; George Porter; Randy H Katz; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Modern Internet systems often combine different applications (eg; DNS; web; anddatabase); span different administrative domains; and function in the context of networkmechanisms like tunnels; VPNs; NATs; and overlays. Diagnosing these complex systems isa daunting challenge. Although many diagnostic tools exist; they are typically designed for aspecific layer (eg; traceroute) or application; and there is currently no tool for reconstructinga comprehensive view of service behavior. In this paper we propose X-Trace; a tracingframework that provides such a comprehensive view for systems that adopt it. We haveimplemented X-Trace in several protocols and software systems; and we discuss how itworks in three deployed scenarios: DNS resolution; a three-tiered photo-hosting website;and a service accessed through an overlay network.,Proceedings of the 4th USENIX conference on Networked systems design & implementation,2007,407
A layered naming architecture for the internet,Hari Balakrishnan; Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; Michael Walfish,Abstract Currently the Internet has only one level of name resolution; DNS; which convertsuser-level domain names into IP addresses. In this paper we borrow liberally from theliterature to argue that there should be three levels of name resolution: from user-leveldescriptors to service identifiers; from service identifiers to endpoint identifiers; and fromendpoint identifiers to IP addresses. These additional levels of naming and resolution (1)allow services and data to be first class Internet objects (in that they can be directly andpersistently named);(2) seamlessly accommodate mobility and multi-homing and (3)integrate middleboxes (such as NATs and firewalls) into the Internet architecture. We furtherargue that flat names are a natural choice for the service and endpoint identifiers. Hence;this architecture requires scalable resolution of flat names; a capability that distributed …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2004,407
Discretized Streams: An Efficient and Fault-Tolerant Model for Stream Processing on Large Clusters.,Matei Zaharia; Tathagata Das; Haoyuan Li; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Many important “big data” applications need to process data arriving in real time.However; current programming models for distributed stream processing are relatively low-level; often leaving the user to worry about consistency of state across the system and faultrecovery. Furthermore; the models that provide fault recovery do so in an expensive manner;requiring either hot replication or long recovery times. We propose a new programmingmodel; discretized streams (D-Streams); that offers a high-level functional programming API;strong consistency; and efficient fault recovery. D-Streams support a new recoverymechanism that improves efficiency over the traditional replication and upstream backupsolutions in streaming databases: parallel recovery of lost state across the cluster. We haveprototyped D-Streams in an extension to the Spark cluster computing framework called …,HotCloud,2012,406
ROFL: routing on flat labels,Matthew Caesar; Tyson Condie; Jayanthkumar Kannan; Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker,Abstract It is accepted wisdom that the current Internet architecture conflates networklocations and host identities; but there is no agreement on how a future architecture shoulddistinguish the two. One could sidestep this quandary by routing directly on host identitiesthemselves; and eliminating the need for network-layer protocols to include any mention ofnetwork location. The key to achieving this is the ability to route on flat labels. In this paperwe take an initial stab at this challenge; proposing and analyzing our ROFL routingalgorithm. While its scaling and efficiency properties are far from ideal; our results suggestthat the idea of routing on flat labels cannot be immediately dismissed.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2006,401
BlinkDB: queries with bounded errors and bounded response times on very large data,Sameer Agarwal; Barzan Mozafari; Aurojit Panda; Henry Milner; Samuel Madden; Ion Stoica,Abstract In this paper; we present BlinkDB; a massively parallel; approximate query enginefor running interactive SQL queries on large volumes of data. BlinkDB allows users to trade-off query accuracy for response time; enabling interactive queries over massive data byrunning queries on data samples and presenting results annotated with meaningful errorbars. To achieve this; BlinkDB uses two key ideas:(1) an adaptive optimization frameworkthat builds and maintains a set of multi-dimensional stratified samples from original dataover time; and (2) a dynamic sample selection strategy that selects an appropriately sizedsample based on a query's accuracy or response time requirements. We evaluate BlinkDBagainst the well-known TPC-H benchmarks and a real-world analytic workload derived fromConviva Inc.; a company that manages video distribution over the Internet.

Managing data transfers in computer clusters with orchestra,Mosharaf Chowdhury; Matei Zaharia; Justin Ma; Michael I Jordan; Ion Stoica,Abstract Cluster computing applications like MapReduce and Dryad transfer massiveamounts of data between their computation stages. These transfers can have a significantimpact on job performance; accounting for more than 50% of job completion times. Despitethis impact; there has been relatively little work on optimizing the performance of these datatransfers; with networking researchers traditionally focusing on per-flow traffic management.We address this limitation by proposing a global management architecture and a set ofalgorithms that (1) improve the transfer times of common communication patterns; such asbroadcast and shuffle; and (2) allow scheduling policies at the transfer level; such asprioritizing a transfer over other transfers. Using a prototype implementation; we show thatour solution improves broadcast completion times by up to 4.5 X compared to the status …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2011,396
A hierarchical fair service curve algorithm for link-sharing; real-time and priority services,Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang; TS Ng,Abstract In this paper; we study hierarchical resource management models and algorithmsthat support both link-sharing and guaranteed real-time services with decoupled delay(priority) and bandwidth allocation. We extend the service curve based QoS model; whichdefines both delay and bandwidth requirements of a class; to include fairness; which isimportant for the integration of real-time and hierarchical link-sharing services. The resultingFair Service Curve link-sharing model formalizes the goals of link-sharing and real-timeservices and exposes the fundamental tradeoffs between these goals. In particular; withdecoupled delay and band-width allocation; it is impossible to simultaneously provideguaranteed real-time service and achieve perfect link-sharing. We propose a novelscheduling algorithm called Hierarchical Fair Service Curve (H-FSC) that approximates …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,1997,373
Building peer-to-peer systems with Chord; a distributed lookup service,Frank Dabek; Emma Brunskill; M Frans Kaashoek; David Karger; Robert Morris; Ion Stoica; Hari Balakrishnan,We argue that the core problem facing peer-to-peer Systems is locating documents in adecentralized network and propose Chord; a distributed lookup primitive. Chord provides anefficient method of locating documents while placing few constraints on the applications thatuse it. As proof that Chord's functionality is useful in the development of peer-to-peerapplications; we outline the implementation of a peer-to-peer file sharing system based onChord.,Hot Topics in Operating Systems; 2001.

FairCloud: sharing the network in cloud computing,Lucian Popa; Gautam Kumar; Mosharaf Chowdhury; Arvind Krishnamurthy; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Ion Stoica,Abstract The network; similar to CPU and memory; is a critical and shared resource in thecloud. However; unlike other resources; it is neither shared proportionally to payment; nor docloud providers offer minimum guarantees on network bandwidth. The reason networks aremore difficult to share is because the network allocation of a virtual machine (VM) X dependsnot only on the VMs running on the same machine with X; but also on the other VMs that Xcommunicates with and the cross-traffic on each link used by X. In this paper; we start fromthe above requirements--payment proportionality and minimum guarantees--and show thatthe network-specific challenges lead to fundamental tradeoffs when sharing cloud networks.We then propose a set of properties to explicitly express these tradeoffs. Finally; we presentthree allocation policies that allow us to navigate the tradeoff space. We evaluate their …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2012,365
A unifying link abstraction for wireless sensor networks,Joseph Polastre; Jonathan Hui; Philip Levis; Jerry Zhao; David Culler; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Recent technological advances and the continuing quest for greater efficiency haveled to an explosion of link and network protocols for wireless sensor networks. Theseprotocols embody very different assumptions about network stack composition and; as such;have limited interoperability. It has been suggested [3] that; in principle; wireless sensornetworks would benefit from a unifying abstraction (or" narrow waist" in architectural terms);and that this abstraction should be closer to the link level than the network level. This papertakes that vague principle and turns it into practice; by proposing a specific unifyingsensornet protocol (SP) that provides shared neighbor management and a message pool.The two goals of a unifying abstraction are generality and efficiency: it should be capable ofrunning over a broad range of link-layer technologies and supporting a wide variety of …,Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Embedded networked sensor systems,2005,347
Incentives for cooperation in peer-to-peer networks,Kevin Lai; Michal Feldman; Ion Stoica; John Chuang,Many peer-to-peer (P2P) systems rely on cooperation among self-interested users. Forexample; users of file-sharing systems who do not share their own resources cause longdelays or download failures. When non-cooperative users benefit from free-riding on others'resources; the “tragedy of the commons”[10] is inevitable. Avoiding this problem requiresincentives for cooperation. To model this problem; we use the Evolutionary Prisoner'sDilemma (EPD)[3] to capture the tension between individual and social utility. In thesituations that EPD characterizes; cooperation requires repetition and reputation. Bothtechniques increase familiarity between entities (either directly or indirectly); therebyreducing the probability of interactions with strangers and consequently enhancingcooperation. The context of P2P applications; however; imposes new challenges. First …,Workshop on economics of peer-to-peer systems,2003,334
A policy-aware switching layer for data centers,Dilip A Joseph; Arsalan Tavakoli; Ion Stoica,Abstract Data centers deploy a variety of middleboxes (eg; firewalls; load balancers and SSLoffloaders) to protect; manage and improve the performance of applications and servicesthey run. Since existing networks provide limited support for middleboxes; administratorstypically overload path selection mechanisms to coerce traffic through the desiredsequences of middleboxes placed on the network path. These ad-hoc practices result in adata center network that is hard to configure and maintain; wastes middlebox resources; andcannot guarantee middlebox traversal under network churn. To address these issues; wepropose the policy-aware switching layer or PLayer; a new layer-2 for data centersconsisting of inter-connected policy-aware switches or pswitches. Unmodified middleboxesare placed off the network path by plugging them into pswitches. Based on policies …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2008,317
Declarative routing: extensible routing with declarative queries,Boon Thau Loo; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Abstract The Internet's core routing infrastructure; while arguably robust and efficient; hasproven to be difficult to evolve to accommodate the needs of new applications. Priorresearch on this problem has included new hard-coded routing protocols on the one hand;and fully extensible Active Networks on the other. In this paper; we explore a new point inthis design space that aims to strike a better balance between the extensibility androbustness of a routing infrastructure. The basic idea of our solution; which we calldeclarative routing; is to express routing protocols using a database query language. Weshow that our query language is a natural fit for routing; and can express a variety of well-known routing protocols in a compact and clean fashion. We discuss the security of ourproposal in terms of its computational expressive power and language design. Via …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2005,316
OverQoS: An Overlay Based Architecture for Enhancing Internet QoS.,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Ion Stoica; Hari Balakrishnan; Randy H Katz,Abstract: This paper describes the design; implementation; and experimental evaluation ofOverQoS; an overlay-based architecture for enhancing the best-effort service of today'sInternet. Using a Controlled loss virtual link (CLVL) abstraction to bound the loss rateobserved by a traffic aggregate; OverQoS can provide a variety of services including:(a)smoothing packet losses;(b) prioritizing packets within an aggregate;(c) statistical loss andbandwidth guarantees.,NSDI,2004,312
ODR: output-deterministic replay for multicore debugging,Gautam Altekar; Ion Stoica,Abstract Reproducing bugs is hard. Deterministic replay systems address this problem byproviding a high-fidelity replica of an original program run that can be repeatedly executedto zero-in on bugs. Unfortunately; existing replay systems for multiprocessor programs fallshort. These systems either incur high overheads; rely on non-standard multiprocessorhardware; or fail to reliably reproduce executions. Their primary stumbling block is dataraces--a source of nondeterminism that must be captured if executions are to be faithfullyreproduced. In this paper; we present ODR--a software-only replay system that reproducesbugs and provides low-overhead multiprocessor recording. The key observation behindODR is that; for debugging purposes; a replay system does not need to generate a high-fidelity replica of the original execution. Instead; it suffices to produce any execution that …,Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS 22nd symposium on Operating systems principles,2009,291
Declarative networking: language; execution and optimization,Boon Thau Loo; Tyson Condie; Minos Garofalakis; David E Gay; Joseph M Hellerstein; Petros Maniatis; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Timothy Roscoe; Ion Stoica,Abstract The networking and distributed systems communities have recently explored avariety of new network architectures; both for application-level overlay networks; and asprototypes for a next-generation Internet architecture. In this context; we have investigateddeclarative networking: the use of a distributed recursive query engine as a powerful vehiclefor accelerating innovation in network architectures [23; 24; 33]. Declarative networkingrepresents a significant new application area for database research on recursive queryprocessing. In this paper; we address fundamental database issues in this domain. First; wemotivate and formally define the Network Datalog (NDlog) language for declarative networkspecifications. Second; we introduce and prove correct relaxed versions of the traditionalsemi-naïve query evaluation technique; to overcome fundamental problems of the …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,280
Listen and whisper: Security mechanisms for BGP,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Volker Roth; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker; Randy Katz,Abstract BGP; the current inter-domain routing protocol; assumes that the routing informationpropagated by authenticated routers is correct. This assumption renders the currentinfrastructure vulnerable to both accidental misconfigurations and deliberate attacks. Toreduce this vulnerability; we present a combination of two mechanisms: Listen and Whisper.Listen passively probes the data plane and checks whether the underlying routes to differentdestinations work. Whisper uses cryptographic functions along with routing redundancy todetect bogus route advertisements in the control plane. These mechanisms are easilydeployable; and do not rely on either a public key infrastructure or a central authority likeICANN. The combination of Listen and Whisper eliminates a large number of problems dueto router misconfigurations; and restricts (though not eliminates) the damage that …,Proc.

Pathlet routing,P Godfrey; Igor Ganichev; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract We present a new routing protocol; pathlet routing; in which networks advertisefragments of paths; called pathlets; that sources concatenate into end-to-end source routes.Intuitively; the pathlet is a highly flexible building block; capturing policy constraints as wellas enabling an exponentially large number of path choices. In particular; we show thatpathlet routing can emulate the policies of BGP; source routing; and several recent multipathproposals. This flexibility lets us address two major challenges for Internet routing: scalabilityand source-controlled routing. When a router's routing policy has only" local" constraints; itcan be represented using a small number of pathlets; leading to very small forwarding tablesand many choices of routes for senders. Crucially; pathlet routing does not impose a globalrequirement on what style of policy is used; but rather allows multiple styles to coexist …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2009,279
Flush: a reliable bulk transport protocol for multihop wireless networks,Sukun Kim; Rodrigo Fonseca; Prabal Dutta; Arsalan Tavakoli; David Culler; Philip Levis; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract We present Flush; a reliable; high goodput bulk data transport protocol for wirelesssensor networks. Flush provides end-to-end reliability; reduces transfer time; and adapts totime-varying network conditions. It achieves these properties using end-to-endacknowledgments; implicit snooping of control information; and a rate-control algorithm thatoperates at each hop along a flow. Using several real network topologies; we show thatFlush closely tracks or exceeds the maximum goodput achievable by a hand-tuned but fixedrate for each hop over a wide range of path lengths and varying network conditions. Flush isscalable; its effective bandwidth over a 48-hop wireless network is approximately one-thirdof the rate achievable over one hop. The design of Flush is simplified by assuming thatdifferent flows do not interfere with each other; a reasonable restriction for many …,Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Embedded networked sensor systems,2007,278
REUNITE: A recursive unicast approach to multicast,Ion Stoica; TS Eugene Ng; Hui Zhang,We propose a new multicast protocol called REUNITE. The key idea of REUNITE is to userecursive unicast trees to implement multicast service. REUNITE does not use class D IPaddresses. Instead; both group identification and data forwarding are based on unicast IPaddresses. Compared with existing IP multicast protocols; REUNITE has several uniqueproperties. First; only routers that are acting as multicast tree branching points for a groupneed to keep the multicast forwarding state of the group. All other non-branching-pointrouters simply forward data packets by unicast routing. In addition; REUNITE can beincrementally deployed in the sense that it works even if only a subset of the routersimplement the protocol. Furthermore; REUNITE supports load balancing and gracefuldegradation such that when a router does not have resources (forwarding table entry …,INFOCOM 2000.

The case for a hybrid P2P search infrastructure,Boon Thau Loo; Ryan Huebsch; Ion Stoica; Joseph M Hellerstein,Abstract Popular P2P file-sharing systems like Gnutella and Kazaa use unstructured networkdesigns. These networks typically adopt flooding-based search techniques to locate files.While flooding-based techniques are effective for locating highly replicated items; they arepoorly suited for locating rare items. As an alternative; a wide variety of structured P2Pnetworks such as distributed hash tables (DHTs) have been recently proposed. Structurednetworks can efficiently locate rare items; but they incur significantly higher overheads thanunstructured P2P networks for popular files. Through extensive measurements of theGnutella network from multiple vantage points; we argue for a hybrid search solution; wherestructured search techniques are used to index and locate rare items; and floodingtechniques are used for locating highly replicated content. To illustrate; we present …,International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems,2004,263
Developing a predictive model of quality of experience for internet video,Athula Balachandran; Vyas Sekar; Aditya Akella; Srinivasan Seshan; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract Improving users' quality of experience (QoE) is crucial for sustaining theadvertisement and subscription based revenue models that enable the growth of Internetvideo. Despite the rich literature on video and QoE measurement; our understanding ofInternet video QoE is limited because of the shift from traditional methods of measuringvideo quality (eg; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and user experience (eg; opinion scores).These have been replaced by new quality metrics (eg; rate of buffering; bitrate) and newengagement centric measures of user experience (eg; viewing time and number of visits).The goal of this paper is to develop a predictive model of Internet video QoE. To this end; weidentify two key requirements for the QoE model:(1) it has to be tied in to observable userengagement and (2) it should be actionable to guide practical system design decisions …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2013,257
Sparrow: distributed; low latency scheduling,Kay Ousterhout; Patrick Wendell; Matei Zaharia; Ion Stoica,Abstract Large-scale data analytics frameworks are shifting towards shorter task durationsand larger degrees of parallelism to provide low latency. Scheduling highly parallel jobs thatcomplete in hundreds of milliseconds poses a major challenge for task schedulers; whichwill need to schedule millions of tasks per second on appropriate machines while offeringmillisecond-level latency and high availability. We demonstrate that a decentralized;randomized sampling approach provides near-optimal performance while avoiding thethroughput and availability limitations of a centralized design. We implement and deploy ourscheduler; Sparrow; on a 110-machine cluster and demonstrate that Sparrow performswithin 12% of an ideal scheduler.,Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles,2013,256
Minimizing churn in distributed systems,P Godfrey; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract A pervasive requirement of distributed systems is to deal with churn-change in theset of participating nodes due to joins; graceful leaves; and failures. A high churn rate canincrease costs or decrease service quality. This paper studies how to reduce churn byselecting which subset of a set of available nodes to use. First; we provide a comparison ofthe performance of a range of different node selection strategies in five real-world traces.Among our findings is that the simple strategy of picking a uniform-random replacementwhenever a node fails performs surprisingly well. We explain its performance throughanalysis in a stochastic model. Second; we show that a class of strategies; which we call"Preference List" strategies; arise commonly as a result of optimizing for a metric other thanchurn; and produce high churn relative to more randomized strategies under realistic …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2006,253
The architecture of pier: an internet-scale query processor,Ryan Huebsch; Brent Chun; Joseph M Hellerstein; Boon Thau Loo; Petros Maniatis; Timothy Roscoe; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; Aydan R Yumerefendi,This paper presents the architecture of PIER1; an Internetscale query engine we have beenbuilding over the last three years. PIER is the first general-purpose relational queryprocessor targeted at a peer-to-peer (p2p) architecture of thousands or millions ofparticipating nodes on the Internet. It supports massively distributed; database-styledataflows for snapshot and continuous queries. It is intended to serve as a building block fora diverse set of Internet-scale informationcentric applications; particularly those that tap intothe standardized data readily available on networked machines; including packet headers;system logs; and file names. In earlier papers we presented the vision for PIER; itsapplication relevance; and initial simulation results [28; 32]. We have also presented real-world results showing the benefits of using PIER in a p2p filesharing network [41; 43]. In …,*,2005,251
HLP: a next generation inter-domain routing protocol,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Matthew Caesar; Cheng Tien Ee; Mark Handley; Morley Mao; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract It is well-known that BGP; the current inter-domain routing protocol; has manydeficiencies. This paper describes a hybrid link-state and path-vector protocol called HLP asan alternative to BGP that has vastly better scalability; isolation and convergence properties.Using current BGP routing information; we show that HLP; in comparison to BGP; canreduce the churn-rate of route updates by a factor 400 as well as isolate the effect of routingevents to a region 100 times smaller than that of BGP. For a majority of Internet routes; HLPguarantees worst-case linear-time convergence. We also describe a prototypeimplementation of HLP on top of the XORP router platform. HLP is not intended to be afinished and final proposal for a replacement for BGP; but is instead offered as a startingpoint for debates about the nature of the next-generation inter-domain routing protocol.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2005,241
Scarlett: coping with skewed content popularity in mapreduce clusters,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Sameer Agarwal; Srikanth Kandula; Albert Greenberg; Ion Stoica; Duke Harlan; Ed Harris,Abstract To improve data availability and resilience MapReduce frameworks use filesystems that replicate data uniformly. However; analysis of job logs from a large productioncluster shows wide disparity in data popularity. Machines and racks storing popular contentbecome bottlenecks; thereby increasing the completion times of jobs accessing this dataeven when there are machines with spare cycles in the cluster. To address this problem; wepresent Scarlett; a system that replicates blocks based on their popularity. By accuratelypredicting file popularity and working within hard bounds on additional storage; Scarlettcauses minimal interference to running jobs. Trace driven simulations and experiments intwo popular MapReduce frameworks (Hadoop; Dryad) show that Scarlett effectivelyalleviates hotspots and can speed up jobs by 20.2%.,Proceedings of the sixth conference on Computer systems,2011,238
Internet indirection infrastructure,Ion Stoica; Daniel Adkins; Shelley Zhuang; Scott Shenker; Sonesh Surana,Attempts to generalize the Internet's point-to-point communication abstraction to provideservices like multicast; anycast; and mobility have faced challenging technical problems anddeployment barriers. To ease the deployment of such services; this paper proposes ageneral; overlay-based Internet Indirection Infrastructure (i3) that offers a rendezvous-basedcommunication abstraction. Instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination; eachpacket is associated with an identifier; this identifier is then used by the receiver to obtaindelivery of the packet. This level of indirection decouples the act of sending from the act ofreceiving; and allows i3 to efficiently support a wide variety of fundamental communicationservices. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach; we have designed and built aprototype based on the Chord lookup protocol.,IEEE/ACM Transactions on networking,2004,237
One more bit is enough,Yong Xia; Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Ion Stoica; Shivkumar Kalyanaraman,Abstract Achieving efficient and fair bandwidth allocation while minimizing packet loss inhigh bandwidth-delay product networks has long been a daunting challenge. Existing end-to-end congestion control (eg TCP) and traditional congestion notification schemes (eg TCP+AQM/ECN) have significant limitations in achieving this goal. While the recently proposedXCP protocol addresses this challenge; XCP requires multiple bits to encode the congestion-related information exchanged between routers and end-hosts. Unfortunately; there is nospace in the IP header for these bits; and solving this problem involves a non-trivial and time-consuming standardization process. In this paper; we design and implement a simple; low-complexity protocol; called Variable-structure congestion Control Protocol (VCP); thatleverages only the existing two ECN bits for network congestion feedback; and yet …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2005,234
PACMan: Coordinated memory caching for parallel jobs,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Ali Ghodsi; Andrew Wang; Dhruba Borthakur; Srikanth Kandula; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Data-intensive analytics on large clusters is important for modern Internet services.As machines in these clusters have large memories; in-memory caching of inputs is aneffective way to speed up these analytics jobs. The key challenge; however; is that thesejobs run multiple tasks in parallel and a job is sped up only when inputs of all such paralleltasks are cached. Indeed; a single task whose input is not cached can slow down the entirejob. To meet this" all-or-nothing" property; we have built PACMan; a caching service thatcoordinates access to the distributed caches. This coordination is essential to improve jobcompletion times and cluster efficiency. To this end; we have implemented two cachereplacement policies on top of PACMan's coordinated infrastructure fb-LIFE that minimizesaverage completion time by evicting large incomplete inputs; and LFU-F that maximizes …,Proceedings of the 9th USENIX conference on Networked Systems Design and Implementation,2012,232
Effective Straggler Mitigation: Attack of the Clones.,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Ali Ghodsi; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Small jobs; that are typically run for interactive data analyses in datacenters;continue to be plagued by disproportionately long-running tasks called stragglers. In theproduction clusters at Facebook and Microsoft Bing; even after applying state-of-the-artstraggler mitigation techniques; these latency sensitive jobs have stragglers that are onaverage 8 times slower than the median task in that job. Such stragglers increase theaverage job duration by 47%. This is because current mitigation techniques all involve anelement of waiting and speculation. We instead propose full cloning of small jobs; avoidingwaiting and speculation altogether. Cloning of small jobs only marginally increasesutilization because workloads show that while the majority of jobs are small; they onlyconsume a small fraction of the resources. The main challenge of cloning is; however …,NSDI,2013,215
Routing as a Service,Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker; Jennifer Rexford,Abstract In Internet routing; there is a fundamental tussle between the end users who wantcontrol over the end-to-end paths and the Autonomous Systems (ASes) who want controlover the flow of traffic through their infrastructure. To resolve this tussle and offer flexiblerouting control across multiple routing domains; we argue that customized route computationshould be offered as a service by third-party providers. Outsourcing specialized routecomputation allows different path-selection mechanisms to coexist; and evolve over time.,*,2004,209
Overqos: offering internet qos using overlays,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Ion Stoica; Hari Balakrishnan; Randy H Katz,Abstract This paper proposes OverQoS; an architecture for providing Internet QoS usingoverlay networks. OverQoS empowers third-party providers to offer enhanced networkservices to their customers using the notion of a controlled loss virtual link (CLVL). The CLVLabstraction bounds the loss-rate experienced by the overlay traffic; OverQoS uses it toprovide differential rate allocations; statistical bandwidth and loss assurances; and enablesexplicit-rate congestion control algorithms.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2003,204
Replay debugging for distributed applications,Dennis Michael Geels; Gautam Altekar; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract: We have developed a new replay debugging tool; liblog; for distributed C/C++applications. It logs the execution of deployed application processes and replays themdeterministically; faithfully reproducing race conditions and non-deterministic failures;enabling careful offline analysis. To our knowledge; liblog is the first replay tool to addressthe requirements of large distributed systems: lightweight support for long-running programs;consistent replay of arbitrary subsets of application nodes; and operation in a mixedenvironment of logging and non-logging processes. In addition; it requires no specialhardware or kernel patches; supports unmodified application executables; and integratesGDB into the replay mechanism for simultaneous source-level debugging of multipleprocesses.,*,2006,202
The design and implementation of a declarative sensor network system,David Chu; Lucian Popa; Arsalan Tavakoli; Joseph M Hellerstein; Philip Levis; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Sensor networks are notoriously difficult to program; given that they encompass thecomplexities of both distributed and embedded systems. To address this problem; wepresent the design and implementation of a declarative sensor network platform; DSN: adeclarative language; compiler and runtime suitable for programming a broad range ofsensornet applications. We demonstrate that our approach is a natural fit for sensornetworks by specifying several very different classes of traditional sensor network protocols;services and applications entirely declaratively--these include tree and geographic routing;link estimation; data collection; event tracking; version coherency; and localization.

Heterogeneity and load balance in distributed hash tables,P Brighten Godfrey; Ion Stoica,Existing solutions to balance load in DHTs incur a high overhead either in terms of routingstate or in terms of load movement generated by nodes arriving or departing the system. Inthis paper; we propose a set of general techniques and use them to develop a protocolbased on Chord; called Y/sub 0/; that achieves load balancing with minimal overhead underthe typical assumption that the load is uniformly distributed in the identifier space. Inparticular; we prove that Y/sub 0/can achieve near-optimal load balancing; while movinglittle load to maintain the balance and increasing the size of the routing tables by at most aconstant factor. Using extensive simulations based on real-world and synthetic capacitydistributions; we show that Y/sub 0/reduces the load imbalance of Chord from O (log n) to aless than 3.6 without increasing the number of links that a node needs to maintain.

A case for a coordinated internet video control plane,Xi Liu; Florin Dobrian; Henry Milner; Junchen Jiang; Vyas Sekar; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract Video traffic already represents a significant fraction of today's traffic and isprojected to exceed 90% in the next five years. In parallel; user expectations for a highquality viewing experience (eg; low startup delays; low buffering; and high bitrates) arecontinuously increasing. Unlike traditional workloads that either require low latency (eg;short web transfers) or high average throughput (eg; large file transfers); a high quality videoviewing experience requires sustained performance over extended periods of time (eg; tensof minutes). This imposes fundamentally different demands on content deliveryinfrastructures than those envisioned for traditional traffic patterns. Our large-scalemeasurements over 200 million video sessions show that today's delivery infrastructure failsto meet these requirements: more than 20% of sessions have a rebuffering ratio≥ 10 …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2012,190
Quanto: Tracking Energy in Networked Embedded Systems.,Rodrigo Fonseca; Prabal Dutta; Philip Levis; Ion Stoica,Abstract: We present Quanto; a network-wide time and energy profiler for embeddednetwork devices. By combining well-defined interfaces for hardware power states; fast high-resolution energy metering; and causal tracking of programmer-defined activities; Quantocan map how energy and time are spent on nodes and across a network. ImplementingQuanto on the TinyOS operating system required modifying under 350 lines of code andadding 1275 new lines. We show that being able to take fine-grained energy consumptionmeasurements as fast as reading a counter allows developers to precisely quantify theeffects of low-level system implementation decisions; such as using DMA versus direct busoperations; or the effect of external interference on the power draw of a low duty-cycle radio.Finally; Quanto is lightweight enough that it has a minimal effect on system behavior …,OSDI,2008,185
Taming IP packet flooding attacks,Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Daniel Adkins; Adrian Perrig; Ion Stoica,One of the major problems faced by Internet hosts is denialof-service (DoS) caused by IPpacket floods. Hosts in the Internet are unable to stop packets addressed to them. Once ahost's network link becomes congested; IP routers respond to the overload by droppingpackets arbitrarily. This is contrary to the goals of the host; which could respond moreeffectively to overload if it had control over which packets were dropped. For example; a hostmay reject new connections rather than accept excess load. A host running multiple servicesmay give higher priority to some services than others (service differentiation). Also; a hostmay provide lower quality service rather than reject requests (service degradation). Themain thesis of this paper is that hosts–not the network–should be given control to respond topacket floods and overload. Ideally; hosts should have fine-grained control over how …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2004,182
Achieving convergence-free routing using failure-carrying packets,Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Matthew Caesar; Murali Rangan; Tom Anderson; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Current distributed routing paradigms (such as link-state; distance-vector; and path-vector) involve a convergence process consisting of an iterative exploration of intermediateroutes triggered by certain events such as link failures. The convergence process increasesrouter load; introduces outages and transient loops; and slows reaction to failures. Wepropose a new routing paradigm where the goal is not to reduce the convergence times butrather to eliminate the convergence process completely. To this end; we propose atechnique called Failure-Carrying Packets (FCP) that allows data packets to autonomouslydiscover a working path without requiring completely up-to-date state in routers. Oursimulations; performed using real-world failure traces and Rocketfuel topologies; showthat:(a) the overhead of FCP is very low;(b) unlike traditional link-state routing (such as …,ACM SIGCOMM computer communication review,2007,180
Micro power meter for energy monitoring of wireless sensor networks at scale,Xiaofan Jiang; Prabal Dutta; David Culler; Ion Stoica,Abstract We present SPOT; a scalable power observation tool that enables in situmeasurement of nodal power and energy over a dynamic range exceeding four decades ora temporal resolution of microseconds. Using SPOT; every node in a sensor network cannow be instrumented; providing unparalleled visibility into the dynamic power profile ofapplications and system software. Power metering at every node enables previouslyimpossible empirical evaluation of low power designs at scale. The SPOT architecture anddesign meet challenges unique to wireless sensor networks and other low power systems;such as orders of magnitude difference in current draws between sleep and active states;short-duration power spikes during periods of brief activity; and the need for minimumperturbation of the system under observation.,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Information processing in sensor networks,2007,178
An overlay MAC layer for 802.11 networks,Ananth Rao; Ion Stoica,Abstract The widespread availability of 802.11-based hardware has made it the premierchoice of both researchers and practitioners for developing new wireless networks andapplications. However; the ever increasing set of demands posed by these applications isstretching the 802.11 MAC protocol beyond its intended capabilities. For example; 802.11provides no control over allocation of resources; and the default allocation policy is ill-suitedfor heterogeneous environments and multi-hop networks. Fairness problems are furtherexacerbated in multi-hop networks due to link asymmetry and hidden terminals. In thispaper; we take a first step towards addressing these problems without replacing the MAClayer by presenting the design and the implementation of an Overlay MAC Layer (OML); thatworks on top of the 802.11 MAC layer. OML uses loosely-synchronized clocks to divide …,Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Mobile systems; applications; and services,2005,178
Enhancing p2p file-sharing with an internet-scale query processor,Boon Thau Loo; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ryan Huebsch; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of designing a scalable; accurate queryprocessor for peer-to-peer filesharing and similar distributed keyword search systems. Usinga globally-distributed monitoring infrastructure; we perform an extensive study of theGnutella filesharing network; characterizing its topology; data and query workloads. Weobserve that Gnutella's query processing approach performs well for popular content; butquite poorly for rare items with few replicas. We then consider an alternate approach basedon Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs). We describe our implementation of PIERSearch; a DHT-based system; and propose a hybrid system where Gnutella is used to locate popular items;and PIERSearch for handling rare items. We develop an analytical model of the twoapproaches; and use it in concert with our Gnutella traces to study the trade-off between …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,178
Tachyon: Reliable; memory speed storage for cluster computing frameworks,Haoyuan Li; Ali Ghodsi; Matei Zaharia; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Tachyon is a distributed file system enabling reliable data sharing at memory speedacross cluster computing frameworks. While caching today improves read workloads; writesare either network or disk bound; as replication is used for fault-tolerance. Tachyoneliminates this bottleneck by pushing lineage; a well-known technique; into the storagelayer. The key challenge in making a long-running lineage-based storage system is timelydata recovery in case of failures. Tachyon addresses this issue by introducing acheckpointing algorithm that guarantees bounded recovery cost and resource allocationstrategies for recomputation under commonly used resource schedulers. Our evaluationshows that Tachyon outperforms in-memory HDFS by 110x for writes. It also improves theend-to-end latency of a realistic workflow by 4x. Tachyon is open source and is deployed …,Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2014,176
Efficient coflow scheduling with varys,Mosharaf Chowdhury; Yuan Zhong; Ion Stoica,Abstract Communication in data-parallel applications often involves a collection of parallelflows. Traditional techniques to optimize flow-level metrics do not perform well in optimizingsuch collections; because the network is largely agnostic to application-level requirements.The recently proposed coflow abstraction bridges this gap and creates new opportunities fornetwork scheduling. In this paper; we address inter-coflow scheduling for two differentobjectives: decreasing communication time of data-intensive jobs and guaranteeingpredictable communication time. We introduce the concurrent open shop scheduling withcoupled resources problem; analyze its complexity; and propose effective heuristics tooptimize either objective. We present Varys; a system that enables data-intensiveframeworks to use coflows and the proposed algorithms while maintaining high network …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2014,172
Exact emulation of an output queueing switch by a combined input output queueing switch,Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Combined input-output queueing switches (CIOQ) have better scaling properties than outputqueueing (OQ) switches. However; a CIOQ switch may have lower switch throughput and;more importantly; it is difficult to control delay in a CIOQ switch due to the existence ofmultiple queueing points. In this paper; we study the following problem: can a CIOQ switchbe designed to behave identically to an OQ switch? B. Prabhakar and N. McKeown (1997)proposed an algorithm such that a CIOQ switch with an internal speedup of 4 can behaveidentically to an OQ switch with FIFO as the output queueing discipline. In this paper; wepropose a new switch scheduling algorithm called joined preferred matching (JPM) thatimproves Prahhakar and McKeown's results in two aspects. First; with JPM; the internalspeedup needed for a CIOQ switch to achieve exact emulation of an OQ switch is only 2 …,Quality of Service; 1998.(IWQoS 98) 1998 Sixth International Workshop on,1998,172
Declarative networking,Boon Thau Loo; Tyson Condie; Minos Garofalakis; David E Gay; Joseph M Hellerstein; Petros Maniatis; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Timothy Roscoe; Ion Stoica,Abstract Declarative Networking is a programming methodology that enables developers toconcisely specify network protocols and services; which are directly compiled to a dataflowframework that executes the specifications. This paper provides an introduction to basicissues in declarative networking; including language design; optimization; and dataflowexecution. We present the intuition behind declarative programming of networks; includingroots in Datalog; extensions for networked environments; and the semantics of long-runningqueries over network state. We focus on a sublanguage we call Network Datalog (NDlog);including execution strategies that provide crisp eventual consistency semantics withsignificant flexibility in execution. We also describe a more general language called Overlog;which makes some compromises between expressive richness and semantic guarantees …,Communications of the ACM,2009,171
Surviving failures in bandwidth-constrained datacenters,Peter Bodík; Ishai Menache; Mosharaf Chowdhury; Pradeepkumar Mani; David A Maltz; Ion Stoica,Abstract Datacenter networks have been designed to tolerate failures of network equipmentand provide sufficient bandwidth. In practice; however; failures and maintenance ofnetworking and power equipment often make tens to thousands of servers unavailable; andnetwork congestion can increase service latency. Unfortunately; there exists an inherenttradeoff between achieving high fault tolerance and reducing bandwidth usage in networkcore; spreading servers across fault domains improves fault tolerance; but requiresadditional bandwidth; while deploying servers together reduces bandwidth usage; but alsodecreases fault tolerance. We present a detailed analysis of a large-scale Web applicationand its communication patterns. Based on that; we propose and evaluate a noveloptimization framework that achieves both high fault tolerance and significantly reduces …,Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2012 conference on Applications; technologies; architectures; and protocols for computer communication,2012,169
HTTP as the narrow waist of the future Internet,Lucian Popa; Ali Ghodsi; Ion Stoica,Abstract Over the past decade a variety of network architectures have been proposed toaddress IP's limitations in terms of flexible forwarding; security; and data distribution.Meanwhile; fueled by the explosive growth of video traffic and HTTP infrastructure (eg;CDNs; web caches); HTTP has became the de-facto protocol for deploying new servicesand applications. Given these developments; we argue that these architectures should beevaluated not only with respect to IP; but also with respect to HTTP; and that HTTP could bea fertile ground (more so than IP) for deploying the newly proposed functionalities. In thispaper; we take a step in this direction; and find that HTTP already provides many of thedesired properties for new Internet architectures. HTTP is a content centric protocol; providesmiddlebox support in the form of reverse and forward proxies; and leverages DNS to …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks,2010,167
Blue-Fi: enhancing Wi-Fi performance using bluetooth signals,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Ion Stoica,Abstract Mobile devices are increasingly equipped with multiple network interfaces withcomplementary characteristics. In particular; the Wi-Fi interface has high throughput andtransfer power efficiency; but its idle power consumption is prohibitive. In this paper wepresent; Blue-Fi; a sytem that predicts the availability of the Wi-Fi connectivity by using acombination of bluetooth contact-patterns and cell-tower information. This allows the deviceto intelligently switch the Wi-Fi interface on only when there is Wi-Fi connectivity available;thus avoiding the long periods in idle state and significantly reducing the the number ofscans for discovery.

LIRA: An approach for service differentiation in the Internet,Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we study the Assured Service model proposed by Clark andWroclawski [3; 4]. While existing schemes use service profiles that are defined in terms ofabsolute bandwidth; it is difficult; if not impossible; to design provisioning algorithms thatachieve simultaneously good service quality and high resource utilization for such serviceswith large spatial granularities. We propose an Assured Service model; called LIRA(Location Independent Resource Accounting); in which service profiles are defined in unitsof resource tokens; rather than absolute bandwidth. The number of resource tokens chargedfor each in-profile packet is a dynamic function of the path it traverses and the congestionlevel. Defining service profile in terms of resource tokens allows more dynamic and flexiblenetwork control algorithms that can simultaneously achieve high utilization and ensure …,Proc. Nossdav,1998,160
Load balancing in dynamic structured peer-to-peer systems,Sonesh Surana; Brighten Godfrey; Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Richard Karp; Ion Stoica,Abstract Most P2P systems that provide a DHT abstraction distribute objects randomlyamong “peer nodes” in a way that results in some nodes having Θ (log N) times as manyobjects as the average node. Further imbalance may result due to nonuniform distribution ofobjects in the identifier space and a high degree of heterogeneity in object loads and nodecapacities. Additionally; a node's load may vary greatly over time since the system canexperience continuous insertions and deletions of objects; skewed object arrival patterns;and continuous arrival and departure of nodes. In this paper; we propose an algorithm forload balancing in such heterogeneous; dynamic P2P systems. Our simulation results showthat in the face of rapid arrivals and departures of objects of widely varying load; ouralgorithm improves load balance by more than an order of magnitude for system …,Performance Evaluation,2006,159
Host mobility using an internet indirection infrastructure,Shelley Zhuang; Kevin Lai; Ion Stoica; Randy Katz; Scott Shenker,Abstract We propose the Robust Overlay Architecture for Mobility (ROAM) to provideseamless mobility for Internet hosts. ROAM is built on top of the Internet IndirectionInfrastructure (i3). With i3; instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination; each packetis associated with an identifier. This identifier defines an indirection point in i3; and is usedby the receiver to obtain the packet. ROAM takes advantage of end-host ability to control theplacement of indirection points in i3 to provide efficient routing; fast handoff; and preservelocation privacy for mobile hosts. In addition; ROAM allows end hosts to movesimultaneously; and is as robust as the underlying IP network to node failure. We havedeveloped a user-level prototype system on Linux that provides transparent mobility withoutmodifying applications or the TCP/IP protocol stack. Simulation results show that ROAM's …,Wireless Networks,2005,159
Probabilistically bounded staleness for practical partial quorums,Peter Bailis; Shivaram Venkataraman; Michael J Franklin; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract Data store replication results in a fundamental trade-off between operation latencyand data consistency. In this paper; we examine this trade-off in the context of quorum-replicated data stores. Under partial; or non-strict quorum replication; a data store waits forresponses from a subset of replicas before answering a query; without guaranteeing thatread and write replica sets intersect. As deployed in practice; these configurations provideonly basic eventual consistency guarantees; with no limit to the recency of data returned.However; anecdotally; partial quorums are often" good enough" for practitioners given theirlatency benefits. In this work; we explain why partial quorums are regularly acceptable inpractice; analyzing both the staleness of data they return and the latency benefits they offer.We introduce Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS) consistency; which provides …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,156
Denial-of-service resilience in peer-to-peer file sharing systems,Dan Dumitriu; E Knightly; Aleksandar Kuzmanovic; Ion Stoica; Willy Zwaenepoel,Abstract Peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing systems are characterized by highly replicatedcontent distributed among nodes with enormous aggregate resources for storage andcommunication. These properties alone are not sufficient; however; to render p2p networksimmune to denial-of-service (DoS) attack. In this paper; we study; by means of analyticalmodeling and simulation; the resilience of p2p file sharing systems against DoS attacks; inwhich malicious nodes respond to queries with erroneous responses. We consider the file-targeted attacks in current use in the Internet; and we introduce a new class of p2p-network-targeted attacks. In file-targeted attacks; the attacker puts a large number of corruptedversions of a single file on the network. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of theseattacks is highly dependent on the clients' behavior. For the attacks to succeed over the …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2005,153
Characterizing selfishly constructed overlay routing networks,Byung-Gon Chun; Rodrigo Fonseca; Ion Stoica; John Kubiatowicz,Abstract—We analyze the characteristics of overlay routing networks generated by selfishnodes playing competitive network construction games. We explore several networkingscenarios—some simplistic; others more realistic—and analyze the resulting Nashequilibrium graphs with respect to topology; performance; and resilience. We find afundamental tradeoff between performance and resilience; and show that limiting the degreeof nodes is of great importance in controlling this balance. Further; by varying the costfunction; the game produces widely different topologies; one parameter in particular—therelative cost between maintaining an overlay link and increasing the path length to othernodes—can generate topologies with node-degree distributions whose tails vary fromexponential to power-law. We conclude that competitive games can create overlay …,IEEE INFOCOM,2004,145
Bolt-on causal consistency,Peter Bailis; Ali Ghodsi; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract We consider the problem of separating consistency-related safety properties fromavailability and durability in distributed data stores via the application of a" bolt-on" shimlayer that upgrades the safety of an underlying general-purpose data store. This shimprovides the same consistency guarantees atop a wide range of widely deployed but ofteninflexible stores. As causal consistency is one of the strongest consistency models thatremain available during system partitions; we develop a shim layer that upgrades eventuallyconsistent stores to provide convergent causal consistency. Accordingly; we leverage widelydeployed eventually consistent infrastructure as a common substrate for providing causalguarantees. We describe algorithms and shim implementations that are suitable for a largeclass of application-level causality relationships and evaluate our techniques using an …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,143
An empirical study of the coolstreaming+ system,Bo Li; Susu Xie; Gabriel Y Keung; Jiangchuan Liu; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang; Xinyan Zhang,In recent years; there has been significant interest in adopting the peer-to-peer (P2P)technology for Internet live video streaming. There are primarily two reasons behind thisdevelopment: the elimination of infrastructure support and the self-scaling property of P2Psystems. The success of our system Coolstreaming represented one of the earliest large-scale P2P video streaming experiments. Since then; there have been several large-scalecommercial deployments. With desirable content; these systems have the potential to scaleorders of magnitude beyond the existing academic P2P prototypes. However; to transformthis potential into reality; we need to understand the key design trade-offs and principles; aswell as the design limitations of these systems.

Balancing traffic load in wireless networks with curveball routing,Lucian Popa; Afshin Rostamizadeh; Richard Karp; Christos Papadimitriou; Ion Stoica,Abstract We address the problem of balancing the traffic load in multi-hop wireless networks.We consider a point-to-point communicating network with a uniform distribution of source-sink pairs. When routing along shortest paths; the nodes that are centrally located forward adisproportionate amount of traffic. This translates into increased congestion and energyconsumption. However; the maximum load can be decreased if the packets follow curvedpaths. We show that the optimum such routing scheme can be expressed in terms ofgeometric optics and computed by linear programming. We then propose a practicalsolution; which we call Curveball Routing which achieves results not much worse than theoptimum. We evaluate our solution at three levels of fidelity: a Java high-level simulator; thens2 simulator; and the Intel Mirage Sensor Network Testbed.

A cost comparison of datacenter network architectures,Lucian Popa; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Gianluca Iannaccone; Arvind Krishnamurthy; Ion Stoica,Abstract There is a growing body of research exploring new network architectures for thedata center. These proposals all seek to improve the scalability and cost-effectiveness ofcurrent data center networks; but adopt very different approaches to doing so. For example;some proposals build networks entirely out of switches while others do so using acombination of switches and servers. How do these different network architecturescompare? For that matter; by what metrics should we even begin to compare thesearchitectures? Understanding the tradeoffs between different approaches is important bothfor operators making deployment decisions and to guide future research.

Re-optimizing data-parallel computing,Sameer Agarwal; Srikanth Kandula; Nicolas Bruno; Ming-Chuan Wu; Ion Stoica; Jingren Zhou,Abstract Performant execution of data-parallel jobs needs good execution plans. Certainproperties of the code; the data; and the interaction between them are crucial to generatethese plans. Yet; these properties are difficult to estimate due to the highly distributed natureof these frameworks; the freedom that allows users to specify arbitrary code as operations onthe data; and since jobs in modern clusters have evolved beyond single map and reducephases to logical graphs of operations. Using fixed apriori estimates of these properties tochoose execution plans; as modern systems do; leads to poor performance in severalinstances. We present RoPE; a first step towards re-optimizing data-parallel jobs. RoPEcollects certain code and data properties by piggybacking on job execution.

Multi-resource fair queueing for packet processing,Ali Ghodsi; Vyas Sekar; Matei Zaharia; Ion Stoica,Abstract Middleboxes are ubiquitous in today's networks and perform a variety of importantfunctions; including IDS; VPN; firewalling; and WAN optimization. These functions differvastly in their requirements for hardware resources (eg; CPU cycles and memorybandwidth). Thus; depending on the functions they go through; different flows can consumedifferent amounts of a middlebox's resources. While there is much literature on weighted fairsharing of link bandwidth to isolate flows; it is unclear how to schedule multiple resources ina middlebox to achieve similar guarantees. In this paper; we analyze several natural packetscheduling algorithms for multiple resources and show that they have undesirableproperties. We propose a new algorithm; Dominant Resource Fair Queuing (DRFQ); thatretains the attractive properties that fair sharing provides for one resource. In doing so; we …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2012,132
Non-Transitive Connectivity and DHTs.,Michael J Freedman; Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Ion Stoica,The most basic functionality of a distributed hash table; or DHT; is to partition a key spaceacross the set of nodes in a distributed system such that all nodes agree on the partitioning.For example; the Chord DHT assigns each node a random identifier from the key space ofintegers modulo 2 160 and maps each key to the node whose identifier most immediatelyfollows it. Chord is thus said to implement the successor relation; and so long as each nodein the network knows its predecessor in the key space; any node can compute which keysare mapped onto it.An implicit assumption in Chord and other DHT protocols is that allnodes are able to communicate with each other; yet we know this assumption is unfoundedin practice. We say a set of three hosts; A; B; and C; exhibit non-transitivity if A cancommunicate with B; and B can communicate with C; but A cannot communicate with C …,WORLDS,2005,130

Service Composition is the construction ofcomplex services from primitive ones; thus enabling rapid and flexible creation of newservices. The presence of multiple independent service providers poses new and significantchallenges. Managing trust across providers and verifying the performance of thecomponents in composition become essential issues. Adapting the composed service tonetwork and user dynamics by choosing service providers and instances is yet anotherchallenge. In SAHARA 1; we are developing a comprehensive architecture for the creation;placement; and management of services for composition across independent providers.

On failure detection algorithms in overlay networks,Shelley Q Zhuang; Dennis Geels; Ion Stoica; Randy H Katz,One of the key reasons overlay networks are seen as an excellent platform for large scaledistributed systems is their resilience in the presence of node failures. This resilience rely onaccurate and timely detection of node failures. Despite the prevalent use of keep-alivealgorithms in overlay networks to detect node failures; their tradeoffs and the circumstancesin which they might best he suited is not well understood. In this paper; we study how thedesign of various keep-alive approaches affect their performance in node failure detectiontime; probability of false positive; control overhead; and packet loss rate via analysis;simulation; and implementation. We find that among the class of keep-alive algorithms thatshare information; the maintenance of backpointer state substantially improves detectiontime and packet loss rate.

Backup path allocation based on a correlated link failure probability model in overlay networks,Weidong Cui; Ion Stoica; Randy H Katz,Communication reliability is a desired property in computer networks. One key technology toincrease the reliability of a communication path is to provision a disjoint backup path. One ofthe main challenges in implementing this technique is that two paths that are disjoint at theIP or overlay layer may share the same physical links. As a result; although we may select adisjoint backup path at the overlay layer one physical link failure may cause the failure ofboth the primary and the backup paths. In this paper we propose a solution to address thisproblem. The main idea is to take into account the correlated link failure at the overlay layerMore precisely; our goal is to find a route for the backup path to minimize the joint pathfailure probability between the primary and the backup paths.

Carat: Collaborative energy diagnosis for mobile devices,Adam J Oliner; Anand P Iyer; Ion Stoica; Eemil Lagerspetz; Sasu Tarkoma,Abstract We aim to detect and diagnose energy anomalies; abnormally heavy battery use.This paper describes a collaborative black-box method; and an implementation called Carat;for diagnosing anomalies on mobile devices. A client app sends intermittent; coarse-grainedmeasurements to a server; which correlates higher expected energy use with clientproperties like the running apps; device model; and operating system. The analysisquantifies the error and confidence associated with a diagnosis; suggests actions the usercould take to improve battery life; and projects the amount of improvement. During adeployment to a community of more than 500;000 devices; Carat diagnosed thousands ofenergy anomalies in the wild. Carat detected all synthetically injected anomalies; producedno known instances of false positives; projected the battery impact of anomalies with 95 …,Proceedings of the 11th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,2013,111
Choosy: Max-min fair sharing for datacenter jobs with constraints,Ali Ghodsi; Matei Zaharia; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Max-Min Fairness is a flexible resource allocation mechanism used in mostdatacenter schedulers. However; an increasing number of jobs have hard placementconstraints; restricting the machines they can run on due to special hardware or softwarerequirements. It is unclear how to define; and achieve; max-min fairness in the presence ofsuch constraints. We propose Constrained Max-Min Fairness (CMMF); an extension to max-min fairness that supports placement constraints; and show that it is the only policy satisfyingan important property that incentivizes users to pool resources. Optimally computing CMMFis challenging; but we show that a remarkably simple online scheduler; called Choosy;approximates the optimal scheduler well. Through experiments; analysis; and simulations;we show that Choosy on average differs 2% from the optimal CMMF allocation; and lets …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM European Conference on Computer Systems,2013,111
Fast and interactive analytics over Hadoop data with Spark,Matei Zaharia; Mosharaf Chowdhury; Tathagata Das; Ankur Dave; Justin Ma; Murphy Mccauley; M Franklin; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Spark started out of our research group's discussions with Hadoop users at and outside UCBerkeley. We saw that as organizations began loading more data into Hadoop; they quicklywanted to run rich applications that the single-pass; batch processing model of MapReducedoes not support efficiently. In particular; users wanted to run: u More complex; multi-passalgorithms; such as the iterative algorithms that are common in machine learning and graphprocessing u More interactive ad hoc queries to explore the data Although theseapplications may at first appear quite different; the core problem is that both multi-pass andinteractive applications need to share data across multiple MapReduce steps (eg; multiplequeries from the user; or multiple steps of an iterative computation). Unfortunately; the onlyway to share data between parallel operations in MapReduce is to write it to a distributed …,Usenix Login,2012,110
Disk-Locality in Datacenter Computing Considered Irrelevant.,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Ali Ghodsi; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Data center computing is becoming pervasive in many organizations. Computingframeworks such as MapReduce [17]; Hadoop [6] and Dryad [25]; split jobs into small tasksthat are run on the cluster's compute nodes. Through these frameworks; computation can beperformed on large datasets in a fault-tolerant way; while hiding the complexities of thedistributed nature of the cluster. For these reasons; a considerable work has been done toimprove the efficiency of these frameworks. A popular approach to improve the efficiency ofcluster computing frameworks has been to increase disklocality–the fraction of tasks that runon nodes that have the task's input data stored on local disk. Several techniques have beenproposed to increase disk-locality; including Delay-scheduling [26] and Scarlett [18]. In manysystems; disk-locality is one of the main performance metrics used to evaluate efficiency …,HotOS,2011,109
Highly available transactions: Virtues and limitations,Peter Bailis; Aaron Davidson; Alan Fekete; Ali Ghodsi; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract To minimize network latency and remain online during server failures and networkpartitions; many modern distributed data storage systems eschew transactional functionality;which provides strong semantic guarantees for groups of multiple operations over multipledata items. In this work; we consider the problem of providing Highly Available Transactions(HATs): transactional guarantees that do not suffer unavailability during system partitions orincur high network latency. We introduce a taxonomy of highly available systems andanalyze existing ACID isolation and distributed data consistency guarantees to identifywhich can and cannot be achieved in HAT systems. This unifies the literature on weaktransactional isolation; replica consistency; and highly available systems. We analyticallyand experimentally quantify the availability and performance benefits of HATs---often two …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,108
Stateless core: a scalable approach for quality of service in the internet,Ion Stoica,Abstract: Today's Internet provides one simple service: best effort datagram delivery. Thisminimalist service allows the Internet to be stateless; that is; routers do not need to maintainany fine grained information about traffic. As a result of this stateless architecture; theInternet is both highly scalable and robust. However; as the Internet evolves into a globalcommercial infrastructure that is expected to support a plethora of new applications such asIP telephony; interactive TV; and e-commerce; the existing best effort service will no longerbe sufficient. In consequence; there is an urgent need to provide more powerful servicessuch as guaranteed services; differentiated services; and flow protection. The keycontribution of this dissertation is to bridge this long-standing gap between stateless andstateful solutions in packet switched networks such as the Internet. Our thesis is that" it is …,*,2000,107
Reducing congestion effects in wireless networks by multipath routing,Lucian Popa; Costin Raiciu; Ion Stoica; David S Rosenblum,We propose a solution to improve fairness and increase throughput in wireless networkswith location information. Our approach consists of a multipath routing protocol; biasedgeographical routing (BGR); and two congestion control algorithms; in-network packetscatter (IPS) and end-to-end packet scatter (EPS); which leverage BGR to avoid thecongested areas of the network. BGR achieves good performance while incurring acommunication overhead of just 1 byte per data packet; and has a computational complexitysimilar to greedy geographic routing. IPS alleviates transient congestion by splitting trafficimmediately before the congested areas. In contrast; EPS alleviates long term congestion bysplitting the flow at the source; and performing rate control. EPS selects the pathsdynamically; and uses a less aggressive congestion control mechanism on non-greedy …,Network Protocols; 2006. ICNP'06.

A quest for an internet video quality-of-experience metric,Athula Balachandran; Vyas Sekar; Aditya Akella; Srinivasan Seshan; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract An imminent challenge that content providers; CDNs; third-party analytics andoptimization services; and video player designers in the Internet video ecosystem face is thelack of a single" gold standard" to evaluate different competing solutions. Existingtechniques that describe the quality of the encoded signal or controlled studies to measureopinion scores do not translate directly into user experience at scale. Recent work showsthat measurable performance metrics such as buffering; startup time; bitrate; and number ofbitrate switches impact user experience. However; converting these observations into aquantitative quality-of-experience metric turns out to be challenging since these metrics areinterrelated in complex and sometimes counter-intuitive ways; and their relationship to userexperience can be unpredictable. To further complicate things; many confounding factors …,Proceedings of the 11th ACM workshop on hot topics in networks,2012,101
Quantifying disincentives in peer-to-peer networks,Michal Feldman; Kevin Lai; John Chuang; Ion Stoica,Cooperation is a central tenet of peer-to-peer systems. Without cooperation; users of a file-sharing system such as Gnutella suffer long download delays; if they are able to downloadat all [1]. Unfortunately; users have a natural disincentive to cooperate because allowinguploads may delay their own file downloads (see Section 2.1). In general; a disincentive tocooperate leads to the “tragedy of the commons”[6]; where participants maximize their ownutility at the expense of the overall utility of the system. However; few existing systemsprovide integrated incentives to counteract disincentives. Existing systems typically rely onaltruism; which inevitably fails when participants cannot hold each other accountable forselfish behavior; or a user-managed incentive system; which overburdens users by requiringthem to approve or reject every transaction. In this paper; we use modeling and …,1st Workshop on Economics of Peer-to-Peer Systems,2003,100
Duality between resource reservation and proportional share resource allocation,Ion Stoica; Hussein Abdel-Wahab; Kevin Jeffay,We describe anew framework for resource allocation that unifies the well-knownproportional share and resource reservation policies. Each client is characterized by twoparameters: a weight that represents the rate at which the client'pays' for the resource; and ashare that represents the fraction of the resource that the client should receive. A fixed ratecorresponds to a proportional share allocation; while a fixed share corresponds to areservation. Furthermore; rates and shares are duals of each other. Once one parameters isfixed the other becomes fixed as well. If a client asks for a fixed share then the level ofcompetition for the resource determines the rate at which it has to pay; while if the rate isfixed; level of competition determines the service time the clients should receive. Toimplement this framework we use a new proportional share algorithm; called earliest …,Multimedia Computing and Networking 1997,1997,99
Knowing when you're wrong: building fast and reliable approximate query processing systems,Sameer Agarwal; Henry Milner; Ariel Kleiner; Ameet Talwalkar; Michael Jordan; Samuel Madden; Barzan Mozafari; Ion Stoica,Abstract Modern data analytics applications typically process massive amounts of data onclusters of tens; hundreds; or thousands of machines to support near-real-time decisions.The quantity of data and limitations of disk and memory bandwidth often make it infeasible todeliver answers at interactive speeds. However; it has been widely observed that manyapplications can tolerate some degree of inaccuracy. This is especially true for exploratoryqueries on data; where users are satisfied with" close-enough" answers if they can comequickly. A popular technique for speeding up queries at the cost of accuracy is to executeeach query on a sample of data; rather than the whole dataset. To ensure that the returnedresult is not too inaccurate; past work on approximate query processing has used statisticaltechniques to estimate" error bars" on returned results. However; existing work in the …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,98
Coordination avoidance in database systems,Peter Bailis; Alan Fekete; Michael J Franklin; Ali Ghodsi; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract Minimizing coordination; or blocking communication between concurrentlyexecuting operations; is key to maximizing scalability; availability; and high performance indatabase systems. However; uninhibited coordination-free execution can compromiseapplication correctness; or consistency. When is coordination necessary for correctness?The classic use of serializable transactions is sufficient to maintain correctness but is notnecessary for all applications; sacrificing potential scalability. In this paper; we develop aformal framework; invariant confluence; that determines whether an application requirescoordination for correct execution. By operating on application-level invariants overdatabase states (eg; integrity constraints); invariant confluence analysis provides anecessary and sufficient condition for safe; coordination-free execution.

A modular network layer for sensorsets,Cheng Tien Ee; Rodrigo Fonseca; Sukun Kim; Daekyeong Moon; Arsalan Tavakoli; David Culler; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract An overall sensornet architecture would help tame the increasingly complexstructure of wireless sensornet software and help foster greater interoperability betweendifferent codebases. A previous step in this direction is the Sensornet Protocol (SP); aunifying link-abstraction layer. This paper takes the natural next step by proposing a modularnetwork-layer for sensornets that sits atop SP. This modularity eases implementation of newprotocols by increasing code reuse; and enables co-existing protocols to share and reducecode and resources consumed at run-time. We demonstrate how current protocols can bedecomposed into this modular structure and show that the costs; in performance and codefootprint; are minimal relative to their monolithic counterparts.,Proceedings of the 7th symposium on Operating systems design and implementation,2006,96
CloudPolice: taking access control out of the network,Lucian Popa; Minlan Yu; Steven Y Ko; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Ion Stoica,Abstract Cloud computing environments impose new challenges on access controltechniques due to multi-tenancy; the growing scale and dynamicity of hosts within the cloudinfrastructure; and the increasing diversity of cloud network architectures. The majority ofexisting access control techniques were originally designed for enterprise environments thatdo not share these challenges and; as such; are poorly suited for cloud environments. In thispaper; we argue that it is both sufficient and advantageous to implement access control onlywithin the hypervisors at the end-hosts. We thus propose Cloud-Police; a system thatimplements a hypervisor-based access control mechanism. We argue that; not only canCloudPolice support more sophisticated access control policies; it can do so in a mannerthat is simpler; more scalable and more robust than existing network-based techniques.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks,2010,87
OCALA: An Architecture for Supporting Legacy Applications over Overlays.,Dilip Antony Joseph; Jayanthkumar Kannan; Ayumu Kubota; Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Ion Stoica; Klaus Wehrle,Abstract: In order for overlays and new network architectures to gain real user acceptance;users should be able to leverage overlay functionality without any modifications to theirapplications and operating systems. We present our design; implementation; andexperience with OCALA; an overlay convergence architecture that achieves this goal.OCALA interposes an overlay convergence layer below the transport layer. This layer iscomposed of an overlay independent sub-layer that interfaces with legacy applications; andan overlay dependent sub-layer that delivers packets to the overlay. Unlike previous efforts;OCALA enables:(a) simultaneous access to multiple overlays (b) communication betweenhosts in different overlays (c) communication between overlay hosts and legacy hosts (d)extensibility; allowing researchers to incorporate their overlays into OCALA.

Low latency geo-distributed data analytics,Qifan Pu; Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Peter Bodik; Srikanth Kandula; Aditya Akella; Paramvir Bahl; Ion Stoica,Abstract Low latency analytics on geographically distributed datasets (across datacenters;edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominantapproach of aggregating all the data to a single datacenter significantly inflates thetimeliness of analytics. At the same time; running queries over geo-distributed inputs usingthe current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times becausethese frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. Wepresent Iridium; a system for low latency geo-distributed analytics. Iridium achieves lowquery response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. Thejoint data and task placement optimization; however; is intractable. Therefore; Iridium usesan online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals; and …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2015,84
Blink and it's done: interactive queries on very large data,Sameer Agarwal; Anand P Iyer; Aurojit Panda; Samuel Madden; Barzan Mozafari; Ion Stoica,Abstract In this demonstration; we present BlinkDB; a massively parallel; sampling-basedapproximate query processing framework for running interactive queries on large volumes ofdata. The key observation in BlinkDB is that one can make reasonable decisions in theabsence of perfect answers. BlinkDB extends the Hive/HDFS stack and can handle thesame set of SPJA (selection; projection; join and aggregate) queries as supported by thesesystems. BlinkDB provides real-time answers along with statistical error guarantees; and canscale to petabytes of data and thousands of machines in a fault-tolerant manner. Ourexperiments using the TPC-H benchmark and on an anonymized real-world video contentdistribution workload from Conviva Inc. show that BlinkDB can execute a wide range ofqueries up to 150x faster than Hive on MapReduce and 10--150x faster than Shark (Hive …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,81
Efficient coflow scheduling without prior knowledge,Mosharaf Chowdhury; Ion Stoica,Abstract Inter-coflow scheduling improves application-level communication performance indata-parallel clusters. However; existing efficient schedulers require a priori coflowinformation and ignore cluster dynamics like pipelining; task failures; and speculativeexecutions; which limit their applicability. Schedulers without prior knowledge compromiseon performance to avoid head-of-line blocking. In this paper; we present Aalo that strikes abalance and efficiently schedules coflows without prior knowledge. Aalo employsDiscretized Coflow-Aware Least-Attained Service (D-CLAS) to separate coflows into a smallnumber of priority queues based on how much they have already sent across the cluster. Byperforming prioritization across queues and by scheduling coflows in the FIFO order withineach queue; Aalo's non-clairvoyant scheduler reduces coflow completion times while …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2015,80
Leveraging endpoint flexibility in data-intensive clusters,Mosharaf Chowdhury; Srikanth Kandula; Ion Stoica,Abstract Many applications do not constrain the destinations of their network transfers. Newopportunities emerge when such transfers contribute a large amount of network bytes. Bychoosing the endpoints to avoid congested links; completion times of these transfers as wellas that of others without similar flexibility can be improved. In this paper; we focus onleveraging the flexibility in replica placement during writes to cluster file systems (CFSes);which account for almost half of all cross-rack traffic in data-intensive clusters. The replicasof a CFS write can be placed in any subset of machines as long as they are in multiple faultdomains and ensure a balanced use of storage throughout the cluster. We study CFSinteractions with the cluster network; analyze optimizations for replica placement; andpropose Sinbad--a system that identifies imbalance and adapts replica destinations to …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2013,80
One more bit is enough,Yong Xia; Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Ion Stoica; Shivkumar Kalyanaraman,Achieving efficient and fair bandwidth allocation while minimizing packet loss and bottleneckqueue in high bandwidth-delay product networks has long been a daunting challenge.Existing end-to-end congestion control (eg; TCP) and traditional congestion notificationschemes (eg; TCP+ AQM/ECN) have significant limitations in achieving this goal. While theXCP protocol addresses this challenge; it requires multiple bits to encode the congestion-related information exchanged between routers and end-hosts. Unfortunately; there is nospace in the IP header for these bits; and solving this problem involves a non-trivial and time-consuming standardization process. In this paper; we design and implement a simple; low-complexity protocol; called variable-structure congestion control protocol (VCP); thatleverages only the existing two ECN bits for network congestion feedback; and yet …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2008,80
A microeconomic scheduler for parallel computers,Ion Stoica; Hussein Abdel-Wahab; Alex Pothen,Abstract We describe a scheduler based on the microeconomic paradigm for scheduling on-line a set of parallel jobs in a multiprocessor system. In addition to increasing the systemthroughput and reducing the response time; we consider fairness in allocating systemresources among the users; and provide the user with control over the relative performancesof his jobs. Every user has a savings account in which he receives money at a constant rate.To run a job; the user creates an expense account for that job to which he transfers moneyfrom his savings account. The job uses the funds in its expense account to obtain the systemresources it needs. The share of the system resources allocated to the user is directly relatedto the rate at which the user receives money; the rate at which the user transfers money intoa job expense account controls the job's performance. We prove that starvation is not …,Workshop on Job Scheduling Strategies for Parallel Processing,1995,80
Hierarchical scheduling for diverse datacenter workloads,Arka A Bhattacharya; David Culler; Eric Friedman; Ali Ghodsi; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract There has been a recent industrial effort to develop multi-resource hierarchicalschedulers. However; the existing implementations have some shortcomings in that theymight leave resources unallocated or starve certain jobs. This is because the multi-resourcesetting introduces new challenges for hierarchical scheduling policies. We provide analgorithm; which we implement in Hadoop; that generalizes the most commonly used multi-resource scheduler; DRF [1]; to support hierarchies. Our evaluation shows that our proposedalgorithm; H-DRF; avoids the starvation and resource inefficiencies of the existing open-source schedulers and outperforms slot scheduling.,Proceedings of the 4th annual Symposium on Cloud Computing,2013,79
Grass: Trimming stragglers in approximation analytics,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Michael Chien-Chun Hung; Xiaoqi Ren; Ion Stoica; Adam Wierman; Minlan Yu,Abstract In big data analytics; timely results; even if based on only part of the data; are oftengood enough. For this reason; approximation jobs; which have deadline or error bounds andrequire only a subset of their tasks to complete; are projected to dominate big dataworkloads. Straggler tasks are an important hurdle when designing approximate dataanalytic frameworks; and the widely adopted approach to deal with them is speculativeexecution. In this paper; we present GRASS; which carefully uses speculation to mitigate theimpact of stragglers in approximation jobs. GRASS's design is based on first principlesanalysis of the impact of speculation. GRASS delicately balances immediacy of improvingthe approximation goal with the long term implications of using extra resources forspeculation.

Faster and more accurate sequence alignment with SNAP,Matei Zaharia; William J Bolosky; Kristal Curtis; Armando Fox; David Patterson; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; Richard M Karp; Taylor Sittler,Abstract: We present the Scalable Nucleotide Alignment Program (SNAP); a new short andlong read aligner that is both more accurate (ie; aligns more reads with fewer errors) and 10-100x faster than state-of-the-art tools such as BWA. Unlike recent aligners based on theBurrows-Wheeler transform; SNAP uses a simple hash index of short seed sequences fromthe genome; similar to BLAST's. However; SNAP greatly reduces the number and cost oflocal alignment checks performed through several measures: it uses longer seeds to reducethe false positive locations considered; leverages larger memory capacities to speed indexlookup; and excludes most candidate locations without fully computing their edit distance tothe read. The result is an algorithm that scales well for reads from one hundred to thousandsof bases long and provides a rich error model that can match classes of mutations (eg …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1111.5572,2011,76

Our solution is based onthree simple principles:(i) enabling end-hosts to communicate without revealing their IPaddress;(ii) giving end-hosts control to defend against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks at theoverlay level; and (iii) making sure that the added functionality does not introducevulnerabilities not present in the Internet.

Making the world (of communications) a different place,David D Clark; Craig Partridge; Robert T Braden; Bruce Davie; Sally Floyd; Van Jacobson; Dina Katabi; Greg Minshall; KK Ramakrishnan; Timothy Roscoe; Ion Stoica; John Wroclawski; Lixia Zhang,There were a number of motivations for this discussion. The Internet itself arose because ofa visionary answer to a question such as this one. Through an alignment of visionaryleaders; the research community; and funding agencies; there was a coherent; long-termeffort to build a running prototype of a major new communications system. That effort led to anumber of new research results; results that substantially expanded and changed ourunderstanding of the communications field. The networking field does not have a sharedvision of the future today. Perhaps as a result; much of the research we see today lacks amotivation to deepen or broaden our understanding of communications. Much of today'sresearch is felt to be incremental (in the sense of “least publishable increment”) and lackinga long-term motivation.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2005,73
Scalable atomic visibility with RAMP transactions,Peter Bailis; Alan Fekete; Ali Ghodsi; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract Databases can provide scalability by partitioning data across several servers.However; multipartition; multioperation transactional access is often expensive; employingcoordination-intensive locking; validation; or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly; manyreal-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics for multipartitionoperations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of applications includingsecondary indexing; foreign key enforcement; and materialized view maintenance. In thiswork; we identify a new isolation model—Read Atomic (RA) isolation—that matches therequirements of these use cases by ensuring atomic visibility: either all or none of eachtransaction's updates are observed by other transactions. We present algorithms for ReadAtomic Multipartition (RAMP) transactions that enforce atomic visibility while offering …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,72
Cake: enabling high-level SLOs on shared storage systems,Andrew Wang; Shivaram Venkataraman; Sara Alspaugh; Randy Katz; Ion Stoica,Abstract Cake is a coordinated; multi-resource scheduler for shared distributed storageenvironments with the goal of achieving both high throughput and bounded latency. Cakeuses a two-level scheduling scheme to enforce high-level service-level objectives (SLOs).First-level schedulers control consumption of resources such as disk and CPU. Theseschedulers (1) provide mechanisms for differentiated scheduling;(2) split large requests intosmaller chunks; and (3) limit the number of outstanding device requests; which togetherallow for effective control over multi-resource consumption within the storage system. Cake'ssecond-level scheduler coordinates the first-level schedulers to map high-level SLOrequirements into actual scheduling parameters. These parameters are dynamicallyadjusted over time to enforce high-level performance specifications for changing …,Proceedings of the Third ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2012,72
Hidden-action in multi-hop routing,Michal Feldman; John Chuang; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker,Abstract In multi-hop networks; the actions taken by individual intermediate nodes aretypically hidden from the communicating endpoints; all the endpoints can observe is whetheror not the end-to-end transmission was successful. Therefore; in the absence of incentives tothe contrary; rational (ie; selfish) intermediate nodes may choose to forward packets at a lowpriority or simply not forward packets at all. Using a principal-agent model; we show how thehidden-action problem can be overcome through appropriate design of contracts; in both thedirect (the endpoints contract with each individual router) and recursive (each routercontracts with the next downstream router) cases. We further demonstrate that per-hopmonitoring does not necessarily improve the utility of the principal or the social welfare in thesystem. In addition; we generalize existing mechanisms that deal with hidden-information …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM conference on Electronic commerce,2005,70
Ernest: Efficient Performance Prediction for Large-Scale Advanced Analytics.,Shivaram Venkataraman; Zongheng Yang; Michael J Franklin; Benjamin Recht; Ion Stoica,Abstract Recent workload trends indicate rapid growth in the deployment of machinelearning; genomics and scientific workloads on cloud computing infrastructure. However;efficiently running these applications on shared infrastructure is challenging and we find thatchoosing the right hardware configuration can significantly improve performance and cost.The key to address the above challenge is having the ability to predict performance ofapplications under various resource configurations so that we can automatically choose theoptimal configuration. Our insight is that a number of jobs have predictable structure in termsof computation and communication. Thus we can build performance models based on thebehavior of the job on small samples of data and then predict its performance on largerdatasets and cluster sizes. To minimize the time and resources spent in building a model …,NSDI,2016,69
Modeling the adoption of new network architectures,Dilip Joseph; Nikhil Shetty; John Chuang; Ion Stoica,Abstract We propose an economic model based on user utility to study the adoption of newnetwork architectures such as IPv6. We use mathematical analysis and simulation studies tounderstand the role of various factors such as user and network benefits; switching costs;and the impact of converters on the adoption of new network architectures. In addition tocorroborating various commonly held beliefs about new network architecture adoption; ouranalysis and simulation studies also reveal several surprising and non-intuitive results. Forexample; while in general; increasing the efficiency of converters hastens the adoption ofnew network architectures; there are cases in which more efficient converters hinder theadoption of such architectures.

IP options are not an option,Rodrigo Fonseca; George Porter; R Katz; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract A wide variety of enhancements to the Internet architecture have been proposedover the past several years; many of which require attaching metadata; or state; to packetsas they flow through the network. Examples of such extensions are IP traceback [10] andXCP [6]. The IP specification supports an “options” mechanism as an extensible way tocouple state with packets. However; as we will show in this paper; IP options are not wellsupported in the Internet. We make use of the PlanetLab planetary scale network testbed [2]to quantify the fate of IP-option enabled packets in the wide-area. We measured wide-areapaths with both standard IP packets and packets with options. We discovered thatapproximately half of Internet paths drop packets with options; raising serious dependabilityissues. Surprisingly; our findings indicate that it is feasible to restore support for options in …,University of California at Berkeley; Technical Report UCB/EECS-2005-24,2005,63
Building Extensible Networks with Rule-Based Forwarding.,Lucian Popa; Norbert Egi; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Ion Stoica,Abstract We present a network design that provides flexible and policy-compliant forwarding.Our proposal centers around a new architectural concept: that of packet rules. A rule is asimple if-then-else construct that describes the manner in which the network should–orshould not–forward packets. A packet identifies the rule by which it is to be forwarded androuters forward each packet in accordance with its associated rule. Each packet rule iscertified; guaranteeing that all parties involved in forwarding a packet agree with the packet'srule. Packets containing uncertified rules are simply dropped in the network. We present thedesign; implementation and evaluation of a Rule-Based Forwarding (RBF) architecture. Wedemonstrate flexibility by illustrating how RBF supports a variety of use cases includingcontent caching; middlebox selection and DDoS protection. Using our prototype router …,OSDI,2010,62
The potential dangers of causal consistency and an explicit solution,Peter Bailis; Alan Fekete; Ali Ghodsi; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract Causal consistency is the strongest consistency model that is available in thepresence of partitions and provides useful semantics for human-facing distributed services.Here; we expose its serious and inherent scalability limitations due to write propagationrequirements and traditional dependency tracking mechanisms. As an alternative to classicpotential causality; we advocate the use of explicit causality; or application-defined happens-before relations. Explicit causality; a subset of potential causality; tracks only relevantdependencies and reduces several of the potential dangers of causal consistency.,Proceedings of the Third ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2012,61

Understanding the impact of video quality on user engagement,Florin Dobrian; Asad Awan; Dilip Joseph; Aditya Ganjam; Jibin Zhan; Vyas Sekar; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract As the distribution of video over the Internet is becoming mainstream; userexpectation for high quality is constantly increasing. In this context; it is crucial for contentproviders to understand if and how video quality affects user engagement and how to bestinvest their resources to optimize video quality. This paper is a first step toward addressingthese questions. We use a unique dataset that spans different content types; including shortvideo on demand (VoD); long VoD; and live content from popular video content providers.Using client-side instrumentation; we measure quality metrics such as the join time; bufferingratio; average bitrate; rendering quality; and rate of buffering events. We find that thepercentage of time spent in buffering (buffering ratio) has the largest impact on the userengagement across all types of content. However; the magnitude of this impact depends …,Communications of the ACM,2013,60

Earliest eligible virtual deadline first: A flexible and accurate mechanism for proportional share resource allocation,Ion Stoica; Hussein Abdel-Wahab,Abstract We propose and analyze a new proportional share allocation algorithm for timeshared resources. We assume that the resource is allocated in time quanta of size q. Toeach client; we associate a weight which determines the relative share from the resourcethat the client should receive. We de ne the notion of fairness in the context of an idealizedsystem in which the resource is assumed to be granted in arbitrarily small intervals of time.Mainly; we show that in steady conditions our algorithm guarantees that the di erencebetween the service time that a client should receive in the idealized system and the servicetime it actually receives in the real system is bounded by the size q of a time quantum. Thealgorithm provides support for dynamic operations; such as a client joining or leaving thecompetition (for the resource); and changing a client's weight.

Wireless ACK collisions not considered harmful,Prabal Dutta; Razvan Musaloiu-e; Ion Stoica; Andreas Terzis,ABSTRACT We present an acknowledged anycast primitive that allows a node to Wirelesslytransmit a packet and efﬁciently determine that at least one neighbor successfully received it.The initiator transmits a single packet to a unicast; multicast; or broadcast address and allnodes that match the destination respond with identical acknowledgment packetsautomatically generated by the hardware. Although these acknowledgments interfere; theyusually do so non-destructively; so the initiator can decode their superposition. We call suchan exchange a Backcast and show that this operation is feasible using a commodity radio;general because it enables multiple network services; efﬁcient because it is independent ofthe neighborhood size and runs in constant time; and scalable because it works with nofewer than a dozen interfering acknowledgments.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets-VII),2008,58
SparkNet: Training deep networks in Spark,Philipp Moritz; Robert Nishihara; Ion Stoica; Michael I Jordan,Abstract: Training deep networks is a time-consuming process; with networks for objectrecognition often requiring multiple days to train. For this reason; leveraging the resources ofa cluster to speed up training is an important area of work. However; widely-popular batch-processing computational frameworks like MapReduce and Spark were not designed tosupport the asynchronous and communication-intensive workloads of existing distributeddeep learning systems. We introduce SparkNet; a framework for training deep networks inSpark. Our implementation includes a convenient interface for reading data from SparkRDDs; a Scala interface to the Caffe deep learning framework; and a lightweight multi-dimensional tensor library. Using a simple parallelization scheme for stochastic gradientdescent; SparkNet scales well with the cluster size and tolerates very high-latency …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.06051,2015,57
The Power of Choice in Data-Aware Cluster Scheduling.,Shivaram Venkataraman; Aurojit Panda; Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Michael J Franklin; Ion Stoica,Abstract Providing timely results in the face of rapid growth in data volumes has becomeimportant for analytical frameworks. For this reason; frameworks increasingly operate ononly a subset of the input data. A key property of such sampling is that combinatorially manysubsets of the input are present. We present KMN; a system that leverages these choices toperform data-aware scheduling; ie; minimize time taken by tasks to read their inputs; for aDAG of tasks. KMN not only uses choices to co-locate tasks with their data but alsopercolates such combinatorial choices to downstream tasks in the DAG by launching a fewadditional tasks at every upstream stage. Evaluations using workloads from Facebook andConviva on a 100-machine EC2 cluster show that KMN reduces average job duration by81% using just 5% additional resources.,OSDI,2014,57
Sharing aggregate computation for distributed queries,Ryan Huebsch; Minos Garofalakis; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract An emerging challenge in modern distributed querying is to efficiently processmultiple continuous aggregation queries simultaneously. Processing each queryindependently may be infeasible; so multi-query optimizations are critical for sharing workacross queries. The challenge is to identify overlapping computations that may not beobvious in the queries themselves. In this paper; we reveal new opportunities for sharingwork in the context of distributed aggregation queries that vary in their selection predicates.We identify settings in which a large set of q such queries can be answered by executingk<< q different queries. The k queries are revealed by analyzing a boolean matrix capturingthe connection between data and the queries that they satisfy; in a manner akin to familiartechniques like Gaussian elimination. Indeed; we identify a class of linear aggregate …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,57
Graphx: Unifying data-parallel and graph-parallel analytics,Reynold S Xin; Daniel Crankshaw; Ankur Dave; Joseph E Gonzalez; Michael J Franklin; Ion Stoica,Abstract: From social networks to language modeling; the growing scale and importance ofgraph data has driven the development of numerous new graph-parallel systems (eg;Pregel; GraphLab). By restricting the computation that can be expressed and introducingnew techniques to partition and distribute the graph; these systems can efficiently executeiterative graph algorithms orders of magnitude faster than more general data-parallelsystems. However; the same restrictions that enable the performance gains also make itdifficult to express many of the important stages in a typical graph-analytics pipeline:constructing the graph; modifying its structure; or expressing computation that spans multiplegraphs. As a consequence; existing graph analytics pipelines compose graph-parallel anddata-parallel systems using external storage systems; leading to extensive data …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1402.2394,2014,56

True elasticity in multi-tenant data-intensive compute clusters,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Christopher Douglas; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Sriram Rao; Ion Stoica,Abstract Data-intensive computing (DISC) frameworks scale by partitioning a job across aset of fault-tolerant tasks; then diffusing those tasks across large clusters. Multi-tenantedclusters must accommodate service-level objectives (SLO) in their resource model; oftenexpressed as a maximum latency for allocating the desired set of resources to every job.When jobs are partitioned into tasks statically; a cluster cannot meet its SLOs whilemaintaining both high utilization and efficiency. Ideally; we want to give resources to jobswhen they are free but would expect to reclaim them instantaneously when new jobs arrive;without losing work. DISC frameworks do not support such elasticity because interruptingrunning tasks incurs high overheads.

The Case for Tiny Tasks in Compute Clusters.,Kay Ousterhout; Aurojit Panda; Josh Rosen; Shivaram Venkataraman; Reynold Xin; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract We argue for breaking data-parallel jobs in compute clusters into tiny tasks thateach complete in hundreds of milliseconds. Tiny tasks avoid the need for complex skewmitigation techniques: by breaking a large job into millions of tiny tasks; work will be evenlyspread over available resources by the scheduler. Furthermore; tiny tasks alleviate long waittimes seen in today's clusters for interactive jobs: even large batch jobs can be split intosmall tasks that finish quickly. We demonstrate a 5.2 x improvement in response times due tothe use of smaller tasks. In current data-parallel computing frameworks; high task launchoverheads and scalability limitations prevent users from running short tasks. Recentresearch has addressed many of these bottlenecks; we discuss remaining challenges andpropose a task execution framework that can efficiently support tiny tasks.,HotOS,2013,50

Adaptive stream processing using dynamic batch sizing,Tathagata Das; Yuan Zhong; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker,Abstract The need for real-time processing of" big data" has led to the development offrameworks for distributed stream processing in clusters. It is important for such frameworksto be robust against variable operating conditions such as server failures; changes in dataingestion rates; and workload characteristics. To provide fault tolerance and efficient streamprocessing at scale; recent stream processing frameworks have proposed to treat streamingworkloads as a series of batch jobs on small batches of streaming data. However; therobustness of such frameworks against variable operating conditions has not been explored.In this paper; we explore the effects of the batch size on the performance of streamingworkloads. The throughput and end-to-end latency of the system can have complicatedrelationships with batch sizes; data ingestion rates; variations in available resources …,Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2014,43

One mightsay that the computing forecast for tomorrow is “cloudy with a chance of failure.” One mainreason why major outages still occur is that there are many unknown large-scale failurescenarios in which recovery might fail. We propose a new type of cloud service; Failure as aService (FaaS); which allows cloud services to routinely perform large-scale failure drills inreal deployments.,University of California; Berkeley; Berkeley,2011,43
C3: Internet-Scale Control Plane for Video Quality Optimization.,Aditya Ganjam; Faisal Siddiqui; Jibin Zhan; Xi Liu; Ion Stoica; Junchen Jiang; Vyas Sekar; Hui Zhang,Abstract As Internet video goes mainstream; we see increasing user expectations for highervideo quality and new global policy requirements for content providers. Inspired by the casefor centralizing network-layer control; we present C3; a control system for optimizing Internetvideo delivery. The design of C3 addresses key challenges in ensuring scalability andtackling data plane heterogeneity. First; to ensure scalability and responsiveness; C3introduces a novel split control plane architecture that can tolerate a small increase in modelstaleness for a dramatic increase in scalability. Second; C3 supports diverse client-sideplatforms via a minimal clientside sensing/actuation layer and offloads complex monitoringand control logic to the control plane.

A Common Substrate for Cluster Computing.,Benjamin Hindman; Andy Konwinski; Matei Zaharia; Ion Stoica,Abstract The success of MapReduce has sparked many efforts to design cluster computingframeworks. We argue that no single framework will be optimal for all applications; and thatwe should instead enable organizations to run multiple frameworks efficiently in the samecloud. Furthermore; to ease development of new frameworks; it is critical to identify commonabstractions and modularize their architectures. To achieve these goals; we propose Nexus;a low-level substrate that provides isolation and efficient resource sharing acrossframeworks running on the same cluster; while giving each framework freedom to implementits own programming model and fully control the execution of its jobs. Nexus fostersinnovation in the cloud by letting organizations run new frameworks alongside existing onesand by letting framework developers focus on specific applications rather than building …,HotCloud,2009,42

Through the use of light-weight securityprimitives; OverDoSe achieves resilience against compromised overlay nodes with aminimal performance overhead.

Why let resources idle? Aggressive cloning of jobs with Dolly,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Ali Ghodsi; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Despite prior research on outlier mitigation; our analysis of jobs from the Facebookcluster shows that outliers still occur; especially in small jobs. Small jobs are particularlysensitive to long-running outlier tasks because of their interactive nature. Outlier mitigationstrategies rely on comparing different tasks of the same job and launching speculativecopies for the slower tasks. However; small jobs execute all their tasks simultaneously;thereby not providing sufficient time to observe and compare tasks. Building on theobservation that clusters are underutilized; we take speculation to its logical extreme—runfull clones of jobs to mitigate the effect of outliers. The heavy-tail distribution of job sizesimplies that we can impact most jobs without using much resources. Trace-drivensimulations show that average completion time of all the small jobs improves by 47 …,Memory,2012,41

We propose a new architecture for secureapplications; Cloud Terminal; in which the only software running on the end host is alightweight secure thin terminal; and most application logic is in a remote cloud renderingengine. The secure thin terminal has a very small TCB (23 KLOC) and no dependence onthe untrusted OS; so it can be easily checked and remotely attested to. The terminal is alsogeneral-purpose: it simply supplies a secure display and input path to remote software.

Fair on-line scheduling of a dynamic set of tasks on a single resource,Sanjoy K Baruah; Johannes E Gehrk; C Greg Plaxton; Ion Stoica; Hussein Abdel-Wahab; Kevin Jeffay,Abstract Consider a set of “tasks” competing for the use of a single “resource”; where (i) onlyone task is allowed to use the resource at a time;(ii) the resource is scheduled in unit-timeintervals;(iii) each task requires a specific fraction of the resource capacity over an extendedperiod; and (iv) tasks arrive and depart at any time. We refer to such a task system as aninstance of the single-resource scheduling problem. The problem of designing a “fair”scheduling algorithm for such task systems has recently received a great deal of attention inthe literature. This paper makes two main contributions. First; we point out that Tijdeman'swork on the so-called “chairman assignment problem” provides a simple and efficient on-line algorithm for the static version of the single-resource scheduling problem (ie; where theset of tasks competing to use the resource does not change over time). We then extend …,Information Processing Letters,1997,35
HUG: Multi-Resource Fairness for Correlated and Elastic Demands.,Mosharaf Chowdhury; Zhenhua Liu; Ali Ghodsi; Ion Stoica,Abstract In this paper; we study how to optimally provide isolation guarantees in multi-resource environments; such as public clouds; where a tenant's demands on differentresources (links) are correlated. Unlike prior work such as Dominant Resource Fairness(DRF) that assumes static and fixed demands; we consider elastic demands. Our approachgeneralizes canonical max-min fairness to the multi-resource setting with correlateddemands; and extends DRF to elastic demands. We consider two natural optimizationobjectives: isolation guarantee from a tenant's viewpoint and system utilization (workconservation) from an operator's perspective. We prove that in non-cooperativeenvironments like public cloud networks; there is a strong tradeoff between optimal isolationguarantee and work conservation when demands are elastic.

Quantifying eventual consistency with PBS,Peter Bailis; Shivaram Venkataraman; Michael J Franklin; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract Data store replication results in a fundamental trade-off between operation latencyand data consistency. At the weak end of the consistency spectrum is eventual consistencyproviding no limit to the staleness of data returned. However; anecdotally; eventualconsistency is often “good enough” for practitioners given its latency and availabilitybenefits. In this work; we explain why eventually consistent systems are regularly acceptablein practice; analyzing both the staleness of data they return and the latency benefits theyoffer. We introduce Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS); a consistency model whichprovides expected bounds on data staleness with respect to both versions and wall clocktime. We derive a closed-form solution for versioned staleness as well as model real-timestaleness under Internet-scale production workloads for a large class of quorum …,The VLDB Journal,2014,33
Tradeoffs in CDN designs for throughput oriented traffic,Minlan Yu; Wenjie Jiang; Haoyuan Li; Ion Stoica,Abstract Internet delivery infrastructures are traditionally optimized for low-latency traffic;such as the Web traffic. However; in recent years we are witnessing a massive growth ofthroughput-oriented applications; such as video streaming. These applications introducenew tradeoffs and design choices for content delivery networks (CDNs). In this paper; wefocus on understanding two key design choices:(1) What is the impact of the number ofCDN's peering points and server locations on its aggregate throughput and operatingcosts?(2) How much can ISP-CDNs benefit from using path selection to maximize itsaggregate throughput compared to other CDNs who only have control at the edge?Answering these questions is challenging because content distribution involves a complexecosystem consisting of many parties (clients; CDNs; ISPs) and depends on various …,Proceedings of the 8th international conference on Emerging networking experiments and technologies,2012,33
Design guidelines for robust Internet protocols,Tom Anderson; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; David Wetherall,Abstract Robustness has long been a central design goal of the Internet. Much of the initialeffort towards robustness focusedon the" fail-stop" model; where node failures are completeand easily detectable by other nodes. The Internet is quite robust against such failures;routinely surviving various catastrophes with only limited outages. This robustness is largelydue to the widespread belief in a set of guidelines for critical design decisions such aswhere to initiate recovery and how to maintain state. However; the Internet remainsextremely vulnerable to more arbitrary failures where; through either error or malice; a nodeissues syntactically correct responses that are not semantically correct. Such failures; someas simple as misconfigured routing state; can seriously undemnine the functioning of theInternet.

A scalable and robust solution for bandwidth allocation,Sridhar Machiraju; Mukund Seshadri; Ion Stoica,We propose a novel architecture for providing bandwidth allocation and reservation that isboth scalable and robust. Scalability is achieved by not requiring routers to maintain per-flowstate on either the data or control planes. To achieve robustness; we develop two keytechniques. First; we use an admission control mechanism based on lightweight certificatesand random sampling to prevent malicious users from claiming reservations that were neverallocated to them. Second; we use a recursive monitoring algorithm to detect misbehavingflows that exceed their reservations. We randomly divide the traffic into large aggregates;and then compare the data arrival rate of each aggregate to its reservation. If an aggregatemisbehaves; ie; its arrival rate is greater than its reservation; we split and monitor thataggregate recursively until we detect the misbehaving flow (s).

SAAR: A Shared Control Plane for Overlay Multicast.,Animesh Nandi; Aditya Ganjam; Peter Druschel; TS Eugene Ng; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang; Bobby Bhattacharjee,Abstract: Many cooperative overlay multicast systems of diverse designs have beenimplemented and deployed. In this paper; we explore a new architecture for overlaymulticast: we factor out the control plane into a separate overlay that provides a singleprimitive: a configurable anycast for peer selection. This separation of control and dataoverlays has several advantages. Data overlays can be optimized for efficient contentdelivery; while the control overlay can be optimized for flexible and efficient peer selection.Several data channels can share a control plane for fast switching among content channels;which is particularly important for IPTV. And; the control overlay can be reused in multicastsystems with different data plane organizations.,NSDI,2007,32
Chord: A scalable peer-to-peer lookup service for internet applications,Hari Balakrishnan,Abstract A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficientlylocate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord; a distributedlookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation:given a key; it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top ofChord by associating a key with each data item; and storing the key/data item pair at thenode to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system;and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results fromtheoretical analysis and simulations show that Chord is scalable; with communication costand the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chordnodes.,ACM SIGCOMM,2001,32

Self-verifying CSFQ,Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang; Scott Shenker,Previously; a class of solutions including core-stateless fair queueing (CSFQ); rainbow fairqueueing; and Diffserv have been proposed to address the scalability concerns that haveplagued stateful architectures such as Intserv and fair queueing. However; despite somedesirable properties; these solutions still have serious scalability; robustness; anddeployment problems. Their scalability; suffers from the fact that the core cannot transcendtrust boundaries (such as at ISP-ISP interconnects); and so the high-speed routers on theseboundaries must maintain per flow or per aggregate state. The lack of robustness is becausea single malfunctioning edge or core router could severely impact the performance of theentire network. The deployability is hampered because the set of routers must be carefullyconfigured with a well-defined set of edge routers surrounding the core. In this paper; we …,INFOCOM 2002.

Shedding light on the structure of internet video quality problems in the wild,Junchen Jiang; Vyas Sekar; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract The key role that video quality plays in impacting user engagement; andconsequently providers' revenues; has motivated recent efforts in improving the quality ofInternet video. This includes work on adaptive bitrate selection; multi-CDN optimization; andglobal control plane architectures.

This method; called Beacon Vector Routing (BVR); assigns coordinatesto nodes based on the vector of distances (hop count) to a small set of beacons; and thendefines a distance metric on these coordinates. Packets are routed greedily; beingforwarded to the next hop that is the closest (according to this beacon vector distance metric)to the destination.

Flexible and robust large scale multicast using i3,Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Ananth Rao; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker,Abstract: There have been many proposals to support multicast in the Internet. Theseproposals can be roughly categorized as being either infrastructure-based; with the multicastfunctionality provided by designated network nodes; or host-based; with the multicastfunctionality provided by the members of the multicast group itself. These two classes havevery different performance characteristics; typically infrastructure-based solutions are farmore scalable; while the host-based solutions are far more deployable and flexible. Thispaper proposes a multicast architecture; that is a hybrid of the two approaches; based on theInternet Indirection Infrastructure (i3). i3 provides a general-purpose rendezvous primitivethat end hosts can use to implement multicast in a scalable; flexible; and deployablemanner.

We evaluate Macroscopeon traces collected at 52 laptops within a large enterprise and show that Macroscope isaccurate in finding the dependencies of networked applications. We also show thatMacroscope requires less human involvement and is significantly more accurate than stateof the art approaches that use only packet traces.

CFA: A Practical Prediction System for Video QoE Optimization.,Junchen Jiang; Vyas Sekar; Henry Milner; Davis Shepherd; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract Many prior efforts have suggested that Internet video Quality of Experience (QoE)could be dramatically improved by using data-driven prediction of video quality for differentchoices (eg; CDN or bitrate) to make optimal decisions. However; building such a predictionsystem is challenging on two fronts. First; the relationships between video quality andobserved session features can be quite complex. Second; video quality changesdynamically. Thus; we need a prediction model that is (a) expressive enough to capturethese complex relationships and (b) capable of updating quality predictions in near real-time. Unfortunately; several seemingly natural solutions (eg; simple machine learningapproaches and simple network models) fail on one or more fronts. Thus; the potentialbenefits promised by these prior efforts remain unrealized. We address these challenges …,NSDI,2016,27
G-ola: Generalized on-line aggregation for interactive analysis on big data,Kai Zeng; Sameer Agarwal; Ankur Dave; Michael Armbrust; Ion Stoica,Abstract Nearly 15 years ago; Hellerstein; Haas and Wang proposed online aggregation(OLA); a technique that allows users to (1) observe the progress of a query by showingiteratively refined approximate answers; and (2) stop the query execution once its resultachieves the desired accuracy.

TCP-aware packet marking in networks with diffserv support,Marco Mellia; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract In the context of Differentiated Service; the Assured Forwarding class recentlyproposed by the IETF offers the capabilities of distinguishing two or more classes of packets;based on bit marking in packet headers. Originally; packet marking was intended to beperformed according to the aggregate user-profile in the DiffServ model. In this paper weshow the benefit of an alternative strategy in which packet-marking is based on the states ofindividual TCP flows. The marking scheme can be implemented either in end systems oringress routers; where the number of concurrent flows is limited; thus allowing per-flowmanagement of packets. In addition; it can be integrated with a marking scheme that isbased on the user-profile.

Succinct: Enabling Queries on Compressed Data.,Rachit Agarwal; Anurag Khandelwal; Ion Stoica,Abstract Succinct is a data store that enables efficient queries directly on a compressedrepresentation of the input data. Succinct uses a compression technique that allows randomaccess into the input; thus enabling efficient storage and retrieval of data. In addition;Succinct natively supports a wide range of queries including count and search of arbitrarystrings; range and wildcard queries. What differentiates Succinct from previous techniques isthat Succinct supports these queries without storing indexes—all the required information isembedded within the compressed representation. Evaluation on real-world datasets showthat Succinct requires an order of magnitude lower memory than systems with similarfunctionality. Succinct thus pushes more data in memory; and provides low query latency fora larger range of input sizes than existing systems.,NSDI,2015,26
Lagover: latency gradated overlays,Anwitaman Datta; Ion Stoica; Mike Franklin,We propose a new genre of overlay network for disseminating information from popular butresource constrained sources. We call this communication primitive as latency gradatedoverlay; where information consumers self-organize themselves according to their individualresource constraints and the latency they are willing to tolerate in receiving the informationfrom the source. Such a communication primitive finds immediate use in applications likeRSS feeds aggregation. We propose heuristic algorithms to construct LagOver based onpreferably some partial knowledge of the network at users (no knowledge slows theconstruction process) but no global coordination. The algorithms are evaluated based onsimulations and show good characteristics including convergence; satisfying peers' latencyand bandwidth constraints even in presence of moderately high membership dynamics …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2007.

Beacon location service: a location service for point-to-point routing in wireless sensor networks,Jorge Ortiz; Chris R Baker; Daekyeong Moon; Rodrigo Fonseca; Ion Stoica,Abstract In this paper we present Beacon Location Service (BLS): a location service forbeacon-based routing algorithms like Beacon Vector Routing (BVR)[8] and S4 [19]. The roleof a location service is to map node names to topologically meaningful addresses that canbe used for routing. We evaluate an implementation of BLS that works on top of BVR. BLSresolves the destination node's name to BVR coordinates and then uses BVR to route thesource message to the destination node. Together; BVR with BLS offer a complete solutionfor scalable point-to-point routing in sensornets. We describe our design and itsimplementation and evaluate BLS in simulation and on a sensornet testbed. Our resultsshow it can sustain a high look-up and routing success rate (greater than 90% on mostnetwork sizes we tested) over various send rates and network sizes.

Supporting best-effort traffic with fair service curve,TS Eugene Ng; Donpaul C Stephens; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,While packet fair queuing (PFQ) algorithms can provide per-flow end-to-end delayguarantees for real-time traffic or protection among competing best-effort traffic; they havetwo important limitations. The first one is that; since only one parameter (a weight) is used toallocate resource for each flow; there is a coupling between delay and bandwidth allocation.When used for real-time traffic; this can result in network under-utilization. The second andless well known limitation is that; when used for best-effort traffic; PFQ algorithms favorthroughput-oriented applications such as FTP over delay-sensitive bursty applications suchas WWW; and telnet. This is due to the memory-less instantaneous fairness property of PFQalgorithms. In a previous study; we proposed the fair service curve (FSC) algorithm whichenables more flexible delay and bandwidth allocation for real-time traffic through the use …,Global Telecommunications Conference; 1999.

Occupy the cloud: distributed computing for the 99%,Eric Jonas; Qifan Pu; Shivaram Venkataraman; Ion Stoica; Benjamin Recht,Abstract Distributed computing remains inaccessible to a large number of users; in spite ofmany open source platforms and extensive commercial offerings. While distributedcomputation frameworks have moved beyond a simple map-reduce model; many users arestill left to struggle with complex cluster management and configuration tools; even forrunning simple embarrassingly parallel jobs. We argue that stateless functions represent aviable platform for these users; eliminating cluster management overhead; fulfilling thepromise of elasticity. Furthermore; using our prototype implementation; PyWren; we showthat this model is general enough to implement a number of distributed computing models;such as BSP; efficiently. Extrapolating from recent trends in network bandwidth and theadvent of disaggregated storage; we suggest that stateless functions are a natural fit for …,Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing,2017,24
Opaque: An Oblivious and Encrypted Distributed Analytics Platform.,Wenting Zheng; Ankur Dave; Jethro G Beekman; Raluca Ada Popa; Joseph E Gonzalez; Ion Stoica,Abstract Many systems run rich analytics on sensitive data in the cloud; but are prone to databreaches. Hardware enclaves promise data confidentiality and secure execution of arbitrarycomputation; yet still suffer from access pattern leakage. We propose Opaque; a distributeddata analytics platform supporting a wide range of queries while providing strong securityguarantees. Opaque introduces new distributed oblivious relational operators that hideaccess patterns; and new query planning techniques to optimize these new operators.Opaque is implemented on Spark SQL with few changes to the underlying system.

Reliable broadcast in unknown fixed-identity networks,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Randy H Katz; Volker Roth; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract In this paper; we formulate a new theoretical problem; namely the reliablebroadcast problem in unknown fixed-identity networks. This problem arises in the context ofdeveloping decentralized security mechanisms in a specific-class of distributed systems:Consider an undirected graph G connecting n nodes where each node is aware of only itsneighbors but not of the entire graph. Additionally; each node has a unique identity andcannot fake its identity to its neighbors. Assume that k among the n nodes act in anadversarial manner and the remaining nk are good nodes. Under what constraints doesthere exist a distributed algorithm Γ that enables every good node v to reliably broadcast amessage m (v) to all other good nodes in G? While good nodes follow the algorithm Γ; anadversary can additionally discard messages; generate spurious messages or collude …,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth annual ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing,2005,24

In this work; weinvestigate the efficacy of cooperation among Internet firewalls in containing such worms.We first propose a model for firewall-level cooperation and then study the containment in ourmodel of cooperation using analysis and simulation. Our results suggest that; with moderateoverhead; cooperation among Internet firewalls can provide 95% containment under 10%deployment while being resilient to 100-1000 malicious firewalls.,SRUTI,2005,24

FairRide: Near-Optimal; Fair Cache Sharing.,Qifan Pu; Haoyuan Li; Matei Zaharia; Ali Ghodsi; Ion Stoica,Abstract–Memory caches continue to be a critical component to many systems. In recentyears; there has been larger amounts of data into main memory; especially in sharedenvironments such as the cloud. The nature of such environments requires resourceallocations to provide both performance isolation for multiple users/applications and highutilization for the systems. We study the problem of fair allocation of memory cache formultiple users with shared files. We find that; surprisingly; no memory allocation policy canprovide all three desirable properties (isolation-guarantee; strategy-proofness andParetoefficiency) that are typically achievable by other types of resources; eg; CPU ornetwork. We also show that there exist policies that achieve any two of the three properties.We find that the only way to achieve both isolationguarantee and strategy-proofness is …,NSDI,2016,22
CellIQ: Real-Time Cellular Network Analytics at Scale.,Anand P Iyer; Li Erran Li; Ion Stoica,Abstract We present CellIQ; a real-time cellular network analytics system that supports richand sophisticated analysis tasks. CellIQ is motivated by the lack of support for realtimeanalytics or advanced tasks such as spatio-temporal traffic hotspots and handoff sequenceswith performance problems in state-of-the-art systems; and the interest in such tasks bynetwork operators. CellIQ represents cellular network data as a stream of domain specificgraphs; each from a batch of data. Leveraging domain specific characteristics—the spatialand temporal locality of cellular network data—CellIQ presents a number of optimizationsincluding geo-partitioning of input data; radiusbased message broadcast; and incrementalgraph updates to support efficient analysis. Using data from a live cellular network andrepresentative analytic tasks; we demonstrate that CellIQ enables fast and efficient …,NSDI,2015,21
Sparrow: Scalable scheduling for sub-second parallel jobs,Kay Ousterhout; Patrick Wendell; Matei Zaharia; Ion Stoica,Abstract Large-scale data analytics frameworks are shifting towards shorter task durationsand larger degrees of parallelism to provide low latency. However; scheduling highlyparallel jobs that complete in hundreds of milliseconds poses a major challenge for clusterschedulers; which will need to place millions of tasks per second on appropriate nodeswhile offering millisecond-level latency and high availability. We demonstrate that adecentralized; randomized sampling approach provides nearoptimal performance whileavoiding the throughput and availability limitations of a centralized design. We implementand deploy our scheduler; Sparrow; on a real cluster and demonstrate that Sparrowperforms within 14% of an ideal scheduler.,EECS Department; University of California; Berkeley; Tech. Rep.

Dominant resource fairness: Fair allocation of heterogeneous resources in datacenters,Ali Ghodsi; Matei Zaharia; Benjamin Hindman; Andrew Konwinski; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract This paper investigates how different resources can be fairly allocated among usersthat possibly prioritize them differently. We introduce a fairness policy; called DominantResource Fairness (DRF); which is an adaptation of max-min fairness from networking todatacenter environments. We show that DRF; unlike other policies which we investigated;satisfies a number of desirable properties that a fair datacenter scheduler should have;including guaranteeing that every user gets 1 n of some resource and that users canrelinquish resources without hurting other users' allocations. DRF is also envy-free;incentivizing users to correctly report their resource demand. When compared to otherintuitive schedulers; as well as competing ones from microeconomic theory; DRF is morefair.,Proc. of NSDI,2010,20

However; interactive data analysis inR is usually limited as the R runtime is single threaded and can only process data sets that fitin a single machine's memory. We present SparkR; an R package that provides a frontend toApache Spark and uses Spark's distributed computation engine to enable large scale dataanalysis from the R shell.

Focus Replay Debugging Effort on the Control Plane.,Gautam Altekar; Ion Stoica,Abstract Replay debugging systems enable the reproduction and debugging of non-deterministic failures in production application runs. However; no existing replay system issuitable for datacenter applications like Cassandra; Hadoop; and Hypertable. On theselarge scale; distributed; and data intensive programs; existing replay methods either incurexcessive production recording overheads or are unable to provide high fidelity replay. Inthis position paper; we hypothesize and empirically verify that control plane determinism isthe key to recordefficient and high-fidelity replay of datacenter applications. The key ideabehind control plane determinism is that debugging does not always require a precisereplica of the original application run. Instead; it often suffices to produce some run thatexhibits the original behavior of the control-plane–the application code responsible for …,HotDep,2010,19

Supporting legacy applications over i3,Jayanthkumar Kannan; Ayumu Kubota; Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Ion Stoica; Klaus Wehrle,Abstract Providing support for legacy applications is a crucial component of many overlaynetworks; as it allows end-users to instantly benefit from the functionality introduced by theseoverlays. This paper presents the design and implementation of a proxy-based solution tosupport legacy applications in the context of the i3 overlay [24]. The proxy design relies onan address virtualization technique which allows the proxy to tunnel the legacy traffic overthe overlay transparently. Our solution can preserve IP packet headers on an end-to-endbasis; even when end-host IP addresses change; or when endhosts live in different addressspaces (eg; behind NATs). In addition; our solution allows the use of human-readablenames to refer to hosts or services; and requires no changes to applications or operatingsystems. To illustrate how the proxy enables legacy applications to take advantage of the …,*,2004,19
Eona: Experience-oriented network architecture,Junchen Jiang; Xi Liu; Vyas Sekar; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract There is a growing recognition among researchers; industry practitioners; andservice providers of the need to optimize user-perceived application experience. Networkinfrastructure owners (ie; ISPs) have traditionally been left out of this equation; leading torepeated tussles between content providers and ISPs. In parallel; application providers haveto deploy complex workarounds that reverse engineer the network's impact on application-level metrics. In this work; we make the case for EONA; a new network paradigm whereapplication providers and network providers can collaborate meaningfully to improveapplication experience. We observe a confluence of technology trends that are enablers forEONA: the ability to collect large volumes of client-side application measurements; theemergence of novel" big data" platforms for real-time analytics; and new control plane …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks,2014,18

Debug Determinism: The Sweet Spot for Replay-Based Debugging.,Cristian Zamfir; Gautam Altekar; George Candea; Ion Stoica; UC Berkeley,Abstract Deterministic replay tools offer a compelling approach to debugging hard-to-reproduce bugs. Recent work on relaxed-deterministic replay techniques shows that replaydebugging with low in-production overhead is possible. However; despite considerableprogress; a replaydebugging system that offers not only low in-production runtime overheadbut also high debugging utility; remains out of reach. To this end; we argue that the researchcommunity should strive for debug determinism—a new determinism model premised on theidea that effective debugging entails reproducing the same failure and the same root causeas the original execution. We present ideas on how to achieve and quantify debugdeterminism and give preliminary evidence that a debugdeterministic system has potentialto provide both low in-production overhead and high debugging utility.,HotOS,2011,16
Snapshots in hadoop distributed file system,Sameer Agarwal; Dhruba Borthakur; Ion Stoica,Abstract The ability to take snapshots is an essential functionality of any file system; assnapshots enable system administrators to perform data backup and recovery in case offailure. We present a low-overhead snapshot solution for HDFS; a popular distributed filesystem for large clusters of commodity servers. Our solution obviates the need for complexdistributed snapshot algorithms; by taking advantage of the centralized architecture of theHDFS control plane which stores all file metadata on a single node; and alleviates the needfor expensive copy-on write operations by taking advantage of the HDFS limited interfacethat restricts the write operations to append and truncate only. Furthermore; our solutionemploys new snapshot data structures to address the inherent challenges related to datareplication and distribution in HDFS.

Customizable routing with declarative queries,Boon Thau Loo; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract To meet the demands of new Internet applications; recent work argues for givingend-hosts more control over routing. To achieve this goal; we propose the use of a recursivequery language; which allows users to define their own routing protocols. Recursive queriescan be used to express a large variety of route requests such as the k shortest paths;shortest paths that avoid (or include) a given set of nodes and least-loaded paths. We showthat these queries can be efficiently implemented in the network; and in the simple casewhen all users request shortest paths; the communication overhead of our solution is similarto that incurred by a distance vector protocol. In addition; when only a subset of nodes issuethe same query; the communication cost can be further lowered using automatic queryoptimization techniques-suggesting that declarative queries and automatic optimization …,*,2004,15

Example of such services are filtering; intrusion detection;anonymization; transcoding; and caching. In this paper; we argue that the Internet IndirectionInfrastructure (i3)--an overlay network architecture that enables users to locate services andcontrol the path followed by their packets--provides a natural platform for servicecomposition. We discuss the challenges in implementing service compositions on top of i3;and suggest several approaches to address these challenges.,Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM international conference on Multimedia,2004,14

We consider multiple clients that compete fora time-shared resource; and we associate to each client a certain amount of funds. At thebeginning of every timeslice a client is selected and it is granted to use the resource duringthat time-slice. For selecting a client; we use a new deterministic scheme that allocates time-slices to every client in proportion to its funds. More precisely; we prove that our schemeensures that out of m consecutive time-slices that are allocated to all clients; the di erencebetween the actual number of time-slices allocated to a client and the expected one is atmost proportional to log m. The algorithm is extended in order to support di erent levels ofservice quality; at the highest level it guarantees that a client receives a share of the …,*,1995,14

Coflow: An application layer abstraction for cluster networking,Mosharaf Chowdhury; Ion Stoica,ABSTRACT Cluster computing applications; whether frameworks like MapReduce andDryad; or customized applications like search platforms and social networks; haveapplicationlevel requirements and higher-level abstractions to express them. Networking;however; still remains at the level of forwarding packets and balancing flows; and thereexists no networking abstraction that can take advantage of the rich semantics readilyavailable from these data parallel applications. The result is a plethora of seemingly disjoint;yet somehow connected; pieces of work to address networking challenges in theseapplications. We propose an application layer; data plane abstraction; coflow; that canexpress the requirements of (data) parallel programming models used in clusters today andmakes it easier to express; reason about; and act upon these requirements.,ACM Hotnets,2012,13

SCONE: A tool to estimate shared congestion among Internet paths,Weidong Cui; Sridhar Machiraju; Randy H Katz; Ion Stoica,Abstract It is well-known that the use of path diversity; ie; the use of multiple end-to-endpaths can improve the performance of applications such as multimedia streaming and Voiceover IP. Leveraging path diversity requires applications to choose independent paths; ie;paths that do not share Points of Congestion (PoCs). Although independent paths may notbe available; performance can often be improved by selecting paths with the least amount ofshared congestion. In this paper; we propose Shared CONgestion Estimator (SCONE); atool that provides an estimate of shared congestion between two paths. SCONE sendsprobe flows along each of these paths and calculates the fraction of drops appearing incorrelated bursts as the estimate of shared congestion. The assumption here is thatcorrelated bursts typically occur at shared PoCs. Previously proposed path selection …,EECS Department; University of California; Berkeley; Tech. Rep.

Hidden-action in network routing,Michal Feldman; John Chuang; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker,In communication networks; such as the Internet or mobile ad-hoc networks; the actionstaken by intermediate nodes or links are typically hidden from the communicating endpoints;all the endpoints can observe is whether or not the end-to-end transmission was successful.Therefore; in the absence of incentives to the contrary; rational (ie; selfish) intermediariesmay choose to forward messages at a low priority or simply not forward messages at all.Using a principal-agent model; we show how the hidden-action problem can be overcomethrough appropriate design of contracts in both the direct (the endpoints contract with eachindividual router directly) and the recursive (each router contracts with the next downstreamrouter) cases.

Building a flexible and efficient routing infrastructure: Need and challenges,Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker,Abstract The Achilles heel of the otherwise extremely successful Internet infrastructure hasbeen its rigidity; which has primarily stemmed from the ossification of shortest-path routing inthe basic architecture. The increasing effect of this rigidity of the current Internetinfrastructure; coupled with the popular belief that basic IP routing cannot be changed; hasled to many companies and researchers turn to infrastructure-based overlay networks tomeet specific application requirements. These overlay networks; however; are mostlyindependent efforts; sharing nothing but the underlying IP infrastructure. We first try to arguefor the need for reversing this trend; and in the process propose a panacea–a global sharedoverlay infrastructure. We envision that a single set of overlay infrastructure nodes;supporting a few simple primitives; would allow end-hosts to choose routes over the …,*,2003,12
EC-Cache: Load-Balanced; Low-Latency Cluster Caching with Online Erasure Coding.,KV Rashmi; Mosharaf Chowdhury; Jack Kosaian; Ion Stoica; Kannan Ramchandran,Abstract Data-intensive clusters and object stores are increasingly relying on in-memoryobject caching to meet the I/O performance demands. These systems routinely face thechallenges of popularity skew; background load imbalance; and server failures; which resultin severe load imbalance across servers and degraded I/O performance.

We apply BlowFish to several such applications fromreal-world production clusters:(i) as a data recovery mechanism during failures: in practice;BlowFish requires 5. 4× lower bandwidth and 2. 5× lower repair time compared to stateof-the-art erasure codes; while reducing the storage cost of replication from 3× to 1. 9×; and (ii)data stores with spatially-skewed and time-varying workloads (eg; due to object popularityand/or transient failures): we show that navigating the storage-performance tradeoff …,NSDI,2016,11

It is based on theassumptions that:(1) cloud computing will comprise an increasing fraction of the applicationworkload offered to an Internet; and (2) that access to cloud computing resources willdemand new architectural features from a network. Features that we have identified includedependability; security; flexibility and extensibility; the entirety of which constitute resilience.Nebula provides resilient networking services using ultrareliable routers; an extensiblecontrol plane and use of multiple paths upon which arbitrary policies may be enforced.

A general bootstrap performance diagnostic,Ariel Kleiner; Ameet Talwalkar; Sameer Agarwal; Ion Stoica; Michael I Jordan,Abstract As datasets become larger; more complex; and more available to diverse groups ofanalysts; it would be quite useful to be able to automatically and generically assess thequality of estimates; much as we are able to automatically train and evaluate predictivemodels such as classifiers. However; despite the fundamental importance of estimatorquality assessment in data analysis; this task has eluded highly automatic solutions. Whilethe bootstrap provides perhaps the most promising step in this direction; its level ofautomation is limited by the difficulty of evaluating its finite sample performance and even itsasymptotic consistency. Thus; we present here a general diagnostic procedure whichdirectly and automatically evaluates the accuracy of the bootstrap's outputs; determiningwhether or not the bootstrap is performing satisfactorily when applied to a given dataset …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,11
A Case for Performance-Centric Network Allocation.,Gautam Kumar; Mosharaf Chowdhury; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Ion Stoica,Abstract We consider the problem of allocating network resources across applications in aprivate cluster running data-parallel frameworks. Our primary observation is that theseapplications have different communication requirements and thus require different supportfrom the network to effectively parallelize. We argue that network resources should beshared in a performance-centric fashion that aids parallelism and allows developers toreason about the overall performance of their applications. This paper tries to address thequestion of whether/how fairnesscentric proposals relate to a performance-centric approachfor different communication patterns common in these frameworks and engages in a questfor a unified mechanism to share the network in such settings.,HotCloud,2012,11
Sweet Storage SLOs with Frosting.,Andrew Wang; Shivaram Venkataraman; Sara Alspaugh; Ion Stoica; Randy H Katz,Abstract Modern datacenters support a large number of applications with diverseperformance requirements. These performance requirements are expressed at theapplication layer as high-level service-level objectives (SLOs). However; large-scaledistributed storage systems are unaware of these high-level SLOs. This lack of awarenessresults in poor performance when workloads from multiple applications are consolidatedonto the same storage cluster to increase utilization. In this paper; we argue that becauseSLOs are expressed at a high level; a high-level control mechanism is required. This is incontrast to existing approaches; which use block-or disk-level mechanisms. These requiremanual translation of high-level requirements into low-level parameters. We presentFrosting; a request scheduling layer on top of a distributed storage system that allows …,HotCloud,2012,11
Adaptive distributed time-slot based scheduling for fairness in multi-hop wireless networks,Ananth Rao; Ion Stoica,Recent research indicates that multi-hop wireless networks can suffer from extremeimbalances in the throughput achieved by simultaneous competing flows. We address thisproblem by designing a practical distributed algorithm to compute a time-slot basedschedule that provides end-to-end Max-Min fairness. Our system uses randomized prioritiesbased on local weights to arbitrate access between nodes that directly compete with eachother (we call this Weighted Slot Allocation or WSA). The local weights are in turn computedby a higher layer called End-to-end Fairness using Local Weights (EFLoW). EFLoWimplements an additive-increase multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) algorithm that canautomatically adapt to changes in traffic demands and network conditions. In each iteration;EFLoW only uses state obtained from within a given node's contention region. We have …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008. ICDCS'08. The 28th International Conference on,2008,11

Towards a next generation inter-domain routing protocol,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Matthew Caesar; Cheng Tien Ee; Mark Handley; Morley Mao; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,After a long period of neglect; there has been a recent resurgence of research on BGP; thecurrent interdomain routing protocol. Some of these papers have provided valuableempirical data on the current state of inter-domain routing [3; 16; 13; 12; 14; 7]; others haveproposed incremental modifications that would improve the status quo [15; 4]. However;there has been a relative paucity of papers exploring how to fundamentally redesign inter-domain routing. In this paper we venture into this void; proposing a clean-sheet redesign ofBGP. Our proposal is a hybrid link-state path-vector routing protocol; called HLP; which weoffer not as the final word on inter-domain routing but rather as a possible starting point fordebates about the future architecture of inter-domain routing.

Stabilizing route selection in BGP,P Godfrey; Matthew Caesar; Ian Haken; Yaron Singer; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Route instability is an important contributor to data plane unreliability on the Internetand also incurs load on the control plane of routers. In this paper; we study how routeselection schemes can avoid these changes in routes. Modifying route selection implies atradeoff between stability; deviation from operators' preferred routes; and availability ofroutes. We develop algorithms to lower-bound the feasible points in these tradeoff spaces.We also propose a new approach; Stable Route Selection (SRS); which uses flexibility inroute selection to improve stability without sacrificing availability and with a controlledamount of deviation. Through large-scale simulation; a software-router implementation; andan emulation with real-world BGP update feeds; we demonstrate that SRS is a promisingapproach to safely stabilize route selection.,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2015,10

Batch sampling: Low overhead scheduling for sub-second prallel jobs,Kay Ousterhout; Patrick Wendell; Matei Zaharia; Ion Stoica,Abstract Large-scale data analytics frameworks are shifting towards shorter task durationsand larger degrees of parallelism to provide low latency. However; scheduling highlyparallel jobs that complete in hundreds of milliseconds poses a major scaling challenge forcluster schedulers; which will need to place millions of tasks per second on appropriatenodes while offering millisecondlevel latency and high availability. This paper presents adecentralized load balancing approach called batch sampling; based on a generalization ofthe power of two random choices; that performs within a few percent of an optimalcentralized scheduler. We evaluate our approach through both analytical results and animplementation called Sparrow. Sparrow schedules tasks with less than 8ms of overheadand features a design that is inherently fault-tolerant and scalable.,University of California; Berkeley,2012,10

Decentralized security mechanisms for routing protocols,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Randy H Katz; Ion Stoica,University of California; Berkeley Professor Randy H. Katz; Co-Chair Professor Ion Stoica;Co-Chair Today's Internet routing protocols are built upon the basic incorrect assumptionthat routers propagate truthful routing information. As a result; the entire Internetinfrastructure is vulnerable to security attacks from routers that propagate incorrect routinginformation. In fact; a single router is capable of hijacking a significant fraction of routes bylaunching such an attack. This issue is not just restricted to Internet routing protocols but iswidely prevalent in several routing protocols that have been proposed in the researchliterature. Many existing approaches for addressing the security problems of routingprotocols typically assume the existence of a Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) or some form ofprior key distribution mechanism along with a central authority.

Dcr: Replay debugging for the datacenter,Gautam Altekar; Ion Stoica,Abstract Debugging is hard; but debugging production datacenter applications such asCassandra; Hadoop; and Hypertable is downright daunting. The key obstacle is non-deterministic failures–hard-to-reproduce program misbehaviors that are immune totraditional cyclicdebugging techniques. Datacenter applications are rife with such failuresbecause they operate in highly nondeterministic environments: a typical setup employsthousands of nodes; spread across multiple datacenters; to process terabytes of data perday. In these environments; existing methods for debugging non-deterministic failures are oflimited use. They either incur excessive production overheads or don't scale to multi-node;terabyte-scale processing. To help remedy the situation; we have built a new replaydebugging tool.

Rule-based Forwarding (RBF): Improving Internet's flexibility and security.,Lucian Popa; Ion Stoica; Sylvia Ratnasamy,From active networks [33] to the more recent efforts on GENI [5]; a long-held goal of Internetresearch has been to arrive at a network architecture that is flexible. The allure of greaterflexibility is that it would allow us to more easily incorporate new ideas into the Internet'sinfrastructure; whether these ideas aim to improve the existing network (eg; improvingperformance [36; 23; 30]; reliability [12; 13]; security [38; 14; 25]; manageability [11]; etc.) orto extend it with altogether new services and business models (eg; multicast; differentiatedservices; IPv6; virtualized networks). An unfortunate stumbling block in these efforts hasbeen that flexibility is fundamentally at odds with another long-held goal: that of devising asecure network architecture. As one example of this tussle: several schemes seek theflexibility of forwarding packets along multiple paths (eg;[36; 12; 13]); to improve …,HotNets,2009,9
Group Therapy for Systems: Using Link Attestations to Manage Failures.,Michael J Freedman; Ion Stoica; David Mazieres; Scott Shenker,Abstract Managing failures and configuring systems properly are of critical importance forrobust distributed services. Unfortunately; protocols offering strong fault-toleranceguarantees are generally too costly and insensitive to performance criteria. Yet; systemmanagement in practice is often ad-hoc and ill-defined; leading to under-utilized capacity oradverse effects from poorly-behaving machines. This paper proposes a new abstractioncalled linkattestation groups (LA-Groups) for building robust distributed systems. Developersspecify application-level correctness conditions or performance requirements for nodes.Nodes vouch for each other's acceptability within small groups of nodes through digitally-signed link attestations; and then apply a link-state protocol to determine these grouprelationships.

Evaluation and enhancement of a unifying link abstraction for sensornets,Arsalan Tavakoli; Jay Taneja; P Dutta; D Culler; S Shenker; I Stoica,Abstract—SP has been proposed as a unifying abstraction or “narrow waist” for theSensorNet Architecture. An early prototype demonstrated the ability to allow multiplenetwork protocols to co-exist and mutually benefit by sharing common resources without thedrawback of larger program size or lesser performance. However; the early implementationfailed to address the policy of resource sharing between network protocols; did not permitcoexisting link layers; was evaluated on a limited scope of controlled experiments; andlacked the capability to evolve with evaluation; hindering broad adoption by the sensornetcommunity.

It is especially hardin production settings; where performance overheads of more than a few percent areunacceptable. To address this challenge; we present Arthur; a new debugger that provides arich set of analysis tools at close to zero runtime overhead through selective replay of dataflow applications. Unlike previous replay debuggers; which add high overheads due to theneed to log low-level nondeterministic events; Arthur takes advantage of the structure oflarge-scale data flow models (eg; MapReduce); which split work into deterministic tasks forfault tolerance; to minimize its logging cost.

COPS: Quality of service vs. Any service at all,Randy Katz; George Porter; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; Mel Tsai,Abstract Todays networks are awash in illegitimate traffic: port scans; propagating worms;and illegal peer-to-peer transfers of materials [8]. This “noise” has created such a crescendothat legitimate traffic is starved for network resources. Essential network services; like DNSand remote file systems; are rendered unavailable. The challenge is no longer “quality ofservice” but rather “any service at all”. Techniques must be developed to identify andsegregate traffic into good; bad; and suspicious classes. Quality of Service should nowprotect the good; block the bad; and slow the ugly when the network is under stress of highresource utilization. We discuss the research challenges and outline a possible architecturalapproach: COPS (Checking; Observing; and Protecting Services).

Hold'em or fold'em?: aggregation queries under performance variations,Gautam Kumar; Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Ion Stoica,Abstract Systems are increasingly required to provide responses to queries; even if notexact; within stringent time deadlines. These systems parallelize computations over manyprocesses and aggregate them hierarchically to get the final response (eg.; search enginesand data analytics). Due to large performance variations in clusters; some processes areslower. Therefore; aggregators are faced with the question of how long to wait for outputsfrom processes before combining and sending them upstream. Longer waits increase theresponse quality as it would include outputs from more processes. However; it alsoincreases the risk of the aggregator failing to provide its result by the deadline. This leads toall its results being ignored; degrading response quality. Our algorithm; Cedar; proposes asolution to this quandary of deciding wait durations at aggregators.

Fastlane: making short flows shorter with agile drop notification,David Zats; Anand Padmanabha Iyer; Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Rachit Agarwal; Randy Katz; Ion Stoica; Amin Vahdat,Abstract The drive towards richer and more interactive web content places increasinglystringent requirements on datacenter network performance. Applications running atop thesenetworks typically partition an incoming query into multiple subqueries; and generate thefinal result by aggregating the responses for these subqueries. As a result; a large fraction---as high as 80%---of the network flows in such workloads are short and latency-sensitive. Thespeed with which existing networks respond to packet drops limits their ability to meet high-percentile flow completion time SLOs. Indirect notifications indicating packet drops (eg;duplicates in an end-to-end acknowledgement sequence) are an important limitation to theagility of response to packet drops.

Automating the debugging of datacenter applications with ADDA,Cristian Zamfir; Gautam Altekar; Ion Stoica,Debugging data-intensive distributed applications running in datacenters is complex andtime-consuming because developers do not have practical ways of deterministicallyreplaying failed executions. The reason why building such tools is hard is that non-determinism that may be tolerable on a single node is exacerbated in large clusters ofinteracting nodes; and datacenter applications produce terabytes of intermediate dataexchanged by nodes; thus making full input recording infeasible. We present ADDA; areplay-debugging system for datacenters that has lower recording and storage overheadthan existing systems.

A critical component of meeting these is ensuring thatthe network responds agilely to congestion; bounding network latency and improving high-percentile flow completion times. We propose a new approach to rapidly detecting andresponding to congestion. We introduce FastLane; a congestion signaling mechanism thatallows senders to respond more quickly. By delivering signals to senders with highprobability and low latency; FastLane allows them to retransmit packets sooner; avoidingresource-wasting timeouts. It also enables senders to make more informed decisions bydifferentiating between out-of-order delivery and packet loss.

We argue that this difficulty stems from the API used to access thenetwork. The ubiquitous Sockets API lets applications choose from a number ofcommunication mechanisms; but binds them tightly to their chosen mechanism (egspecifying a destination using IPv4). Applications must therefore be modified in order tobenefit from new network technologies. To address this problem; we propose a newcommunication API called NetAPI that lets applications specify their communication intentswithout binding to particular network mechanisms; enabling evolution below the API.

However; theearly congestion control design decisions were made in a context where loss recovery wasfairly primitive (eg TCP Reno) and often timed-out when more than a few losses occurredand routers were FIFO drop-tail. In subsequent years; there has been significantimprovement in TCP's loss recovery algorithms. For instance; TCP SACK can recover frommany losses without timing out.

Trends and challenges in big data processing,Ion Stoica,Abstract Almost six years ago we started the Spark project at UC Berkeley. Spark is a clustercomputing engine that is optimized for in-memory processing; and unifies support for avariety of workloads; including batch; interactive querying; streaming; and iterativecomputations. Spark is now the most active big data project in the open source community;and is already being used by over one thousand organizations. One of the reasons behindSpark's success has been our early bet on the continuous increase in the memory capacityand the feasibility to fit many realistic workloads in the aggregate memory of typicalproduction clusters. Today; we are witnessing new trends; such as Moore's law slowingdown; and the emergence of a variety of computation and storage technologies; such asGPUs; FPGAs; and 3D Xpoint.

IOLAP: Managing uncertainty for efficient incremental OLAP,Kai Zeng; Sameer Agarwal; Ion Stoica,Abstract The size of data and the complexity of analytics continue to grow along with theneed for timely and cost-effective analysis. However; the growth of computation powercannot keep up with the growth of data. This calls for a paradigm shift from traditional batchOLAP processing model to an incremental OLAP processing model. In this paper; wepropose iOLAP; an incremental OLAP query engine that provides a smooth trade-offbetween query accuracy and latency; and fulfills a full spectrum of user requirements fromapproximate but timely query execution to a more traditional accurate query execution.iOLAP enables interactive incremental query processing using a novel mini-batch executionmodel---given an OLAP query; iOLAP first randomly partitions the input dataset into smallersets (mini-batches) and then incrementally processes through these mini-batches by …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,6

Reducing congestion effects by multipath routing in wireless networks,L Popa; C Raiciu; I Stoica; DS Rosenblum,We propose a solution to improve fairness and increasethroughput in wireless networks withlocation information. Our approach consists of a multipath routing protocol;BiasedGeographical Routing (BGR); and two congestion controlalgorithms; In-NetworkPacket Scatter (IPS) and End-to-EndPacket Scatter (EPS); which leverage BGR to avoid thecongestedareas of the network. BGR achieves good performancewhile incurring acommunication overhead of just 1 byte perdata packet; and has a computational complexitysimilar togreedy geographic routing. IPS alleviates transient congestion bysplitting trafficimmediately before the congested areas. In contrast; EPS alleviates long term congestion bysplitting the flow atthe source; and performing rate control. EPS selects thepathsdynamically; and uses a less aggressive congestion controlmechanism on non …,ICNP'06: Proceedings of the 2006 14th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols; 2006,2006,6
Brief announcement: towards a secure indirection infrastructure,Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Daniel Adkins; Adrian Perrig; Ion Stoica,Abstract Designing a flexible; yet secure communication infrastructure has long been anelusive goal. Most of the proposals that seek to address the problem of flexibility haveopened up the system for new forms of attacks. In this paper; we consider one particularproposal; i3 [2]; a flexible indirection infrastructure that provides natural support for amultitude of communication primitives such as multicast; anycast and mobility. Wesystematically identify the attacks on i3; and propose techniques that address the securityproblems without sacrificing the flexibility that i3 offers.

A simple algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees in the internet,H Abdel-Wahab; Ion Stoica; Florin Sultan; K Wilson,Abstract A central problem in wide-area networks is to efficiently multicast a message to allmembers (hosts) of a target group. One of the most effective methods to multicast a messageis to send the message along the edges of a spanning tree connecting all the members ofthe group. In this paper; we propose a new fully distributed algorithm to build a minimumspanning tree (MST) in a generic communication network. During the execution; thealgorithm maintains a collection of disjoint trees spanning all the group members. Every tree;which initially consists of only one node; independently expands by joining the closest tree;until all of the nodes are connected in a single tree. The resulting communication topology isboth robust (there are no singularities subject to failures) and scalable (every node stores alimited amount of local information that is independent of the size of the network).,Information sciences,1997,6

NetCache: Balancing Key-Value Stores with Fast In-Network Caching,Xin Jin; Xiaozhou Li; Haoyu Zhang; Robert Soulé; Jeongkeun Lee; Nate Foster; Changhoon Kim; Ion Stoica,Abstract We present NetCache; a new key-value store architecture that leverages the powerand flexibility of new-generation programmable switches to handle queries on hot items andbalance the load across storage nodes. NetCache provides high aggregate throughput andlow latency even under highly-skewed and rapidly-changing workloads. The core ofNetCache is a packet-processing pipeline that exploits the capabilities of modernprogrammable switch ASICs to efficiently detect; index; cache and serve hot key-value itemsin the switch data plane. Additionally; our solution guarantees cache coherence withminimal overhead.

Drizzle: Fast and adaptable stream processing at scale,Shivaram Venkataraman; Aurojit Panda; Kay Ousterhout; Michael Armbrust; Ali Ghodsi; Michael J Franklin; Benjamin Recht; Ion Stoica,Abstract Large scale streaming systems aim to provide high throughput and low latency.They are often used to run mission-critical applications; and must be available 24x7. Thussuch systems need to adapt to failures and inherent changes in workloads; with minimalimpact on latency and throughput. Unfortunately; existing solutions require operators tochoose between achieving low latency during normal operation and incurring minimalimpact during adaptation. Continuous operator streaming systems; such as Naiad and Flink;provide low latency during normal execution but incur high overheads during adaptation(eg; recovery); while micro-batch systems; such as Spark Streaming and FlumeJava; adaptrapidly at the cost of high latency during normal operations.

Real-time machine learning: The missing pieces,Robert Nishihara; Philipp Moritz; Stephanie Wang; Alexey Tumanov; William Paul; Johann Schleier-Smith; Richard Liaw; Mehrdad Niknami; Michael I Jordan; Ion Stoica,Abstract Machine learning applications are increasingly deployed not only to servepredictions using static models; but also as tightly-integrated components of feedback loopsinvolving dynamic; real-time decision making. These applications pose a new set ofrequirements; none of which are difficult to achieve in isolation; but the combination of whichcreates a challenge for existing distributed execution frameworks: computation withmillisecond latency at high throughput; adaptive construction of arbitrary task graphs; andexecution of heterogeneous kernels over diverse sets of resources. We assert that a newdistributed execution framework is needed for such ML applications and propose acandidate approach with a proof-of-concept architecture that achieves a 63x performanceimprovement over a state-of-the-art execution framework for a representative application.,Proceedings of the 16th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems,2017,5
Multi-level discovery of deep options,Roy Fox; Sanjay Krishnan; Ion Stoica; Ken Goldberg,Abstract: Augmenting an agent's control with useful higher-level behaviors called optionscan greatly reduce the sample complexity of reinforcement learning; but manually designingoptions is infeasible in high-dimensional and abstract state spaces. While recent work hasproposed several techniques for automated option discovery; they do not scale to multi-levelhierarchies and to expressive representations such as deep networks. We presentDiscovery of Deep Options (DDO); a policy-gradient algorithm that discovers parametrizedoptions from a set of demonstration trajectories; and can be used recursively to discoveradditional levels of the hierarchy.

Cooperative containment of fast scanning worms,Jayanthkumar Kannan; Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker; Randy Katz,Abstract Scanning worms; that spread by probing the IP address space to find vulnerablehosts; are among the most serious threats to Internet security today; as evident by the time-scales of some recent large-scale worm attacks. Only an automatic defense can hope tocontain a carefully designed worm that uses an unknown or a recently-divulgedvulnerability.

In this paper; we argue that the InternetIndirection Infrastructure (i3)—an overlay network architecture that enables users to locateservices and control the path followed by their packets—provides a natural platform forservice composition. We discuss the challenges in implementing service compositions ontop of i3; and suggest several approaches to address these challenges.,Proceedings of ACM Multimedia,2004,4

Evolvability is highly desirable for the Internet; sincecommunication patterns change must faster than the underlying infrastructure.

Developers wish they had a wayto deterministically replay failed executions with little human effort; but unfortunately no suchtool exists today. We see two challenges in replay-based debugging: First; the clusters usedto run datacenter applications consist of many nodes; so the nondeterminism resulting frommultithreaded execution on a single node is compounded by the size of the cluster.

Stabilizing route selection in BGP,Philip Brighten Godfrey; Matthew Caesar; Ian Haken; Yaron Singer; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Route instability is an important contributor to data plane unreliability on the Internet; andalso incurs load on the control plane of routers. In this paper; we study how route selectionschemes can avoid these changes in routes. Specifically; we characterize the tradeoffsbetween interruption rate; our measure of stability; availability of routes; and deviation fromthe network operator's preferred routes. We develop algorithms to lower bound the feasiblepoints in the tradeoff spaces between these three cost metrics. We also propose a newapproach; Stable Route Selection (SRS); which uses flexibility in route selection to improvestability without sacrificing availability; and with a controlled amount of deviation. Our large-scale simulation results show that SRS can significantly improve stability while deviatingonly a small amount from preferred routes. We implement our protocol in a software router …,*,2010,3
An aggregate network abstraction for mobile devices,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; David Zats; Ion Stoica,Mobile devices; as a norm; are equipped with multiple network interfaces; viz. cellular; Wi-Fiand bluetooth; with Wi-Max networks on the horizon. These network interfaces have diverseas well as dynamic characteristics in terms of range; bandwidth and power [3].

Declarative routing: Extensible routing with declarative queries,Boon Thau; Loo Joseph; M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Abstract The Internet's core routing infrastructure; while arguably robust and efficient; hasproven to be difficult to evolve to accommodate the needs of new applications. Priorresearch on this problem has included new hard-coded routing protocols on the one hand;and fully extensible Active Networks on the other. In this paper; we explore a new point inthis design space that aims to strike a better balance between the extensibility androbustness of a routing infrastructure. The basic idea of our solution; which we calldeclarative routing; is to express routing protocols using a database query language. Weshow that our query language is a natural fit for routing; and can express a variety of well-known routing protocols in a compact and clean fashion. We discuss the security of ourproposal in terms of its computational expressive power and language design. Via …,In Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM'05,2005,3
Measurement and Analysis of Ultrapeer-based P2P Search Networks,Boon Thau Loo; Joseph Hellerstein; Ryan Huebsch; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Unstructured Networks have been used extensively in P2P search systems todayprimarily for file sharing. These networks exploit heterogeneity in the network and offloadmost of the query processing load to more powerful nodes. As an alternative to unstructurednetworks; there have been recent proposals for using inverted indexes on structurednetworks for searching. These structured networks; otherwise known as distributed hashtables (DHTs); guarantee recall and are well suited for locating rare items. However; theymay incur significant bandwidth for keyword-based searches. This paper performs ameasurement study of Gnutella; a popular unstructured network used for file sharing. Wefocus primarily on studying Gnutella's search performance and recall; especially in light ofrecent ultrapeer enhancements.

A robust and flexible microeconomic scheduler for parallel computers,Ion Stoica; Alex Pothen,We compare the behavior of a microeconomic scheduler with three commonly usedscheduling policies under a systematically designed set of experiments. We experiment withthree different income distribution policies within the economic scheduling algorithm. Weshow that the other scheduling policies can be considered as limiting cases of themicroeconomic scheduling policy. Our results show that the economic scheduler performsthe best overall; when mutually antagonistic criteria such as system and user response timesan one hand and system utilization on the other hand; are considered.

Evaluating the hyperbolic model on a variety of architectures,Ion Stoica; Florin Sultan; David Keyes,Abstract We illustrate the application of the hyperbolic model; which generalizes standardtwo-parameter dedicated-link models for communication costs in message-passingenvironments; to four distributed-memory architectures: Ethernet NOW; FDDI NOW; IBMSP2; and Intel Paragon. We first evaluate the parameters of the model from simplecommunication patterns. Then overall communication time estimates; which comparefavorably with experimental measurements; are deduced for the message traffic in ascientific application code. For transformational computing on dedicated systems; for whichmessage traffic is describable in terms of a finite number of regular patterns; the model offersa good compromise between the competing objectives of flexibility; tractability; and reliabilityof prediction.,European Conference on Parallel Processing,1996,3
A time-optimal multiple-query nearest-neighbor algorithm on meshes with multiple broadcasting,Ion Stoica,The multiple-query nearest-neighbor (MQNN) problem is stated as follows: given a set S of npoints in plane and a set Q of m (1≤ m≤ n) query points; determine for every point in Q itsclosest neighbor in S. Besides the pure theoretical interest; this problem has many practicalapplications in various areas such as: computer graphics; pattern recognition and imageprocessing. First; this paper proposes a new time-optimal algorithm to solve the all nearest-neighbor (ANN) problem in time on a mesh-connected computer of size. Next; using thisresult in conjunction with the generalized multiple search (GMS) paradigm of Bokka et al. 3;5 we devise a time-optimal algorithm that solves the MQNN problem in time on a mesh withmultiple broadcasting (MMB) of size.,International journal of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence,1995,3
Modeling Communication in Cluster Computing.,Ion Stoica; Florin Sultan; David Keyes,Abstract We introduce a model for communication costs in parallel processing environments;called the\hyperbolic model" that generalizes two-parameter dedicated-link models in ananalytically simple way. The communication system is modeled as a directedcommunication graph in which terminal nodes represent the application processes andinternal nodes; called communication blocks (CBs); re ect the layered structure of theunderlying communication architecture. A CB is characterized by a twoparameter hyperbolicfunction of the message size that represents the service time needed for processing themessage. Rules are given for reducing a communication graph consisting of many CBs toan equivalent two-parameter form; while maintaining a good approximation for the servicetime.

Fast and Accurate Performance Analysis of LTE Radio Access Networks,Anand Padmanabha Iyer; Ion Stoica; Mosharaf Chowdhury; Li Erran Li,Abstract: An increasing amount of analytics is performed on data that is procured in a real-time fashion to make real-time decisions. Such tasks include simple reporting on streams tosophisticated model building. However; the practicality of such analyses are impeded inseveral domains because they are faced with a fundamental trade-off between datacollection latency and analysis accuracy. In this paper; we study this trade-off in the contextof a specific domain; Cellular Radio Access Networks (RAN). Our choice of this domain isinfluenced by its commonalities with several other domains that produce real-time data; ouraccess to a large live dataset; and their real-time nature and dimensionality which makes it anatural fit for a popular analysis technique; machine learning (ML).

A simple ordered and reliable group multicast protocol,Ion Stoica; Ramesh Yerraballi; Ravi Mukkamala,Abstract In this paper; we propose a simple and efficient token-based protocol thatminimizes the {\em delivery-time} while maintaining an acceptable level of reliability. Itguarantees a total order for all delivered messages within a group. The novel feature of theprotocol is the ability to choose the sites within a group from which acknowledgements are tobe received prior to delivery of a message. This choice can be made on a per messagebasis. The paper also discusses the trade-offs involved in choosing a large set ofacknowledgers versus a small set. We analyze the effects of the size of this set on deliverytime; availability; and robustness of the system. We also state and prove the propertiesguaranteed by the protocol.,*,1994,2

Record Placement Based on Data Skew Using Solid State Drives,Jun Suzuki; Shivaram Venkataraman; Sameer Agarwal; Michael Franklin; Ion Stoica,Abstract Integrating a solid state drive (SSD) into a data store is expected to improve its I/Operformance. However; there is still a large difference between the price of an SSD and ahard-disk drive (HDD). One of the methods to offset the increase in cost of consisting devicesis to configure a hybrid system using both devices. In such a system; a common method todecide the placement of data records is based on reference locality; ie; placing thefrequently accessed records in a faster SSD. In this paper; we propose an alternative thatfocuses on data skew by storing records with values that appear less often in an SSD whilethose that do more in an HDD. As we will show; this enhances the performance of fetchingrecords using multi-dimensional indices.

FastLane: Agile Drop Notification for Datacenter Networks,David Zats; Anand P Iyer; Ganesh Ananthanarayanan; Randy H Katz; Ion Stoica; Amin Vahdat,Abstract: The drive towards richer and more interactive web content places increasinglystringent requirements on datacenter networks. The speed with which such networksrespond to packet drops limits their ability to meet high-percentile flow completion timeSLOs. Indirect notifications to packet drops (eg; duplicates in an end-to-endacknowledgment sequence) are an important limitation to the agility of response to packetdrops. We propose FastLane; a new in-network drop notification mechanism. FastLaneenhances switches to send high-priority per-flow drop notifications to sources; thus informingsources as quickly as possible. Consequently; sources can retransmit packets sooner andthrottle transmission rates earlier. Sources also can make better decisions; given moreprecise information and the ability to differentiate between out-of-order delivery and …,*,2013,1

Output-deterministic replay for multicore debugging,Gautam Altekar; Ion Stoica,ABSTRACT Reproducing bugs is hard. Deterministic replay systems aim to address thisproblem; by providing a high-fidelity replica of an original program execution that can berepeatedly executed to zero-in on bugs. Unfortunately; existing replay systems formultiprocessor programs fall short. These systems either incur high overheads; rely onnonstandard multiprocessor hardware; or fail to reliably reproduce executions. Their primarystumbling block is data races–a source of non-determinism that must be captured ifexecutions are to be faithfully reproduced. In this paper; we present ODR–a software-onlyreplay system that reproduces bugs and provides low-overhead multiprocessor recording.The key observation behind ODR is that; for debugging purposes; a replay system does notneed to generate a high-fidelity replica of the original execution.

On the consistency of dht-based routing,Jayanth Kumar Kannan; Matthew Chapman Caesar; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker,ABSTRACT DHT-based routing has been proposed recently in the literature and this newrouting paradigm promises several advantages (eg; decreased state requirement) overconventional routing protocols. However; the robustness of such schemes is questionablegiven the difficulty of maintaining even overlay DHTs on Planetlab. In this work; we seek toaddress this issue head-on by taking the first steps towards a theory of the consistency ofDHT-based routing. We do so by proposing the first fully-decentralized maintenancealgorithm for DHT-based routing and then prove that it guarantees the property of eventualconsistency. We then go on to explore a generalization of DHT-based routing; called arendezvous service; and explain how routing protocols built using a rendezvous service mayoffer better convergence properties as compared to DHT-based routing. Although it is …,*,2007,1
1 Introduction,Ion Stoica,Abstract Today's Internet provides one simple service: best effort datagram delivery. Such aminimalist service allows routers to be stateless; that is; except for the routing state; which ishighly aggregated; routers do not need to maintain any fine grained state about traffic. As aconsequence; today's Internet is both highly scalable and robust. It is scalable becauserouter complexity does not increase in either the number of flows or the number of nodes inthe network; and it is robust because there is little state; if any; to update when a router failsor recovers. The scalability and robustness are two of the most important reasons behind thesuccess of today's Internet.,*,2004,1
Towards a common API for structured peer-to-peer overlays,P Druschel; J Kubiatowicz; I Stoica; F Dabek; B Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we describe an ongoing effort to define common APIs for structuredpeer-to-peer overlays and the key abstractions that can be built on them. In doing so; wehope to facilitate independent innovation in overlay protocols; services; and applications; toallow direct experimental comparisons; and to encourage application development by thirdparties.

Universal internet conference information system,H Abdel-Wahab; Ion Stoica; Florin Sultan,Abstract The Internet Conferencing Information System (ICIS) described in this paper isdeveloped to provide timely information about ongoing computer-supported conferencesthroughout the Internet. ICIS is composed of three major components: Information Server (S);Conference Announcer (A); and Conference Querier (Q). S stores conference information; Asends conference information to S; while Q retrieves the current conference information fromS and makes it available to the user application. The system is designed to be reliable;efficient; and flexible. Reliability is achieved by running multiple well-known S s throughoutthe Internet. Efficiency is achieved by connecting the servers via a minimum-cost spanningtree of TCP connections. Flexibility is achieved by allowing each A or Q to communicate withany server using either UDP or TCP protocols. In addition; ICIS protocols are universal in …,Information sciences,1996,1
Estimating Shared Congestion Among Internet Paths,Weidong Cui; Sridhar Machiraju; Randy H Katz; Ion Stoica,Abstract—Recent work on media streaming has pro-posed to exploit path diversity; ie; theuse of multiple endto-end paths; as a means to obtain better performance. The bestperformance is achieved when the various paths are independent in the sense that the twopaths do not share a Point of Congestion (PoC). However; topologies used in mediastreaming applications do not meet the assumption of Inverted-Y or Y topologies made byprior work on detecting shared PoC. In this paper; we propose a new technique called CD-DJ (Correlating Drops and Delay Jitter) which solves this problem. CD-DJ is better thanearlier solutions for three main reasons. First; CDDJ overcomes the clock synchronizationproblem and can work with most topologies relevant to applications. Second; it providesapplications with an estimate of the fraction of packet drops caused by shared PoCs. This …,*,*,1

Model-Based Value Estimation for Efficient Model-Free Reinforcement Learning,Vladimir Feinberg; Alvin Wan; Ion Stoica; Michael I Jordan; Joseph E Gonzalez; Sergey Levine,Abstract: Recent model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have proposed incorporatinglearned dynamics models as a source of additional data with the intention of reducingsample complexity. Such methods hold the promise of incorporating imagined data coupledwith a notion of model uncertainty to accelerate the learning of continuous control tasks.Unfortunately; they rely on heuristics that limit usage of the dynamics model. We presentmodel-based value expansion; which controls for uncertainty in the model by only allowingimagination to fixed depth. By enabling wider use of learned dynamics models within amodel-free reinforcement learning algorithm; we improve value estimation; which; in turn;reduces the sample complexity of learning.

Ray RLLib: A Composable and Scalable Reinforcement Learning Library,Eric Liang; Richard Liaw; Robert Nishihara; Philipp Moritz; Roy Fox; Joseph Gonzalez; Ken Goldberg; Ion Stoica,Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms involve the deep nesting of distinctcomponents; where each component typically exhibits opportunities for distributedcomputation. Current RL libraries offer parallelism at the level of the entire program;coupling all the components together and making existing implementations difficult toextend; combine; and reuse. We argue for building composable RL components byencapsulating parallelism and resource requirements within individual components; whichcan be achieved by building on top of a flexible task-based programming model. Wedemonstrate this principle by building Ray RLLib on top of Ray and show that we canimplement a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms by composing and reusing a handful ofstandard components. This composability does not come at the cost of performance---in …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.09381,2017,*

ZipG: A Memory-efficient Graph Store for Interactive Queries,Anurag Khandelwal; Zongheng Yang; Evan Ye; Rachit Agarwal; Ion Stoica,Abstract We present ZipG; a distributed memory-efficient graph store for serving interactivegraph queries. ZipG achieves memory efficiency by storing the input graph data using acompressed representation. What differentiates ZipG from other graph stores is its ability toexecute a wide range of graph queries directly on this compressed representation. ZipG canthus execute a larger fraction of queries in main memory; achieving query interactivity. ZipGexposes a minimal API that is functionally rich enough to implement published functionalitiesfrom several industrial graph stores. We demonstrate this by implementing and evaluatinggraph queries from Facebook TAO; LinkBench; Graph Search and several other workloadson top of ZipG. On a single server with 244GB memory; ZipG executes tens of thousands ofqueries from these workloads for raw graph data over half a TB; this leads to an order of …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,*

This defense has been widely and successfully used to protectreturn addresses and stack data; hence; current attacks instead typically corrupt vtable andfunction pointers to subvert a forward edge (an indirect jump or call) in the control-flowgraph. Forward edges can be protected using Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) but; to date; CFIimplementations have been research prototypes; based on impractical assumptions or adhoc; heuristic techniques.

Surviving Failures in Bandwidth-Constrained Datacenters,Ishai Menache; Mosharaf Chowdhury; Pradeepkumar Mani; Dave Maltz; Peter Bodík; Ion Stoica,Abstract Datacenter networks have been designed to tolerate failures of network equipmentand provide sufficient bandwidth. In practice; however; failures and maintenance ofnetworking and power equipment often make tens to thousands of servers unavailable; andnetwork congestion can increase service latency. Unfortunately; there exists an inherenttradeoff between achieving high fault tolerance and reducing bandwidth usage in networkcore; spreading servers across fault domains improves fault tolerance; but requiresadditional bandwidth; while deploying servers together reduces bandwidth usage; but alsodecreases fault tolerance. We present a detailed analysis of a large-scale Web applicationand its communication patterns. Based on that; we propose and evaluate a noveloptimization framework that achieves both high fault tolerance and significantly reduces …,*,2012,*

Router-Transparent Packet Annotations,George Porter; Rodrigo Fonseca; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; Randy H Katz,Abstract Annotations are a mechanism for adding state to packets that is orthogonal to thedata payload. Historically; two ways of adding annotations to packets have been used:overloading reserved bits in the header; and using IP options. In the first case; the amount ofspace available is very limited and difficult to share. In the second case; packets with IPoptions are dropped on many Internet paths. We propose a more general and flexiblemechanism for annotating packets that appends annotations to the end of packets; in the IPpayload. We show that many existing proposals for adding state to packets can exploit thiscommon mechanism for annotations. Our key result is that packets annotated in this wayhave a much higher probability of successful transport across the network than those forwhich IP options have been used.,*,2005,*
The Cost of Inconsistency in DHTs,Shelley Q Zhuang; Ion Stoica; Randy H Katz,Abstract Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) support a hash-table-like lookup interface: given akey; it maps the key onto a node. One of the crucial questions facing DHTs is whetherlookups can route correctly in a dynamic environment where the routing state is inconsistent.The routing state may become inconsistent when a node falsely thinks a failed neighbor isup (false negative); when a node falsely removes a neighbor that is up (false positive); whena new node joins but has not been fully incorporated into the routing state (join hole); andwhen a node leaves and disrupts the routing state (leave recovery). In this paper we analyzethe cost of inconsistency in DHTs. Using the example of Chord; we evaluate the cost of eachtype of inconsistency on lookup performance. We find that the routing invariant has a firstorder impact on the relative cost of different types of inconsistencies. In addition; the cost …,*,2005,*

6 Providing Relative Service Differentiation in SCORE,Ion Stoica,Abstract In this chapter we describe a third application of the DPS technique: implementing alarge spatial granularity network service; called Location Independent Resource Accounting(LIRA); that provides relative service differentiation. Unlike traditional services; such as theGuaranteed service; that are defined on a per flow basis; large spatial granularity servicesare defined over a large number of destinations. A simple example would be to guarantee auser 10 Mbps bandwidth irrespective of where or when the user sends traffic.,*,2004,*

9 Conclusions and Future Work,Ion Stoica,One of the most important reasons behind the overwhelming success of the Internet is the statelessnature of its architecture. The fact that routers do not need to maintain any fine grained informationabout traffic makes the Internet both scalable and robust. However; these advantages come ata price: today's Internet provides only a minimalist service; the best effort datagram delivery. Asthe Internet evolves into a global communication infrastructure that is expected to support a plethoraof new applications such as IP telephony; interactive TV; and e-commerce; the existing best effortservice will no longer be sufficient. As a result; there is an urgent need to provide more powerfulservices such as guaranteed services and flow protection. Over the past decade; there has beenintense research toward achieving this goal. Two classes of solutions have been proposed: thosemaintaining the stateless property of the original Internet (eg; Differentiated Services) …,*,2004,*
8 Prototype Implementation Description,Ion Stoica,Abstract In Chapters 4; 5 and 6 we have presented three applications of our SCORE/DPSsolution to provide scalable services in a network in which core routers maintain no per flowstate. In this chapter; we describe a prototype implementation of our solution. In particular;we have fully implemented the functionalities required to provide guaranteed and flowprotection services. While section 5.5 presents several experimental results; includingoverhead measurements of our prototype; this chapter focuses on the implementationdetails.,*,2004,*
2 Background,Ion Stoica,Abstract Over the past decade; two classes of solutions have been proposed to providebetter network services than the existing best effort service in the Internet: those maintainingthe stateless property of the original Internet (eg; Differentiated Services); and thoserequiring a new stateful architecture (eg; Integrated Services). While stateful solutions canprovide more powerful and flexible services such as per flow guaranteed services; and canachieve higher resource utilization; they are less scalable than stateless solutions.,*,2004,*
4 Providing Flow Protection in SCORE,Ion Stoica,Abstract In this chapter we present the first illustration of our general solution described inChapter 3. The goal is to provide flow protection; which is one of the most desirableenhancements of today's best-effort service. If deployed; flow protection would allow diverseend-to-end congestion control schemes to seamlessly coexist in the Internet; and protectwell behaved traffic against malicious or ill-behaved traffic.,*,2004,*
A Performance Bounds for CSFQ,Ion Stoica,Abstract In this appendix we give the proof of Theorem 1 (Section 4.3. 4). Recall that forsimplicity we make the following assumptions:(1) the fair share α is fixed;(2) there is nobuffering and therefore the drop probability is given by Eq.(4.2); and (3) when a packetarrives; a fraction of that packet equal to the flow's forwarding probability is transmitted. Theproof is based on two intermediate results given in Lemmas 1 and 2; respectively. Lemma 1gives the upper bound for the excess service received by a flow with weight w during anarbitrary time period in which the estimated rate of the flow; as given by Eq.(4.3); does notexceed the flow's fair rate; ie; wα. Similarly; Lemma 2 gives the upper bound for the excessservice received by a flow during an arbitrary period in which the flow's estimated rate isnever smaller than its fair rate.,*,2004,*
B Performance Bounds for Guaranteed Services,Ion Stoica,Abstract Premium service provides the equivalent of a dedicated link of fixed bandwidthbetween edge nodes in a Diffserv network. In such a service; each premium flow has areserved peak rate. In the data plane; ingress nodes police each premium service traffic flowaccording to its peak reservation rate. Inside the Diffserv domain; core routers put theaggregate of all premium traffic into one scheduling queue and service the premium trafficwith strict priority over best effort traffic. In the control plane; a bandwidth broker is used toperform admission control. The idea is that by using very conservative admission controlalgorithms based on worst case analysis; together with peak rate policing at ingress nodesand static priority scheduling at core nodes; it is possible to ensure that all premium servicepackets incur very small queueing delay.,*,2004,*
3 Overview,Ion Stoica,Abstract The main contribution of this dissertation is to provide the first solution that makes itpossible to implement services as powerful and as flexible as the ones implemented by astateful network using a stateless core network architecture. In this chapter; we give anoverview of our solution and present a perspective of how this solution compares to the twomost prominent solutions proposed in the literature to provide better services in the Internet:Integrated Services and Differentiated Services.,*,2004,*
5 Providing Guaranteed Services in SCORE,Ion Stoica,Abstract In the previous chapter we demonstrated that using the SCORE/DPS frameworkmakes it possible to implement a service with a per flow semantic (ie; per flow isolation) in astateless core architecture. In this chapter; we present a second example which shows that itis possible to provide per flow bandwidth and delay guarantees in a core stateless network.We achieve this goal by using the DPS technique to implement the functionalities requiredby the Guaranteed service [93] on both the data and control paths in a SCORE network.,*,2004,*
7 Making SCORE More Robust and Scalable,Ion Stoica,Abstract While SCORE/DPS based solutions are much more scalable and; in the case of fail-stop failures; more robust than their stateful counterparts; they are less scalable and robustthan the stateless solutions. The scalability of the SCORE architecture suffers from the factthat the network core cannot transcend trust boundaries; such as the boundary between twocompeting Internet Service Providers (ISPs). As a result; the high-speed routers on theseboundaries must be stateful edge routers. The lack of robustness is because themalfunctioning of a single edge or core router that inserts erroneous state in the packetheaders could severely impact the performance of an entire SCORE network.,*,2004,*

The Case for a Hybrid P2P Search Infrastructure,Ion Stoica; Joseph M Hellerstein; Boon Thau Loo; Ryan Huebsch,Abstract Popular P2P file-sharing systems like Gnutella and Kazaa use unstructured networkdesigns. These networks typically adopt flooding-based search techniques to locate files.While flooding-based techniques are effective for locating highly replicated items; they arepoorly suited for locating rare items. As an alternative; a wide variety of structured P2Pnetworks such as Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) have been recently proposed. Structurednetworks can efficiently locate rare items; but they incur significantly higher overheads thanunstructured P2P networks for popular files. Through extensive measurements of theGnutella network from multiple vantage points; we argue for a hybrid search solution; wherestructured search techniques are used to index and locate rare items; and floodingtechniques are used for locating highly replicated content. To illustrate; we present …,*,2003,*

A Distributed Waypoint Service Approach to Connect Heterogeneous Internet Address Spaces,TS Eugene Ng; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract—The rapid growth of the Internet has made IPv4 addresses a scarce resource.Today we witness two major trends to get around this problem. The first is to upgrade anddeploy networks using IPv6; the second is to deploy networks using reusable-IPv4addresses. As a result; the Internet is rapidly evolving into a collection of networks ofheterogeneous address spaces. Such development jeopardizes the universal connectivityproperty of the Internet. In this paper; we address the fundamental problem of providingconnectivity in the address-space heterogeneous Internet. The main difficulty is that; withoutIPv4 addresses; IPv6 or reusable-IPv4 hosts simply cannot be reached by IPv4 hosts. Tosolve this problem; we propose a distributed waypoint service called AVES. The key idea isto use IPv4 waypoints (3rd-party network agents) as relays to connect any IPv4 host to an …,*,2001,*
School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh; PA 15213,Ion Stoica; TS Eugene Ng; Hui Zhang,Abstract We propose a new multicast protocol called REUNITE. The key idea of REUNITE isto use recursive unicast trees to implement multicast service. REUNITE does not use class DIP addresses. Instead; both group identification and data forwarding are based on unicast IPaddresses. Compared with existing IP multicast protocols; REUNITE has several uniqueproperties. First; only routers that are acting as multicast tree branching points for a groupneed to keep multicast forwarding state of the group. All other non-branching-point routerssimply forward data packets by unicast routing. In addition; REUNITE can be incrementallydeployed in the sense that it works even if only a subset of the routers implement theprotocol. Furthermore; REUNITE supports load balancing and graceful degradation suchthat when a router does not have resources (forwarding table entry; buffer space …,*,2000,*

This results in atight coupling between the neural network computation and the underlying distributedexecution; which poses a challenge for the implementation of new communication andaggregation strategies. We argue that decoupling the deep learning framework from thedistributed execution framework enables the flexible development of new communicationand aggregation strategies. Furthermore; we argue that Ray [12] provides a flexible set ofdistributed computing primitives that; when used in conjunction with modern deep learninglibraries; enable the implementation of a wide range of gradient aggregation strategiesappropriate for different computing environments.

Swift Regular Expression Matching,Anurag Khandelwal; Rachit Agarwal; Ion Stoica,ABSTRACT Queries involving Regular Expressions (RegEx) have a wide range ofapplications including document stores; bioinformatics and information retrieval. However;efficiently executing RegEx queries over large datasets remains a challenging task. Datascans do not scale well with input size; however; existing techniques that avoid data scans—referred to as “black-box” approaches—offer little or no benefit over data scans for RegEx.The latter typically execute RegEx queries by decomposing the query along operators;computing intermediate results for individual sub-queries (using indexes and/or partial datascans) and combining the intermediate results along respective operators. We analyze theblack-box approach and identify operators for which the execution time of the black-boxapproach can be far from optimal. We then propose Swift; a set of transformations over …,*,*,*

Securing User-controlled Routing Infrastructures,Karthik Lakshminarayanan Daniel Adkins Adrian Perrig; Ion Stoica,Abstract—Designing infrastructures that give untrusted third-parties (such as end-hosts)control over routing is a promising research direction for achieving flexible and efficientcommunication. However; serious concerns remain over the deployment of suchinfrastructures; particularly the new security vulnerabilities they introduce. The flexiblecontrol plane of these infrastructures can be exploited to launch many types of powerfulattacks with little effort. In this paper; we make several contributions towards studyingsecurity issues in forwarding infrastructures (FIs). We present a general model for aforwarding infrastructure; analyze potential security vulnerabilities; and present techniquesto address these vulnerabilities. The main technique that we introduce in this paper is theuse of simple; light-weight; cryptographic constraints on forwarding entries. We show that …,*,*,*
Towards More Robust Internet Protocols,Tom Anderson; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; David Wetherall,Abstract Robustness has long been a central design goal of the Internet. Much of the initialeffort towards robustness focused on the “fail-stop” model; where node failures are completeand easily detectable by other nodes. The Internet is quite robust against such failures;routinely surviving various catastrophes with only limited outages. This robustness is largelydue to the widespread belief in a set of general principles that guide critical design decisionssuch as where to initiate recovery and how to maintain state. However; the Internet remainsextremely vulnerable to more arbitrary failures where; through either error or malice; a nodeissues syntactically correct responses that are not semantically correct. Such failures; someas simple as misconfigured routing state; can seriously undermine the functioning of theInternet. With the Internet playing such a central role in the global telecommunications …,*,*,*

We call this communication primitive as LatencyGradated Overlay; where information consumers self-organize themselves according to theirindividual resource constraints and the latency they are willing to tolerate in receiving theinformation from the source. Such a communication primitive finds immediate use inapplications like RSS feeds aggregation. We propose heuristic algorithms to constructLagOver [7] 1 based on preferably some partial knowledge of the network at users (noknowledge slows the construction process) but no global coordination. The algorithms areevaluated based on simulations and show good characteristics including convergence;satisfying peers' latency and bandwidth constraints even in presence of moderately high …,*,*,*

School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh; PA 15213,TS Eugene Ng; Donpaul C Stephens; Ion Stoica; Hui Zhang,Abstract Packet Fair Queueing (PFQ) algorithms are the most popular and well studiedscheduling algorithms for integrated services networks for two reasons:(1) With reservation;they can provide per-flow end-to-end delay guarantees for real-time traffic flows.(2) Withoutreservation; they can provide protection among competing best-effort flows while allowingdynamic bandwidth sharing. However; PFQ algorithms have two important limitations. Thefirst one is that; since only one parameter (a weight) is used to allocate resource for eachflow; there is a coupling between delay and bandwidth allocation. This can result in networkunder-utilization when real-time flows have diverse delay and bandwidth requirements. Thesecond and less well known limitation is that; due to the instantaneous fairness property ofPFQ algorithms; when used for best-effort service; PFQ algorithms favor continuously …,*,*,*

While the commercial viability of P2P networks is still in doubt; there is noquestion that as a technology for filesharing P2P networks are phenomenally successful:according to a Reuters article; filesharing is at record highs; with users swapping 1.81 billionmedia files via P2P tools in October 2001; up from 1.5 billion in September [?].

One of the main components that directlydetermine the communication bandwidth and the quality of services that are provided arethe communication switches. In this paper; we propose a new scheduling algorithm forservicing the output sessions of a high-speed ATM switch; that is both accurate and e cient.To each session we associate a weight w that represents the share of the communicationbandwidth it should receive. To characterize the allocation accuracy we give bounds for thedi erence (called lag) between the number of time slots that each session should receiveand the number of time slots it actually receives.

Stabilizing BGP; Safely,P Brighten Godfrey; Matthew Caesar; Ian Haken; Yaron Singer; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,ABSTRACT Route instability incurs significant load core routers and is widely recognized asa major contributor to data plane unreliability on the Internet. Route flap damping providessome protection against instability; but introduces pathologies and reduces availability.Concerns about the scalability of the routing system and the increasing prevalence of real-time applications have prompted a renewed interest in stability. We believe it is time for aprincipled approach to stabilizing Internet routing. This paper takes a step towards that goalby characterizing the tradeoff between stability and availability; and between stability anddeviation from preferred routes. We propose a new approach; Stable Route Selection (SRS);which uses flexibility in route selection to improve stability without sacrificing availability. Ourextensive simulation and experimental results show that SRS improves stability and data …,*,*,*

Listen and Whisper: Security Mechanisms for BGP Best Student Paper!,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian; Volker Roth; Ion Stoica; Scott Shenker; Randy H Katz,Abstract BGP; the current inter-domain routing protocol; assumes that the routing informationpropagated by authenticated routers is correct. This assumption renders the currentinfrastructure vulnerable to both accidental misconfigurations and deliberate attacks. Toreduce this vulnerability; we present a combination of two mechanisms: Listen and Whisper.Listen passively probes the data plane and checks whether the underlying routes to differentdestinations work. Whisper uses cryptographic functions along with routing redundancy todetect bogus route advertisements in the control plane. These mechanisms are easilydeployable; and do not rely on either a public key infrastructure or a central authority likeICANN.,*,*,*

Wesystematically identify the attacks on i3; and propose techniques that address the securityproblems without sacrificing the flexibility that i3 offers.

The graphx graph processing system,Daniel Crankshaw; Ankur Dave; Reynold S Xin; Joseph E Gonzalez; Michael J Franklin; Ion Stoica,ABSTRACT The growing scale and importance of graph data has driven the development ofspecialized graph computation engines capable of inferring complex recursive properties ofgraph-structured data. However; these systems are unable to express many of the inherentlydata-parallel stages in a typical graph-analytics pipeline. As a consequence; existing graphanalytics pipelines resort to multiple stages of data-parallel and graph-parallel systemscomposed through external storage systems. Instead; the GraphX abstraction unifies graph-parallel and data-parallel computation in a single system and is capable of succinctlyexpressing the entire graph analytics pipeline. However; implemented naively with relationaloperators it is impractically slow. We describe an implementation of the GraphX abstractionthat encodes graphs as collections of edges and vertices along with simple auxiliary …,UC Berkeley AMPLab,*,*
Taming IP Packet Flooding Attacks,Daniel Adkins Karthik Lakshminarayanan Adrian Perrig; Ion Stoica,One of the vexing problems faced by end-hosts in the Internet is denial-of-service (DoS)caused by IP packet floods. IP packet flooding is possible because end-hosts have nochoice but to receive packets addressed to them. The main thesis of this paper is that end-hosts are in the best position to detect DoS attacks and thus should be given control torespond to such attacks. We present two solutions that achieve the following properties bygiving end-hosts more control over which packets they receive.,*,*,*
CA-94720; USA,Sonesh Surana; Brighten Godfrey; Karthik Lakshminarayanan; Richard Karp; Ion Stoica,Abstract Most P2P systems that provide a DHT abstraction distribute objects randomlyamong" peer nodes" in a way that results in some nodes having Θ (logN) times as manyobjects as the average node. Further imbalance may result due to nonuniform distribution ofobjects in the identifier space and a high degree of heterogeneity in object loads and nodecapacities. Additionally; a node's load may vary greatly over time since the system canexperience continuous insertions and deletions of objects; skewed object arrival patterns;and continuous arrival and departure of nodes. In this paper; we propose an algorithm forload balancing in such heterogeneous; dynamic P2P systems. Our simulation results showthat in the face of rapid arrivals and departures of objects of widely varying load; ouralgorithm improves load balance by more than an order of magnitude for system …,*,*,*
