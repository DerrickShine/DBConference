Sql-on-hadoop: Full circle back to shared-nothing database architectures,Avrilia Floratou; Umar Farooq Minhas; Fatma Özcan,Abstract SQL query processing for analytics over Hadoop data has recently gainedsignificant traction. Among many systems providing some SQL support over Hadoop; Hive isthe first native Hadoop system that uses an underlying framework such as MapReduce orTez to process SQL-like statements. Impala; on the other hand; represents the newemerging class of SQL-on-Hadoop systems that exploit a shared-nothing parallel databasearchitecture over Hadoop. Both systems optimize their data ingestion via columnar storage;and promote different file formats: ORC and Parquet. In this paper; we compare theperformance of these two systems by conducting a set of cluster experiments using a TPC-Hlike benchmark and two TPC-DS inspired workloads. We also closely study the I/O efficiencyof their columnar formats using a set of micro-benchmarks. Our results show that Impala is …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,95
Clash of the titans: MapReduce vs. Spark for large scale data analytics,Juwei Shi; Yunjie Qiu; Umar Farooq Minhas; Limei Jiao; Chen Wang; Berthold Reinwald; Fatma Özcan,Abstract MapReduce and Spark are two very popular open source cluster computingframeworks for large scale data analytics. These frameworks hide the complexity of taskparallelism and fault-tolerance; by exposing a simple programming API to users. In thispaper; we evaluate the major architectural components in MapReduce and Sparkframeworks including: shuffle; execution model; and caching; by using a set of importantanalytic workloads. To conduct a detailed analysis; we developed two profiling tools:(1) Wecorrelate the task execution plan with the resource utilization for both MapReduce andSpark; and visually present this correlation;(2) We provide a break-down of the taskexecution time for in-depth analysis. Through detailed experiments; we quantify theperformance differences between MapReduce and Spark. Furthermore; we attribute …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,77
Remusdb: Transparent high availability for database systems,Umar Farooq Minhas; Shriram Rajagopalan; Brendan Cully; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Kenneth Salem; Andrew Warfield,Abstract In this paper; we present a technique for building a high-availability (HA) databasemanagement system (DBMS). The proposed technique can be applied to any DBMS withlittle or no customization; and with reasonable performance overhead. Our approach isbased on Remus; a commodity HA solution implemented in the virtualization layer; that usesasynchronous virtual machine state replication to provide transparent HA and failovercapabilities. We show that while Remus and similar systems can protect a DBMS; databaseworkloads incur a performance overhead of up to 32% as compared to an unprotectedDBMS. We identify the sources of this overhead and develop optimizations that mitigate theproblems. We present an experimental evaluation using two popular database systems andindustry standard benchmarks showing that for certain workloads; our optimized …,The VLDB Journal,2013,72

Towards expanded trust management for agents in vehicular ad-hoc networks,Umar Farooq Minhas; Jie Zhang; Thomas Tran; Robin Cohen,Abstract: In this paper; we examine the challenge of designing intelligent agents to enablethe sharing of information between vehicles in mobile ad hoc vehicular networks (VANETs).Our focus is on developing a framework that models the trustworthiness of the agents ofother vehicles; in order to receive the most effective reports. We develop a multifaceted trustmodeling framework that incorporates role-based trust; experience-based trust and majority-based trust and that is able to restrict the number of reports that are received. We include analgorithm that proposes how to integrate these various dimensions of trust; along withexperimentation to validate the benefit of our approach; emphasizing the importance of eachof the different facets that are included. In addition; we clarify how our approach is able tomeet various critical challenges for trust modeling in VANETs.

A Multifaceted Approach to Modeling Agent Trust for Effective Communication in the Application of Mobile Ad Hoc Vehicular Networks,Umar Farooq Minhas; Jie Zhang; Thomas Tran; Robin Cohen,An increasingly large number of cars are being equipped with global positioning system andWi-Fi devices; enabling vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication with the goal of providingincreased passenger and road safety. This technology actuates the need for agents thatassist users by intelligently processing the received information. Some of these agents mightbecome self-interested and try to maximize car owners' utility by sending out falseinformation. Given the dire consequences of acting on false information in this context; thereis a serious need to establish trust among agents. The main goal of this paper is then todevelop a framework that models the trustworthiness of the agents of other vehicles; in orderto receive the most effective information. We develop a multifaceted trust modeling approachthat incorporates role-; experience-; priority-; and majority-based trust and this is able to …,Systems; Man; and Cybernetics; Part C: Applications and Reviews; IEEE Transactions on,2011,50
Database systems on virtual machines: How much do you lose?,Umar Farooq Minhas; Jitendra Yadav; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Kenneth Salem,Virtual machine technologies offer simple and practical mechanisms to address manymanageability problems in database systems. For example; these technologies allow forserver consolidation; easier deployment; and more flexible provisioning. Therefore;database systems are increasingly being run on virtual machines. This offers manyopportunities for researchers in self-managing database systems; but it is also important tounderstand the cost of virtualization. In this paper; we present an experimental study of theoverhead of running a database workload on a virtual machine. We show that the averageoverhead is less than 10%; and we present details of the different causes of this overhead.Our study shows that the manageability benefits of virtualization come at an acceptable cost.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008.

A Bayesian approach to online performance modeling for database appliances using Gaussian models,Muhammad Bilal Sheikh; Umar Farooq Minhas; Omar Zia Khan; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Pascal Poupart; David J Taylor,Abstract In order to meet service level agreements (SLAs) and to maintain peak performancefor database management systems (DBMS); database administrators (DBAs) need toimplement policies for effective workload scheduling; admission control; and resourceprovisioning. Accurately predicting response times of DBMS queries is necessary for a DBAto effectively achieve these goals. This task is particularly challenging due to the fact that adatabase workload typically consists of many concurrently running queries and an accuratemodel needs to capture their interactions. Additional challenges are introduced whenDBMSes are run in dynamic cloud computing environments; where workload; data; andphysical resources can change frequently; on-the-fly.

Intelligent agents in mobile vehicular ad-hoc networks: Leveraging trust modeling based on direct experience with incentives for honesty,Umar Farooq Minhas; Jie Zhang; Thomas Tran; Robin Cohen,In this paper we introduce a multi-faceted trust model of use for the application of ad-hocvehicular networks (VANETs)–scenarios where agents representing drivers exchangeinformation with other drivers regarding road and traffic conditions. We argue that there is aneed to model trust in various dimensions and that combining these elements effectively canassist agents in making transportation decisions. We then introduce two new elements to ourproposed model: i) distinguishing direct and indirect reports that are shared ii) employing apenalty for misleading reports; to promote honesty. We demonstrate how these two elementstogether serve to increase the value of the trust model; through a series of experiments ofsimulated traffic. In brief; we present a framework to facilitate the effective sharing ofinformation in VANET environments between agents representing the vehicles.,Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT); 2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on,2010,35
Accordion: Elastic scalability for database systems supporting distributed transactions,Marco Serafini; Essam Mansour; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Kenneth Salem; Taha Rafiq; Umar Farooq Minhas,Abstract Providing the ability to elastically use more or fewer servers on demand (scale outand scale in) as the load varies is essential for database management systems (DBMSes)deployed on today's distributed computing platforms; such as the cloud. This requiressolving the problem of dynamic (online) data placement; which has so far been addressedonly for workloads where all transactions are local to one sever. In DBMSes where ACIDtransactions can access more than one partition; distributed transactions represent a majorperformance bottleneck. Scaling out and spreading data across a larger number of serversdoes not necessarily result in a linear increase in the overall system throughput; becausetransactions that used to access only one server may become distributed. In this paper wepresent Accordion; a dynamic data placement system for partition-based DBMSes that …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,29
Elastic Scale-out for Partition-Based Database Systems,Umar Farooq Minhas; Rui Liu; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Kenneth Salem; Jonathan Ng; Sean Robertson,An important goal for database systems today is to provide elastic scale-out; ie; the ability togrow and shrink processing capacity on demand; with varying load. Database systems aredifficult to scale since they are stateful-they manage a large database; and it is importantwhen scaling to multiple server machines to provide mechanisms so that these machinescan collaboratively manage the database and maintain its consistency. Databasepartitioning is often used to solve this problem; with each server machine being responsiblefor one partition. In this paper; we propose that the flexibility provided by a partitioned;shared nothing parallel database system can be exploited to provide elastic scale-out. Theidea is to start with a small number of server machines that manage all partitions; and toelastically scale out by dynamically adding new server machines and redistributing …,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,28
ATHENA: An Ontology-Driven System for Natural Language Querying over Relational Data Stores,Diptikalyan Saha; Avrilia Floratou; Karthik Sankaranarayanan; Umar Farooq Minhas; Ashish R Mittal; Fatma Ozcan,Abstract In this paper; we present ATHENA; an ontology-driven system for natural languagequerying of complex relational databases. Natural language interfaces to databases enableusers easy access to data; without the need to learn a complex query language; such asSQL. ATHENA uses domain specific ontologies; which describe the semantic entities; andtheir relationships in a domain. We propose a unique two-stage approach; where the inputnatural language query (NLQ) is first translated into an intermediate query language overthe ontology; called OQL; and subsequently translated into SQL. Our two-stage approachallows us to decouple the physical layout of the data in the relational store from thesemantics of the query; providing physical independence. Moreover; ontologies providericher semantic information; such as inheritance and membership relations; that are lost …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,11
Scalable and Highly Available Database Systems in the Cloud,Umar Farooq Minhas,Cloud computing allows users to tap into a massive pool of shared computing resourcessuch as servers; storage; and network. These resources are provided as a service to theusers allowing them to “plug into the cloud” similar to a utility grid. The promise of the cloudis to free users from the tedious and often complex task of managing and provisioningcomputing resources to run applications. At the same time; the cloud brings severaladditional benefits including: a pay-as-you-go cost model; easier deployment ofapplications; elastic scalability; high availability; and a more robust and secureinfrastructure. One important class of applications that users are increasingly deploying inthe cloud is database management systems. Database management systems differ fromother types of applications in that they manage large amounts of state that is frequently …,*,2013,9
A Framework for Modeling Trustworthiness of Users in Mobile Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks and Its Validation through Simulated Traffic Flow,John Finnson; Jie Zhang; Thomas Tran; Umar Minhas; Robin Cohen,Abstract In this paper; we present an approach for modeling user trustworthiness when trafficinformation is exchanged between vehicles in transportation environments. Our multi-faceted approach to trust modeling combines priority-based; role-based and experience-based trust; integrated with a majority consensus model influenced by time and location; foreffective route planning. The proposed representation for the user model is outlined in detail(integrating ontological and propositional elements) and the algorithm for updating trustvalues is presented as well. This trust modeling framework is validated in detail through anextensive simulation testbed that models vehicle route planning. We are able to showdecreased average path time for vehicles when all facets of our trust model are employed inunison.

Promoting effective exchanges between vehicular agents in traffic through transportationoriented trust modeling,Umar Farooq Minhas; Jie Zhang; Thomas Tran; Robin Cohen,ABSTRACT In this paper; we focus on the problem of enabling vehicles in mobile vehicularad-hoc networks (VANETs) to exchange information about traffic and road conditions in away that makes it possible for each agent to assess the trustworthiness of the reportsreceived. In particular; we develop a multi-faceted trust modeling framework that is designedspecifically for VANET contexts; providing for trust modeling that includes reasoning abouttime and location and about agent roles; as part of the overall processing. We demonstratethe value of our trust modeling framework through simulated traffic environments; clarifyingthe importance of distinct elements of our multi-faceted model. In addition; we comment onthe value of our chosen simulation environment towards future research to support moreeffective agent exchanges in VANETs.,Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS) Workshop on Agents in Traffic and Transportation,2010,4
A trust-based framework for vehicular travel with non-binary reports and its validation via an extensive simulation testbed,Robin Cohen; Jie Zhang; John Finnson; Thomas Tran; Umar F Minhas,Abstract In this paper; we offer an algorithm for intelligent decision making about travel pathplanning in mobile vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs); for scenarios where agentsrepresenting vehicles exchange reports about traffic. One challenge that arises is how bestto model the trustworthiness of those traffic reports. To this end; we outline an algorithm foreffectively soliciting; receiving and analyzing the trustworthiness of these reports; to drive avehicle's decision about the path to follow. Distinct from earlier work; we clarify the need forspecifying the conditions under which reports are exchanged and for processing non-binaryreports; culminating in a proposed algorithm to achieve that processing; as part of the trustmodeling and path planning. To validate our approach we then offer a detailed evaluationframework that achieves large scale simulation of traffic; travel and reporting of …,Journal of Trust Management,2014,3
A performance evaluation of database systems on virtual machines,Umar Farooq Minhas,Virtual machine technologies offer simple and practical mechanisms to address manymanageability problems in database systems. For example; these technologies allow forserver consolidation; easier deployment; and more flexible provisioning. Therefore;database systems are increasingly being run on virtual machines. This offers many uniqueopportunities for database research. However; it is also important to understand the cost ofvirtualization. Virtual machine technologies add a layer of indirection between applicationsand the hardware that they use (eg CPU; memory; disk). This added complexity results in aperformance overhead for software systems running in a virtual machine. In this thesis; wepresent an experimental study of the overhead of running a database workload in a virtualmachine. Using a TPC-H workload running on PostgreSQL in a Xen virtual machine …,*,2008,2
Reasoning about user trustworthiness with non-binary advice from peers.,John Finnson; Robin Cohen; Jie Zhang; Thomas T Tran; Umar Farooq Minhas,Abstract. In this paper we outline an approach for reasoning about the trustworthiness ofusers when advice from peers is provided and a majority opinion is central to the overallcalculation. Typically; trust modeling frameworks have reasoned with binary reports frompeers (ie trustworthy or not). In this paper; we illustrate how to do trust modeling whennumeric advice is provided; instead (ie degree of trustworthiness within a continuum). This isdone in the context of a specific application: directing the travel decisions of users with peer-provided traffic reports. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by mapping theaverage time for completing paths in simulated traffic environments when vehicles aremodeling trust using our framework and road reports are shared. We conclude with adiscussion of the value of our approach for other applications as well.,UMAP Workshops,2012,1
Chimera: data sharing flexibility; shared nothing simplicity,Umar Farooq Minhas; David Lomet; Chandramohan A Thekkath,Abstract The current database market is fairly evenly split between shared nothing and datasharing systems. While shared nothing systems are easier to build and scale; data sharingsystems have advantages in load balancing. In this paper we explore adding data sharingfunctionality as an extension to a shared nothing database system. Our approach isolatesthe data sharing functionality from the rest of the system and relies on well-studied; robusttechniques to provide the data sharing extension. This reduces the difficulty in providingdata sharing functionality; yet provides much of the flexibility of a data sharing system. Wepresent the design and implementation of Chimera--a hybrid database system; targeted atload balancing for many workloads; and scale-out for read-mostly workloads.
