Neural basis of global resting-state fMRI activity,Marieke L Schölvinck; Alexander Maier; Q Ye Frank; Jeff H Duyn; David A Leopold,Abstract Functional MRI (fMRI) has uncovered widespread hemodynamic fluctuations in thebrain during rest. Recent electroencephalographic work in humans and microelectroderecordings in anesthetized monkeys have shown this activity to be correlated with slowchanges in neural activity. Here we report that the spontaneous fluctuations in the local fieldpotential (LFP) measured from a single cortical site in monkeys at rest exhibit widespread;positive correlations with fMRI signals over nearly the entire cerebral cortex. This correlationwas especially consistent in a band of upper gamma-range frequencies (40–80 Hz); forwhich the hemodynamic signal lagged the neural signal by 6–8 s. A strong; positivecorrelation was also observed in a band of lower frequencies (2–15 Hz); albeit with a lagcloser to zero. The global pattern of correlation with spontaneous fMRI fluctuations was …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2010,493
Stable perception of visually ambiguous patterns,David A Leopold; Melanie Wilke; Alexander Maier; Nikos K Logothetis,Abstract During the viewing of certain patterns; widely known as ambiguous or puzzlefigures; perception lapses into a sequence of spontaneous alternations; switching every fewseconds between two or more visual interpretations of the stimulus. Although their natureand origin remain topics of debate; these stochastic switches are generally thought to be theautomatic and inevitable consequence of viewing a pattern without a unique solution. Wereport here that in humans such perceptual alternations can be slowed; and even brought toa standstill; if the visual stimulus is periodically removed from view. We also show; with avisual illusion; that this stabilizing effect hinges on perceptual disappearance rather than onactual removal of the stimulus. These findings indicate that uninterrupted subjectiveperception of an ambiguous pattern is required for the initiation of the brain-state changes …,Nature neuroscience,2002,356
Divergence of fMRI and neural signals in V1 during perceptual suppression in the awake monkey,Alexander Maier; Melanie Wilke; Christopher Aura; Charles Zhu; Q Ye Frank; David A Leopold,Abstract The role of primary visual cortex (V1) in determining the contents of perception iscontroversial. Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of perceptualsuppression have revealed a robust drop in V1 activity when a stimulus is subjectivelyinvisible. In contrast; monkey single-unit recordings have failed to demonstrate suchperception-locked changes in V1. To investigate the basis of this discrepancy; we measuredboth the blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) response and several electrophysiologicalsignals in two behaving monkeys. We found that all signals were in good agreement duringconventional stimulus presentation; showing strong visual modulation to presentation andremoval of a stimulus. During perceptual suppression; however; only the BOLD responseand the low-frequency local field potential (LFP) power showed decreases; whereas the …,Nature neuroscience,2008,245
Layer-specific entrainment of gamma-band neural activity by the alpha rhythm in monkey visual cortex,Eelke Spaak; Mathilde Bonnefond; Alexander Maier; David A Leopold; Ole Jensen,Summary Although the mammalian neocortex has a clear laminar organization; layer-specific neuronal computations remain to be uncovered. Several studies suggest thatgamma band activity in primary visual cortex (V1) is produced in granular and superficiallayers and is associated with the processing of visual input [1–3]. Oscillatory alpha bandactivity in deeper layers has been proposed to modulate neuronal excitability associatedwith changes in arousal and cognitive factors [4–7]. To investigate the layer-specificinterplay between these two phenomena; we characterized the coupling between alpha andgamma band activity of the local field potential in V1 of the awake macaque. Usingmulticontact laminar electrodes to measure spontaneous signals simultaneously from alllayers of V1; we found a robust coupling between alpha phase in the deeper layers and …,Current Biology,2012,148
Distinct superficial and deep laminar domains of activity in the visual cortex during rest and stimulation,Alexander Maier; Geoffrey K Adams; Christopher Aura; David A Leopold,Spatial patterns of spontaneous neural activity at rest have previously been associated withspecific networks in the brain; including those pertaining to the functional architecture of theprimary visual cortex (V1). However; despite the prominent anatomical differences betweencortical layers; little is known about the laminar pattern of spontaneous activity in V1. Weaddress this topic by investigating the amplitude and coherence of ongoing local fieldpotential (LFP) signals measured from different layers in V1 of macaque monkeys duringrest and upon presentation of a visual stimulus in the receptive field. We used a linearmicroelectrode array to measure LFP signals at multiple; evenly spaced positionsthroughout the cortical thickness. Analyzing both the mean LFP amplitudes and between-contact LFP coherences; we identified two distinct zones of activity; roughly …,Frontiers in systems neuroscience,2010,141
Perception of temporally interleaved ambiguous patterns,Alexander Maier; Melanie Wilke; Nikos K Logothetis; David A Leopold,Abstract Background: Continuous viewing of ambiguous patterns is characterized bywavering perception that alternates between two or more equally valid visual solutions.However; when such patterns are viewed intermittently; either by repetitive presentation orby periodic closing of the eyes; perception can become locked or “frozen” in oneconfiguration for several minutes at a time. One aspect of this stabilization is the possibleexistence of a perceptual memory that persists during periods in which the ambiguousstimulus is absent. Here; we use a novel paradigm of temporally interleaved ambiguousstimuli to explore the nature of this memory; with particular regard to its potential impact onperceptual organization. Results: We found that the persistence of a perceptualconfiguration was robust to interposed visual patterns; and; further; that at least three …,Current Biology,2003,104
Ongoing physiological processes in the cerebral cortex,David A Leopold; Alexander Maier,Abstract Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed that the human brainundergoes prominent; regional hemodynamic fluctuations when a subject is at rest. Theseongoing fluctuations exhibit distinct patterns of spatiotemporal synchronization that havebeen dubbed “resting state functional connectivity”; and which currently serve as a principaltool to investigate neural networks in the normal and pathological human brain. Despite thewide application of this approach in human neuroscience; the neural mechanisms that giverise to spontaneous fMRI correlations are largely unknown. Here we review results of recentelectrophysiological studies in the cerebral cortex of humans and nonhuman primates thatlink neural activity to ongoing fMRI fluctuations. We begin by describing results obtained withsimultaneous fMRI and electrophysiological measurements that allow for the identification …,*,2012,89
Single-trial evoked potential estimation using wavelets,Zhisong Wang; Alexander Maier; David A Leopold; Nikos K Logothetis; Hualou Liang,Abstract In this paper we present conventional and translation-invariant (TI) wavelet-basedapproaches for single-trial evoked potential estimation based on intracortical recordings. Wedemonstrate that the wavelet-based approaches outperform several existing methodsincluding the Wiener filter; least mean square (LMS); and recursive least squares (RLS); andthat the TI wavelet-based estimates have higher SNR and lower RMSE than theconventional wavelet-based estimates. We also show that multichannel averagingsignificantly improves the evoked potential estimation; especially for the wavelet-basedapproaches. The excellent performances of the wavelet-based approaches for extractingevoked potentials are demonstrated via examples using simulated and experimental data.,Computers in Biology and Medicine,2007,69
Infragranular sources of sustained local field potential responses in macaque primary visual cortex,Alexander Maier; Christopher J Aura; David A Leopold,A local field potential (LFP) response can be measured throughout the visual cortex inresponse to the abrupt appearance of a visual stimulus. Averaging LFP responses to manystimulus presentations isolates transient; phase-locked components of the response that areconsistent from trial to trial. However; stimulus responses are also composed of sustainedcomponents; which differ in their phase from trial to trial and therefore must be evaluatedusing other methods; such as computing the power of the response of each trial beforeaveraging. Here; we investigate the basis of phase-locked and non-phase-locked LFPresponses in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey using a novel variant ofcurrent source density (CSD) analysis. We applied a linear array of electrode contactsspanning the thickness of the cortex to measure the LFP and compute band-limited CSD …,Journal of Neuroscience,2011,59
Context-dependent perceptual modulation of single neurons in primate visual cortex,Alexander Maier; Nikos K Logothetis; David A Leopold,Abstract Some neurons in the visual cortex alter their spiking rate according to theperceptual interpretation of an observed stimulus; rather than its physical structure alone.Experiments in monkeys have suggested that; although the proportion of neurons showingthis effect differs greatly between cortical areas; this proportion remains similar acrossdifferent stimuli. These findings have raised the intriguing questions of whether the sameneurons always participate in the disambiguation of sensory patterns and whether suchneurons might represent a special class of cortical cells that relay perceptual signals tohigher cortical areas. Here we explore this question by measuring activity in the middletemporal cortex of monkeys and asking to what degree the percept-related responses ofindividual neurons depend upon the specific sensory input. In contrast to our expectations …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2007,33
Global competition dictates local suppression in pattern rivalry,Alexander Maier; Nikos K Logothetis; David A Leopold,Abstract Certain pairs of visual patterns; when superimposed as if transparent; elicit awavering percept in which one or the other pattern can enjoy temporary periods of exclusivevisibility. This multistable perceptual phenomenon is called monocular rivalry or patternrivalry (PR) and is most pronounced when the component patterns are faint and devoid ofdetail. The principal mechanisms that give rise to PR continue to be a topic of speculation. Inthe present study; we examine the determinants of exclusive dominance during PR using anovel stimulus in which a central portion is free of conflict. By observing the properties ofsuppression in this so-called rivalry-free region; we demonstrate that perception is drivenlargely by the global and holistic interpretation of the patterns; rather than by the need toresolve local spatial conflict. The suppression of this central region was often complete …,Journal of Vision,2005,33
Microcircuitry of agranular frontal cortex: testing the generality of the canonical cortical microcircuit,David C Godlove; Alexander Maier; Geoffrey F Woodman; Jeffrey D Schall,We investigated whether a frontal area that lacks granular layer IV; supplementary eye field;exhibits features of laminar circuitry similar to those observed in primary sensory areas. Wereport; for the first time; visually evoked local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activityrecorded simultaneously across all layers of agranular frontal cortex using linear electrodearrays. We calculated current source density from the LFPs and compared the laminarorganization of evolving sinks to those reported in sensory areas. Simultaneous; transientsynaptic current sinks appeared first in layers III and V followed by more prolonged currentsinks in layers I/II and VI. We also found no variation of single-or multi-unit visual responselatency across layers; and putative pyramidal neurons and interneurons displayed similarresponse latencies. Many units exhibited pronounced discharge suppression that was …,Journal of Neuroscience,2014,27
Receptive field focus of visual area V4 neurons determines responses to illusory surfaces,Michele A Cox; Michael C Schmid; Andrew J Peters; Richard C Saunders; David A Leopold; Alexander Maier,Abstract Illusory figures demonstrate the visual system's ability to infer surfaces underconditions of fragmented sensory input. To investigate the role of midlevel visual area V4 invisual surface completion; we used multielectrode arrays to measure spiking responses totwo types of visual stimuli: Kanizsa patterns that induce the perception of an illusory surfaceand physically similar control stimuli that do not. Neurons in V4 exhibited stronger andsometimes rhythmic spiking responses for the illusion-promoting configurations comparedwith controls. Moreover; this elevated response depended on the precise alignment of theneuron's peak visual field sensitivity (receptive field focus) with the illusory surface itself.Neurons whose receptive field focus was over adjacent inducing elements; less than 1.5away; did not show response enhancement to the illusion. Neither receptive field sizes …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2013,27
Measuring subjective visual perception in the nonhuman primate,David Leopold; Alexander Maier; Nikos K Logothetis,Understanding how activity in the brain leads to a subjective percept is of great interest tophilosophers and neuroscientists alike. In the last years; neurophysiological experimentshave approached this problem directly by measuring neural signals in animals as theyexperience well-defined visual percepts. Stimuli in these studies are often inherentlyambiguous; and thus rely upon the subjective report; generally from trained monkeys; toprovide a measure of perception. By correlating activity levels in the brain to this report; onecan speculate on the role of individual neurons and groups of neurons in the formation andmaintenance of a particular percept. However; in order to draw valid conclusions from suchexperiments; it is critical that the responses accurately and reliably reflect what is perceived.For this reason; a number of behavioural paradigms have been developed to control and …,Journal of Consciousness Studies,2003,26
13 Binocular Rivalry and the Illusion of Monocular Vision,David A Leopold; Alexander Maier; Melanie Wilke; Nikos K Logothetis,A primate's visual impression of the world is shaped by highly refined cortical mechanismsfor registering and interpreting images cast on the retinas. The act of seeing is normally soefficient and effortless that one seldom considers the inherent difficulty in the process. Theeyes and brain; presented with a two-dimensional image of light; dark; and color; mustextract the structure and spatial relationships of objects from which illuminating light isreflected. In particular; the visual cortex is thought to employ diverse stages of processingthat together integrate the detection of sensory motifs in a scene with mechanisms thatactively interpret and understand the physical structures from which they arise. Interestingly;among these multiple levels of representation; some of the neural elements critical insecuring robust perception are not themselves enlightened as to the ultimate percept.,*,1998,26
Spontaneous neural dynamics and multi-scale network organization,Brett L Foster; Biyu J He; Christopher J Honey; Karim Jerbi; Alexander Maier; Yuri B Saalmann,Spontaneous neural activity has historically been viewed as task-irrelevant noise that shouldbe controlled for via experimental design; and removed through data analysis. However;electrophysiology and functional MRI studies of spontaneous activity patterns; which havegreatly increased in number over the past decade; have revealed a close correspondencebetween these intrinsic patterns and the structural network architecture of functional braincircuits. In particular; by analyzing the large-scale covariation of spontaneous hemodynamicactivity; researchers are able to reliably identify functional networks in the human brain.Subsequent work has sought to identify the corresponding neural signatures viaelectrophysiological measurements; as this would elucidate the neural origin ofspontaneous hemodynamic dynamics; and would reveal the temporal dynamics of these …,Frontiers in systems neuroscience,2016,23
Locally measured neuronal correlates of functional MRI signals,Amir Shmuel; Alexander Maier,Abstract Functional brain imaging techniques; such as functional MRI (fMRI); are commonlyemployed to estimate local changes in neuronal activity in response to stimuli orexperimental tasks. However; fMRI signals are not direct measures of neuronal activity suchas spikes or dendritic potentials. Instead; fMRI is used to infer changes in neuronal activitybased on local metabolic and blood-based (hemodynamic) responses via intermediaryprocesses such as neurovascular coupling and MRI contrast. This chapter reviews currentconcepts on the neuronal basis of fMRI signals. Although the exact relationship between thefMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal and local neural activity remains atopic of ongoing research; there is a consensus among existing studies that gradedincreases in neuronal responses result in a monotonous increase in metabolic and …,*,2015,23
Single-trial classification of bistable perception by integrating empirical mode decomposition; clustering; and support vector machine,Zhisong Wang; Alexander Maier; Nikos K Logothetis; Hualou Liang,Abstract We propose an empirical mode decomposition (EMD-) based method to extractfeatures from the multichannel recordings of local field potential (LFP); collected from themiddle temporal (MT) visual cortex in a macaque monkey; for decoding its bistable structure-from-motion (SFM) perception. The feature extraction approach consists of three stages.First; we employ EMD to decompose nonstationary single-trial time series into narrowbandcomponents called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with time scales dependent on the data.Second; we adopt unsupervised K-means clustering to group the IMFs and residues intoseveral clusters across all trials and channels. Third; we use the supervised common spatialpatterns (CSP) approach to design spatial filters for the clustered spatiotemporal signals. Weexploit the support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the extracted features to decode …,EURASIP journal on advances in signal processing,2008,21
Beta oscillation dynamics in extrastriate cortex after removal of primary visual cortex,Joscha T Schmiedt; Alexander Maier; Pascal Fries; Richard C Saunders; David A Leopold; Michael C Schmid,The local field potential (LFP) in visual cortex is typically characterized by the followingspectral pattern: before the onset of a visual stimulus; low-frequency oscillations (beta; 12–20 Hz) dominate; whereas during the presentation of a stimulus these oscillations diminishand are replaced by fluctuations at higher frequencies (gamma;> 30 Hz). The origin of betaoscillations in vivo remains unclear; as is the basis of their suppression during visualstimulation. Here we investigate the contribution of ascending input from primary visualcortex (V1) to beta oscillation dynamics in extrastriate visual area V4 of behaving monkeys.We recorded LFP activity in V4 before and after resecting a portion of V1. After the surgery;the visually induced gamma LFP activity in the lesion projection zone of V4 was markedlyreduced; consistent with previously reported spiking responses (Schmid et al.; 2013).

Multisensory response modulation in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus,Dipanwita Ghose; Alexander Maier; Aaron Nidiffer; Mark T Wallace,The mammalian superior colliculus (SC) is made up of seven distinct layers. Based onoverall differences in neuronal morphology; afferent and efferent projection patterns;physiological properties; and presumptive behavioral role; the upper three layers have beenclassically grouped together as the superficial layers and the remaining four layerscollectively make up the deep layers. Although the superficial layers receive their primaryinputs from the retina and primary visual cortex; the deep layers receive inputs fromextrastriate visual cortical areas and from auditory; somatosensory; and motor-relatedstructures. In contrast; there is no evidence of monosynaptic nonvisual inputs to thesuperficial layers. However; more recent studies have revealed anatomical connectionsbetween the superficial and deep layers; thus providing the substrate for possible …,Journal of Neuroscience,2014,14

Microcircuitry of agranular frontal cortex: contrasting laminar connectivity between occipital and frontal areas,Taihei Ninomiya; Kacie Dougherty; David C Godlove; Jeffrey D Schall; Alexander Maier,Neocortex is striking in its laminar architecture. Tracer studies have uncovered anatomicalconnectivity among laminae; but the functional connectivity between laminar compartmentsis still largely unknown. Such functional connectivity can be discerned through spontaneousneural correlations during rest. Previous work demonstrated a robust pattern of mesoscopicresting-state connectivity in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) through interlaminar cross-frequency coupling. Here we investigated whether this pattern generalizes to other corticalareas by comparing resting-state laminar connectivity between V1 and the supplementaryeye field (SEF); a frontal area lacking a granular layer 4 (L4). Local field potentials (LFPs)were recorded with linear microelectrode arrays from all laminae of granular V1 andagranular SEF while monkeys rested in darkness. We found substantial differences in the …,Journal of Neurophysiology,2015,13
Motion-sensitive responses in visual area V4 in the absence of primary visual cortex,Michael C Schmid; Joscha T Schmiedt; Andrew J Peters; Richard C Saunders; Alexander Maier; David A Leopold,Neurons in cortical ventral-stream area V4 are thought to contribute to important aspects ofvisual processing by integrating information from primary visual cortex (V1). However; howV4 neurons respond to visual stimulation after V1 injury remains unclear: Whileelectrophysiological investigation of V4 neurons during reversible V1 inactivation suggeststhat virtually all responses are eliminated (Girard et al.; 1991); fMRI in humans and monkeyswith permanent lesions shows reliable V1-independent activity (Baseler et al.; 1999; Goebelet al.; 2001; Schmid et al.; 2010). To resolve this apparent discrepancy; we longitudinallyassessed neuronal functions of macaque area V4 using chronically implanted electrodearrays before and after creating a permanent aspiration lesion in V1. During the month afterlesioning; we observed weak yet significant spiking activity in response to stimuli …,Journal of Neuroscience,2013,13
Ongoing alpha activity in V1 regulates visually driven spiking responses,Kacie Dougherty; Michele A Cox; Taihei Ninomiya; David A Leopold; Alexander Maier,Abstract The interlaminar connections in the primate primary visual cortex (V1) are welldescribed; as is the presence of ongoing alpha-range (7–14 Hz) fluctuations in this area.Less well understood is how these interlaminar connections and ongoing fluctuationscontribute to the regulation of visual spiking responses. Here; we investigate the relationshipbetween alpha fluctuations and spiking responses to visual stimuli across cortical layers.Using laminar probes in macaque V1; we show that neural firing couples with the phase ofalpha fluctuations; and that magnitude of this coupling is particularly pronounced duringvisual stimulation. The strongest modulation of spiking activity was observed in layers 2/3.Alpha-spike coupling and current source density analysis pointed to an infragranular originof the alpha fluctuations. Taken together; these results indicate that ongoing infragranular …,Cerebral Cortex,2017,10
Neuroimaging: perception at the brain's core,David A Leopold; Alexander Maier,How can activity in the brain possibly give rise to our subjective experience? This question canbe traced back at least to René Descartes; the father of modern philosophy who lived in the 17thcentury. In his Treatise on Man [1]; Descartes hypothesized that a percept arises when a sensorystimulus impresses upon the pineal gland; which communicates directly with the soul (Figure1A; soul not shown). In explaining his choice of the pineal gland; the only unpaired structurein the brain he could identify; he appealed to the unity of perception: “Since we see only onething with two eyes; … it must necessarily be the case that the impressions which enter by thetwo eyes…unite with each other in some part of the body before being considered by thesoul” [2] … Figure 1.

To see or not to see–Thalamo-cortical networks during blindsight and perceptual suppression,Michael C Schmid; Alexander Maier,Abstract Even during moments when we fail to be fully aware of our environment; our brainsnever go silent. Instead; it appears that the brain can also operate in an alternate;unconscious mode. Delineating unconscious from conscious neural processes is apromising first step toward investigating how awareness emerges from brain activity. Herewe focus on recent insights into the neuronal processes that contribute to visual function inthe absence of a conscious visual percept. Drawing on insights from findings on thephenomenon of blindsight that results from injury to primary visual cortex and the results ofexperimentally induced perceptual suppression; we describe what kind of visual informationthe visual system analyzes unconsciously and we discuss the neuronal routing andresponses that accompany this process. We conclude that unconscious processing of …,*,2015,6
Single-trial decoding of bistable perception based on sparse nonnegative tensor decomposition,Zhisong Wang; Alexander Maier; Nikos K Logothetis; Hualou Liang,The study of the neuronal correlates of the spontaneous alternation in perception elicited bybistable visual stimuli is promising for understanding the mechanism of neural informationprocessing and the neural basis of visual perception and perceptual decision-making. In thispaper; we develop a sparse nonnegative tensor factorization-(NTF)-based method to extractfeatures from the local field potential (LFP); collected from the middle temporal (MT) visualcortex in a macaque monkey; for decoding its bistable structure-from-motion (SFM)perception. We apply the feature extraction approach to the multichannel time-frequencyrepresentation of the intracortical LFP data. The advantages of the sparse NTF-basedfeature extraction approach lies in its capability to yield components common across thespace; time; and frequency domains yet discriminative across different conditions without …,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2008,6
Serial versus parallel processing in mid-level vision: filling-in the details of spatial interpolation,Michele A Cox; Alexander Maier,Abstract The relationship between boundary completion and surface filling-in; two coremechanisms of mid-level vision; remains unclear. Here; we integrate recent empiricalfindings to shine new light onto the neural mechanisms of boundary completion and surfacefilling-in as well as their relation to each other. Specifically; we discuss severalpsychophysical and neurophysiological studies that; when taken together; support a modelwhere object boundaries and visual surfaces are interpolated in parallel; with one processimpacting the other. We suggest that visual boundary completion and surface filling-in aretwo interacting processes that are supported by neural processes that are distributedthroughout several areas of the early visual system.,Neuroscience of Consciousness,2015,5
Extraction of bistable-percept-related features from local field potential by integration of local regression and common spatial patterns,Zhisong Wang; Alexander Maier; Nikos K Logothetis; Hualou Liang,Bistable perception arises when an ambiguous stimulus under continuous view is perceivedas an alternation of two mutually exclusive states. Such a stimulus provides a uniqueopportunity for understanding the neural basis of visual perception because it dissociatesthe perception from the visual input. In this paper; we focus on extracting the percept-relatedfeatures from the local field potential (LFP) in monkey visual cortex for decoding its bistablestructure-from-motion (SFM) perception. Our proposed feature extraction approach consistsof two stages. First; we estimate and remove from each LFP trial the nonpercept-relatedstimulus-evoked activity via a local regression method called the locally weighted scatterplotsmoothing because of the dissociation between the perception and the stimulus in ourexperimental paradigm. Second; we use the common spatial patterns approach to design …,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,2009,5
Relaxation-based feature selection for single-trial decoding of bistable perception,Zhisong Wang; Alexander Maier; Nikos K Logothetis; Hualou Liang,Bistable perception refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously alternating percepts whileviewing the same stimulus continuously. Bistable stimuli allow dissociation between stimuliand perception; and thus; provide a unique opportunity for understanding the neural basis ofvisual perception. In this paper; we focus on a relaxation (RELAX) based algorithm to selectfeatures from the multitaper spectral estimates of the multichannel intracortical local fieldpotential (LFP); simultaneously collected from the middle temporal visual cortex of amacaque monkey; for decoding its bistable structure-from-motion (SFM) perception. Wedemonstrate that RELAX surpasses the conventional sequential forward selection (SFS) byoffering the flexibility of modifying selected features. We propose a redundancy reductionpreprocessing technique to significantly reduce the computational load for both SFS and …,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,2009,5
Sustained perceptual invisibility of solid shapes following contour adaptation to partial outlines,MA Cox; KA Lowe; R Blake; A Maier,Abstract Contour adaptation (CA) is a recently described paradigm that renders otherwisesalient visual stimuli temporarily perceptually invisible. Here we investigate whether thisillusion can be exploited to study visual awareness. We found that CA can induce secondsof sustained invisibility following similarly long periods of uninterrupted adaptation.Furthermore; even fragmented adaptors are capable of producing CA; with the strength ofCA increasing monotonically as the adaptors encompass a greater fraction of the stimulusoutline. However; different types of adaptor patterns; such as distinctive shapes or illusorycontours; produce equivalent levels of CA suggesting that the main determinants of CA arelow-level stimulus characteristics; with minimal modulation by higher-order visual processes.Taken together; our results indicate that CA has desirable properties for studying visual …,Consciousness and cognition,2014,4

Relaxation-based multichannel signal combination (RELAX-MUSIC) for ROC analysis of percept-related neuronal activity,Zhisong Wang; Alexander Maier; David A Leopold; Hualou Liang,In this letter; we consider how to combine neuronal signals from multiple electrodes tooptimally predict behavioral choices from observed neural activity. The predictability is oftenquantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; also calledchoice probability (CP) in neurophysiology. We exploit a distribution-free relaxation basedmultichannel signal combination (RELAX-MUSIC) approach that requires only simplepairwise combination and recursive implementation for optimizing the area under the ROCcurve. A permutation test is employed to assess the statistical significance of the derived CP.We demonstrate that the RELAX-MUSIC approach outperforms the commonly usedresponse pooling and Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) methods.

Neural activity during stable perception of ambiguous displays in monkey visual cortex,A Maier; DA Leopold; NK Logothetis,Abstract Multistable perception is generally considered to be the inevitable consequence ofprolonged inspection of ambiguous displays. We have recently demonstrated that in humanobservers perceptual alternation can be strongly retarded; and in some cases nearlyeliminated; when the inducing pattern is perceived intermittently rather than continuously(Leopold et al.; Nat. Neurosci. 2002). The present study extends these results to themacaque monkey (macaca mulatta); and examines what types of neural mechanisms mightunderlie such stabilization. We recorded broad-band signals with multiple electrodes fromthe early visual areas of a rhesus monkey trained to report his percepts during perceptualrivalry. Ambiguous patterns were presented intermittently with “on” and “off” periods eachlasting 1-5 seconds. Given our previous finding that under these conditions perception of …,32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience (Neuroscience 2002),2002,4
Correlated activity of cortical neurons survives extensive removal of feedforward sensory input,Katharine A Shapcott; Joscha T Schmiedt; Richard C Saunders; Alexander Maier; David A Leopold; Michael C Schmid,Abstract A fundamental property of brain function is that the spiking activity of corticalneurons is variable and that some of this variability is correlated between neurons.Correlated activity not due to the stimulus arises from shared input but the neuronal circuitmechanisms that result in these noise correlations are not fully understood. Here we testedin the visual system if correlated variability in mid-level area V4 of visual cortex is alteredfollowing extensive lesions of primary visual cortex (V1). To this end we recordedlongitudinally the neuronal correlations in area V4 of two behaving macaque monkeysbefore and after a V1 lesion while the monkeys fixated a grey screen. We found that thecorrelations of neuronal activity survived the lesions in both monkeys.

We focus on studies of ongoing local field potential (LFP) dataobtained simultaneously from multiple sites in the primary visual cortex in two types ofexperiments in which electrode contacts were spaced either along the cortical surface or atdifferent laminar positions. These studies demonstrate that across both dimensions thecoherence of ongoing LFP fluctuations diminishes as a function of interelectrode distance;although the nature and spatial scale of this falloff is very different. Along the cortical surface;the overall LFP coherence declines gradually and continuously away from a given …,Eye and brain,2014,2
Neuronal activity in area MT during perceptual stabilization of ambiguous structure-from-motion,Naotsugu Tsuchiya; Alexander Maier; Nikos Logothetis; David Leopold,Abstract During continuous viewing of an ambiguous display; perception spontaneouslyalternates between two alternative interpretations of the stimulus. Such perceptualalternation can be greatly slowed down all the way to a standstill if the stimulus isperiodically removed from view; a phenomenon called 'perceptual stabilization'(Leopold etal NatNeuro 2002). While brain activity during perceptual switches has been studiedextensively; neuronal activity during perceptual stabilization remains unexplored. Here; wereport neuronal responses in area MT in two behaving macaque monkeys under twoconditions that differ in the strength of perceptual stabilization. In the first condition; wepresented ambiguous structure-from-motion (SFM) stimuli periodically; a standard paradigmfor stabilization in humans.

A comparison of local field potentials and spiking activity to predict perceptual report during bistable visual stimulation,H Liang; X Wang; Z Wang; NK Logothetis; DA Leopold; AV Maier,Zusammenfassung Certain continuously moving objects appear to spontaneously reversetheir motion direction (eg; the illusion of structure-from-motion; SFM). The neuronalmechanisms underlying these perceptual fluctuations still remain elusive. Spiking activityfrom individual neurons in cortical middle temporal visual area (MT) has been shown tocorrelate to a certain degree with an animal's perceptual report during stimulation with SFMand related paradigms of bistable perception. Similarly; certain frequency bands of the localfield potentials (LFPs) can be used to predict these perceptual judgments (Maier et al.; SFN2005). Here we ask whether spiking activity or local field potentials are better correlated withthe perceptual outcome of bistable stimulation. Two macaque monkeys were trained toreport the perceived direction of motion in an SFM task while single-unit activity (SUA) …,36th Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience (Neuroscience 2006),2006,2
Percept-related fluctuations of MT local field potentials,AV Maier; NK Logothetis; DA Leopold,Zusammenfassung Single-cell recordings in the awake monkey during bistable visualperception have revealed a diversity of roles for individual neurons with regard to anexperienced percept. We have recently shown that this perceptual modulation is not onlyneuron-specific but also stimulus-specific: MT neurons showing perceptual modulation toone stimulus often do not show significant modulation to closely related ambiguous patternsthat differ only in the value of a single parameter (Maier et al.; SFN 2003). In the presentstudy; we explore how this stimulus-specificity for perceptual modulation might be reflectedin the local field potential (LFP) during the perception of ambiguous 3-D rotation; as well asduring binocular rivalry flash suppression. Following the presentation of severalcombinations of rivaling patterns; as well as 3-D rotation; to the same neurons; we …,35th Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience (Neuroscience 2005),2005,2
Parallel perception of multiple visually bistable patterns,A Maier; M Wilke; DA Leopold; NK Logothetis,Abstract The visual instability that results from viewing ambiguous or conflicting patterns isthought to reflect dynamic processes that are critical for perceptual organization duringnormal vision. We have recently discovered a method to prolong states of perceptualdominance up to two orders of magnitude by periodically switching off and on the inducingbistable pattern. In the current study we used this paradigm to temporally interleave thepresentation of pairs of ambiguous stimuli at the same location in visual space. Bistablepatterns including rotating three-dimensional objects; depth reversals; and binocular rivalry;were shown alternately with appropriate blanking periods to prolong phases of perceptualdominance. We were interested under what conditions the time courses of two parallelbistable visual processes would be independent. We found that for certain pairs of …,5.

Neuroscience: The Cortical Layering of Visual Processing,Alexander Maier,Take a brief look at Figure 1A and try to figure out what it depicts. If you are unable to make outsomething meaningful immediately; do not be concerned. This image is not part of a Rorschachtest designed for psychoanalysis; but rather a common type of visual stimulus used in perceptionresearch [1]. As someone who has never seen this picture before; what you are likely to experienceis roughly reminiscent of the incohesive distribution of dark and bright spots that form thetwo-dimensional retinal image — visual information in its rawest form. Now try rotating the pageby 180 degrees so that the figure is turned on its head: from this angle; you will easily make outa face.

Prestimulus activity in area MT predicts psychophysical performance in a bistable motion task,Z Wang; A Maier; NK Logothetis; DA Leopold; H Liang,Zusammenfassung Extensive studies have shown that the stimulus-evoked neuronal activityin area MT is causally related to motion perception. Yet little is known about how ongoing(pre-and inter-stimulus) activity in area MT influences the subjects ability to perceive andrespond to stimuli. Here we ask whether the activity level of area MT preceding stimulusonset has an influence on the subject s psychophysical performance during physicallyidentical; but perceptually ambiguous visual stimulation. Two rhesus monkeys were welltrained to indicate the perceived direction of rotation of bistable structure-from-motion (SFM)stimuli by pulling one of two levers. During this task; multi-channel multi-unit activity (MUA)and local field potentials (LFP) were recorded from area MT while monitoring the animal'spsychophysical performance and response times.

Competition and integration in monocular rivalry,A Maier; NK Logothetis; DA Leopold,Zusammenfassung The paradigm of monocular rivalry (MR); also called pattern rivalry; hasbeen used to illustrate selective suppression of one of two superimposed visual patterns orimages. Much like the related phenomenon of binocular rivalry (BR); perception during MRis dynamic; and often marked by dominance of only one of the competing patterns; withcomplete invisibility of its rival. However; MR distinguishes itself from its counterpart in that itarises in the absence of any interocular conflict; but is highly restricted in the types of stimulithat will engage in spontaneous alternation. Here we report several experiments that attemptto identify the principles by which perception selects and/or suppresses superimposedpatterns during MR. Stimuli generally consisted of superimposed orthogonal gratings; whichhave been shown previously to engage in vigorous rivalry. However; in the present study …,26th European Conference on Visual Perception,2003,1
Probing Electrophysiological Indices of Perceptual Awareness across Unisensory and Multisensory Modalities,Jean-Paul Noel; David Simon; Antonia Thelen; Alexander Maier; Randolph Blake; Mark T Wallace,The neural underpinnings of perceptual awareness have been extensively studied usingunisensory (eg; visual alone) stimuli. However; perception is generally multisensory; and it isunclear whether the neural architecture uncovered in these studies directly translates to themultisensory domain. Here; we use EEG to examine brain responses associated with theprocessing of visual; auditory; and audiovisual stimuli presented near threshold levels ofdetectability; with the aim of deciphering similarities and differences in the neural signalsindexing the transition into perceptual awareness across vision; audition; and combinedvisual–auditory (multisensory) processing. More specifically; we examine (1) the presence oflate evoked potentials (∼> 300 msec);(2) the across-trial reproducibility; and (3) the evokedcomplexity associated with perceived versus nonperceived stimuli.

Binocular Response Modulation in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus,Kacie Dougherty; Michael C Schmid; Alexander Maier,Abstract The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) receives the mainoutputs of both eyes and relays those signals to the visual cortex. Each retina projects toseparate layers of the LGN so that each LGN neuron is innervated by a single eye. In linewith this anatomical separation; visual responses of almost all of LGN neurons are driven byone eye only. Nonetheless; many LGN neurons are sensitive to what is shown to the othereye as their visual responses differ when both eyes are stimulated compared to when thedriving eye is stimulated in isolation. This; predominantly suppressive; binocular modulationof LGN responses might suggest that the LGN is the first location in the primary visualpathway where the outputs from the two eyes interact. Indeed; the LGN features severalanatomical structures that would allow for LGN neurons responding to one eye to …,*,2018,*
Spiking Suppression Precedes Cued Attentional Enhancement of Neural Responses in Primary Visual Cortex,Michele A Cox; Kacie Dougherty; Geoffrey K Adams; Eric A Reavis; Jacob A Westerberg; Brandon S Moore; David A Leopold; Alexander Maier,Abstract Attending to a visual stimulus increases its detectability; even if gaze is directedelsewhere. This covert attentional selection is known to enhance spiking across many brainareas; including the primary visual cortex (V1). Here we investigate the temporal dynamicsof attention-related spiking changes in V1 of macaques performing a task that separatesattentional selection from the onset of visual stimulation. We found that preceding attentionalenhancement there was a sharp; transient decline in spiking following presentation of anattention-guiding cue. This disruption of V1 spiking was not observed in a task-naïve subjectthat passively observed the same stimulus sequence; suggesting that sensory activation isinsufficient to cause suppression. Following this suppression; attended stimuli evoked morespiking than unattended stimuli; matching previous reports of attention-related activity in …,Cerebral Cortex,2017,*

Single-trial bistable perception classification based on sparse nonnegative tensor decomposition,Zhisong Wang; Alexander Maier; Nikos K Logothetis; Hualou Liang,The study of the neuronal correlates of the spontaneous alternation in perception elicited bybistable visual stimuli is promising for understanding the mechanism of neural informationprocessing and the neural basis of visual perception and perceptual decision-making. In thispaper we apply a sparse nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) based method to extractfeatures from the local field potential (LFP) in monkey visual cortex for decoding its bistablestructure-from-motion (SFM) perception. We apply the feature extraction approach to themultichannel time-frequency representation of intracortical LFP data collected from themiddle temporal area (MT) in a macaque monkey performing a SFM task.

Spatiotemporal Integration of Neuronal Activity for Single-Trial Classifications of Bistable Perception,Zhisong Wang; Alexander Maier; David A Leopold; Hualou Liang,This paper aims to understand how the discriminative information of neuronal populationactivity evolves and accumulates over time. We present two classes of approaches namelythe probability-based and response-based approaches to predict the perceptual reports of atrained macaque monkey on a single-trial basis by integrating neural signals from multipleelectrodes across time. We extend the probability-based integration originally using only thequadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) by considering also the linear discriminant analysis(LDA) and logistic regression methods. Furthermore; we introduce the response-basedintegration for the QDA; LDA and logistic regression methods. Experimental examplesdemonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches for determining the perceptual state of abrain under study by integrating its localized spatiotemporal neuronal activity.,Neural Networks; 2007.

Optimal spatio-temporal pooling of neural responses in area MT,Hualou Liang; Zhisong Wang; David A Leopold; Alexander Maier,Bistable visual stimuli such as Rubin's vase/face or the Necker cube refer to the phenomenaof spontaneously alternating percepts while viewing the same visual image. The uncouplingbetween the stimulus and percept offers a means for understanding neural basis of visualperception. Here we asked whether pooling the responses of a large population of MTneurons over time and space could improve the predictability of perceptual decisions duringambiguous visual stimulation. Two well trained rhesus monkeys indicated the perceiveddirection of rotation of bistable structure-from-motion (SFM) stimuli by pushing one of twolevers.

We used flash-suppression to dissociate the constant stimulus from thevarying percept and showed that neurons in V5 modulate their firing rate according towhether a random-dot motion stimulus is perceived or not. In all cases; these changes reflectthe ones produced under physical stimulus alternations; ie are higher for the motioncompared to the static checkerboard stimulus; they increase in strength with increases in thedirectional coherence of the perceived dot movies. 70 of these perceptually-modulatingneurons showed a further modulation when the strength of the suppressed motion stimuluswas varied.

Perceptual and neuronal dynamics of binocular rivalry flash suppression,Alexander Maier; Melanie Wilke; Nikos K Logothetis; David A Leopold,Abstract Asynchronous presentation of two dissimilar patterns at the same point in visualspace can lead to the perceptual domination of the second pattern; accompanied bysuppression of the first. This flash suppression is particularly pronounced when there isdirect interocular conflict; as in binocular rivalry flash suppression (BRFS; Wolfe; 1984); ormore subtle interocular differences as in generalized flash suppression (GFS; Wilke et al;2003). Under conditions favorable to monocular rivalry; asynchronous presentation is alsoeffective at promoting exclusive visibility when two overlapping patterns are shown tocorresponding portions of the same eye (Maier et al.; ECVP 2004). The dynamics of all thesephenomena appear to be closely related; all possessing an increasing probability ofperceptual suppression with longer 'adaptation'intervals before the presentation of the …,Journal of Vision,2005,*
13 Binocular Rivalry and the Illusion of,David A Leopold; Alexander Maier; Melanie Wilke; Nikos K Logothetis,A primate's visual impression of the world is shaped by highly refined cortical mechanismsfor registering and interpreting images cast on the retinas. The act of seeing is normally soefficient and effortless that one seldom considers the inherent difficulty in the process. Theeyes and brain; presented with a two-dimensional image of light; dark; and color; mustextract the structure and spatial relationships of objects from which illuminating light isreflected. In particular; the visual cortex is thought to employ diverse stages of processingthat together integrate the detection of sensory motifs in a scene with mechanisms thatactively interpret and understand the physical structures from which they arise. Interestingly;among these multiple levels of representation; some of the neural elements critical insecuring robust perception are not themselves enlightened as to the ultimate percept.,Binocular Rivalry,2005,*

Shared and Distinct Cortical Mechanisms Underlying the Perception of Diverse Visually Ambiguous Patterns,Alexander Vinzenz Maier,Visual illusions are fascinating because they demonstrate in a most direct way that ourperception is not a veridical representation of the physical world. They may also help tounderstand the hidden mechanisms which aide the brain in making sense of sensoryinputs1-4. The power of these organizational principles in perception becomes mostapparent when studying visual patterns which; when viewed for several seconds; elicit asequence of spontaneous perceptual alternations5-8. These multistable perceptualphenomena; as they are called; can be elicited by a wide array of ambiguous visual stimuli.They are usually defined as a series of mutually exclusive ('rivaling') percepts thatstochastically displace each other over time without being accompanied by physicalstimulus changes. Although perceptual aspects underlying alternation can range from …,*,2004,*
A comparison of perception-related activity in the visual cortex using different ambiguous patterns,A Maier; NK Logothetis; DA Leopold,Zusammenfassung Neurophysiological studies using bistable visual patterns have revealeda diversity of roles for individual neurons with respect to the ultimate percept. Furthermore;studies have demonstrated that the incidence of percept-related neurons in different areasappears to be similar during ambiguous perception brought about by binocular rivalry (BR)and structure from motion (SFM). One interpretation of these results is that there exists aspecialized subset of neurons whose responses are inextricably linked with perception;regardless of the exact stimulus. The present experiments address this hypothesis byexamining perception-related responses at individual recording sites during thepresentation of two or more fundamentally different ambiguous patterns.

Periods of stimulus absence stabilize the perception of ambiguous patterns,M Wilke; A Maier; DA Leopold; NK Logothetis,Abstract A fundamental property of ambiguous visual patterns is the inevitability ofperceptual reversal. The rate of alternation generally depends both upon the physicalstructure of the stimulus as well as the inherent rate of an individual. Here we presentevidence that critical to the reversal process is the prolonged physical presence of theinducing stimulus. We systematically investigated the influence of stimulus on and offdurations on the stability of such patterns; finding that minimizing the duration of the stimulus“on time” was the predominant factor in perceptual stabilization. We demonstrate that whenstimuli are shown only intermittently; the rate of perceptual alternation sharply declines tonearly zero in some subjects. In particular; we found that rotating three-dimensional bistablepatterns with mean dominance time less than 10 seconds could be stabilized for periods …,5.

What processes in the brain make a stimulus visible?,DA Leopold; M Wilke; A Maier,Text When we look at a salient visual pattern; say a bright flower or a traffic sign; why do wesee it? The question might seem odd; since this aspect of our perception seems automaticand effortless. Nonetheless; a number of visual illusions demonstrate that the contents of ourperception can deviate significantly from the image falling on the retina; and that even highlysalient elements of a scene can be completely suppressed. This suppression can occureven when the location of suppression is fully attended. We have studied the neural basis ofvisual suppression using several related psychophysical paradigms in the behavingmonkey. I will present data arising from two of these paradigms; binocular rivalry flashsuppression (BRFS); and the recently introduced generalized flash suppression (GFS). Ingeneral; and consistent with previous work; we found that the visibility or invisibility of a …,*,*,*
