Biodiesel production using cation-exchange resin as heterogeneous catalyst,Yaohui Feng; Benqiao He; Yuhe Cao; Jianxin Li; Meng Liu; Feng Yan; Xiaoping Liang,Abstract Three types of cation-exchange resins (NKC-9; 001× 7 and D61) as solid acidcatalysts were employed to prepare biodiesel from acidified oils generated from waste fryingoils. The results show that the catalytic activity of NKC-9 was higher than that of 001× 7 andD61. The conversion of the esterification by NKC-9 increased with increasing in the amountof catalyst; reaction temperature and time and methanol/oil molar ratio. The maximalconversion of reaction is approximately 90.0%. Furthermore; NKC-9 resin exhibits goodreusability. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis reveals that the production issimplex and mainly composed of C16: 0 (palmitic); C18: 2 (linoleic); and C18: 1 (oleic) acidsof methyl ester; respectively.,Bioresource Technology,2010,182

A comparison study on membrane fouling in a sponge-submerged membrane bioreactor and a conventional membrane bioreactor,Lijuan Deng; Wenshan Guo; Huu Hao Ngo; Jian Zhang; Shuang Liang; Siqing Xia; Zhiqiang Zhang; Jianxin Li,Abstract This study compared membrane fouling in a sponge-submerged membranebioreactor (SSMBR) and a conventional membrane bioreactor (CMBR) based on sludgeproperties when treating synthetic domestic wastewater. In the CMBR; soluble microbialproducts (SMP) in activated sludge were a major contributor for initial membrane fouling andpresented higher concentration in membrane cake layer. Afterwards; membrane fouling wasmainly governed by bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in activated sludge;containing lower proteins but significantly higher polysaccharides. Sponge addition couldprevent cake formation on membrane surface and pore blocking inside membrane; therebyalleviating membrane fouling. The SSMBR exhibited not only less growth of the biomassand filamentous bacteria; but also lower cake layer and pore blocking resistance due to …,Bioresource technology,2014,38

New proposed conceptual mathematical models for biomass viability and membrane fouling of membrane bioreactor,MFR Zuthi; HH Ngo; WS Guo; JX Li; SQ Xia; ZQ Zhang,Abstract The production and accumulation of soluble microbial products (SMP); extracellularpolymeric substances (EPS) and colloidal inert compounds within a membrane bioreactor(MBR) may greatly affect the biomass viability and subsequently the permeability of themembrane. This paper aims at presenting new mathematical models of biomass viabilityand membrane fouling that has been conceptually developed through establishing linksbetween these biomass parameters and operating parameters of the MBR. The proposedmodels can be used to predict the biomass viability and membrane fouling at any state ofoperation of MBR. Meanwhile; easily measurable parameters of the proposed model canalso serve to estimate SMP/EPS concentration in the supernatant of MBR without the tediousand expensive measurement.,Bioresource technology,2013,6

Modeling of filtration characteristics during submerged hollow fiber membrane microfiltration of yeast suspension under aeration condition,X. Li*; J. Li*; Z. Cui; Y. Yao,Abstract A modeling of filtration characteristics during the submerged hollow fiber membranemicrofiltration of yeast suspension under aeration condition was developed on the basis ofhydrodynamic mathematical equations that describe the local flux distribution; particledeposition and gas–liquid two-phase flow. The effects of average operating flux; fiber length;inner diameter and aeration rate on the distributions of local flux and filtration resistancewere investigated using the developed model. The model was validated using the literaturedata. The simulated results showed that the asymmetry of initial local flux distribution wasintensified with the increase of aeration rate. The local fluxes along the fiber experienced theself-adjustment and reconstruction due to the changes of filtration resistance as the filtrationprocessed. Furthermore; the local flux distribution along the fiber with a short length and …,Journal of Membrane Science,2016,4
