The genome of the model beetle and pest Tribolium castaneum,Tribolium Genome Sequencing Consortium,Abstract Tribolium castaneum is a member of the most species-rich eukaryotic order; apowerful model organism for the study of generalized insect development; and an importantpest of stored agricultural products. We describe its genome sequence here. Thisomnivorous beetle has evolved the ability to interact with a diverse chemical environment;as shown by large expansions in odorant and gustatory receptors; as well as P450 andother detoxification enzymes. Development in Tribolium is more representative of otherinsects than is Drosophila; a fact reflected in gene content and function. For example;Tribolium has retained more ancestral genes involved in cell–cell communication thanDrosophila; some being expressed in the growth zone crucial for axial elongation in short-germ development. Systemic RNA interference in T. castaneum functions differently from …,Nature,2008,909
Liquid-mediated dense integration of graphene materials for compact capacitive energy storage,Xiaowei Yang; Chi Cheng; Yufei Wang; Ling Qiu; Dan Li,Porous yet densely packed carbon electrodes with high ion-accessible surface area and lowion transport resistance are crucial to the realization of high-density electrochemicalcapacitive energy storage but have proved to be very challenging to produce. Takingadvantage of chemically converted graphene's intrinsic microcorrugated two-dimensionalconfiguration and self-assembly behavior; we show that such materials can be readilyformed by capillary compression of adaptive graphene gel films in the presence of anonvolatile liquid electrolyte. This simple soft approach enables subnanometer scaleintegration of graphene sheets with electrolytes to form highly compact carbon electrodeswith a continuous ion transport network. Electrochemical capacitors based on the resultingfilms can obtain volumetric energy densities approaching 60 watt-hours per liter.,science,2013,875

Here we report the noninvasive detection of 2HG by proton magnetic resonancespectroscopy (MRS). We developed and optimized the pulse sequence with numerical andphantom analyses for 2HG detection; and we estimated the concentrations of 2HG usingspectral fitting in the tumors of 30 subjects. Detection of 2HG correlated with mutations inIDH1 or IDH2 and with increased levels of D-2HG by mass spectrometry of the resectedtumors. Noninvasive detection of 2HG may prove to be a valuable diagnostic and prognosticbiomarker.,Nature medicine,2012,383

Here; wedemonstrate that adaptor protein STING; but not MyD88; is required for type I IFN-dependentantitumor effects of radiation. In dendritic cells (DCs); STING was required for IFN-βinduction in response to irradiated-tumor cells. The cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP(cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) mediated sensing of irradiated-tumor cells in DCs. Moreover;STING was essential for radiation-induced adaptive immune responses; which relied ontype I IFN signaling on DCs. Exogenous IFN-β treatment rescued the cross-priming by cGASor STING-deficient DCs. Accordingly; activation of STING by a second messenger cGAMPadministration enhanced antitumor immunity induced by radiation. Thus radiation …,Immunity,2014,280

To study tumor metabolism in vivo; we used an orthotopic mouse modelof primary human glioblastoma (GBM). We infused 13 C-labeled nutrients into mice bearingthree independent GBM lines; each with a distinct set of mutations. All three lines displayedglycolysis; as expected for aggressive tumors. They also displayed unexpected metaboliccomplexity; oxidizing glucose via pyruvate dehydrogenase and the citric acid cycle; andusing glucose to supply anaplerosis and other biosynthetic activities. Comparing the tumorsto surrounding brain revealed obvious metabolic differences; notably the accumulation of alarge glutamine pool within the tumors. Many of these same activities were conserved in …,Cell metabolism,2012,248
Vgram: Improving performance of approximate queries on string collections using variable-length grams,Chen Li; Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang,Abstract Many applications need to solve the following problem of approximate stringmatching: from a collection of strings; how to find those similar to a given string; or the stringsin another (possibly the same) collection of strings? Many algorithms are developed usingfixed-length grams; which are substrings of a string used as signatures to identify similarstrings. In this paper we develop a novel technique; called VGRAM; to improve theperformance of these algorithms. Its main idea is to judiciously choose high-quality grams ofvariable lengths from a collection of strings to support queries on the collection. We give afull specification of this technique; including how to select high-quality grams from thecollection; how to generate variable-length grams for a string based on the preselectedgrams; and what is the relationship between the similarity of the gram sets of two strings …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,205
Leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase is a functional receptor for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan axon growth inhibitors,Daniel Fisher; Bin Xing; John Dill; Hui Li; Hai Hiep Hoang; Zhenze Zhao; Xiao-Li Yang; Robert Bachoo; Stephen Cannon; Frank M Longo; Morgan Sheng; Jerry Silver; Shuxin Li,Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are a family of extracellular matrix moleculeswith various functions in regulating tissue morphogenesis; cell division; and axon guidance.A number of CSPGs are highly upregulated by reactive glial scar tissues after injuries andform a strong barrier for axonal regeneration in the adult vertebrate CNS. Although CSPGsmay negatively regulate axonal growth via binding and altering activity of other growth-regulating factors; the molecular mechanisms by which CSPGs restrict axonal elongationare not well understood. Here; we identified a novel receptor mechanism whereby CSPGsinhibit axonal growth via interactions with neuronal transmembrane leukocyte commonantigen-related phosphatase (LAR).

However;its limited rate capability and cyclability; along with large variation of reported capacitance;cast doubt on its potential for real-world applications. We use a recently developedgraphene hydrogel film as a substrate to revisit the capacitance of polyaniline; and revealthat if its nanostructure is properly engineered; polyaniline can provide a combination ofhigh capacitance; excellent rate performance and long cycling life and is promising for realapplications.,Energy & Environmental Science,2013,125
Ultrasonic-assisted extraction of epimedin C from fresh leaves of Epimedium and extraction mechanism,Hua-Feng Zhang; Xiao-Hua Yang; Li-Dong Zhao; Ying Wang,Abstract Epimedin C is an important component of Epimedium with many beneficialfunctions to human health. In this study; the feasibility of the extraction of epimedin C fromfresh leaves of Epimedium using ultrasonic probe system was demonstrated. The highextraction yield of epimedin C was obtained under an optimum extraction condition:extraction temperature of 50° C; methanol concentration 60%(v/v); ratio of liquor to solid 30mL g− 1; and ultrasonication time 15 min. Scanning electron micrographs and transmissionelectron micrographs revealed that ultrasound could result in the disruptions of leaf tissuesand cell walls; which enhanced the mass transfer of the solvents into the leaf materials andthe soluble constituents into the solvents.

Cost-based variable-length-gram selection for string collections to support approximate queries efficiently,Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Chen Li,Abstract Approximate queries on a collection of strings are important in many applicationssuch as record linkage; spell checking; and Web search; where inconsistencies and errorsexist in data as well as queries. Several existing algorithms use the concept of" grams;"which are substrings of strings used as signatures for the strings to build index structures. Arecently proposed technique; called VGRAM; improves the performance of these algorithmsby using a carefully chosen dictionary of variable-length grams based on their requencies inthe string collection. Since an index structure using fixed-length grams can be viewed as aspecial case of VGRAM; a fundamental problem arises naturally: what is the relationshipbetween the gram dictionary and the performance of queries? We study this problem in thispaper. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm for computing a tight lower bound …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,111
Targeting the tumor microenvironment with interferon-β bridges innate and adaptive immune responses,Xuanming Yang; Xunmin Zhang; May Lynne Fu; Ralph R Weichselbaum; Thomas F Gajewski; Yajun Guo; Yang-Xin Fu,Summary Antibodies (Abs) that preferentially target oncogenic receptors have beenincreasingly used for cancer therapy; but tumors often acquire intrinsic Ab resistance afterprolonged and costly treatment. Herein we armed the Ab with IFNβ and observed that it ismore potent than the first generation of Ab for controlling Ab-resistant tumors. This strategycontrols Ab resistance by rebridging suppressed innate and adaptive immunity in the tumormicroenvironment. Mechanistically; Ab-IFNβ therapy primarily and directly targetsintratumoral dendritic cells; which reactivate CTL by increasing antigen cross-presentationwithin the tumor microenvironment. Additionally; blocking PD-L1; which is induced by Ab-IFNβ treatment; overcomes treatment-acquired resistance and completely eradicatesestablished tumors.

Complex regulation of human androgen receptor expression by Wnt signaling in prostate cancer cells,X Yang; MW Chen; S Terry; F Vacherot; DL Bemis; J Capodice; J Kitajewski; A De La Taille; MC Benson; Y Guo; R Buttyan,Abstract β-Catenin; a component of the Wnt signaling pathway; is a coactivator of humanandrogen receptor (hAR) transcriptional activity. Here; we show that Wnt signaling alsoinfluences androgen-mediated signaling through its ability to regulate hAR mRNA andprotein in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Three functional LEF-1/TCF binding sites lie within thepromoter of the hAR gene as shown by CHIP assays that captured β-catenin-boundchromatin from Wnt-activated LNCaP cells. Chimeric reporter vectors that use the hAR genepromoter to drive luciferase expression confirmed that these LEF-1/TCF binding elementsare able to confer robust upregulation of luciferase expression when stimulated by Wnt-1 orby transfection with β-catenin and that dominant-negative TCF or mutations within thedominant TCF-binding element abrogated the response.

Induction of innate lymphoid cell-derived interleukin-22 by the transcription factor STAT3 mediates protection against intestinal infection,Xiaohuan Guo; Ju Qiu; Tony Tu; Xuanming Yang; Liufu Deng; Robert A Anders; Liang Zhou; Yang-Xin Fu,Summary Inhibitors of the transcription factor STAT3 target STAT3-dependent tumorigenesisbut patients often develop diarrhea from unknown mechanisms. Here we showed thatSTAT3 deficiency increased morbidity and mortality after Citrobacter rodentium infection withdecreased secretion of cytokines including IL-17 and IL-22 associated with the transcriptionfactor RORγt. Administration of the cytokine IL-22 was sufficient to rescue STAT3-deficientmice from lethal infection. Although STAT3 was required for IL-22 production in both innateand adaptive arms; by using conditional gene-deficient mice; we observed that STAT3expression in RORγt+ innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s); but not T cells; was essential for theprotection. However; STAT3 was required for RORγt expression in T helper cells; but not inILC3s. Activated STAT3 could directly bind to the Il22 locus. Thus; cancer therapies that …,Immunity,2014,90

Materials science & engineering,David Bahr,Since the 1950's there has been experimental evidence that structures on the sub-micronscale can exhibit strengths approaching the theoretical strength of the material. The generalhypothesis taken is that if dislocation sources are missing; then the nucleation; rather thanpropagation; of these defects must control deformation. In small samples it is possible tocreate nominally dislocation free solids; which provides a possible platform for bothfundamental measurements of materials properties as well as insight into designing strongstructures. Two common ways these extraordinary strengths are being examinedexperimentally are with nanoindentation and micro-machined structures such as tensile andcompression samples; both in ambient conditions as well as during in situ electronmicroscopy.

In this paper; we consider data-publishingapplications where the publisher specifies what information is sensitive and should beprotected. We show that if a partial document is published carelessly; users can usecommon knowledge (eg;" all patients in the same ward have the same disease") to infermore data; which can cause leakage of sensitive information. The goal is to protect suchinformation in the presence of data inference with common knowledge. We considercommon knowledge represented as semantic XML constraints.

A molecular mechanism for ibuprofen-mediated RhoA inhibition in neurons,John Dill; Ankur R Patel; Xiao-Li Yang; Robert Bachoo; Craig M Powell; Shuxin Li,Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used to relieve pain andinflammation in many disorders via inhibition of cyclooxygenases. Recently; we havedemonstrated that ibuprofen inhibits intracellular signaling of RhoA and promotes significantaxonal growth and functional recovery following spinal cord lesions in rodents. In addition;another study suggests that ibuprofen reduces generation of amyloid-β42 peptide viainactivation of RhoA signaling; although it may also regulate amyloid-β42 formation by directinhibition of the γ-secretase complex. The molecular mechanisms by which ibuprofeninhibits the RhoA signal in neurons; however; remain unclear.

RR photons,Pablo G Cámara; Luis E Ibanez; Fernando Marchesano,Abstract Type II string compactifications to 4d generically contain massless Ramond-Ramond U (1) gauge symmetries. However there is no massless matter charged underthese U (1)'s; which makes a priori difficult to measure any physical consequences of theirexistence. There is however a window of opportunity if these RR U (1)'s mix with thehypercharge U (1) Y (hence with the photon). In this paper we study in detail differentavenues by which U (1) RR bosons may mix with D-brane U (1)'s. We concentrate on TypeIIA orientifolds and their M-theory lift; and provide geometric criteria for the existence of suchmixing; which may occur either via standard kinetic mixing or via the mass terms induced byStückelberg couplings. The latter case is particularly interesting; and appears whenever D-branes wrap torsional p-cycles in the compactification manifold. We also show that in the …,Journal of High Energy Physics,2011,64

Rationale; design and organization of the Second Chinese Cardiac Study (CCS-2): a randomized trial of clopidogrel plus aspirin; and of metoprolol; among patients...,Zheng-Ming Chen; Second Chinese Cardiac Study (CCS-2) Collaborative Group,Assessing combined anti-platelet therapy in suspected acute myocardial infarction Aspirinhas been shown to be effective in the emergency treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Itirreversibly inhibits platelet cyclo-oxygenase and thereby prevents the formation of theplatelet aggregating agent thromboxane A2. Clopidogrel is an anti-platelet agent that acts bya different mechanism; inhibiting adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation.Simultaneous inhibition of both of these pathways might produce significantly greater anti-platelet effects than inhibition of either alone. The Second Chinese Cardiac Study (CCS-2)will reliably determine whether adding oral clopidogrel to aspirin for up to 4 weeks inhospital after suspected acute myocardial infarction can produce a greater reduction in therisk of major vascular events than can be achieved by giving aspirin alone.

Multifunctional microporous organic polymers,Buyi Li; Zhenhong Guan; Xinjia Yang; Wei David Wang; Wei Wang; Irshad Hussain; Kunpeng Song; Bien Tan; Tao Li,Functional microporous organic polymers (MOPs) are attractive in a wide range ofapplications including gas separation; catalysis; and energy storage. There is a lack of cost-effective processes to produce functional MOPs at industrial scale; which in fact limits theirpractical applications. Here; we propose a new low-cost strategy; based on the Schollreaction; which can directly link rigid building blocks to obtain MOPs with high surface areaand highly microporous structures. More importantly; this method is suitable for variousbuilding blocks and can be used as a general bottom-up approach to produce a variety ofmultifunctional MOPs. Multifaceted applications of these materials are also demonstrated bytheir large gas storage capacity; high catalytic activity; luminescence and semiconductingproperties.,Journal of Materials Chemistry A,2014,51

Autophagy plays an important role in sunitinib-mediated cell death in H9c2 cardiac muscle cells,Yuqin Zhao; Tao Xue; Xiaochun Yang; Hong Zhu; Xiaofei Ding; Liming Lou; Wei Lu; Bo Yang; Qiaojun He,Abstract Sunitinib; which is a multitargeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitor; exhibits antiangiogenicand antitumor activity; and extends survival of patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma(mRCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). This molecule has also been reported tobe associated with cardiotoxicity at a high frequency; but the mechanism is still unknown. Inthe present study; we observed that Sunitinib showed high anti-proliferative effect on H9c2cardiac muscle cells measured by PI staining and the MTT assay. But apoptotic markers(PARP cleavage; caspase 3 cleavage and chromatin condensation) were uniformly negativein H9c2 cells after Sunitinib treatment for 48 h; indicating that another cell death pathwaymay be involved in Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. Here we found Sunitinib dramaticallyincreased autophagic flux in H9c2 cells. Acidic vesicle fluorescence and high expression …,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2010,50
K-anonymization approaches for supporting multiple constraints.,Xiao-Chun Yang; Xiang-Yu Liu; Bin Wang; Ge Yu,K-Anonymization is an important approach to protect data privacy in data publishingscenario. Existing approaches mainly consider data processing with single constraint. Thereexist multiple constraints cases in the real applications; which makes the K-anonymizationmore complex. Simply applying the approaches with single constraint to the problem ofmultiple constraints may cause high information loss and low efficiency. Based on the ideaof Classfly; a family of multiple constraints supported K-anonymization approaches namedClassfly+ are proposed according to the features of mutiple constraints. Three K-anonymization approaches are proposed; which are na? ve approach; complete IndepCSet;and partial IndepCSet Classfly+ approaches. Experimental results show that Classfly+ candecrease the information loss and improve efficiency of k-anonymization.,Ruan Jian Xue Bao(Journal of Software),2006,50

Drastic change in China's lakes and reservoirs over the past decades,Xiankun Yang; Xixi Lu,Abstract Using remote sensing images; we provided the first complete picture of freshwaterbodies in mainland China. We mapped 89;700 reservoirs; covering about 26;870 km 2 andapproximately 185;000 lakes with a surface area of about 82;232 km 2. Despite relativelysmall surface area; the total estimated storage capacity of reservoirs (794 km 3) is triple thatof lakes (268 km 3). Further analysis indicates that reservoir construction has made the riversystems strongly regulated: only 6% of the assessed river basins are free-flowing; 20% ofassessed river basins have enough cumulative reservoir capacity to store more than theentire annual river flow. Despite the existence of 2;721 lakes greater than 1 km 2; we foundthat about 50 lakes greater than km 2 have formed on the Tibetan Plateau resulting fromclimate change. More than 350 lakes of≥ 1 km 2 vanished in four other major lake …,Scientific reports,2014,48

Biogeochemical evidence of Holocene East Asian summer and winter monsoon variability from a tropical maar lake in southern China,Guodong Jia; Yang Bai; Xiaoqiang Yang; Luhua Xie; Gangjian Wei; Tingping Ouyang; Guoqiang Chu; Zhonghui Liu; Ping'an Peng,Abstract Lake Huguangyan (21° 9′ N; 110° 17′ E); a maar lake located near the SouthChina Sea; can provide valuable sedimentary data regarding past changes of the EastAsian monsoonal system. Here; we used the proxies of TOC; δ 13 C org; δ 15 N; and leafwax n-alkane δ 13 C values (δ 13 C wax) to reconstruct the lake conditions; which; in turn;revealed patterns in monsoonal changes during the Holocene. Two distinct patterns of proxychanges were identified in the sedimentary profile. A marked shift in the δ 13 C wax valueat∼ 9.2 ka (thousand years ago) suggests the abrupt disappearance of C 4 plants; signalingthe enhancement of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Between 9.2 and 1.8 ka; a nearlypure C 3 terrestrial ecosystem was present; with the climax at ca 7–6 ka. After ca 3 ka; fewertropical species and a reappearance of C 4 plants at 1.8 ka indicate a weakened EASM in …,Quaternary Science Reviews,2015,38

The oxidation states of DJ-1 dictate the cell fate in response to oxidative stress triggered by 4-hpr: autophagy or apoptosis?,Ji Cao; Meidan Ying; Nan Xie; Guanyu Lin; Rong Dong; Jun Zhang; Hailin Yan; Xiaochun Yang; Qiaojun He; Bo Yang,Abstract Aim: Chemotherapy-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) not only contribute toapoptosis; but also trigger autophagy. Since autophagy is reported to protect cancer cellsfrom apoptosis; this weakens the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy. This study aimed atidentifying the key molecules that determine the cellular response to ROS and; therefore;provide better strategies to increase chemotherapeutic efficiency. Results: Increasingconcentrations of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR)-treatment pushed autophagydown to apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner; and 4-HPR-induced ROS contribute to thisprocess. Since we found that ASK1-regulated JNK1 and p38 are responsible for 4-HPR-induced autophagy and apoptosis; respectively; we further utilized co-immunoprecipitationfollowed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify …,Antioxidants & redox signaling,2014,37

Oxidative stress is involved in Dasatinib-induced apoptosis in rat primary hepatocytes,Tao Xue; Peihua Luo; Hong Zhu; Yuqin Zhao; Honghai Wu; Renhua Gai; Youping Wu; Bo Yang; Xiaochun Yang; Qiaojun He,Abstract Dasatinib; a multitargeted inhibitor of BCR–ABL and SRC kinases; exhibitsantitumor activity and extends the survival of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However;some patients suffer from hepatotoxicity; which occurs through an unknown mechanism. Inthe present study; we found that Dasatinib could induce hepatotoxicity both in vitro and invivo. Dasatinib reduced the cell viability of rat primary hepatocytes; induced the release ofalanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in vitro; and triggered theballooning degeneration of hepatocytes in Sprague–Dawley rats in vivo. Apoptotic markers(chromatin condensation; cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP) were detected to indicatethat the injury induced by Dasatinib in hepatocytes in vitro was mediated by apoptosis …,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2012,36
Gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer cells regulated by PI3K/AKT-mediated cellular proliferation exerts negative feedback via the MEK/MAPK and mTOR pathways,Xiao Li Yang; Feng Juan Lin; Ya Jie Guo; Zhi Min Shao; Zhou Luo Ou,Abstract Chemoresistance is a major cause of cancer treatment failure and leads to areduction in the survival rate of cancer patients. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinaseB/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) pathways are aberrantly activated in many malignant tumors; including breastcancer; which may indicate an association with breast cancer chemoresistance. In this study;we generated a chemoresistant human breast cancer cell line; MDA-MB-231/gemcitabine(simplified hereafter as “231/Gem”); from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Flowcytometry studies revealed that with the same treatment concentration of gemcitabine;231/Gem cells displayed more robust resistance to gemcitabine; which was reflected byfewer apoptotic cells and enhanced percentage of S-phase cells.

CD160 is essential for NK-mediated IFN-γ production,Tony C Tu; Nicholas K Brown; Tae-Jin Kim; Joanna Wroblewska; Xuanming Yang; Xiaohuan Guo; Seoyun Hyunji Lee; Vinay Kumar; Kyung-Mi Lee; Yang-Xin Fu,NK-derived cytokines play important roles for natural killer (NK) function; but how thecytokines are regulated is poorly understood. CD160 is expressed on activated NK or T cellsin humans but its function is unknown. We generated CD160-deficient mice to probe itsfunction. Although CD160−/− mice showed no abnormalities in lymphocyte development;the control of NK-sensitive tumors was severely compromised in CD160−/− mice.Surprisingly; the cytotoxicity of NK cells was not impaired; but interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretionby NK cells was markedly reduced in CD160−/− mice. Functionally targeting CD160signaling with a soluble CD160-Ig also impaired tumor control and IFN-γ production;suggesting an active role of CD160 signaling. Using reciprocal bone marrow transfer andcell culture; we have identified the intrinsic role of CD160 on NK cells; as well as its …,Journal of Experimental Medicine,2015,31

A generalization based approach for anonymizing weighted social network graphs,Xiangyu Liu; Xiaochun Yang,Abstract The increasing popularity of social networks; such as online communities andtelecommunication systems; has generated interesting knowledge discovery and datamining problems. Since social networks usually contain personal information of individuals;preserving privacy in the release of social network data becomes an important concern. Anadversary can use many types of background knowledge to conduct an attack; such astopological structure and/or basic graph properties. Unfortunately; most of the previousstudies on privacy preservation can deal with simple graphs only; and cannot be applied toweighted graphs. Since there exists numerous unique weight-based information in weightedgraphs that can be used to attack a victim's privacy; to resist such weight-based re-identification attacks becomes a great challenge. In this paper; we investigate the identity …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2011,31

A dual-spatially-confined reservoir for sulfur by wrappingmicroporous carbon with dense graphene; micro@ meso-porous DSC (dual-spatial carbon);is synthesized to solve this issue. Such a structure is prepared through two distinctivemethods: graphene promoted in situ hydrothermal carbonization of organics to growmicropores on itself; and liquid mediated drying of graphene hydrogel to form mesoporousgraphene frameworks. In contrast to previously reported hierarchical carbon/S; the innermicropores are mainly responsible for loading sulfur; which could help confine its particlesize; thus increasing the electrical/ionic conductivity and the utilization of sulfur; and …,Nanoscale,2016,29

Privacy preserving approaches for multiple sensitive attributes in data publishing,X Yang; Ya-Zhe Wang; Bin Wang; Ge Yu,Abstract Current privacy preserving data publishing techniques concentrate on tables withonly one sensitive attribute. However; most of the real-world applications contain multiplesensitive attributes. Directly applying the existing single-sensitive-attribute privacypreserving techniques often causes unexpected private information disclosure. This paperfirstly discusses the problem of secure publishing data when sensitive data contains multiattributes; and then propose a multi-dimensional bucket grouping approach on the idea oflossy join; called Multi-Sensitive Bucketization (MSB). In order to avoid exhausting search;three specific line-time greedy based MSB algorithms are proposed; which are maximal-bucket first algorithm (MBF); maximal single-dimension-capacity first algorithm (MSDCF);and maximal multi-dimension-capacity first algorithm (MMDCF).

Ultra‐low output impedance RF power amplifier for parallel excitation,Xu Chu; Xing Yang; Yunfeng Liu; Juan Sabate; Yudong Zhu,Abstract Inductive coupling between coil elements of a transmit array is one of the keychallenges faced by parallel RF transmission. An ultra-low output impedance RF poweramplifier (PA) concept was introduced to address this challenge. In an exampleimplementation; an output-matching network was designed to transform the drain-sourceimpedance of the metallic oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) into a verylow value for suppressing interelement coupling effect; and meanwhile; to match the inputimpedance of the coil to the optimum load of the MOSFET for maximizing the availableoutput power. Two prototype amplifiers with 500-W output rating were developedaccordingly; and were further evaluated with a transmit array in phantom experiments.Compared to the conventional 50-Ω sources; the new approach exhibited considerable …,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2009,25

The chemical and physical properties of used photosensitizer play keyroles in the treatment efficacy. In this study; a novel photosensitizer; Chlorin-H [-13; 15-N-(cyclohexyl) cycloimide] which displayed a characteristic long wavelength absorption peakat 698 nm was synthesized. Following flash photolysis with 355 nm laser; Chlorin-H is potentto react with O 2 and then produce 1 O 2. This finding indicates that Chlorin-H takes itseffects through type II mechanism in PDT. Generally; Chlorin-H is localized in mitochondriaand nucleus of cell. After light irradiation with 698 nm laser; it can kill many types of cell;inhibit cell proliferation and colony formation; suppress cancer cell invasiveness and triggerapoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in A549 cells in vitro.

Bortezomib sensitizes human acute myeloid leukemia cells to all-trans-retinoic Acid–Induced differentiation by modifying the RARα/STAT1 axis,Meidan Ying; Xinglu Zhou; Like Zhong; Nengming Lin; Hui Jing; Peihua Luo; Xiaochun Yang; Hua Song; Bo Yang; Qiaojun He,All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has held great promise for differentiation-based therapy butreportedly downregulates retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα) in a proteasome-dependentmanner; which leads to decreased acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell differentiationefficiency. Therefore; research strategies that seek to further sensitize cells to retinoids andextend the range of retinoid-affected myeloid malignancies beyond acute promyelocyticleukemia (APL) are key investigative avenues. Here; we show that bortezomib; the firstproteasome inhibitor approved for newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple myeloma;exhibited strong synergism with ATRA to promote HL60 and NB4 AML cell differentiation.We observed that bortezomib sensitized AML cells to ATRA-induced morphologic;biochemical; and functional changes; indicative of myeloid differentiation without cell …,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2013,23

Androgen receptor antagonists compromise T cell response against prostate cancer leading to early tumor relapse,Yang Pu; Meng Xu; Yong Liang; Kaiting Yang; Yajun Guo; Xuanming Yang; Yang-Xin Fu,Surgical and medical androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a cornerstone for prostatecancer treatment; but relapse usually occurs. We herein show that orchiectomy synergizeswith immunotherapy; whereas the more widely used treatment of medical ADT involvingandrogen receptor (AR) antagonists suppresses immunotherapy. Furthermore; we observedthat the use of medical ADT could unexpectedly impair the adaptive immune responsesthrough interference with initial T cell priming rather than in the reactivation or expansionphases. Mechanistically; we have revealed that inadvertent immunosuppression might bepotentially mediated by a receptor shared with γ-aminobutyric acid. Our data demonstratethat the timing and dosing of antiandrogens are critical to maximizing the antitumor effects ofcombination therapy. This study highlights an underappreciated mechanism of AR …,Science translational medicine,2016,22

A thermokinetic description of nanoscale grain growth: Analysis of the activation energy effect,Z Chen; F Liu; XQ Yang; CJ Shen,Abstract The inhibition of grain growth by solute segregation in nanoscale materials hasoften been described using kinetic models (eg Acta Mater 1999; 47: 2143) or thermokineticmodels (eg Acta Mater 2009; 57: 1466); in which constant activation energy and a negligibleeffect of solute segregation on activation energy were assumed. In this paper; an intactthermokinetic model for nanoscale grain growth was developed by incorporating mixedeffects of activation energy and grain boundary (GB) energy. By application of the model tonanoscale grain growth in Ni–P; Pb–Zr; Fe–Zr and Ru–Al alloys; the validity of the presentmodel was confirmed; in combination with verification of the initial condition of GBsegregation. On this basis; the increase of activation energy and the decrease of GB energyare interrelated and thus the kinetics and the thermodynamics of normal grain growth are …,Acta Materialia,2012,22

Efficient direct search on compressed genomic data,Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Chen Li; Jiaying Wang; Xiaohui Xie,The explosive growth in the amount of data produced by next-generation sequencing posessignificant computational challenges on how to store; transmit and query these data;efficiently and accurately. A unique characteristic of the genomic sequence data is that manyof them can be highly similar to each other; which has motivated the idea of compressingsequence data by storing only their differences to a reference sequence; thereby drasticallycutting the storage cost. However; an unresolved question in this area is whether it ispossible to perform search directly on the compressed data; and if so; how.

We found 99 new lakes and extensive lakeexpansion on the Tibetan Plateau during the last four decades; 1970–2013; due toincreased precipitation and cryospheric contributions to its water balance. This contrastswith disappearing lakes and drastic shrinkage of lake areas on the adjacent MongolianPlateau: 208 lakes disappeared; and 75% of the remaining lakes have shrunk. We detecteda statistically significant coincidental timing of lake area changes in both plateaus;associated with the climate regime shift that occurred during 1997/1998. This distinct changein 1997/1998 is thought to be driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation changes inresponse to climate warming.

Outlier detection over sliding windows for probabilistic data streams,Bin Wang; Xiao-Chun Yang; Guo-Ren Wang; Ge Yu,Abstract Outlier detection is a very useful technique in many applications; where data isgenerally uncertain and could be described using probability. While having been studiedintensively in the field of deterministic data; outlier detection is still novel in the emerginguncertain data field. In this paper; we study the semantic of outlier detection on probabilisticdata stream and present a new definition of distance-based outlier over sliding window. Wethen show the problem of detecting an outlier over a set of possible world instances isequivalent to the problem of finding the k-th element in its neighborhood.

The effect of coiling temperature and continuous annealing on the properties of bake hardenable IF steels,Koen Lips; Xiaohong Yang; Koen Mols,Abstract Five bake hardenable IF steels were investigated. The transformation andrecrystallization behaviour; the precipitation and the mechanical properties were studied.The coiling temperature was varied between 580 and 720 C. Soaking was carried out in atemperature range from 700 to 900 C and the soaking time ranged from 60 to 240 s. It wasfound that boron significantly retards transformation and recrystallization. The bakehardening is increased but deep drawability is lowered by boron additions. In the Ti-containing steels; TiS; Ti 4 C 2 S 2 and MnS precipitate competitively during the hot rollingprocess after reheating to 1250 C. To obtain a reasonable bake hardening effect; theamount of carbide forming elements should be substoichiometrical related to C.

Role of lipid metabolism in plant pollen exine development,Dabing Zhang; Jianxin Shi; Xijia Yang,Abstract Pollen plays important roles in the life cycle of angiosperms plants. It acts as notonly a biological protector of male sperms but also a communicator between the male andthe female reproductive organs; facilitating pollination and fertilization. Pollen is producedwithin the anther; and covered by the specialized outer envelope; pollen wall. Although themorphology of pollen varies among different plant species; the pollen wall is mainlycomprised of three layers: the pollen coat; the outer exine layer; and the inner intine layer.Except the intine layer; the other two layers are basically of lipidic nature. Particularly; theouter pollen wall layer; the exine; is a highly resistant biopolymer of phenylpropanoid andlipidic monomers covalently coupled by ether and ester linkages. The precise molecularmechanisms underlying pollen coat formation and exine patterning remain largely elusive …,*,2016,15
Dark counts of superconducting nanowire single-photon detector under illumination,Sijing Chen; Lixing You; Weijun Zhang; Xiaoyan Yang; Hao Li; Lu Zhang; Zhen Wang; Xiaoming Xie,An abnormal increase in the SDE was observed for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) when the bias current (I_b) was close to the switching current(I_sw). By introducing the time-correlated single-photon counting technique; we investigatedthe temporal histogram of the detection counts of an SNSPD under illumination. Thetemporal information helps us to distinguish photon counts from dark counts in the timedomain. In this manner; the dark count rate (DCR) under illumination and the accurate SDEcan be determined. The DCR under moderate illumination may be significantly larger thanthe conventional DCR measured without illumination under a high I_b; which causes theabnormal increase in the SDE. The increased DCR may be explained by the suppression ofI_sw under illumination.,Optics express,2015,15
Estimate of cumulative sediment trapping by multiple reservoirs in large river basins: An example of the Yangtze River basin,Xiankun Yang; XX Lu,Abstract Most existing models are unable to model large spatial pattern of reservoirsedimentation due to the difficulty in accounting for trapping by upstream reservoirs in amultiple reservoir system. In this study we developed and applied a framework on 1358 oflarge and medium-sized reservoirs (≥ 10 7 maximum storage capacity) for calculatingreservoir sedimentation rates in the multi-reservoir Yangtze River system while accountingfor the effect of reduced sediment input due to upstream traps. We further used statisticalinferences to assess the sedimentation rates of remaining 42;000 smaller reservoirs. Ourresults indicate that annual sediment accumulated in the Yangtze reservoirs isapproximately 691 (±93.7) million tons (Mt); 669 (±89.1) Mt of which is trapped by 1358 largeand medium-sized reservoirs and 22 (±4.6) Mt is trapped by smaller reservoirs.

However; the limited anticancer activity and dose-dependent toxicity restrict itsclinical application. Here; we offered convincing evidence that CA-4 induced autophagy invarious cancer cells; which was demonstrated by acridine orange staining of intracellularacidic vesicles; the degradation of p62; the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and GFP-LC3punctate fluorescence. Interestingly; CA-4-mediated apoptotic cell death was furtherpotentiated by pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1)or small interfering RNAs against the autophagic genes (Atg5 and Beclin 1). The enhancedanticancer activity of CA-4 and 3-MA was further confirmed in the SGC-7901 xenograft tumormodel.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 mediates melanocyte transformation via transactivation of insulin‐like growth factor 1 receptor,Jessica LF Teh; Raj Shah; Seung‐Shick Shin; Yu Wen; Janice M Mehnert; James Goydos; Suzie Chen,Summary Our laboratory previously described the oncogenic properties of metabotropicglutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in melanocytes. mGluR1 transformed immortalized mousemelanocytes in vitro and induced vigorous tumor formation in vivo. Subsequently; weobserved the activation of PI3K/AKT in mGluR1-mediated melanocytic tumorigenesis in vivo.In particular; we identified AKT2 being the predominant isoform contributing to the activationof AKT. Suppression of Grm1 or AKT2 using an inducible Tet-R siRNA system resulted in a60 or 30% reduction; respectively; in in vivo tumorigenesis. We show that simultaneousdownregulation of Grm1 plus AKT2 results in a reduction of approximately 80% in tumorvolumes; suggesting that both mGluR1 and AKT2 contribute to the tumorigenic phenotype invivo.

Modeling enterprise objects in a virtual enterprise integrating system: ViaScope,Xiaochun Yang; Guoren Wang; Ge Yu; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract The construction of information integrating systems for virtual enterprises raises aset of issues concerned with coupling the systems of independent enterprises in acontrolled; flexible and easily-understood manner. In particular; these independententerprises are typically large-scale; scattered on the Internet; and they involve in differentkinds of heterogeneous data or information. Basically; the information architectures rely onwide ranges of data sources that are not completely federated. Moreover; making thosearchitectures fatally ends up in a new system. In order to solve these problems; we reviewthe research work related to this paper as well as the needs to study on the constraintsbetween distributed objects. According to distributed object paradigm; we present theenterprise object modeling techniques in a CORBA/IIOP based enterprise integrating …,International Computer Science Conference,1999,14
Sanguinarine-induced apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells is dependent on reactive oxygen species production and endoplasmic reticulum stress,Shuang Gu; Xiao-Chun Yang; Xi-Yan Xiang; YAO Wu; YU Zhang; Xiao-Yu Yan; Ya-Nan Xue; Lian-Kun Sun; Guo-Guang Shao,Abstract Sanguinarine (SAN); an alkaloid isolated from plants of the Papaveraceae family; isa compound with multiple biological activities. In the present study; we explored theanticancer properties of SAN in lung cancer using the human lung adenocarcinoma cell lineSPC-A1. Our results revealed that SAN inhibited SPC-A1 cell growth and induced apoptosisin a dose-dependent manner. We found that SAN triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS)production; while elimination of ROS by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed the growthinhibition and apoptosis induced by SAN. SAN-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressresulted in the upregulation of many genes and proteins involved in the unfolded proteinresponse (UPR) pathway; including glucose‑regulated protein 78 (GRP78); p-protein kinaseR (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK); p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) …,Oncology reports,2015,13

Local filtering: Improving the performance of approximate queries on string collections,Xiaochun Yang; Yaoshu Wang; Bin Wang; Wei Wang,Abstract We study efficient query processing for approximate string queries; which findstrings within a string collection whose edit distances to the query strings are within thegiven thresholds. Existing methods typically hinge on the property that globally similarstrings must share at least certain number of identical substrings or subsequences. Theybecome ineffective when there are burst errors or when the number of errors is large. In thispaper; we explore the opposite paradigm focusing on finding out the differences of databasestrings to the query string. We propose a new filtering method; called local filtering; based onthe idea that two strings exhibiting substantial local dissimilarities must be globallydissimilar. We propose the concept of (positional) local distance to quantify the minimumamount of errors a query fragment contributes to the edit distance between the query and …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,13

Protecting sensitive relationships against inference attacks in social networks,Xiangyu Liu; Xiaochun Yang,Abstract The increasing popularity of social networks in various application domains hasraised privacy concerns for the individuals involved. One popular privacy attack is identifyingsensitive relationships between individuals. Simply removing all sensitive relationshipsbefore releasing the data is insufficient. It is easy for adversaries to reveal sensitiverelationships by performing link inferences. Unfortunately; most of previous studies cannotprotect privacy against link inference attacks. In this work; we identify two types of linkinference attacks; namely; one-step link inference attacks and cascaded link inferenceattacks. We develop a general framework for preventing link inference attacks; which adoptsa novel lineage tracing mechanism to efficiently cut off the inference paths of sensitiverelationships. We also propose algorithms for preventing one-step link inference attacks …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,13

Autophagy protects against dasatinib-induced hepatotoxicity via p38 signaling,Xiaochun Yang; Jincheng Wang; Jiabin Dai; Jinjin Shao; Jian Ma; Chao Chen; Shenglin Ma; Qiaojun He; Peihua Luo; Bo Yang,Abstract Liver dysfunction is a common side effect associated with the treatment of dasatiniband its mechanism is poorly understood. Autophagy has been thought to be a potentsurvival or death factor for liver dysfunction; which may shed the light on a novel strategy forthe intervention of hepatotoxicity caused by dasatinib. In this study; we show for the first timethat autophagy is induced; which is consistent with the formation of liver damage. Autophagyinhibition exacerbated dasatinib-induced liver failure; suggesting that autophagy acted as aself-defense mechanism to promote survival. Oxidative stress has been shown to be animportant stimulus for autophagy and hepatotoxicity. Interestingly; dasatinib increased theactivity of p38; which is a critical modulator of the oxidative stress related to liver injury andautophagy. p38 silencing significantly blocked LC3-II induction and p62 reduction by …,Oncotarget,2015,12

We base our approach on the GCC compiler which is considered asthe defacto open source compiler for several languages including C; C++; JAVA; ADA;FORTRAN; etc. To achieve our goal we use a conventional push down system model-checker for reachability properties; and turn it into a fully-fledged verification tool for both lowand high level software security properties. We also allow programmers to define a widerange of temporal security properties using an automata-based specification approach. As aresult; our approach can model-check large scale software against system-specific securityproperties.,Privacy; Security and Trust; 2008. PST'08. Sixth Annual Conference on,2008,10

Protecting individual information against inference attacks in data publishing,Chen Li; Houtan Shirani-Mehr; Xiaochun Yang,Abstract In many data-publishing applications; the data owner needs to protect sensitiveinformation pertaining to individuals. Meanwhile; certain information is required to bepublished. The sensitive information could be considered as leaked; if an adversary caninfer the real value of a sensitive entry with a high confidence. In this paper we study how toprotect sensitive data when an adversary can do inference attacks using association rulesderived from the data. We formulate the inference attack model; and develop complexityresults on computing a safe partial table. We classify the general problem into subcasesbased on the requirements of publishing information; and propose the correspondingalgorithms for finding a safe partial table to publish. We have conducted an empirical studyto evaluate these algorithms on real data.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,10

Bradykinin-induced airway constriction in guinea-pigs: role of leukotriene D4,DJ Turner; K Gupta; XX Yang; JG Martin,Abstract Tachykinins (TK) have been implicated in both bradykinin-(BK) and hyperpnea-induced broncho-constriction (HIB) in the guinea-pig. However; TKs appear to have anindirect effect in HIB by releasing leukotriene (LT) D 4. We postulated that BK may causebronchoconstriction through a cascade involving TK and LTD 4. We examined the role of TKand LTD 4 in BK-induced bronchoconstriction in ventilated Hartley guinea-pigs. Respiratoryresistance (R rs) was monitored for 2 h following insufflation of BK (150 nM).

This form of differentiation hasbeen generally associated with a poor prognosis and is often present in tumors with a poorlydifferentiated morphology. The development of a rhabdoid morphology appears to representa common dedifferentiation pathway for renal parenchymal malignancies. The aim of thisstudy is to evaluate the incidence and clinicopathologic features of RCC rhabdoiddifferentiation in Chinese adult patients and to further investigate its origin. We reviewed 723cases of RCC obtained between January 2012 and March 2014 in Peking University FirstHospital. From these cases; 10 (1.4%) were found to have areas of classic rhabdoidmorphology.

On-line/off-line threshold proxy re-signatures,Xiaodong YANG; Caifen WANG; Lei ZHANG; Jianbin QIU,Abstract—To improve the performance of threshold proxy re-signatures; the notion of on-line/off-line threshold proxy re-signatures is introduced. The bulk of re-signature computationcan be done in the off-line phase before the message arrives. The results of this pre-computation are saved and then utilized in the on-line phase once a message to be re-signed is known. Based on any threshold proxy re-signature scheme and a thresholdversion of chameleon hash function; we present a generic on-line/off-line threshold proxy re-signature scheme that can convert any existing secure threshold proxy re-signature schemeinto an on-line/off-line one. The on-line phase of our scheme is efficient: computing a re-signature share requires one round of communication; two modular additions and onemodular multiplication.

Its structure was confirmed byUV spectra; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra; 1 H nuclear magneticresonance; and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectra. Thecontent of Na element was determined by inductive coupled plasma atomic emissionspectroscopy. The mass content of Na in the product obtained from the conventional routewas about 10%; and it could be almost completely eliminated by dialysis with a membraneof molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) 8-15 kDa. The yield of fullerol by the dialysis methodwas slightly higher than by the conventional route. These results indicate that dialysis …,Chinese Journal of Chemical Engineering,2010,9

Integrating HTML tables using semantic hierarchies and meta-data sets,Seung-Jin Lim; Yiu-Kai Ng; Xiaochun Yang,As the Internet is a global network; there is a demand on accessing closely related datawithout browsing through different Web documents. A significant amount of these data arepresented in HTML documents. Since data contents of HTML documents are intervened bymarkups; it is not trivial to integrate and provide a unified view of closely related data indifferent HTML documents. In this paper we present an approach for integrating semanticallyrelated data in any HTML tables that belong to a particular domain of interest (ID); such ashouse/apartment rental; by using the semantic hierarchies generated from the tables and thepredefined meta-data sets that indicate related column names in ID. In our approach; wecapture each data source as semi-structured data; called semantic hierarchy; and the endresult of integrating different HTML tables of ID is a unified view of data in the tables …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2002.

Efficiently Mapping Integrity Constraints from Relational Database to XML Document1,Xiaochun Yang; Ge Yu; Guoren Wang,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the dominant standard for exchanging data on theWWW. Most of application data are stored in relational databases due to its popularity andrich development experiences over it. Therefore; how to provide a proper mapping approachfrom relational data to XML documents becomes an important topic. Integrity constraints areuseful for semantic specification that plays the important roles in relation schema definition.The existing XML schema language does not define general constraints and maintainingmethod for integrity constraints. So how to use XML to express and maintain integrityconstraints especially the advanced integrity constraints; eg; general constraints of relationaldata is one of challenge research issues. In this paper; a novel mapping approach isproposed to map relation data to XML document with active nodes; XML A; and extended …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2001,9

Clinical benefits; however; have been elusive. Here; weidentify an SRY-related box 2 (SOX2) transcriptional regulatory network that is independentof upstream RTKs and capable of driving glioma-initiating cells. We identifiedoligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) and zinc-finger E-box bindinghomeobox 1 (ZEB1); which are frequently co-expressed irrespective of driver mutations; aspotential SOX2 targets. In murine glioma models; we show that different combinations oftumor suppressor and oncogene mutations can activate Sox2; Olig2; and Zeb1 expression.We demonstrate that ectopic co-expression of the three transcription factors can transformtumor-suppressor-deficient astrocytes into glioma-initiating cells in the absence of an …,Cell reports,2017,8
An approximate dynamic programming approach for improving accuracy of lossy data compression by Bloom filters,Xinan Yang; Alexei Vernitski; Laura Carrea,Abstract Bloom filters are a data structure for storing data in a compressed form. They offerexcellent space and time efficiency at the cost of some loss of accuracy (so-called lossycompression). This work presents a yes–no Bloom filter; which as a data structure consistingof two parts: the yes-filter which is a standard Bloom filter and the no-filter which is anotherBloom filter whose purpose is to represent those objects that were recognized incorrectly bythe yes-filter (that is; to recognize the false positives of the yes-filter). By querying the no-filterafter an object has been recognized by the yes-filter; we get a chance of rejecting it; whichimproves the accuracy of data recognition in comparison with the standard Bloom filter of thesame total length. A further increase in accuracy is possible if one chooses objects toinclude in the no-filter so that the no-filter recognizes as many as possible false positives …,European Journal of Operational Research,2016,8

Effects of phycocyanin on INS-1 pancreatic β-cell mediated by PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway,Yingnv Gao; Gaoyong Liao; Chenxi Xiang; Xuegan Yang; Xiaodong Cheng; Yu Ou,Abstract The level of methylglyoxal (MG); which is a side-product of metabolic pathways;particularly in glycolysis; is elevated in diabetes. Notably; the accumulation of MG causes aseries of pathological changes. Phycocyanin (PC) has been demonstrated to show insulin-sensitizing effect; however; the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. The aimof this study was to investigate the protective effects of PC on INS-1 rat insulinoma β-cellagainst MG-induced cell dysfunction; as well as the underlying mechanisms. PC waspreliminarily verified to time-dependently activate PI3-kinase (PI3K) pathway; but the PI3K-specific inhibitor Wortmannin blocked the effect of PC. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion(GSIS) was impaired in MG-treated INS-1 cells. Furthermore; MG induceddephosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1; resulting in nuclear localization and transactivation …,International journal of biological macromolecules,2016,8
The heat shock transcription factor PsHSF1 of Phytophthora sojae is required for oxidative stress tolerance and detoxifying the plant oxidative burst,Yuting Sheng; Yonglin Wang; Harold JG Meijer; Xinyu Yang; Chenlei Hua; Wenwu Ye; Kai Tao; Xiaoyun Liu; Francine Govers; Yuanchao Wang,Summary In the interaction between plant and microbial pathogens; reactive oxygen species(ROS) rapidly accumulate upon pathogen recognition at the infection site and play a centralrole in plant defence. However; the mechanisms that plant pathogens use to counteract ROSare still poorly understood especially in oomycetes; filamentous organisms that evolvedindependently from fungi. ROS detoxification depends on transcription factors (TFs) that arehighly conserved in fungi but much less conserved in oomycetes. In this study; we identifiedthe TF PsHSF1 that acts as a modulator of the oxidative stress response in the soybean stemand root rot pathogen Phytophthora sojae. We found that PsHSF1 is critical for pathogenicityin P. sojae by detoxifying the plant oxidative burst. ROS produced in plant defence can bedetoxified by extracellular peroxidases and laccases which might be regulated by …,Environmental microbiology,2015,8

Dietary obese individuals are inclined toovereat high caloric foods. However; it is still unclear whether the taste or postingestivereinforcement mainly contributes to the excessive intake by obese individuals. In the presentstudy; we measured 10-or 120-min sucrose solution drunk by dietary obese rats andmeasured c-Fos expression following 120-min tests in the central nucleus of amygdala(CeA); a forebrain nucleus involved in the hedonic reward and craving; and the parabrachialnucleus (PBN); a taste relay area responsive to positive postingestive effects. Dietary obeserats; compared with those fed normal chow; ingested larger amounts of sucrose solution(0.25 M) in the 120-min test; but not in the 10-min test.

Role of the lateral hypothalamus in modulating responses of parabrachial gustatory neurons in the rat,Qi Lei; Jianqun Yan; Tao Huang; Jinghong Shi; Xuejuan Yang; Bo Lv; Qiang Li,Abstract The lateral hypothalamus (LH) receives projections from the parabrachial nucleus(PBN) gustatory neurons and sends efferent projections to the PBN. To examine if the LH isinvolved in modulating activity of gustatory neurons in the PBN; we examined the effects ofelectrical stimulation and electrolytic lesions of the LH on the response of PBN gustatoryneurons; using extracellular recording techniques. Among 45 PBN taste neurons recorded;60% were affected by LH stimulation and 73% were affected by LH lesions. During LHstimulation; the responses of most affected PBN neurons were inhibited with the magnitudesignificantly lower than that obtained before stimulation (P< 0.05). In contrast; LH lesionsfacilitated the response. Based on the best-stimulus category; the responses of the NaCl-best neurons to NaCl and HCl and the QHCl-best neurons to HCl and QHCl were …,Brain research bulletin,2008,8
Algorithm for optimizing multidimensional K-NN queries in wireless sensor networks.,Zhi-Bin Zhao; Ge Yu; Bin-Yang Li; Lan Yao; Xiao-Chun Yang,This paper presents a filter-based algorithm called PREDICTOR for optimizingmultidimensional K-NN queries in WSN. A filter installed at each sensor node is a nodevalue distribution range. It is used to prevent the node from sending the data that belongs tothe covering range of the filter; and so the node's energy is saved. The server keeps thehistorical sample data of all the nodes; and determines filters for them according to the queryrequirement and the samples. Three optimization strategies are proposed:(1) the method fordynamically adjusting the assignment strategies of the filter covering ranges so that a nodewith little chance to contribute to the final result is assigned with a larger covering range;(2)the method for sharing the filter among nodes so that the nodes with similar historical dataare assigned with the same filter;(3) the method for transmitting filters in a compressed …,Ruan Jian Xue Bao(Journal of Software),2007,8

PET-based bisBODIPY photosensitizers for highly efficient excited triplet state and singlet oxygen generation: tuning photosensitizing ability by dihedral angles,Xian-Fu Zhang; Xudong Yang; Baomin Xu,Herein; four covalent BODIPY heterodimers that differ by dihedral angles were shown to behighly efficient excited triplet state (T1) photosensitizers (PSs) for singlet oxygen formationwith a quantum yield (ΦΔ) of up to 0.94 as compared to their respective monomers; whichhad only negligible ΦΔ of ca. 0.060. More interestingly; these PSs generate T1via chargerecombination mechanism rather than traditional inter-system crossing. The photosensitizingability of dimers is easily tuned by either the dihedral angle (between the two linkedBODIPYs) or solvent polarity.

A BTLA-Mediated Bait and Switch Strategy Permits Listeria Expansion in CD8α+ DCs to Promote Long-Term T Cell Responses,Xuanming Yang; Xunmin Zhang; Yonglian Sun; Tony Tu; May Lynne Fu; Mendy Miller; Yang-Xin Fu,Summary Listeria monocytogenes infected CD8α+ DCs in the spleen are essential for CD8+T cell generation. CD8α+ DCs are also necessary for Listeria expansion and disseminationwithin the host. The mechanisms that regulate CD8α+ DCs to allow Listeria expansion areunclear. We find that activating the B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); a coinhibitoryreceptor for T cells; suppresses; while blocking BTLA enhances; both the primary andmemory CD8 T cell responses against Listeria. Btla−/− mice have lower effector and memoryCD8+ T cells while paradoxically also being more resistant to Listeria. Although bacterialentry into Btla−/− CD8α+ DCs is unaffected; Listeria fails to expand within these cells. BTLAsignaling limits Fas/FasL-mediated suppression of Listeria expansion within CD8α+ DCs tomore effectively alert adaptive immune cells. This study uncovers a BTLA-mediated …,Cell host & microbe,2014,7
Phosphorescence of BODIPY dyes,Xian-Fu Zhang; Xudong Yang; Kui Niu; Hao Geng,Abstract The phosphorescence of BODIPY dyes was observed directly in glassy solventmatrix at 78 K. The phosphorescence occurred when Br substituents are present on theBODIPY core and the solvent temperature is lower than the freezing point. Thephosphorescence quantum yield (Φ p) and lifetime (τ p) were measured. The substitutioneffect of Br atoms on the phosphorescence properties of 8-phenyl-BODIPY dyes is alsostudied. Upon the increase in the number of Br atoms on the BODIPY core; thephosphorescence emission maximum is varied from 720 to 780 nm; the correspondingexcited triplet state energy changes from 1.71 to 1.62 eV; the lifetime τ p is shortened from5.8 to 3.7 ms; while the quantum yield Φ p is decreased from 3.0× 10− 3 to 1.4× 10− 3.

However; the graph reachability isseverely distorted after the anonymization. In this paper; we solve this problem by designinga reachability preserving anonymization (RPA for short) algorithm. The main idea of RPA isto organize vertices into groups and greedily anonymizes each vertex with lowanonymization cost on reachability. We propose the reachable interval to efficiently measurethe anonymization cost incurred by an edge addition; which guarantees the high …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,7

Multilayered graphene membrane as an experimental platform to probe nano-confined electrosorption,Chi Cheng; Julia Uhe; Xiaowei Yang; Yanzhe Wu; Dan Li,Abstract Multilayered graphene membranes (MGMs) with different packing densities wereprepared and used as electrodes for supercapacitors to probe nano-confinedelectrosorption in porous carbon materials. The electrosorption capacity of MGMs wasmeasured against an increasing operation rate in a series of aqueous solutions ofmonovalent ions. The nano-confinement effect was found prominent when the microscopicpore structure of the MGMs was controlled to be comparable to the size of hydrated ionsbeing tested. The electrosorption capacity was found highly dependent on the type of ions.This study highlights the great potential of using easily available and structurally tunablegraphene membranes as a model system to investigate fundamental problems relating toenergy storage; membrane separation and nanofluidics.,Progress in Natural Science: Materials International,2012,7

Mapping referential integrity constraints from relational databases to XML,Xiaochun Yang; Guoren Wang,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the dominant standard for exchanging data on theWWW. Most of application data are stored in relational databases due to its popularity andrich development experiences over it. Therefore; how to provide a proper mapping approachfrom relational data to XML documents becomes an important topic. Referential integrityconstraints are useful for semantic specification that plays the important roles in relationschema definition. So far; there are about a dozen of XML schema languages have beenproposed. Although most languages are based on DTD; they have different grammarresulting in the XML world more complicated. In this paper; we investigate referentialintegrity constraints for XML.

An approximate dynamic programming approach to attended home delivery management,Xinan Yang; Arne K Strauss,Abstract We propose a new method of controlling demand through delivery time slot pricingin attended home delivery management with a focus on developing an approach suitable forindustry-scale implementation. To this end; we exploit a relatively simple yet effective way ofapproximating delivery costs by decomposing the overall delivery problem into a collectionof smaller; area-specific problems. These cost estimations serve as inputs into anapproximate dynamic programming method that provides estimates of the opportunity costassociated with having a customer from a specific area book delivery in a specific time slot.These estimates depend on the area and on the delivery time slot under consideration.Using real; large-scale industry data; we estimate a demand model including a multinomiallogit model of customers' delivery time slot choice; and show in simulation studies that we …,European Journal of Operational Research,2017,6
Negative factor: Improving regular-expression matching in strings,Xiaochun Yang; Tao Qiu; Bin Wang; Baihua Zheng; Yaoshu Wang; Chen Li,Abstract The problem of finding matches of a regular expression (RE) on a string exists inmany applications; such as text editing; biosequence search; and shell commands. Existingtechniques first identify candidates using substrings in the RE; then verify each of them usingan automaton. These techniques become inefficient when there are many candidateoccurrences that need to be verified. In this article; we propose a novel technique thatprunes false negatives by utilizing negative factors; which are substrings that cannot appearin an answer. A main advantage of the technique is that it can be integrated with manyexisting algorithms to improve their efficiency significantly. We present a detailed descriptionof this technique.

Reconstruction of a paleotemperature record from 0.3–3.7 ka for subtropical South China using lacustrine branched GDGTs from Huguangyan Maar,Jianfang Hu; Haoda Zhou; Ping'an Peng; Xiaoqiang Yang; Baruch Spiro; Guodong Jia; Gangjian Wei; Tingping Ouyang,Abstract The concentrations of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in catchmentsoils; suspended particulate matter (SPM); lake bottom sediments; and sediment cores fromHuguangyan Maar; subtropical South China; were investigated. The distribution ofisoprenoid GDGTs has GDGT-0/crenachaol> 2 and therefore the widely used TEX 86 isprecluded from being used for the calculation of lake water temperature in this lake. The totalconcentration of branched GDGTs (br-GDGTs) in the soils; SPM; and lake bottom sedimentsranged from 91.3–223.7 ng/g; 17.8–41.4 ng/L; and 864.2–2008.6 ng/g; respectively. Themolecular composition of br-GDGTs; MBT values (methylation of br-GDGTs); and CBTvalues (the cyclization ratio of br-GDGTs) in the catchment soils differ from those in lakematerials. This difference indicates that br-GDGTs in the lake are largely produced in situ …,Palaeogeography; Palaeoclimatology; Palaeoecology,2015,6

Flexible threshold proxy re-signature schemes,XD Yang; CF Wang; CH Lan; Biao Wang,Abstract—Threshold proxy re-signatures are extensions of proxy re-signatures where re-signature keys are shared among n proxies in such a way that at least k out of n proxiesmust collaborate to generate the delegator's signatures. The adversary must compromise atleast k proxies to learn the re-signing key. Threshold proxy re-signature can protect re-signature key from the attack of internal and external adversaries. However; thresholdvalues in previous threshold proxy re-signatures are fixed. Two flexible threshold proxy re-signature schemes are proposed in this paper; which are existentially unforgeable androbust in the standard model. Based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem; threshold valueand the number of proxies can be altered with the significance of the document to be signed.According to the variable threshold value; each proxy can locally generate his re …,Chinese Journal of Electronics,2011,6

Comparison of Indoor Environment of a Locally Concentrated Cleanroom at Occupied and Unoccupied Status by Numerical Method,Bin Zhao; Li Cao; Xianting Li; Xudong Yang; Dongtao Huang,The existing standard for cleanrooms is based on an unoccupied state where there are nopeople or furniture inside the room. However; the distribution of airflow and particles in acleanroom may differ significantly in an occupied state with the presence of people andfurniture. This paper first validates a numerical model for simulating the air distribution in alocally concentrated cleanroom. Then the indoor airflow and the pollutant concentration in alocally concentrated bio-clean operation room (BCOR) are simulated at both occupied andunoccupied states by the validated model. The comparison of results shows the environmentis very different between the two cases. Thus; human bodies and furniture should beproperly considered when evaluating the environment in the locally concentratedcleanroom.,Journal of the IEST,2004,6

SAP: Improving continuous top-k queries over streaming data,Rui Zhu; Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Baihua Zheng; Guoren Wang,Continuous top-k query over streaming data is a fundamental problem in database. In thispaper; we focus on the sliding window scenario; where a continuous top-k query returns thetop-k objects within each query window on the data stream. Existing algorithms support thistype of queries via incrementally maintaining a subset of objects in the window and try toretrieve the answer from this subset as much as possible whenever the window slides.However; since all the existing algorithms are sensitive to query parameters and datadistribution; they all suffer from expensive incremental maintenance cost. In this paper; wepropose a self-adaptive partition framework to support continuous top-k query. It partitionsthe window into sub-windows and only maintains a small number of candidates with highestscores in each sub-window.

Compact multi-band fluorescent microscope with an electrically tunable lens for autofocusing,Zhaojun Wang; Ming Lei; Baoli Yao; Yanan Cai; Yansheng Liang; Yanlong Yang; Xibin Yang; Hui Li; Daxi Xiong,Autofocusing is a routine technique in redressing focus drift that occurs in time-lapsemicroscopic image acquisition. To date; most automatic microscopes are designed on thedistance detection scheme to fulfill the autofocusing operation; which may suffer from the lowcontrast of the reflected signal due to the refractive index mismatch at the water/glassinterface. To achieve high autofocusing speed with minimal motion artifacts; we developed acompact multi-band fluorescent microscope with an electrically tunable lens (ETL) device forautofocusing. A modified searching algorithm based on equidistant scanning and curvefitting is proposed; which no longer requires a single-peak focus curve and then efficientlyrestrains the impact of external disturbance. This technique enables us to achieve anautofocusing time of down to 170 ms and the reproductivity of over 97%. The imaging …,Biomedical optics express,2015,5

Colorization using edge-preserving smoothing filter,Ahmed A Hussein; Xiaochun Yang,Abstract Colorization is the process of replacing a scalar value stored at each pixel of agrayscale image or film by a vector in a multidimensional color space. Mapping betweenscalar and color is therefore not unique; and colorization is ambiguous in nature andrequires some amount of human interaction or external information. This paper presents anew method of interactive colorization by introducing a new concept to the bilateral filter. Weadopt the bilateral filter as a range weights filter (bilateral filter without Gaussian spatialdomain); and we show that the Nikolaou filter is equivalent to the range weights bilateralfilter; but has better behavior near the edges. In our algorithm; the user selects grayscaleimage regions by directly painting these regions; the user does not need to paint over thewhole object. Each selection can be automatically expanded from the user's paint brush …,Signal; Image and Video Processing,2014,5

An efficient trip planning algorithm under constraints,Jinling Bao; Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Jiaying Wang,The problem of trip planning has received wide concerns in recent years. More and morepeople require the service of automatically confirming the optimal tour route. When usersassign the source and the destination; and the time limit of the tour; how can automaticallydecide the optimal tour route with the highest sum of the popularity scores of scenic spots.Current methods for trip planning are on the setting that providing with the route which iscomposed of the scenic spots to travel. These would work poorly for the pre-mentionedproblem when the route satisfying the constraints can not be found. Thus we adjust thesetting to giving the route composed of the scenic spots which users visit or simply pass by.Obviously; the modified problem would incur larger search cost as each scenic spot in thegiven route has two states.

Protecting sensitive labels in weighted social networks,Ke Chen; Hongyi Zhang; Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang,With the popularity of social networks; data privacy preserving in social networks hasbecome a hot issue among scholars. An attacker can use a variety of backgroundknowledge to attack against privacy. Most of the present technology on anonymity weightedsocial network graphs can only deal with edge weight; but cannot be applied to sensitivelabels. We consider a new generalization approach for sensitive labels; which can affordutility without compromising privacy. In this paper; we investigate the sensitive label privacydisclosure problem in weighted graph; propose k-histogram-inverse-l-diversity (KH-inv-LDfor short) anonymity to protect sensitive label information; and develop a label anonymousapproach to achieve this model. Extensive experiments on real data sets show that thealgorithm performs well in terms of sensitive label privacy protection in weighted graph.,Web Information System and Application Conference (WISA); 2013 10th,2013,5

Dispersion relations of externally and thermally excited dust lattice modes in 2D complex plasma crystals,Xue-Feng Yang; Yue Liu; Jian Cui; Yuan Zhang,The dispersion relations of the externally and thermally (naturally) excited dust lattice modes(both longitudinal and transverse) in two-dimensional Debye-Yukawa complex plasmacrystals are investigated. The dispersion relations are calculated numerically by taking theneutral gas damping effects into account and the numerical results are in agreement with theexperimental data given by Nunomura et al.[Phys. Rev. E 65; 066402 (2002)]. It is found thatfor the mode excited by an external disturbance with a real frequency; the dispersionproperties are changed at a critical frequency near where the group velocity of the modegoes to zero. Therefore; the high frequency branch with negative dispersion cannot bereached.

Protecting location privacy using cloaking subgraphs on road network,Jiao Xue; Xiangyu Liu; Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang,Mobile users traveling over roads often issue KNN queries based on their current locationswith their mobile terminals (eg where is the nearest gas station?). However; exact locationinformation transmitted to an unsecure server will easily lead the mobile user to be tracked.Thus it is important to protect mobile users' location privacy while providing location-basedservices. People traveling over roads always follow a road network. We observe that twocloaking subgraph structures; which we name cloaking cycle and cloaking tree; can be usedto protect mobile users' location privacy effectively in road network environment. Based onthese two subgraph structures; we propose a novel location privacy preserving approachusing cloaking cycle and forest; which can effectively protect mobile users' location privacywhile efficiently providing exact location-based services.,Web Information Systems and Applications Conference (WISA); 2010 7th,2010,5
A new forward-secure threshold proxy re-signature scheme,Xiaodong Yang; Caifen Wang; Yulei Zhang; Weiyi Wei,A forward-secure threshold proxy re-signature scheme in the standard model is firstlyproposed in this paper. The scheme has the property that it is infeasible to forge valid proxyre-signatures relating to the past even if more than or equal to the threshold proxies arecorrupted. Re-signature keys are updated at regular periods of time. It implies that past proxyre-signatures remain secure if the current re-signature key is leaked. The scheme isprovably robust; forward-secure and unforgettable without relying on the random oraclemodel.

Associated load shedding strategies for computing multi-joins in sensor networks,Xiaochun Yang; Lin Li; Yiu-Kai Ng; Bin Wang; Ge Yu,Abstract In sensor networks; multi-join queries are processed by joining sensor datagenerated at different sensor nodes. Due to the energy constraint; however; sometimes onlypartial sensor data can be transmitted to the join site. In handling the energy constraint oneach sensor node; the load shedding strategy under the MAX-subset principle has beenconsidered for shedding selected data at each node so that transmitted data may yield themaximal possible results in a multi-join. Existing load shedding approaches; however;isolate sensor data to be joined; which often do not yield the maximal results. To obtain asmany results as possible; we propose two load shedding strategies; the basic localassociated shedding strategy and the global associated shedding strategy; based ondifferent shedding constraints in this paper.

A k-anonymizing approach for preventing link attacks in data publishing,Xiaochun Yang; Xiangyu Liu; Bin Wang; Ge Yu,Abstract K-anonymization is an important approach to protect data privacy in datapublishing. It is desired to publish k-anomymized data with less information loss. However;the existing algorithms are not feasible enough to satisfy such a requirement. We propose ak-anonymization approach; Classfly for publishing as much data as possible. For any attribute;in stead of generalizing all values; Classfly only generalizes partial values that do not satisfyk-anonymization. As a side-effect; Classfly provides higher efficiency than existingapproaches; since not all data need to be generalized. Classfly also considers the case ofsatisfying multiple anonymity constraints in one published table; which makes it morefeasible for real applications. Experimental results show that the proposed Classflyapproach can efficiently generate a published table with less information loss.,International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing and Applications,2005,5

To address related research challenges; we develop a system called XGuard;which can help data owners publish a partial XML document without leaking sensitiveinformation; even if public users can do inference. Specifically; the system has the followingfunctionalities. i) It allows the data owner to define sensitive information and specify commonknowledge as XML constraints. ii) Given a partial document; the system can validate if thedocument can cause information leakage due to common knowledge and how much datacan be leaked. iii) The system can help the data owner interactively analyze the datainference and produce a secure valid partial document using the algorithms.,Data Engineering; 2005.

The β2-agonist Salbutamol Inhibits Bronchoconstriction and Leukotriene D4Synthesis After Dry Gas Hyperpnea in the Guinea-pig,XX Yang; G Ho; LJ Xu; WS Powell; JG Martin,Abstract Isocapnic dry gas hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB) in the guinea-pig ismediated by both tachykinin release from airway sensory nerve C-type fiber terminals andsecondary synthesis of cysteinyl-leukotrienes; in particular LTD 4. Beta (β) 2-agonists arepotent bronchodilators but potentially could also inhibit the airway response to hyperpneachallenge via effects on the release of LTD 4 from airway cells in vivo. The purpose of thisstudy was to test the hypothesis that β 2 agonists attenuate HIB in guinea-pigs; in part; byreduction in LTD 4 release in vivo. Twenty-six guinea-pigs (400–550 g) were anesthetizedwith xylazine (7 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (65 mg/kg); tracheotomized and mechanicallyventilated with a small animal ventilator using a tidal volume of 3 ml and a breathingfrequency of 60 breaths/min.

We haveidentified a 4.31±0.14 cm error in the Z (cross-track) direction that defines the center-of-massof the SARAL satellite in the spacecraft coordinate system; and we have tuned the SLR andDORIS tracking point offsets. After these changes; we reduce the average RMS of the SLRresiduals for seven-day arcs from 1.85 to 1.38 cm. We tuned the non-conservative forcemodel for SARAL; reducing the amplitude of the daily adjusted empirical accelerations byeight percent. We find that the best dynamic orbits show altimeter crossover residuals of5.524 cm over cycles 7–15. Our analysis offers a unique illustration that high-elevation …,Advances in Space Research,2016,4
MicroRNA-133b inhibits the migration and invasion of non small cell lung cancer cells via targeting FSCN1,Xucheng Yang; Pengfei Lei; Yong Huang; Zijian Zhang; Yingying Zhang,Abstract MicroRNA (miR)-133b has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor in multipletypes of human cancers; including non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However; theunderlying mechanism by which miR‑133b inhibits NSCLC metastasis remains largelyunclear. In the present study; reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reactionand western blotting were used to detect messenger RNA and protein expression. A woundhealing assay and transwell assay were used to examine the cell migration and invasion.The expression level of miR‑133b was found to be significantly downregulated in NSCLCcell lines compared with normal lung epithelial BEAS‑2B cells. Further investigationidentified fascin1 (FSCN1) as a direct target of miR‑133b in NSCLC cells.

Divisible on-line/off-line proxy re-signature,Xiaodong Yang; Chunmei Li; Yan Li; Sian Zhou; Caifen Wang,Abstract: To improve the real-time efficiency of proxy re-signature schemes; a notion calleddivisible on-line/off-line proxy resignatures is introduced in this paper. The idea of this notionis to split the re-signing algorithm into two phases: the off-line and on-line phases. The proxycan perform the bulk of re-signature computation in the off-line phase before seeing themessage to be re-signed. The results of this pre-computation are saved and then used in theon-line phase after the message to be re-signed is given. Divisible on-line/off-line proxy re-signatures are very useful in a particular scenario where the proxy must respond quicklyonce the message to be re-signed is presented. In a divisible on-line/off-line proxy re-signature scheme; the partial re-signature might be exposed before the message to be re-signed arrives. We then propose a generic divisible on-line/off-line proxy re-signature …,Applied Mathematics & Information Sciences,2015,4
The influence of solid-state grain growth mechanism on the microstructure evolution in undercooled Ni–10at.% Fe alloy,Z Chen; Q Chen; F Liu; XQ Yang; Y Fan; CH Zhang; AM Liu,Abstract The effect of solid-state grain growth mechanism on the microstructure evolutionwas investigated by employing the glass fluxing technique in undercooled Ni–10at.% Fealloy. The continuous phenomenon of grain size refinement; coarsening and refinement withundercooling (ΔT) was found and corresponded to different mechanism of grain growth afterrecrystallization: normal growth (ΔT< 70 K)→ abnormal growth (70 K< ΔT< 180 K)→ normalgrowth (ΔT> 180 K). Applying the calculation of stress accumulation model after rapidsolidification; the influence of ΔT on the driving force of grain growth was analyzed. Incombination of the solute trapping model of undercooled melt and solute drag model of solid-state grain growth; the relationship between ΔT and drag force was proposed. Finally; themechanism of alternant grain growth with ΔT was studied.,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,2015,4
Red fluorescent monobenzo-BODIPY dyes: Solvent effects on spectra and efficient fluorescence quenching by quinones and phenols,Xudong Yang; Xian-Fu Zhang; Xulin Lu; Changjiang Yu; Lijuan Jiao,Abstract The fluorescence properties of five monobenzo-BODIPY compounds weremeasured in nonpolar and polar solvents by UV–vis absorption; steady-state fluorescenceand time-correlated single-photon counting methods. These monobenzo-BODIPY dyes emitbright red fluorescence (wavelength> 605 nm) with high fluorescence quantum yields (Φ f≥0.60) which are slightly affected by solvent polarity. The fluorescence lifetimes of theseBODIPY compounds are also long (τ f∼ 5 ns) and not affected remarkably by solventpolarity. These fluorescence properties make them good fluorescent markers/probes in thered visible region. Quinones can efficiently quench the fluorescence of monobenzo-BODIPYs with the dynamic quenching rate constants in the order of 10 10 L mol− 1 s− 1;suggesting that the BODIPY compounds can act as good electron donors for …,Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry,2015,4

A secure K‐automorphism privacy preserving approach with high data utility in social networks,Jun Yang; Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Hongyi Zhang; Guang Xiang,ABSTRACT The prevalence of social networks has raised the concern for individual privacyleakage. Although preserving user privacy in social networks has been studied extensively;there is still a lot of room for improvement in the state of the art techniques. For example; therecently proposed K-automorphism model can prevent node identity attack by constructing aK-automorphism graph; however; it ignores preserving the privacy of the edges; resulting inpath length leakage and edge leakage in the anonymous graph. Another example is the K-isomorphism model; which was proposed to improve the K-automorphism model bytransforming the graph of social networks into K disjoined isomorphic subgraphs. However;it cuts off the connection among subgraphs; which impairs the data utility of the releasedanonymous graph. In this paper; we design a secure and high utility privacy preserving …,Security and Communication Networks,2014,4
Density functional study of hydrogen adsorption and diffusion on Ni‐loaded graphene and graphene oxide,Qingzheng Li; Houyuan Wang; Haiping Xia; Shihao Wei; Jianhui Yang,Abstract In this work; we performed density functional calculations to investigate theadsorption and diffusion of hydrogen on Ni-loaded graphene and single layer grapheneoxide (SLGO). We evaluated the feasibility of hydrogen spillover in the presence of Ni 4cluster and the role of oxygen-containing groups. Our calculations indicate that the hydrogendiffusion is difficult to take place on the Ni/graphene interface due to the stronger Ni [BOND]H bond strength. Further; the chemisorbed H atoms are also hard to diffuse freely on thegraphene surface. For the SLGO surface; both hydroxyl and epoxide groups may notfacilitate the hydrogen diffusion. Instead; they are readily attracted by the nearby Ni catalystand hydrogenated to water molecules.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals; Inc.,International Journal of Quantum Chemistry,2014,4
Broadband circularly polarized slot antenna array with fan-shaped feed line and L-shaped grounded strips,Ping Xu; Ze-Hong Yan; Tian-Ling Zhang; Xiao-Qiang Yang,Abstract: A broadband circularly polarized (CP) slot antenna array fed by a coplanarwaveguide (CPW) is proposed. A fan-shaped feed line and three L-shaped grounded stripsare embedded in the square slot antenna element to enlarge the bandwidth. Simulatedresults show that the antenna element can obtain a wide impedance bandwidth with-10 dBreflection coefficient covering 1.7-6.3 GHz (about 115% relative bandwidth) and 3 dB axialratio (AR) bandwidth covering 2.6-5.2 GHz (about 66%). Using four elements with sequentialphase feed; the measured impedance bandwidth and axial ratio bandwidth of the antennaarray can be enhanced to 105%(1.65-5.35 GHz) and 71.3%(2.3-4.85 GHz); respectively.Good radiation characteristics with the peak gain of 10.8 dBic over the operating band canbe obtained.

The comparison of both direction andrelative intensity with other adjacent records confirmed that the non-dipole field has commonfluctuations in the centennial to millennial timescales. This pattern provides some profoundtied points to correlate the sediment sequence in the different deposition environments. Thesignificant age offsets of the similar secular variation features between the different recordscorroborate the radiocarbon errors in dating the sediments. This work further showed thatthe geomagnetic secular variations can serve as an effective tool to determine thesediments' age and correlate the stratigraphy for the different deposition environments in …,The Holocene,2013,4

Visual sign language recognition based on HMMs and auto-regressive HMMs,Xiaolin Yang; Feng Jiang; Han Liu; Hongxun Yao; Wen Gao; Chunli Wang,Abstract A sign language recognition system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) andAuto-regressive Hidden Markov Models (ARHMMs) has been proposed in this paper.ARHMMs fully consider the observation relationship and are helpful to discriminate signswhich don't have obvious state transitions while similar in motion trajectory. ARHMM whichmodels the observation by mixture conditional linear Gaussian is proposed for signlanguage recognition. The corresponding training and recognition algorithms for ARHMMare also developed. A hybrid structure to combine ARHMMs with HMMs based on the trick ofusing an ambiguous word set is presented and the advantages of both models are revealedin such a frame work.,International Gesture Workshop,2005,4

A protein secondary structure prediction framework based on the support vector machine,Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Yiu-Kai Ng; Ge Yu; Guoren Wang,Abstract Our framework for predicting protein secondary structures differs from existingprediction methods since we consider physio-chemical information and context informationof secondary structure segments. We have employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) fortraining the CB513 and RS126 data sets; which are collections of protein secondarystructure sequences; through sevenfold cross validation to uncover the structural differencesof protein secondary structures. We apply the sliding window technique to test a set ofprotein sequences based on the group classification learned from the training data set. Ourprediction approach achieves 77.8% segment overlap accuracy (SOV) and 75.2% three-state overall per-residue accuracy (Q 3) on CB513 set; which outperform existing proteinsecondary structure prediction methods.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2003,4

H-MRST: a novel framework for supporting probability degree range query using extreme learning machine,Bin Wang; Rui Zhu; Shiying Luo; Xiaochun Yang; Guoren Wang,Abstract Background/Introduction Data classification is an important application in thedomain of cognitive computation; which has various applications. In this paper; we useclassification techniques to solve some key issues in answering range query overprobabilistic data. The key of answering this query is to store the feature of each uncertainobject in a lightweight structure and use these structures for pruning/validating. However; inthese works; the costly integral calculation has to be carried out when dealing with objectsthat cannot be pruned/validated; and some of the structure construction algorithms are notgeneral. Methods In this paper; we employ ELM; a popular classification technique; to tacklethe above issues. Our proposed methods are as follows: We firstly propose a new querycalled PDR (short for probabilistic degree range) query to substitute the traditional prob …,Cognitive Computation,2017,3
Robust berth allocation using a hybrid approach combining branch-and-cut and the genetic algorithm,Ghazwan Alsoufi; Xinan Yang; Abdellah Salhi,Abstract Seaside operations at container ports often suffer from uncertainty due to eventssuch as the variation in arrival and/or processing time of vessels; weather conditions andothers. Finding a robust plan which can accommodate this uncertainty is therefore desirableto port operators. This paper suggests ways to generate robust berth allocation plans incontainer terminals. The problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer programming modelwhose main objective is to minimize the total tardiness of vessel departure time. It is thensolved exactly and approximately. Experimental results show that only small instances of theproposed model can be solved exactly. To handle large instances in reasonable times; theGenetic Algorithm (GA) is used. However; it does not guarantee optimality and often theapproximate solutions returned are of low quality. A hybrid meta-heuristic which …,International Workshop on Hybrid Metaheuristics,2016,3

Diffeomorphic metric landmark mapping using stationary velocity field parameterization,Xianfeng Yang; Yonghui Li; David Reutens; Tianzi Jiang,Abstract Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) has been shown as aneffective computational paradigm to measure anatomical variability. However; its time-varying vector field parameterization of diffeomorphism flow leads to computationallyexpensive implementation; as well as some theoretical issues in metric based shapeanalysis; eg high order metric approximation via Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff (BCH) formula.To address these problems; we study the role of stationary vector field parameterization incontext of LDDMM. Under this setting registration is formulated as finding the Lie groupexponential path with minimal energy in Riemannian manifold of diffeomorphisms bringingtwo shapes together.

The importin α subunit PsIMPA1 mediates the oxidative stress response and is required for the pathogenicity of Phytophthora sojae,Xinyu Yang; Fa Ding; Lei Zhang; Yuting Sheng; Xiaobo Zheng; Yuanchao Wang,Abstract The sensing of extracellular signals and their transduction into an appropriateresponse are crucial for the survival and virulence of plant pathogens. Eukaryotic plantpathogens must overcome the obstacles posed by nuclear membranes to manipulate geneexpression to adapt to the host challenge. A highly sophisticated mechanism is the use ofimportins to transport proteins into the nucleus. In this study; we identified a conservedimportin α gene; PsIMPA1; in Phytophthora sojae that was differentially expressed duringthe life cycle of this soybean pathogen. PsIMPA1 expression was lowest in zoospores andcysts but relatively consistent during the other life cycle stages; except for a slight increase at6 h post infection. Silenced mutants Psimpa1 had a decreased growth rate; an aberrantmycelial morphology; and a severely impaired ability to form oospores and sporangia. In …,Fungal Genetics and Biology,2015,3

Regulation of ribonucleotide reductase during iron limitation,Alexandra Seguin; Diane McVey Ward; Jerry Kaplan,DNA replication and repair are essential processes in which the limiting step is the availabilityof deoxynucleotides. The size of deoxynucleotide pools is controlled by the activity of the ribonucleotidereductase (RNR) that catalyzes the conversion of all four nucleotides to the corresponding deoxynucleotidesand provides the monomeric precursors for DNA synthetic processes. RNR is an important targetfor cell growth control and is therefore tightly regulated through the cell cycle and by DNAdamage. RNR is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels. During DNA damageor S phase; the activity of RNR is also regulated by selective movement of RNR subunits fromnucleus to cytosol. In this issue of Molecular Cell; Sanvisens et al.

A statistical approach to interactive image segmentation,Ahmed A Hussein; Xiaochun Yang,Interactive segmentation aims to separate an object of interest from the rest of an image.This problem in computer vision is known to be hard; and very few fully automatic visionsystems exist which have been shown to be accurate and robust under all sorts ofchallenging inputs. Most of the previous works require users to trace the whole boundary ofthe object. When the object has a complicated boundary; or the object is in a highly texturedregion; users have to put great effort into iteratively correcting the selection. To solve thisproblem; most researchers rely on computing cost function for the purpose of control on theboundary of the region. Minimizing cost function yields a large; sparse system of linearequations. This paper presents a new interactive algorithm by introducing new equations forimage foreground background separation.

Investigation of oil‐motion non‐uniformity in a reflective display based on electrowetting,Li Chen; Yan Tu; Lili Wang; Qiaofen Li; Xin Yang; Jun Xia; B Johan Feenstra; Andrea Giraldo; Nadin Rösler,Abstract—A novel reflective display based on electrowetting technology has gained muchattention because of its readability in sun light. This technology can provide high-efficiencycontrol of the display pixel reflectivity. In the on-state; the oil droplet is expected to move tothe same corner regularly. To realize uniform motion of the oil; it is possible to provide asymmetry-breaking mechanism in the pixel. However; depending on the uniformity of theprocessing and the size of the built-in symmetry breaking; it is possible that the oil actuallymoves to a different position. The visibility of defects; by the representation of oil-motion non-uniformity; depending on different notch pattern; notch size; and defect type; has beeninvestigated in the perception experiments. Results indicate that the influence of the defectsis more obvious for the more preferred pattern. The larger the notch sizes; the easier the …,Journal of the Society for Information Display,2010,3
Late Quaternary pollen records and climate significance in Guangzhou,XJ Wang; JH Wang; LL Cao; Jie YANG; Xiaoqiang YANG; Zhuolun PENG; Gangxiong JIN,Through the pollen analysis; combined with the informations on dating and sedimentation oftwo drilling cores located at different deposition-geomorphological area in the northern andsouthern part of Guangzhou; the deposition environmental and climatic changes since thelate Pleistocene in Guangzhou; the Pearl River Delta; are suggested. Pollen records showthat the climate during the late Pleistocene changed as below: partially dry-cold; slightly cool-dry; warm-humid; hot-moisture below; partially cool-dry; cold-dry. The obvious influence fromthe Last Maximum Glaciation resulted in the difference of pollen assemblage characteristicsbetween the Holocene and the late Pleistocene. The climate became generally warm andhumid in the Holocene; but being alterated with some minor climatic fluctuation events; egthe most obvious partial dry-cool transition around 2250a BP.

Image indexing by color plane moment,Shinfeng D Lin; Kuo‐Hae Chen; Xin‐Lun Yang,Abstract Among the features of content-based image retrieval; color features provideimportant clues to search similar image contents. In addition to color; there exists moreinformation in the image. In this article; we propose a new method for content-based imageretrieval: Color Plane Moment (CPM). This method combines colors' content and their spatialdistribution to improve image query results. It integrates the ideas of color histogram;backprojection; and moments. The CPM uses backprojection as one of the imagepreprocessing methods and computes the invariant moments with those dominant colorplane images after preprocessing. There are several dominant colors chosen by colorhistogram in an image; and each can be expressed by seven invariant moment values thatrepresent spatial distribution of those dominant color planes; respectively.

Novel membership-function-dependent stability condition for TS fuzzy systems,Xiaozhan Yang; Hak-Keung Lam; Ligang Wu,This paper presents an idea to further simplify and relax the linear matrix inequality (LMI)stability conditions of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems. By considering the distribution ofmembership functions in a unified space; we can easily find the overall relation of theoriginal nonlinear system and its approximated local subsystems. Based on the theory ofconvex combination; the upper-bounds and lower-bounds of each membership functionscan be directly used to construct less conservative LMI conditions. The cases of both Type-1and Type-2 systems are considered; and examples are provided to illustrate the achievedimprovement.,Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,2

CITPM: a cluster-based iterative topical phrase mining framework,Bing Li; Bin Wang; Rui Zhou; Xiaochun Yang; Chengfei Liu,Abstract A phrase is a natural; meaningful; essential semantic unit. In topic modeling;visualizing phrases for individual topics is an effective way to explore and understandunstructured text corpora. Unfortunately; existing approaches predominately rely on thegeneral distributional features between topics and phrases on an entire corpus; while ignorethe impact of domain-level topical distribution. This often leads to losing domain-specificterminologies; and as a consequence; weakens the coherence of topical phrases. In thispaper; we present a novel framework CITPM for topical phrase mining. Our framework viewsa corpus as a mixture of clusters (domains); and each cluster is characterized by documentssharing similar topical distributions. The CITPM framework iteratively performs phrasemining; topical inferring and cluster updating until a satisfactory final result is obtained …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2016,2

A system in laboratory is devised for the NOsteady state measurement. An ICL laser whose center wavelength is 5263 nm is chosen forthe detection. With the direct detection method; a resolution about 2 ppm is realized; and therelative error is less than 5%. In contrast to the direct detection method; the harmonicdetection method realizes a higher resolution; and the error is better less 3%. Consideringwith the temperature fluctuation of the diesel emission; the absorption line strength iscalculated from 300 K to 500 K. At the same time; the intensity of the 2f signal is measured;which is proportional to the change of the line strength. So a modification can be importedeasily to avoid the error produced by the temperature fluctuation. The TDLAS proposed in …,Optik-International Journal for Light and Electron Optics,2016,2
Influence and choice shifts in households: An experimental investigation,Xiaojun Yang; Fredrik Carlsson,Abstract In this paper; we examine the relative influence of individual decisions on jointhousehold decisions; and whether and to what extent joint choices are more or less patientthan individual choices in households. We find that both spouses have a significantinfluence on joint decisions; whereas husbands on average have a stronger influence thanwives. Moreover; we find a substantial share of choice shifts from individual to jointhousehold decisions; ie joint decisions are either more patient or more impatient than bothindividual choices. A number of observable characteristics are significantly correlated withthese shifts in preferences from individual decisions to joint decisions.,Journal of Economic Psychology,2016,2

In utero exposure to low-dose alcohol induces reprogramming of mammary development and tumor risk in MMTV-erbB-2 transgenic mice,Zhikun Ma; Amanda J Blackwelder; Harry Lee; Ming Zhao; Xiaohe Yang,Abstract: There is increasing evidence that prenatal exposure to environmental factors maymodify breast cancer risk later in life. This study aimed to investigate the effects of in uteroexposure to low-dose alcohol on mammary development and tumor risk. Pregnant MMTV-erbB-2 mice were exposed to alcohol (6 g/kg/day) between day 13 and day 19 of gestation;and the female offspring were examined for tumor risk. Whole mount analysis indicated thatin utero exposure to low-dose alcohol induced significant increases in ductal extension at 10weeks of age. Molecular analysis showed that in utero alcohol exposure inducedupregulation of ERα signaling and activation of Akt and Erk1/2 in pubertal mammary glands.However; enhanced signaling in the EGFR/erbB-2 pathway appeared to be more prominentin 10-week-old glands than did signaling in the other pathways.

Refreshment strategies for the shortest path caching problem with changing edge weight,Xiaohua Li; Tao Qiu; Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Ge Yu,Abstract The problem of caching shortest paths which aims at reducing the computationaltime of servers has been widely studied. All the existing methods addressing this problemassume that the graph status does not change with time. Based on this assumption; theyanalyze shortest paths query logs and prefer to load paths with the most query frequencyinto the cache. However; the graph status is actually affected by many factors andundoubtedly changes with time in the real work. As the existing approaches ignore thechange of graph status; they cannot guarantee the efficient use of caches. In this paper; wefirst exploit properties related with changing graphs. Then we develop an algorithm to detectshortest paths affected by weight change of edges. After detection affected paths in a cache;several heuristic based refreshment strategies are proposed to update the cache. In the …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2014,2
Approximate Self-Adaptive Data Collection in Wireless Sensor Networks,Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Wanyu Zang; Meng Yu,Abstract To extend the lifetime of wireless sensor networks; reducing and balancing energyconsumptions are main concerns in data collection due to the power constrains of thesensor nodes. Unfortunately; existing data collection schemes mainly focus on energysaving while overlook balancing the energy consumption of the sensor nodes. In addition;most of them assume that each sensor has a global knowledge about the network topology.However; in many real applications; such a global knowledge is not desired due to thedynamic features of the wireless sensor network. In this paper; we propose an ApproximateSelf-Adaptive data collection technique (ASA); to approximately collect data in a distributedwireless sensor network.

An improved algorithm to enhance the utilization of shortest path caches,Xiaohua Li; Shimeng Wang; Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Ge Yu,The caching has been developed for shortest path queries. At present; existing methods forthe shortest path caching include the dynamic cache method Least-Recently-Used (LRU);the static cache method Highest-Query-Frequency (HQF); as well as a recently proposedmethod Shortest" Path" Cache (SPC). It is commonly known that LRU and HQF are notefficient enough for the shortest path caching. To the best of our knowledge; SPC is the state-of-art technique in the shortest path caching. However; in their method; they fully rely on theinformation from the historical log; making their method over fit the historical log. In thisregard; this paper proposes an improved cache loading method; in which we try to cover asmany paths as possible. At the same time; the cache utilization is maximized.

Efficient secure data publishing algorithms for supporting information sharing,XiaoChun Yang; Bin Wang; Ge Yu,Abstract Many data sharing applications require that publishing data should protect sensitiveinformation pertaining to individuals; such as diseases of patients; the credit rating of acustomer; and the salary of an employee. Meanwhile; certain information is required to bepublished. In this paper; we consider data-publishing applications where the publisherspecifies both sensitive information and shared information. An adversary can infer the realvalue of a sensitive entry with a high confidence by using publishing data. The goal is toprotect sensitive information in the presence of data inference using derived associationrules on publishing data. We formulate the inference attack framework; and developcomplexity results. We show that computing a safe partial table is an NP-hard problem.

The effect of multilayer structure on magnetic properties of FePt thin films,DONG Kaifeng; YANG Xiaofei; YAN Junbing; Weiming Cheng; Xiaomin Cheng,The Fe/Pt multilayer films with different structures were deposited by RF magnetronsputtering on glass substrates; and the L1 0-FePt films were obtained after the as-depositedsamples were subjected to vacuum annealing at various temperatures. Results show thatthe Fe/Pt multilayer structure can effectively reduce the ordering temperature of FePt film;and the in-plane coercivity of [Fe (5.2 nm)/Pt (5.2 nm)] 7 multilayers can reach 161.2 kA/mafter annealed at 350° C for 30 min. When Fe and Pt layer thickness is equal; the coercivityof the film is the largest. On the other hand; the different Fe-Pt crystalline phases such as Fe3 Pt and FePt 3 phases are formed after annealing when the thickness ratio of Fe/Pt deviatesfrom 1 after annealing. When Fe and Pt have the same thickness; the thinner single layergets the lower ordering temperature and the larger coercivity.,Acta Metallurgica Sinica (English letters),2009,2

Hybrid neural network architecture for on-line learning,Yuhua Chen; Subhash Kak; Lei Wang,Abstract: Approaches to machine intelligence based on brain models have stressed the useof neural networks for generalization. Here we propose the use of a hybrid neural networkarchitecture that uses two kind of neural networks simultaneously:(i) a surface learningagent that quickly adapt to new modes of operation; and;(ii) a deep learning agent that isvery accurate within a specific regime of operation. The two networks of the hybridarchitecture perform complementary functions that improve the overall performance. Theperformance of the hybrid architecture has been compared with that of back-propagationperceptrons and the CC and FC networks for chaotic time-series prediction; the CATSbenchmark test; and smooth function approximation. It has been shown that the hybridarchitecture provides a superior performance based on the RMS error criterion.,arXiv preprint arXiv:0809.5087,2008,2

Differential crosssections were measured for scattering process of Hn.+ He→ H-n'.+ He at the collisionenergy of 0. 526 eV. Experimental result indicates that the scattered H-n'. product is mainlyforward distributed* with signals observed in the wide range of angles at the sideway andforward scattering directions. At the sideway and forward directions* a lot of oscillatorystructures in the angular distributions are present. Detailed analysis also shows that theprinciple quantum number* n* is not changed much for the Rydberg H atom at the forwardscattering direction. This work provides a good test ground to investigate theoretically theexact collision dynamics between the high-n Rydberg H atom and the helium atom.,Chinese Journal of Chemical Physics,2005,2

Comparison of Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors Made of NbTiN and NbN Thin Films,Xiaoyan Yang; Lixing You; Lu Zhang; Chaolin Lv; Hao Li; Xiaoyu Liu; Hui Zhou; Zhen Wang,We fabricated superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) made of NbTiNand NbN thin films in the same fabrication batch. Various parameters; such as criticaltemperature; resistivity; switching current; and kinetic inductance; were compared betweenthe two types of SNSPDs. These data indicate that NbTiN SNSPD surpasses NbN SNSPD inmany aspects; including a shorter recovery time due to smaller kinetic inductance; a lowertiming jitter due to higher switching current; and better uniformity. Based on themeasurement of 28 out of 121 NbTiN SNSPDs on a 2-in Si wafer; 71% of detectors show asystem detection efficiency of over 50% at a dark count rate of 100 Hz; with the maximumefficiency being 77.5%.,IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity,2018,1
Buformin inhibits the stemness of erbB-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells and premalignant mammary tissues of MMTV-erbB-2 transgenic mice,Amanda B Parris; Qingxia Zhao; Erin W Howard; Ming Zhao; Zhikun Ma; Xiaohe Yang,Metformin; an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of Type II diabetes; has emerged as apromising anti-cancer agent. Other biguanide analogs; including buformin and phenformin;are suggested to have similar properties. Although buformin was shown to reduce mammarytumor burden in carcinogen models; the anti-cancer effects of buformin on different breastcancer subtypes and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore; we aimed toinvestigate the effects of buformin on erbB-2-overexpressing breast cancer with in vitro andin vivo models. MTT; cell cycle; clonogenic/CFC; ALDEFLUOR; tumorsphere; and Westernblot analyses were used to determine the effects of buformin on cell growth; stem cellpopulations; stem cell-like properties; and signaling pathways in SKBR3 and BT474 erbB-2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines.

Phenformin inhibits growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells through targeting the IGF1R pathway,Zhiying Guo; Ming Zhao; Erin W Howard; Qingxia Zhao; Amanda B Parris; Zhikun Ma; Xiaohe Yang,Abstract Reports suggest that metformin; a popular anti-diabetes drug; prevents breastcancer through various systemic effects; including insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR)regulation. Although the anti-cancer properties of metformin have been well-studied; reportson a more bioavailable/potent biguanide; phenformin; remain sparse. Phenformin exertssimilar functional activity to metformin and has been reported to impede mammarycarcinogenesis in rats. Since the effects of phenformin on specific breast cancer subtypeshave not been fully explored; we used ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell and animalmodels to test the anti-cancer potential of phenformin. We report that phenformin (25–75 μM)decreased cell proliferation and impaired cell cycle progression in SKBR3 and 78617 breastcancer cells. Reduced tumor size after phenformin treatment (30 mg/kg/day) was …,Oncotarget,2017,1
An evolutionary approach to a combined mixed integer programming model of seaside operations as arise in container ports,Abdellah Salhi; Ghazwan Alsoufi; Xinan Yang,Abstract This paper puts forward an integrated optimisation model that combines threedistinct problems; namely berth allocation; quay crane assignment; and quay cranescheduling that arise in container ports. Each one of these problems is difficult to solve in itsown right. However; solving them individually leads almost surely to sub-optimal solutions.Hence; it is desirable to solve them in a combined form. The model is of the mixed-integerprogramming type with the objective being to minimize the tardiness of vessels and reducethe cost of berthing. Experimental results show that relatively small instances of theproposed model can be solved exactly using CPLEX. Large scale instances; however; canonly be solved in reasonable times using heuristics. Here; an implementation of the geneticalgorithm is considered. The effectiveness of this implementation is tested against CPLEX …,Annals of Operations Research,2017,1
Most influential community search over large social networks,Jianxin Li; Xinjue Wang; Ke Deng; Xiaochun Yang; Timos Sellis; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Detecting social communities in large social networks provides an effective way to analyzethe social media users' behaviors and activities. It has drawn extensive attention from bothacademia and industry. One essential aspect of communities in social networks is outerinfluence which is the capability to spread internal information of communities to externalusers. Detecting the communities of high outer influence has particular interest in a widerange of applications; eg; Ads trending analytics; social opinion mining and newspropagation pattern discovery. However; the existing detection techniques largely ignore theouter influence of the communities.

Individual differences in behavioral activation and cardiac vagal control influence affective startle modification,Xiao Yang; Bruce H Friedman,Abstract The startle response (SR) has a close relationship with stress responses. Startlemodification (SRM) has been widely used to study stress disorders (eg; posttraumatic stressdisorder). The framework of the behavioral inhibition and activation systems (BIS/BAS) hasbeen thought to correspond with withdrawal and approach motivational processesunderlying affective SRM and can influence stress reactivity. Vagally-mediated cardiacactivity as indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with SRM andregulatory processes during stress. In the present study; the influence of individualdifferences in the BIS/BAS and resting HRV on affective SRM were examined. Eighty-sixsubjects viewed affective pictures while acoustic SR stimuli were delivered. Individualdifferences in motivation were measured by the BIS/BAS scales.

Top-k representative documents query over geo-textual data stream,Bin Wang; Rui Zhu; Xiaochun Yang; Guoren Wang,Abstract The increasing popularity of location-based social networks encourages more andmore users to share their experiences. It deeply impacts the decision of customers whenshopping; traveling; and so on. This paper studies the problem of top-K valuable documentsquery over geo-textual data stream. Many researchers have studied this problem. However;they do not consider the reliability of documents; where some unreliable documents maymislead customers to make improper decisions. In addition; they lack the ability to prunedocuments with low representativeness. In order to increase user satisfaction inrecommendation systems; we propose a novel framework named PDS. It first employs anefficiently machine learning technique named ELM to prune unreliable documents; and thenuses a novel index named G ℋ GH to maintain documents.

Theoretical and experimental study on conveying behavior of a twin-screw multiphase pump,Bin Hu; Feng Cao; Xiaoqiang Yang; Xiaolin Wang; Ziwen Xing,In this paper; the conveying behavior of a twin-screw multiphase pump is investigated whenit pumps either pure water or gas–liquid mixtures with gas void fractions varying from 20% to90%. A prototype of the twin-screw multiphase pump is developed and set up in a laboratoryfor this purpose. A theoretical model is established to evaluate backflow rates in the twin-screw pump clearances; total pump volume flow rates; and power consumptions at variouspressure differences and gas void fractions. Results show that the predictions from themodel agree well with experimental data. For pumping pure water; the power consumptionincreases by 45.3% when the pressure difference between inlet and outlet of the twin-screwmultiphase pump increases from 0.6 to 1.0 MPa. However; the effect of the pressuredifference on the total pump flow rate is negligible.

Range-based obstructed nearest neighbor queries,Huaijie Zhu; Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract In this paper; we study a novel variant of obstructed nearest neighbor queries;namely; range-based obstructed nearest neighbor (RONN) search. A natural generalizationof continuous obstructed nearest-neighbor (CONN); an RONN query retrieves the obstructednearest neighbor for every point in a specified range. To process RONN; we first propose aCONN-Based (CONNB) algorithm as our baseline; which reduces the RONN query into arange query and four CONN queries processed using an R-tree. To address theshortcomings of the CONNB algorithm; we then propose a new RONN by R-tree Filtering(RONN-RF) algorithm; which explores effective filtering; also using R-tree. Next; we proposea new index; called O-tree; dedicated for indexing objects in the obstructed space. Thenovelty of O-tree lies in the idea of dividing the obstructed space into non-obstructed …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,1
A Novel Spatial Cloaking Scheme Using Hierarchical Hilbert Curve for Location-Based Services,Ningning Cui; Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang,Abstract With the rapid development of positioning and wireless technologies; Location-based Services (LBS) appear anywhere in our daily life. Though LBS brings a greatconvience to users; the location privacy is vulnerable in many ways (eg; untrusted LBSServer). To address privacy issues; we propose HHScloak; a novel Hierarchical HilbertCurve Spatial Cloaking algorithm to effectively achieve k-anonymity for mobile users in LBS.Different from existing methods; we take Average Query Density (AQD) into consideration;and generate the Anonymity Set (AS) which satisfies reciprocity and uniformity. Based on thehierarchical method and optimal splitting bucket strategy; our scheme provides a largercloaking region which guarantees privacy level.

An adaptive approach of approximate substring matching,Jiaying Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Chengfei Liu,Abstract Approximate substring matching is a common problem in many applications. In thispaper; we study approximate substring matching with edit distance constraints. Existingmethods are very sensitive to query strings or query parameters like query length and editdistance. To address the problem; we propose a new approach using partition scheme. Itfirst partitions a query into several segments; and finds matching substrings of thesesegments as candidates; then performs a bidirectional verification on these candidates toget final results. We devise an even partition scheme to efficiently find candidates; and abest partition scheme to find high quality candidates. Furthermore; through theoreticalanalysis; we find that the best partition scheme cannot always outperform the even partitionscheme. Thus we propose an adaptive approach for selectively choosing scheme using …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2016,1

TBX20 is a crucial transcription factor for the development of embryoniccardiovascular system. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in the TBX20coding region contribute to familial and sporadic CHD occurrence. However; it remainslargely unknown whether variants in the TBX20 regulatory region are also related to CHDs.In this study; we sequenced the 2 kb region upstream of the TBX20 transcription start site in228 CHD patients and 292 controls in a Han Chinese population.

Synthesis of chiral ND-322; ND-364 and ND-364 derivatives as selective inhibitors of human gelatinase,Yugang Yan; Xueying Chen; Xinying Yang; Jian Zhang; Wenfang Xu; Yingjie Zhang,Abstract Compounds 10 (ND-322) and 15 (ND-364) are potent selective inhibitors forgelatinases; matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9).However; both of them are racemates. Herein we report facile synthesis of optically active(R)-and (S)-enantiomers of compounds 10 and 15. And the sulfonyl of 15 was transformed tosulfinyl to obtain four epimeric mixtures. All synthesized thiirane-based compounds wereevaluated in MMP2 and MMP9 inhibitory assays. Our results indicated that the configurationof thiirane moiety had little effects on gelatinase inhibition; but the substitution of sulfinyl forsulfonyl was detrimental to gelatinase inhibition.

Modified dust-acoustic waves in dusty plasma with Lennard-Jones potential,YZ Qian; H Chen; XS Yang; SQ Liu,Abstract Dust-acoustic waves in a dusty plasma are investigated by solving the Vlasovequation including the effect of dust-dust interaction modeled by a Lennard-Jones-likepotential. The latter contains a potential well and is applicable when thermionic or photoemission processes are important. It is shown that the excitation and linear dispersion of thedust-acoustic waves are strongly modified. In fact; the phase of the dust acoustic waves isshifted and a cut-off for the long-wavelength modes appears; leading to a purely growinginstability.,Astrophysics and Space Science,2015,1

Grain growth and thermal stability in nanocrystalline Fe–B alloys prepared by melt spinning,Zheng Chen; Xiaoqin Yang; Feng Liu; Rongxin Cui; Qiang Chen; Chonghao Zhang,Using the melt spinning technique; a nanocrystalline (NC) Fe–B single-phase solid solutionwas prepared at a disk speed of 7 000 rpm. After treatment by isothermal annealing at 700°C for the NC solid solution; the grain growth behavior was investigated using thedimensionless parabolic growth model; the dimensionless purely kinetic model; and arecently proposed dimensionless thermo-kinetic model. Neither the parabolic growth modelnor the purely kinetic growth model with solute drag was in agreement with the experimentalresults; although the grain growth rate was partially inhibited. However; the thermo-kineticmodel was consistent with the experimental results; which confirmed that the mainstabilizing mechanism is a reduction in the grain boundary energy and an increase in theinterface activation energy.,International Journal of Materials Research,2015,1
Single-arm helical antenna with width of arm varying periodically for tilted beam,Tian-Ling Zhang; Xiao-Qiang Yang; Dong-Liang Fei; Ze-Hong Yan,A single-arm helical antenna with the width of the arm varying periodically for a circularlypolarised (CP) tilted beam is introduced. The proposed antenna radiates a CP tilted beam;when the following two conditions are met:(i) the circumference of the proposed antenna is>4λ 0/3 (λ 0 is the wavelength in free space at the centre frequency) and (ii) the width of thearm varies periodically. The designed procedure reveals that the maximum radiationdirection of the tilted beam is not sensitive to a change in frequency. The simulated andmeasured results show that the designed antenna radiates a CP tilted beam with θ max=32°. The measured 10 dB return loss bandwidth is 12.8% from 2.33 to 2.65 GHz; and theexperimental results of the radiation pattern; gain and axial ratio are also presented.,Electronics Letters,2015,1

The measurement of geocentric sea level change from satellitealtimetry requires an extreme stability of the altimeter measurement system since the signalbeing measured is at the level of a few mm/yr. Many of the obstacles previously impedingthe measurement and validation of estimates of GMSL from satellite altimetry have beenovercome (Fu and Haines; 2012). Nonetheless; measuring sea level rates at the precisionrequired for climate science continues to be challenging for at least two reasons:(1) theTerrestrial Reference Frame (TRF) realizations are determined using space geodetic dataover finite time spans; and must be periodically updated;(2) the dynamic nature of the Earthengenders global and regional variations in the geopotential which if not properly …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2014,1
Multi-constrained optimal path search algorithms,Jinling Bao; Bin Wang; Shuchao Yan; Xiaochun Yang,Abstract The problem of trip planning has received wide concerns in recent years. More andmore people require the service of automatically confirming the optimal tour path. Whenusers assign the source; the destination and the permitted time of the tour; how do we helpthem find the optimal path with the maximum popularity score? The multi-constrainedoptimal path search solutions have been used to solve the trip planning problem widely.However; when the permitted time is not enough to visit all attractions in any path; existingmethods can not find the path satisfying the constraints. The time and the popularity scoreare different when we select the different attractions to visit in the same path. So we proposea new search rule to answer above issue; making a choice on any node (visit or pass by)according to the tradeoff between permitted time and popularity score of attractions.

Analysis of thermal stability after occurrence of absolute solute trapping in undercooled Co–Cu alloy,XQ Yang; Z Chen; W Yang; JT Liu,Thermal stability after recalescence of the single-phase supersaturated granular grainsprepared in Co-15 at.% Cu immiscible alloy melt was investigated. As for undercooled Co–Cu alloy; a transition from dendritic to granular crystals occurred when Δ T≥ Δ T∗; whichwas induced by an abrupt change in the dendritic growth mechanism from solute-controlledto purely thermally-controlled growth. However; the recalescence effect led to grain growthand solute segregation of trapped Cu to grain boundaries. On this basis; a thermo-kineticmodel applicable for nano-scale materials was extended to the system of micro-scaleundercooled Co–Cu alloy. The model showed close agreement with the experimentalresults. It is concluded that Cu atoms captured by solute trapping re-segregated to grainboundaries; which was responsible for the reduction in grain boundary energy and …,International Journal of Materials Research,2013,1

Learning about vegetarian diets in school: Curricular representations of food and nutrients in elementary health education,Clara Hanson,This paper examines the way non-meat and plant based diets are discussed in fourelementary curricula. The author used an open coding technique of grounded theory tounderstand the way food; nutrition and vegetarianism was discussed. The curricula reliedheavily upon the USDA Food Pyramid and a related concept of “balance” for nutritionalinformation. The curricula also discussed nutrition in terms of food and food groups; ratherthan in terms of nutrients. Although some of the curricula included information about thebenefits of vegetarian diets; the high level of use of the Food Pyramid often overwhelmed thelow level of information about vegetarianism.,Advances in Applied Sociology,2012,1

Transition from high-order commensurate to incommensurate phase in organic films: rubrene on Bi (0001),Xiu-fan YANG; Meng Lan; Ting-na SHAO; Jia-le XIE; Mao-lu DU; Ming XU; Jun-zhong WANG,A transition from high-order commensurate phase to weak incommensurate phase (HC-WI)has been found in rubrene films grown on Bi (0001) surface. The HC phase corresponds toa self-assembled rubrene bilayer with point-on-line coincident match with Bi (0001). The WIphase can be described as a collection of incommensurate domains separated bycommensurate domain walls with well-developed patterns. A large anisotropic strain hasbeen found in the incommensurate domains; which exhibits orthorhombic latticesresembling the ab plane of crystalline rubrene. Depending on the substrate temperature; thedomain walls may exhibit zigzagged networks at room temperature; or linear stripe patternsat elevated temperature. The formation of different domain wall patterns can be regarded asthe result of complicated interplay of the anisotropic strain relief and rotational epitaxy.,Journal of Chinese Electron Microscopy Society,2011,1

A data storage method based on query processing region in wireless sensor networks,Fangfang Li; Chuanwen Li; Xiaochun Yang; Ge Yu,With extensive applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs); a WSN system with singlefunction such as sea-monitoring and accident succor is expected to supply much moreabilities for effective periodic queries or ad hoc queries; because some applications requirereal-time queries since the results should be returned before deadlines. Meanwhile; efficientdata storage technique is always necessary to save energy in the query procedure. Forthese reasons; we propose a new data storage technique based on query processingregion. A query processing region is developed to store the data by using an indexingstrategy and to process the queries in real time; and the model for the process of queryprocessing is also built.

Continually answering constraint k-NN queries in unstructured P2P systems,Bin Wang; Xiao-Chun Yang; Guo-Ren Wang; Ge Yu; Lei Chen; X Sean Wang; Xue-Min Lin,Abstract We consider the problem of efficiently computing distributed geographical k-NNqueries in an unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) system; in which each peer is managed by anindividual organization and can only communicate with its logical neighboring peers. Suchqueries are based on local filter query statistics; and require as less communication cost aspossible; which makes it more difficult than the existing distributed k-NN queries. Especially;we hope to reduce candidate peers and degrade communication cost. In this paper; wepropose an efficient pruning technique to minimize the number of candidate peers to beprocessed to answer the k-NN queries. Our approach is especially suitable for continuous k-NN queries when updating peers; including changing ranges of peers; dynamically leavingor joining peers; and updating data in a peer.

Different effects of silane and carboxyled polypropylene on crystal morphology of polypropylene/molecular sieves type 5A composites,Zhi‐Ling Ma; Hua‐Ying Guo; Wei Jia; Xiao‐Jing Yang,Abstract The silane KH-550 and carboxyled polypropylene (EPP) were used ascompatibilizers in this study. The effect of them on crystalline morphology of polypropylene/molecular sieves type 5A (PP/5A) composites was investigated. IR illustrated that 5Ainteracts with EPP by forming molecule interaction or hydrogen bonds; but interacts withsilane by covalent bonds. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)revealed that a suitable amount of silane can promote β-crystal formation in PP; and theaverage size of spherulites in the PP/5A/silane is smaller than that of PP. EPP interacts with5A by molecule interaction and cocrystallizes with PP; leading to the crystal morphology ofPP/5A/EPP resembles to that of pure PP. Significant difference was detected in the effect ofthe two compatibilizers; which attributed to the different compatibility mechanisms.© 2007 …,Journal of applied polymer science,2007,1

A Slack Factors Based Real-Time Query Processing Approach in Wireless Sensor Networks,Fangfang Li; Ge Yu; Xiaochun Yang; Chuanwen Li; Zhibo Feng,For mission-critical applications such as emergency monitoring over wireless sensornetworks; query deadline must be satisfied. Otherwise; the query results would be useless.Thus; it is better to query the nodes as many as possible within the deadline. On the otherhand; the energy consumption should be saved to prolong the life of the network. For thispurpose; we propose a slack factor based real-time query processing (SFQ) approach forwireless sensor networks; where a slack factor describes the relationship between the timeof query processing and the deadline for a node. Since the data delivery mode betweennodes is a key factor for data transmission time and energy consumption; we can choose theoptimal data delivery mode by using slack factor so that we can maximize the querycoverage as well as minimize the total energy cost.

In this article; wedevelop a new algorithm that can deal with different ventilation scenarios while it requiresminimum computing time. This algorithm divides indoor contaminant distribution into twoparts: the contribution from inlets and the contribution from sources. The former can beobtained with the concentrations at inlets and volume fraction for each inlet; which is definedas the relative concentration when the boundary concentrations are 1 for the inlet and 0 forother inlets. The latter is calculated by setting the concentrations at all inlets as 0.

Owing to a short dead time (10 ns) and negligible darkcount rate (70 Hz) of the SNSPD; the obtained IF signal attained an SNR of 42 dB and thedirect distance accuracy was improved to 3 mm when the modulation bandwidth of the CAMsignal was 240 MHz and the modulation period was 1 ms.,Chinese Physics B,2018,*

Range-based Nearest Neighbor Queries with Complex-shaped Obstacles,Huaijie Zhu; Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Wang-Chien Lee,In this paper; we study a novel variant of obstructed nearest neighbor queries; namely;range-based obstructed nearest neighbor (RONN) search. As a natural generalization ofcontinuous obstructed nearest-neighbor (CONN); an RONN query retrieves a set ofobstructed nearest neighbors corresponding to every point in a specified range. We proposea new index; namely binary obstructed tree (called OB-tree); for indexing complex objects inthe obstructed space. The novelty of OB-tree lies in the idea of dividing the obstructed spaceinto non-obstructed subspaces; aiming to efficiently retrieve highly qualified candidates forRONN processing. We develop an algorithm for construction of the OB-tree and propose aspace division scheme; called optimal obstacle balance (OOB2) scheme; to address the treebalance problem. Accordingly; we propose an efficient algorithm; called RONN by OB …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*

Exteroceptive stimuli override interoceptive state in reaction time control,Xiao Yang; J Richard Jennings; Bruce H Friedman,Abstract The processing of reaction time (RT) stimulus is modulated by its timing relative tothe cardiac cycle. RT stimulus processing is also influenced by task-irrelevant stimuli: asensory stimulus speeds RT when it accompanies a cue to react in another sensorymodality. Different theories have been proposed to explain this accessory stimulus effect(ASE). However; it is unclear whether the ASE interacts with the cardiac timing effect. In thepresent study; the relationship of the ASE; cardiac timing; and stimulus valence wasexamined. Fifty-two subjects performed 400 trials of a simple RT task. Images of neutral andfear faces served as visual accessory stimuli; the RT stimulus was a 75 dB tone.Electrocardiography was recorded.

A novel representation and compression for queries on trajectories in road networks,Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Kai Yang; Chengfei Liu; Baihua Zheng,Recording and querying time-stamped trajectories incurs high cost of data storage andcomputing. In this paper; we explore several characteristics of the trajectories in road\mbox{networks}; which have motivated the idea of coding trajectories by associating timestampswith relative spatial path and locations. Such a representation contains large number ofduplicate information to achieve a lower entropy compared with the existing representations;thereby drastically cutting the storage cost. We propose several techniques to compressspatial path and locations separately; which can support fast positioning and achieve bettercompression ratio. For locations; we propose two novel encoding schemes such that thebinary code can preserve distance information; which is very helpful for\mbox {LBS}applications.

Due to the dynamic environment that the data is acquired withthe change of monitoring time; acquisitional data are typically a time-stamped stream wherea time-stamped value could either contain noises or be missing. Aiming to improve thequality of data acquisition; we focus on the explanations of missing values in this paper.Several techniques have been developed to provide the explanation on relational data;however; they cannot be directly applied in acquisitional stream data due to its dynamicfeature; such as the “change” of acquisitional stream data between two adjacent monitoringtime is often constrained by some rules.

Regulation of p53 turnover is essential not onlyfor the response to chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation in cancer cell but also to keep p53activity under control in a normal cell. Moreover;. p53 is found to be overactivated in variousdiseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Inthis paper; we firstly propose a novel index called S-MRST for indexing uncertain data. Forone thing; via using an irregular shape for bounding uncertain data; it has a stronger spacepruning ability. For another; by taking the gradient of probability density function intoconsideration; S-MRST is also powerful in terms of probability pruning ability. Moreimportant; S-MRST is a general index which could support multiple types of probabilisticqueries.

AngleCut: A Ring-Based Hashing Scheme for Distributed Metadata Management,Jiaxi Liu; Renxuan Wang; Xiaofeng Gao; Xiaochun Yang; Guihai Chen,Abstract Today's file systems are required to store PB-scale or even EB-scale data acrossthousands of servers. Under this scenario; distributed metadata management schemes;which store metadata on a group of metadata servers (MDS's); are used to alleviate theworkload of a single server. However; they present a significant challenge as the group ofMDS's should maintain a high level of metadata locality and load balancing; which arepractically contradictory to each other. In this paper we propose a novel and speciallydesigned hashing scheme called AngleCut to partition metadata namespace tree and servelarge-scale distributed storage systems. AngleCut first uses a locality preserving hashing(LPH) function to project the namespace tree into linear keyspace; ie; multiple Chord-likerings.

Comparison of the biomechanical function and clinical effects of plate and multi-pin fixation in the treatment of Sanders II calcaneal fractures,Pengfei Lei; Ruyin Hu; Rongxin Sun; Hao Liu; Hua Liu; Xucheng Yang; Jie Xie; Yihe Hu,Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical function and clinicaleffects of plate and multi-pin fixation in the treatment of Sanders II calcaneal fractures. Athree-dimensional finite element model of the Sanders II calcaneal fracture was establishedby subtracting several unit structures from the normal model from a healthy volunteer. Thefractured calcaneal were reduced and fixed with a steel plate or multi-pin. Loading of thefractured calcaneus via the tendo calcaneal was simulated and the resulting von Misesstresses and equivalent strain were observed at 0 (neutral position) for plate group; and at 0(neutral position) and 30 (plantar flexed position) for multi-pin group; respectively.

Approximate Continuous Top-k Query over Sliding Window,Rui Zhu; Bin Wang; Shi-Ying Luo; Xiao-Chun Yang; Guo-Ren Wang,Abstract Continuous top-k query over sliding window is a fundamental problem in database;which retrieves k objects with the highest scores when the window slides. Existing studiesmainly adopt exact algorithms to tackle this type of queries; whose key idea is to maintain asubset of objects in the window; and try to retrieve answers from it. However; all the existingalgorithms are sensitive to query parameters and data distribution. In addition; they sufferfrom expensive overhead for incremental maintenance; and thus cannot satisfy real-timerequirement. In this paper; we define a novel query named (ε; δ)-approximate continuous top-k query; which returns approximate answers for top-k query. In order to efficiently supportthis query; we propose an efficient framework; named PABF (Probabilistic ApproximateBased Framework); to support approximate top-k query over sliding window.

Refreshment of the shortest path cache with change of single edge,Xiaohua Li; Tao Qiu; Ning Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Ge Yu,Abstract The problem of caching shortest paths has been widely studied. All of existingmethods that address this problem assume that the condition of road networks does notchange with time. In this paper; we study how to refresh a cache when one edge of theunderlying road network (graph) changes. A bitmap-based cache structure is proposed tostore and give access to shortest paths. In the following; algorithms are developed to detectshortest paths that are affected by the change of edge. After detecting affected paths; severalheuristic-based refreshment strategies are proposed to update the cache. We haveconducted a series of experiments to compare the performance of proposed strategies. Itshows that replacing affected shortest paths with new paths whose benefit values are thelargest should be applied in the shortest path caching applications such as navigation …,Expert Systems with Applications,2017,*

However; most graph keyword search solutionsproposed so far primarily focus on a single query setting. We observe that for a popularkeyword query system; the number of keyword queries received could be substantially largeeven in a short time interval; and the chance that these queries share common keywords isquite high. Therefore; answering keyword queries in batches would significantly enhancethe performance of the system. Motivated by this; this paper studies efficient batchprocessing for multiple keyword queries on graph data.

Unfortunately; the existing data collection schemesmainly focus on energysaving but overlook balancing the energy consumption of the sensor nodes. In addition;most of them assume that each sensor has a global knowledge about the network topology.However; in many real applications; such a global knowledge is not desired due to thedynamic features of the wireless sensor network.

An Update Method for Shortest Path Caching with Burst Paths Based on Sliding Windows,Xiaohua Li; Ning Wang; Kanggui Peng; Xiaochun Yang; Ge Yu,Abstract Caching shortest paths is an important problem; and it is widely used in trafficnetworks; social networks; logistic networks; communication networks and other fields. Byfar; few existing methods has considered burst paths; which are common in real life. Forinstance; queries of a certain path can sharply increase due to a promotion or vacations.Such burst queries usually last for a relatively short period; and their frequencies are too lowto be loaded into caches according to conventional methods. In this paper; we propose twomethods: the basic and incremental cache update methods. Both methods are based onsliding windows. Specially; the incremental update method quantifies burst paths andupdates the cache incrementally.

Each one of these problems is complex to solve in its ownright. However; solving them individually leads almost surely to sub-optimal solutions.Hence the need to solve them in a combined form. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model with the objective being to minimise the tardiness of vessels.Experimental results show that relatively small instances of the proposed model can besolved exactly using CPLEX.,EURO Journal on Computational Optimization,2015,*

Detecting copy directions among programs using extreme learning machines,Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Guoren Wang,Because of the complexity of software development; some software developers mayplagiarize source code from other projects or open source software in order to shortendevelopment cycle. Many methods have been proposed to detect plagiarism amongprograms based on the program dependence graph; a graph representation of a program.However; to our best knowledge; existing works only detect similarity between programswithout detecting copy direction among them. By employing extreme learning machine(ELM); we construct feature space for describing features of every two programs withpossible plagiarism relationship.

Dissipativity analysis for discrete-time TS fuzzy systems with time-varying delay and stochastic perturbation,Xiaozhan Yang; Zhong Zheng; Yuxin Zhao; Ligang Wu,This paper addresses the problems of dissipativity analysis for discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno(TS) fuzzy systems with time-varying state delay and stochastic perturbation. Firstly; theuncertainty of state delay is pulled out of the original system by a novel model transformationprocess. Consequently the transformed model; which consists of a linear timeinvariantsystem and a norm-bounded uncertain subsystem; is obtained to simplify the dissipativityanalysis. By using this model transformation method combined with the Lyapunov-Krasovskii technique; sufficient conditions of the dissipativity are established. Finally; twoexamples are presented: one shows the effectiveness of model transformation method; andthe other presents comparisons with alternative approaches.,Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,*

Most of the traditional text search approaches are based on“bag of words” text representation based on frequency statics. However; these approachesignore the semantic correlation of words in the text. So this may lead to inaccurate ranking ofthe search results. In this paper; we propose a new Wikipedia-based similar text searchapproach that the words in the texts and query text could be semantic correlated inWikipedia.

Estimation for Dyadic-Dependent Exponential Random Graph Models,Xiaolin Yang; Alessandro Rinaldo; Stephen E Fienberg,Abstract. Graphs are the primary mathematical representation for networks; with nodes orvertices corresponding to units (eg; individuals) and edges corresponding to relationships.Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) are widely used for describing network databecause of their simple structure as an exponential function of a sum of parametersmultiplied by their corresponding sufficient statistics. As with other exponential familysettings the key computational difficulty is determining the normalizing constant for thelikelihood function; a quantity that depends only on the data. In ERGMs for network data; thenormalizing constant in the model often makes the parameter estimation intractable for largegraphs; when the model involves dependence among dyads in the graph. One way to dealwith this problem is to approximate the likelihood function by something tractable; eg; by …,Journal of Algebraic Statistics,2014,*

Optimal model approximation of discrete-time TS fuzzy systems: Hankel norm approach,Tong Peng; Yongyang Xiong; Xiaozhan Yang; Rongni Yang; Ligang Wu,This paper is concerned with the Hankel norm model approximation for discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems with time delay. For a given stable TS fuzzy system; our attentionis focused on the construction of a reduced-order model which not only approximates theoriginal system well with a Hankel norm performance but also is translated into a lower-dimensional system. By employing the modified delay partitioning method; a delay-dependent sufficient condition is developed for the asymptotic stability with a Hankel normerror performance for the error system. Then; the Hankel norm approximation problem issolved by employing the convex linearization approach; which cast the reduced-order modelconstruction into a convex optimization problem subject to linear matrix inequalityconstraints.

Permission of pathogen expansion inside a specialized DC by a co-inhibitory pathway dictates T cell response (P4249),Yang-Xin Fu; Xuanming Yang,B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); a co-inhibitory receptor; is required to suppress T cellmediated immunity. We demonstrated that cross-linking BTLA by herpesvirus entry mediator(HVEM) suppresses T cell responses against Listeria; while blocking BTLA enhances the Tcell response at not only primary but also memory phase. Unexpectedly; BTLA-/-mice havesignificantly lower CD8+ T cell effector and memory cells while paradoxically being moreresistant to Listeria monocytogenes infection. Although there is no reduction in listerial entryinto BTLA-/-CD8+ DCs; intriguingly; Listeria fails to expand within these DCs.

Periodical Climate Deduced from Stalagmite Oxygen Isotope in Southern China,Zhihua SU; Xiaoqiang YANG; Jianhua WANG; Linglong CAO; Jie YANG; Gangxiong JIN,The continuous wavelet transform was introduced to assay the oxygen isotope sequences ofstalagmites since the Last Glacial Maximum (~ 30 000 aBP) at Hulu Cave; Sanbao Cave;and Dongge Cave in South China. The result shows that the climate fluctuation in glacialperiod was more prominent than that in interglacial period. The periods of oxygen isotope inboth Dongge Cave and Sanbao Cave were characterized by three stages during theHolocene. However; the length; as well as the intensity of oxygen isotope periods displayedsignificant difference between two caves. The reason is that the climate in Sanbao Caveregion was only controlled by the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM); while that inDongge Cave region was jointly influenced by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) andEASM.

Direct observation of mass density wave in rubrene monolayer grown on Bi (001),Meng Lan; TingNa SHAO; JiaLe XIE; XiuFan YANG; Kai SUN; TianTian CAI; JunZhong WANG,Strain plays a crucial role in controlling the structure and morphology of heteroepitaxial films.Theoretical study predicted that; in the incommensurate films; strain can be released bycreating of mass density wave (MDW). However; there has been so far no conclusiveevidence for the existence of MDW. Here we show the direct observation of MDW in rubrenemonolayer grown on Bi (001) using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). It is found thatMDWs manifest themselves as small sinusoidal variation of surface height; plus periodicdistortion of molecular orientations. Furthermore; we demonstrate that the MDW formationresults from lattice rotation of rubrene monolayer with respect to Bi substrate. Depending onthe rotational direction; MDW may exhibit either stripe or zigzag patterns.,SCIENTIA SINICA Physica; Mechanica & Astronomica,2011,*

Animal studies have shown that PDGFRα signaling can drivetumor growth. Clinical studies; however; have failed to show efficacy when patients withrecurrent GBM were treated with non-specific PDGFR inhibitors (Imatinib; Sunitinib).Drawing firm conclusions from such studies is limited by lack of patient stratification byPDGFRα expression and lack of biological data demonstrating effective target inhibition. CP-868;596 is a benzimidazole which is orally bioavailable; and has IC50s of 0.9 nM and 1.8nM for PDGFRα and PDGFRb; respectively.

Hyperhomocysteinemia increases endothelial cell-monocyte interaction in association with ICAM-1 induction and hypomethylation,Shu Meng; Xiao-Jin Sha; Xiao-Feng Yang; Hong Wang,Abstract Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for cardiovasculardisease. Our previous results have shown that HHcy accelerates atherosclerosis andincreases lesion monocytes (MC). It has been well characterized that atherosclerosis is aninflammatory vascular disease and that inflamed vascular endothelial cell (EC) is the initialstep for MC attraction and adhesion. Here we showed that homocysteine (Hcy; 50ìM)increased human peripheral blood MC adhesion to human umbilical vascular endothelialcells (HUVEC) using both a static and a flow adhesion assay. Further; Hcy induced mRNAand cell surface expression of inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1); but not vascularadhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) in HUVEC.

Protein synthesis inhibition in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala facilitates extinction of auditory fear memory,XinChun Jin; XueLian Qi; XiaoFei Yang; BaoMing Li,Abstract It is known that consolidation of fear conditioning requires de novo protein synthesisin the amygdala. However; there is controversy about the role of protein synthesis in post-retrieval extinction of fear memory. The present study investigated the effect of proteinsynthesis inhibition (PSI) in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BLA) on post-retrievalextinction of auditory fear memory. Intra-BLA infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitoranisomycin '0'h post-retrieval facilitated the extinction; but was ineffective if the memory wasnot retrieved. Anisomycin had no effect on the extinction when it was infused 6 h post-retrieval. The present results suggest that there exists a protein-synthesis-dependentmechanism in the BLA that retards extinction of auditory fear memory.,Chinese Science Bulletin,2007,*

Whenthere are multiple constraints; K-anonymizing a table to satisfy all the constraints is muchmore complex. We propose a K-anonymization approach; FTB-Classfly; which is based onfrequent tables. In stead of generalizing all values in an attribute; FTB-Classfly onlygeneralizes partial tuples that do not satisfy the constraints. By using frequent tables; FTB-Classfly provides higher efficiency than existing approaches.

Query Optimization Based on Site Constraints in PDMS,Bin Wang; Xiao-chun Yang; Guo-ren Wang; En-de Zhang,Query rewriting technique based on views is an important solution to sharing data in PDMS(peer data management system). An extended Datalog technique based on peer constraintsis proposed to optimize query processing in PDMS. In particular; the query optimizationproblem in data-intension and logical tight-coupled PDMS environment is studied. Thedefinition language for PDMS views; PView and the definitions of local and global peerconstraints are proposed; as well as the query rewriting optimization algorithms. A costmodel is given to evaluate the queries in PDMS. Experimental results show that theproposed approach outperforms other view-based query rewriting approaches.,JOURNAL-NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY NATURAL SCIENCE,2005,*

Upregulation of p73 via E2F-1 contributes to genistein-induced apoptosis,Xiaohe Yang; Qi Wang; Joan Liu; Wei Zheng; Bolin Liu; Susan Edgerton; Qing Yang; Hsueh-Kung Lin; Ann Thor,2538 Genistein is a soybean-derived isoflavone that has anti-tumorigenic activities. Theunderlying mechanisms of genistein mediated anti-tumor effects include the modulation ofestrogen receptor; induction of apoptosis and cell growth arrest. Activation of p21WAF1/Cip1; a target gene of p53 family members; has been associated with genistein-induced apoptosis and growth arrest. However; whether p53 is or is not involved in thisprocess remains controversial. The argument against p53 involvement is based on theresults from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells; which express mutant p53 but are sensitive togenistein. To elucidate the mechanism of genistein-mediated apoptosis in p53 mutant cells;we hypothesize that in p53 mutant cells; upregulation/activation of p73; a homologue of p53;might compensate p53 function in genistein induced apoptosis.

Overexpression of Bak induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase through up-regulating expression of p27KIP1 in HCC-9204 cell line,LI Jiang; WANG Wen-Liang; YU Xin-Xin; YANG Xin-Ke; Hou Yun-De,The Id family (Idl-Id4) of helix-loop-helix proteins act as negative regulators of basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that drive cell lineage commitment and differentiationin diverse cell types. In general; tissue-specific bHLH proteins form heterodimers with theubiquitously expressed bHLH proteins and activate the expression of specific genescarrying an E-box regulatory motif. Id proteins lack a basic region and act as dominant-negative antagonists of the bHLH transcription factors by forming heterodimers that areunable to bind DNA. We have previously shown that Id2 and Id3 undergo cell cycledependent phosphorylation at a serine residue (Ser5) within a consensus target site forcyclin-dependent kinases (EMBO J. 1 6 332-342; 1997). The timing of phosphorylation in thelate G1 phase correlates with the activation of Cdk2 by cyclin E and/or cyclin A. We now …,Biochemical Society Transactions,2000,*

Studies on Effect of Water Treated by High-Voltage Electrostatic Field on Oxygen Utilization Rating of Activated Sludge,F Yang,The microorganisms extracted from activated sludge were selected as the sensitive materialto make a BOD biosensor for monitoring the metabolic ability of themselves in high voltageelectrostatic treated water (HVETW). The oxygen utilization rating of the microorganismswhich operated in such an aqueous media for appropriate time; could be promoted by atleast 20%. At the same working high voltage; this effect depended on how long the waterwas treated. The water treated for too long a time would lead to the negative effects. At 5000V; it took about 6.0 h for the microorganisms to obtain the maximum oxygen utilization rating;whereas it did about 4.0 h at 7000 V. This discovery might offer a great potential forimproving the new waste water disposal techniques.,CHINESE JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,1997,*

A successfulmethod has been found to promote the efficiency of lower hybrid current drive (LHCD). Thekey points are to control plasma impurities effectively and to utilize the synergy betweenLHCD and various heating approaches. Titanium gettering and boronization were used toreduce the impurities. The LHCD plasma was successfully heated by electron cyclotronresonance heating; edge ohmic heating and ion cyclotron resonance heating; and thecurrent drive efficiency was increased considerably. The full current drive efficiency reached1.8 X 10 15 cm-2· A· W-1; which is 1.8 times higher than the JT-60 1989 scaling.

In the laboratory; bednets impregnated with 250mg ai/m'and 500mg ai/m2permethrin caused respectively the mean mortalities of 86.6% within 13 months and 87.2%within l7 months on laboratorybred An. sinensis; while they caused average mortalities of583% within 4 months and 73.8% within 10 months on An. dirus respectively. The bioassayresults of KT50 and LT50 on the two species showed that KTSO is shorter than LT50 afterexposure to the treated bednets. The ratio is l: 2. 1 6-l: 3.05. It was observed Anopheles hadobviously secondary knocked down after exposure to the treated bednets and there isobvious resurgent after Anopheles have been knocked down. When the temperature goesup the resurgence gets shorter; the resurgence rate gets higher and the mortality gets lower.It showed that permethrin has stronger knocking down effect than killing effect.,*,1996,*
Growth and characterization of (Tl; Pb)(Sr; Ba) 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O y single crystals,HW Weber; XL Wang; XM Yang; R Abraham; K Lebbou; M Th Cohen-Adad; E Halwax; P Wiede,(Tl; Pb)(Sr; Ba) 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O y single crystals were grown by a self flux method. We find thatthe crystal growth strictly depends on the starting composition; on optimizing the meltingtemperature by suitable additives and on the choice of the cooling rate. The crystals werecharacterized by X-ray diffraction; EDX; SEM and SQUID magnetometry. Thesuperconducting transition temperatures and the best transition widths obtained for as-grown crystals are 105.0-111.2 K and 3-6 K; respectively. Layer by layer growth patterns; butno spiral growth; were observed by SEM. Annealing effects were studied in O 2 or Aratmosphere and led to improvements of T c and the transition width only following annealingin Ar. Annealing at temperatures above 600° C results in a decomposition of the crystals intothe insulating oxides Tl 2 O and (Sr; Ba)-Ca-Cu.,Journal of Crystal Growth,1996,*

DEVELOPMENT OF AN 0.014-IN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-GUIDEWIRE,B Qiu; P Karmarkar; F Gao; C Brushett; R Kon; S Kar; E Atalar; X Yang,The MR imaging-guidewire (MRIG) is a co-axial cable with extension of its inner conductor[1]. The MRIG has two functions: imaging and guiding [2]. The current generations of MRIGsare made of nitinol at 0.032 inch (0.81 mm) in diameter; which has been successfullyapplied in the middle-and large-sized peripheral arteries [2; 3]. The final goal in thedevelopment of this technique is to diagnose and treat atherosclerosis in small-sizedarteries; such as the coronary arteries; which requires a thinner MRIG; ideally 0.014 inch(0.35 mm) in diameter as a standard size for both imaging and guiding. However; there areseveral challenges in building such a thin MRIG because of the limitations on either MRsignal conductivity or the mechanical properties of the MRIG.

Querying Large Similar Sequences in a Compressed Format Efficiently,Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Chen Li; Xiaohui Xie,Abstract—With the advances in next-generation sequencing technologies; the amount ofgenomic sequence data being produced continues to grow at an exponential rate. A uniquecharacteristic of these sequences is that they are over 99% similar; and therefore highlycompressible using their differences with respect to a reference sequence. Still; anincreasingly pressing challenge is how to efficiently query these massive amounts ofsequence data in their compressed format. In this paper we study the problem of answeringsubsequence-search queries on a compressed set of long sequences. We develop novelindex structures for the differences and algorithms for answering queries. We presentvarious optimization techniques to further reduce the space requirement and queryresponse time. We demonstrate the efficiency of these techniques using a thorough …,*,*,*
