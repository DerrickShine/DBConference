Data center tcp (dctcp),Mohammad Alizadeh; Albert Greenberg; David A Maltz; Jitendra Padhye; Parveen Patel; Balaji Prabhakar; Sudipta Sengupta; Murari Sridharan,Abstract Cloud data centers host diverse applications; mixing workloads that require smallpredictable latency with others requiring large sustained throughput. In this environment;today's state-of-the-art TCP protocol falls short. We present measurements of a 6000 serverproduction cluster and reveal impairments that lead to high application latencies; rooted inTCP's demands on the limited buffer space available in data center switches. For example;bandwidth hungry" background" flows build up queues at the switches; and thus impact theperformance of latency sensitive" foreground" traffic. To address these problems; wepropose DCTCP; a TCP-like protocol for data center networks. DCTCP leverages ExplicitCongestion Notification (ECN) in the network to provide multi-bit feedback to the end hosts.We evaluate DCTCP at 1 and 10Gbps speeds using commodity; shallow buffered …,ACM SIGCOMM computer communication review,2010,1044
The nature of data center traffic: measurements & analysis,Srikanth Kandula; Sudipta Sengupta; Albert Greenberg; Parveen Patel; Ronnie Chaiken,Abstract We explore the nature of traffic in data centers; designed to support the mining ofmassive data sets. We instrument the servers to collect socket-level logs; with negligibleperformance impact. In a 1500 server operational cluster; we thus amass roughly a petabyteof measurements over two months; from which we obtain and report detailed views of trafficand congestion conditions and patterns. We further consider whether traffic matrices in thecluster might be obtained instead via tomographic inference from coarser-grained counterdata.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement,2009,808
An analysis of wireless network coding for unicast sessions: The case for coding-aware routing,Sudipta Sengupta; Shravan Rayanchu; Suman Banerjee,A recent approach; COPE; for improving the throughput of unicast traffic in wireless multi-hop networks exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless medium through opportunisticnetwork coding. In this paper; we analyze throughput improvements obtained by COPE-typenetwork coding in wireless networks from a theoretical perspective. We make two keycontributions. First; we obtain a theoretical formulation for computing the throughput ofnetwork coding on any wireless network topology and any pattern of concurrent unicasttraffic sessions. Second; we advocate that routing be made aware of network codingopportunities rather than; as in COPE; being oblivious to it. More importantly; our workstudies the tradeoff between routing flows" close to each other" for utilizing codingopportunities and" away from each other" for avoiding wireless interference.

Towards a next generation data center architecture: scalability and commoditization,Albert Greenberg; Parantap Lahiri; David A Maltz; Parveen Patel; Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract Applications hosted in today's data centers suffer from internal fragmentation ofresources; rigidity; and bandwidth constraints imposed by the architecture of the networkconnecting the data center's servers. Conventional architectures statically map web servicesto Ethernet VLANs; each constrained in size to a few hundred servers owing to control planeoverheads. The IP routers used to span traffic across VLANs and the load balancers used tospray requests within a VLAN across servers are realized via expensive customizedhardware and proprietary software. Bisection bandwidth is low; severly constrainingdistributed computation Further; the conventional architecture concentrates traffic in a fewpieces of hardware that must be frequently upgraded and replaced to keep pace withdemand-an approach that directly contradicts the prevailing philosophy in the rest of the …,Proceedings of the ACM workshop on Programmable routers for extensible services of tomorrow,2008,276
ChunkStash: Speeding Up Inline Storage Deduplication Using Flash Memory.,Biplob K Debnath; Sudipta Sengupta; Jin Li,Abstract Storage deduplication has received recent interest in the research community. Inscenarios where the backup process has to complete within short time windows; inlinededuplication can help to achieve higher backup throughput. In such systems; the method ofidentifying duplicate data; using disk-based indexes on chunk hashes; can createthroughput bottlenecks due to disk I/Os involved in index lookups. RAM prefetching andbloom-filter based techniques used by Zhu et al.[42] can avoid disk I/Os on close to 99% ofthe index lookups. Even at this reduced rate; an index lookup going to disk contributes about0.1 msec to the average lookup time–this is about 1000 times slower than a lookup hitting inRAM. We propose to reduce the penalty of index lookup misses in RAM by orders ofmagnitude by serving such lookups from a flash-based index; thereby; increasing inline …,USENIX annual technical conference,2010,239
Data center interconnect and traffic engineering,*,A system for commoditizing data center networking is disclosed. The system includes aninterconnection topology for a data center having a plurality of servers and a plurality ofnodes of a network in the data center through which data packets may be routed. Thesystem uses a routing scheme where the routing is oblivious to the traffic pattern betweennodes in the network; and wherein the interconnection topology contains a plurality of pathsbetween one or more servers. The multipath routing may be Valiant load balancing. Itdisaggregates the function of load balancing into a group of regular servers; with the resultthat load balancing server hardware can be distributed amongst racks in the data centerleading to greater agility and less fragmentation.

FlashStore: high throughput persistent key-value store,Biplob Debnath; Sudipta Sengupta; Jin Li,Abstract We present FlashStore; a high throughput persistent key-value store; that uses flashmemory as a non-volatile cache between RAM and hard disk. FlashStore is designed tostore the working set of key-value pairs on flash and use one flash read per key lookup. Asthe working set changes over time; space is made for the current working set by destagingrecently unused key-value pairs to hard disk and recycling pages in the flash store.FlashStore organizes key-value pairs in a log-structure on flash to exploit faster sequentialwrite performance. It uses an in-memory hash table to index them; with hash collisionsresolved by a variant of cuckoo hashing. The in-memory hash table stores compact keysignatures instead of full keys so as to strike tradeoffs between RAM usage and false flashread operations. FlashStore can be used as a high throughput persistent key-value …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,206
Efficient and robust routing of highly variable traffic,Murali Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract We consider the following issues related to robust network routing in a highlydynamic and changing traffic environment: What network routing should an Internet ServiceProvider use so as to (i) accommodate users demanding" good" service while beingunpredictable in the traffic that they would like to send to different destinations;(ii) minimizethe amount of" overprovisioning" that needs to be done in the network in order to make" besteffort networking better" without resorting to sophisticated traffic prediction and managementmechanisms;(iii) operate the network efficiently with mostly static routing configurations andwithout dynamic routing adjustments to avoid congestion due to drastic changes in trafficflows between a network's ingress and egress routers.

Load-aware spectrum distribution in wireless LANs,Thomas Moscibroda; Ranveer Chandra; Yunnan Wu; Sudipta Sengupta; Paramvir Bahl; Yuan Yuan,Traditionally; the channelization structure in IEEE 802.11-based Wireless LANs has beenfixed: Each access point (AP) is assigned one channel and all channels are equally wide. Incontrast; it has recently been shown that even on commodity hardware; the channel-widthcan be adapted dynamically purely in software. Leveraging this capability; we study the useof dynamic-width channels; where every AP adaptively adjusts not only its center-frequency;but also its channel-width to match its traffic load. This gives raise to a novel optimizationproblem that differs from previously studied channel assignment problems. We proposeefficient spectrum-distribution algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness through analysisand simulations using real-world traces. Our results indicate that by allocating morespectrum to highly-loaded APs; the overall spectrum-utilization can be substantially …,Network Protocols; 2008. ICNP 2008.

The Bw-Tree: A B-tree for new hardware platforms,Justin J Levandoski; David B Lomet; Sudipta Sengupta,The emergence of new hardware and platforms has led to reconsideration of how datamanagement systems are designed. However; certain basic functions such as key indexedaccess to records remain essential. While we exploit the common architectural layering ofprior systems; we make radically new design decisions about each layer. Our new form of B-tree; called the Bw-tree achieves its very high performance via a latch-free approach thateffectively exploits the processor caches of modern multi-core chips. Our storage manageruses a unique form of log structuring that blurs the distinction between a page and a recordstore and works well with flash storage. This paper describes the architecture and algorithmsfor the Bw-tree; focusing on the main memory aspects.

Techniques for scheduling with rejection,Daniel W Engels; David R Karger; Stavros G Kolliopoulos; Sudipta Sengupta; RN Uma; Joel Wein,Abstract We consider the general problem of scheduling a set of jobs where we may choosenot to schedule certain jobs; and thereby incur a penalty for each rejected job. Morespecifically; we focus on choosing a set of jobs to reject and constructing a schedule for theremaining jobs so as to optimize the sum of the weighted completion times of the jobsscheduled plus the sum of the penalties of the jobs rejected. We give several techniques fordesigning scheduling algorithms under this criterion. Many of these techniques show how toreduce a problem with rejection to a (potentially more complex) scheduling problem withoutrejection. Some of the reductions are based on general properties of certain kinds of linear-programming relaxations of optimization problems; and therefore are applicable to problemsoutside of scheduling; we demonstrate this by giving an approximation algorithm for a …,Journal of Algorithms,2003,144
SkimpyStash: RAM space skimpy key-value store on flash-based storage,Biplob Debnath; Sudipta Sengupta; Jin Li,Abstract We present SkimpyStash; a RAM space skimpy key-value store on flash-basedstorage; designed for high throughput; low latency server applications. The distinguishingfeature of SkimpyStash is the design goal of extremely low RAM footprint at about 1 (±0.5)byte per key-value pair; which is more aggressive than earlier designs. SkimpyStash uses ahash table directory in RAM to index key-value pairs stored in a log-structured manner onflash. To break the barrier of a flash pointer (say; 4 bytes) worth of RAM overhead per key; it"moves" most of the pointers that locate each key-value pair from RAM to flash itself. This isrealized by (i) resolving hash table collisions using linear chaining; where multiple keys thatresolve (collide) to the same hash table bucket are chained in a linked list; and (ii) storingthe linked lists on flash itself with a pointer in each hash table bucket in RAM pointing to …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,142

Capacity performance of dynamic provisioning in optical networks,Ramu Ramamurthy; Zbigniew Bogdanowicz; Shahrokh Samieian; Debanjan Saha; Bala Rajagopalan; Sudipta Sengupta; Sid Chaudhuri; Krishna Bala,This paper describes an architecture and analyzes the performance of dynamic provisioningof lightpaths in an optical network. In dynamic provisioning; a lightpath is set up in real-timewithout rearranging the working and protection routes of existing lightpaths; and without theknowledge of future lightpath provisioning events. This paper develops a general model ofthe physical topology of the optical network; and outlines routing approaches for dynamicprovisioning of lightpaths. It analyzes via simulations the performance of dynamicallyprovisioned unprotected; 1+ 1 protected and mesh-restored lightpaths.

Utility maximization in peer-to-peer systems,Minghua Chen; Miroslav Ponec; Sudipta Sengupta; Jin Li; Philip A Chou,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of utility maximization in P2P systems; in whichaggregate application-specific utilities are maximized by running distributed algorithms onP2P nodes; which are constrained by their uplink capacities. This may be understood asextending Kelly's seminal framework from single-path unicast over general topology to multi-path multicast over P2P topology; with network coding allowed. For certain classes ofpopular P2P topologies; we show that routing along a linear number of trees per source canachieve the largest rate region that can be possibly obtained by (multi-source) networkcoding. This simplification result allows us to develop a new multi-tree routing formulation forthe problem.

Switched optical backbone for cost-effective scalable core IP networks,Sudipta Sengupta; Vijay Kumar; Debanjan Saha,With the advent of WDM technology; IP backbone carriers are now connecting core routersdirectly over point-to-point WDM links (IP over WDM). The advances and standardization inoptical control plane technologies like GMPLS have substantially increased the intelligenceof the optical layer and shown promise toward making dynamic provisioning and restorationof optical layer circuits a basic capability to be leveraged by upper network layers. In light ofthis; an architecture where a reconfigurable optical backbone (IP over OTN) consisting ofSONET/SDH crossconnects/switches interconnected via DWDM links provides connectivityamong IP routers is an emerging alternative. As carriers evolve their networks to meet thecontinued growth of data traffic in the Internet; they have to make a fundamental choicebetween the above architectural alternatives.

Loss-aware network coding for unicast wireless sessions: design; implementation; and performance evaluation,Shravan Rayanchu; Sayandeep Sen; Jianming Wu; Suman Banerjee; Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract Local network coding is growing in prominence as a technique to facilitate greatercapacity utilization in multi-hop wireless networks. A specific objective of such local networkcoding techniques has been to explicitly minimize the total number of transmissions neededto carry packets across each wireless hop. While such a strategy is certainly useful; weargue that in lossy wireless environments; a better use of local network coding is to providehigher levels of redundancy even at the cost of increasing the number of transmissionsrequired to communicate the same information. In this paper we show that the design spacefor effective redundancy in local network coding is quite large; which makes optimalformulations of the problem hard to realize in practice.

Capacity efficient distributed routing of mesh-restored lightpaths in optical networks,Sudipta Sengupta; Ramu Ramamurthy,A mesh-restored lightpath in an optical network has a primary route and a diversely routedbackup route.

Wavelength channels are shared in a waythat ensures restoration of all lightpaths affected by any single link failure. In the centralizedscenario; complete knowledge of the network state allows determination of the sharability ofa backup channel during path computation. This information is not available in thedistributed scenario. Use of 1+ 1 routing algorithms for mesh-restored lightpaths leads toinefficient capacity sharing.

BloomFlash: Bloom filter on flash-based storage,Biplob Debnath; Sudipta Sengupta; Jin Li; David J Lilja; David HC Du,The bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that provides a compact representation of aset of elements. To keep false positive probabilities low; the size of the bloom filter must bedimensioned a priori to be linear in the maximum number of keys inserted; with the linearityconstant ranging typically from one to few bytes. A bloom filter is most commonly used as anin memory data structure; hence its size is limited by the availability of RAM space on themachine. As datasets have grown over time to Internet scale; so have the RAM spacerequirements of bloom filters. If sufficient RAM space is not available; we advocate that flashmemory may serve as a suitable medium for storing bloom filters; since it is about one-tenththe cost of RAM per GB while still providing access times orders of magnitude faster thanhard disk.

Flash memory cache including for use with persistent key-value store,*,Described is using flash memory; RAM-based data structures and mechanisms to provide aflash store for caching data items (eg; key-value pairs) in flash pages.

P2P streaming capacity under node degree bound,Shao Liu; Minghua Chen; Sudipta Sengupta; Mung Chiang; Jin Li; Phil A Chou,Two of the fundamental problems in peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming are as follows: what is themaximum streaming rate that can be sustained for all receivers; and what peering algorithmscan achieve close to this maximum? These problems of computing and approaching theP2P streaming capacity are often challenging because of the constraints imposed onoverlay topology. In this paper; we focus on the limit of P2P streaming rate under nodedegree bound; ie; the number of connections a node can maintain is upper bounded. Wefirst show that the streaming capacity problem under node degree bound is NP Complete ingeneral.

Algorithms and approximation schemes for minimum lateness/tardiness scheduling with rejection,Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract We consider the problem of minimum lateness/tardiness scheduling with rejectionfor which the objective function is the sum of the maximum lateness/tardiness of thescheduled jobs and the total rejection penalty (sum of rejection costs) of the rejected jobs. Ifrejection is not considered; the problems are solvable in polynomial time using the EarliestDue Date (EDD) rule. We show that adding the option of rejection makes the problems NP-complete. We give pseudo-polynomial time algorithms; based on dynamic programming; forthese problems. We also develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) forminimum tardiness scheduling with rejection using a geometric rounding technique on thetotal rejection penalty.

Online multicast routing with bandwidth guarantees: a new approach using multicast network flow,Murali Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract This paper presents a new algorithm for online routing of bandwidth-guaranteedmulticasts where routing requests arrive one by one without there being any a prioriknowledge of future requests. A multicast routing request consists of a source s; a set ofreceivers R; and a bandwidth requirement b. This multicast routing problem arises in manycontexts. Two applications of interest are routing of point-to-multipoint label-switched pathsin multiprotocol label switched (MPLS) networks; and the provision of bandwidth-guaranteedvirtual private network (VPN) services under the" hose" service model [18]. Offline multicastrouting algorithms cannot be used since they require a priori knowledge of all multicastrequests that are to be routed. Instead; online algorithms that handle requests arriving oneby one and that satisfy as many potential future demands as possible are needed. The …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2003,62
Efficient channel reservation for backup paths in optical mesh networks,Somdip Datta; Sudipta Sengupta; Subir Biswas,In an optical mesh network; backup channels are shared between multiple lightpaths toreduce restoration capacity overhead. The sharability of channels is usually constrained bythe mandate to provide 100% recovery of all lightpaths affected by any single event failure inthe network. This paper proposes a pool based channel reservation scheme that is optimalwhen the set of primary and backup paths (specified at link level without channel allocation)is given. In the online case; our simulations on representative network topologies show thatthis method improves over the existing (more restrictive) method of allocating shared backupchannels using primary path diversity.,Global Telecommunications Conference; 2001.

In order toroute such traffic with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees without requiring detection oftraffic changes in real-time or reconfiguring the network in response to it; a routing andbandwidth allocation scheme has been recently proposed that allows preconfiguration of thenetwork such that all traffic patterns permissible within the network's natural ingress-egresscapacity constraints can be handled in a capacity efficient manner. The scheme routes trafficin two phases. In the first phase; incoming traffic is sent from the source to a set ofintermediate nodes and then; in the second phase; from the intermediate nodes to the finaldestination.

Maximum throughput routing of traffic in the hose model,M Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract—Routing traffic subject to hose model constraints [5] has been of much recentresearch interest [10];[6]. Two-phase routing has been proposed [9];[18] as a mechanism forrouting traffic in the hose model. It has desirable properties in being able to staticallypreconfigure the transport network and in being able to handle constraints imposed byspecialized service overlays. In this paper; we investigate whether the desirable propertiesof two-phase routing come with any resource overhead compared to (i) direct source-destination path routing; and (ii) optimal scheme among the class of all schemes that areallowed to even make the routing dynamically dependent on the traffic matrix. In the pursuitof this endeavor; we achieve several milestones. First; we develop the first polynomial sizelinear programming (LP) formulation for maximum throughput routing of hose traffic along …,INFOCOM 2006. 25th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications.

The traffic-oblivious routing weconsider is a scheme where incoming traffic is first distributed in a preset manner to a set ofintermediate nodes. The traffic is then routed from the intermediate nodes to the finaldestination. This splitting of the routing into two phases simplifies network configurationsignificantly. In implementing this scheme; the first and second phase paths are realized atthe optical layer with router packet grooming at a single intermediate node only. Given thisunreliability of routers; we consider how two-phase routing in IP-over-optical networks canbe made resilient against router node failures. We propose two different schemes forprovisioning the optical layer to handle router node failures-one that is failure node …,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2007,53

Reliability in single domain vs. multi domain optical mesh networks,Ahmet Akyamac; Sudipta Sengupta; J François Labourdette; Sid Chaudhuri; Stephen French,Abstract Network reliability is an important element of a service level agreement and istypically evaluated based on the number of unavailable minutes per year. The widespreadbelief is that networks with faster restoration times are more reliable; created by theassumption that fast restoration from a failure leads to smaller down time. This is notnecessarily the case since it has been shown that reliability may have little to do with therestoration speed when the restoration time is small compared to the mean time to repair ofthe failed elements. In this paper; we compare the reliability of optical mesh networks withmulti domain restoration and single domain restoration using both dedicated meshprotection and shared mesh restoration; and show that splitting a network into multipledomains increases the overall reliability.,IEEE/OSA NFOEC,2002,49
Using index partitioning and reconciliation for data deduplication,*,The subject disclosure is directed towards a data deduplication technology in which a hashindex service's index is partitioned into subspace indexes; with less than the entire hashindex service's index cached to save memory.

The index may bedivided into subspaces based on criteria associated with the data to index; such as file type;data type; time of last usage; and so on. Also described is subspace reconciliation; in whichduplicate entries in subspaces are detected so as to remove entries and chunks from thededuplication system.

Techniques for scheduling with rejection,Daniel W Engels; David R Karger; Stavros G Kolliopoulos; Sudipta Sengupta; RN Uma; Joel Wein,Abstract We consider the general problem of scheduling a set of jobs where we may choosenot to schedule certain jobs; and thereby incur a penalty for each rejected job. Morespecifically; we focus on choosing a set of jobs to reject and constructing a schedule for theremaining jobs so as to optimize the sum of the weighted completion times of the jobsscheduled plus the sum of the penalties of the jobs rejected. We give several techniques fordesigning scheduling algorithms under this criterion. Many of these techniques show how toreduce a problem with rejection to a (potentially more complex) scheduling problem withoutrejection. Some of the reductions are based on general properties of certain kinds of linear-programming relaxations of optimization problems; and therefore are applicable to problemsoutside of scheduling; we demonstrate this by giving an approximation algorithm for a …,European Symposium on Algorithms,1998,41
Analysis of enhanced OSPF for routing lightpaths in optical mesh networks,Sudipta Sengupta; Debanjan Saha; Sid Chaudhuri,We discuss enhancements to the OSPF (open shortest path first) protocol for routing andtopology discovery in optical mesh networks. OSPF's opaque LSA (link state advertisement)mechanism is used to extend OSPF to disseminate optical resource related informationthrough optical LSAs. Standard link-state database flooding mechanisms are used fordistribution of optical LSAs. Each optical LSA carries optical resource information pertainingto a single optical link bundle between two adjacent OXCs (optical cross connects); allowingfor fine granularity changes in topology to be incorporated in path computation algorithms.OSPF packets are carried over a single IP control channel between adjacent OXCs. Weanalyze the performance of OSPF with optical extensions. Specifically; we compute controlchannel bandwidth used due to LSA updates. We also estimate the amount of memory …,Communications; 2002.

Traffic-oblivious routing for guaranteed bandwidth performance,M Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,A virtual private network provides network connectivity among the different sites of anenterprise. The bandwidth requirement of a VPN is typically specified by peak ingress-egress traffic volumes for each site. The actual distribution of traffic from each site to othersites in the VPN is not known a priori and could vary over time (eg; at an intra-day or dailylevel or due to special activities). This is captured by the hose traffic model. It is theresponsibility of the Internet service provider to provision the VPN so that variable trafficsubject to aggregate ingress-egress constraints can be transported with bandwidthguarantees.

LLAMA: A cache/storage subsystem for modern hardware,Justin Levandoski; David Lomet; Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract LLAMA is a subsystem designed for new hardware environments that supports anAPI for page-oriented access methods; providing both cache and storage management.Caching (CL) and storage (SL) layers use a common mapping table that separates a page'slogical and physical location. CL supports data updates and management updates (eg; forindex re-organization) via latch-free compare-and-swap atomic state changes on itsmapping table. SL uses the same mapping table to cope with page location changesproduced by log structuring on every page flush. To demonstrate LLAMA's suitability; wetailored our latch-free Bw-tree implementation to use LLAMA. The Bw-tree is a B-tree styleindex.

Bandwidth guaranteed routing with fast restoration against link and node failures,Randeep S Bhatia; Murali Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,An important feature of MPLS networks is local restoration where detour paths are set-up apriori. The detour is such that failed links or nodes can be bypassed locally from the firstnode that is upstream from the failures. This local bypass activation from the first detectionpoint for failures permits much faster recovery than end-to-end path based mechanisms thatrequire failure information to propagate to the network edges. However; local restoration ofbandwidth guaranteed connections can be expensive in the additional network capacityneeded. Hence; it is important to minimize and share restoration capacity. The problem ofrouting with local restoration requirements has been studied previously in a dynamic on-linesetting. However; there are no satisfactory algorithms for the problem of pre-provisioning fastrestorable connections when the aggregate traffic demands are known (as would be the …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2008,25

Methods of network routing having improved resistance to faults affecting groups of links subject to common risks,*,A number of techniques are described for routing methods that improve resistance to faultsaffecting groups of links subject to common risks. One of these techniques accounts forfailure potentials in physical networks by considering shared risk link groups separately fromperformance and costs metrics in determining a primary routing path and a backup path. Ashared risk link group (SRLG) is an attribute attached to a link to identify edges that havephysical links in common and can therefore be simultaneously disrupted due to a singlefault. Another technique considers node disjointness and provides a solution of two pathsthat are as node disjoint as possible and minimizes administrative costs.

To make use of this ability; dynamic schemes thatjointly route primary paths and all link detours for links used by the primary paths have beenpreviously proposed. These schemes also permit sharing of reserved restoration capacity forachieving efficiency.

Content is located at the level of a locality domain using ahierarchical DHT in which nodes correspond to locality domains. A peer searches for agiven piece of content in a proximity guided manner and terminates at the earliest localitydomain (in the hierarchy) which has the content. Locality domains are organized intohierarchical clusters based on their proximity.,*,2011,11
Traffic-oblivious routing in the hose model,Murali Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract Routing traffic subject to hose model constraints has been of much recent researchinterest. Two-phase routing has been proposed as a mechanism for routing traffic in thehose model. It has desirable properties in being able to statically preconfigure the transportnetwork and in being able to handle constraints imposed by specialized service overlays. Inthis paper; we investigate whether the desirable properties of two-phase routing come withany resource overhead compared to: 1) direct source-destination path routing; and 2)optimal scheme among the class of all schemes that are allowed to even make the routingdynamically dependent on the traffic matrix. In the pursuit of this endeavor; we achieveseveral milestones. First; we develop a polynomial-size linear programming (LP) formulationfor maximum throughput routing of hose traffic along direct source-destination paths …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2011,11

Multi-version range concurrency control in Deuteronomy,Justin Levandoski; David Lomet; Sudipta Sengupta; Ryan Stutsman; Rui Wang,Abstract The Deuteronomy transactional key value store executes millions of serializabletransactions/second by exploiting multi-version timestamp order concurrency control.However; it has not supported range operations; only individual record operations (eg;create; read; update; delete). In this paper; we enhance our multi-version timestamp ordertechnique to handle range concurrency and prevent phantoms. Importantly; we maintainhigh performance while respecting the clean separation of duties required by Deuteronomy;where a transaction component performs purely logical concurrency control (including rangesupport); while a data component performs data storage and management duties.

FlashBlox: Achieving Both Performance Isolation and Uniform Lifetime for Virtualized SSDs.,Jian Huang; Anirudh Badam; Laura Caulfield; Suman Nath; Sudipta Sengupta; Bikash Sharma; Moinuddin K Qureshi,Abstract A longstanding goal of SSD virtualization has been to provide performanceisolation between multiple tenants sharing the device. Virtualizing SSDs; however; hastraditionally been a challenge because of the fundamental tussle between resource isolationand the lifetime of the device–existing SSDs aim to uniformly age all the regions of flash andthis hurts isolation. We propose utilizing flash parallelism to improve isolation betweenvirtual SSDs by running them on dedicated channels and dies. Furthermore; we offer acomplete solution by also managing the wear. We propose allowing the wear of differentchannels and dies to diverge at fine time granularities in favor of isolation and adjusting thatimbalance at a coarse time granularity in a principled manner.

Traffic-independent allocation of working and restoration capacity in networks,*,A given network of nodes that are interconnected by links having corresponding capacitieshas each link's capacity divided into working capacity and restoration capacity without apriori information about network traffic characteristics.

Configuring networks with content filtering nodes with applications to network security,Murali Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,With the rapid increase in the frequency of worm attacks; there has been significant interestin developing network based mechanisms that slow or contain worm propagation. Onesuggested network-based approach is the use of special content filtering nodes thatexamine the complete content of each packet and block traffic that contain strings matchinga pre-specified set of worm signatures. To be effective; containment systems need to havefast reaction times (content filtering with the appropriate signatures must be activated verysoon after the start of an attack) and need to be comprehensive in the sense that everypacket routed through the network must be examined at least once. Since network-basedcontent filtering is expensive; it is desirable to make the best use of deployable contentfiltering capability.

For filepositions within the chunk size restriction; a signature representative of a window fingerprintis compared with a target pattern; with a chunk boundary candidate identified if matched.Other signatures and patterns are then checked to determine a highest ranking signature(corresponding to a lowest numbered Rule) to associate with that chunk boundarycandidate; or set an actual boundary if the highest ranked signature is matched. If themaximum chunk size is reached without matching the highest ranked signature; thechunking mechanism regresses to set the boundary based on the candidate with the nexthighest ranked signature (if no candidates; the boundary is set at the maximum).

On optimality of routing for multi-source multicast communication scenarios with node uplink constraints,Sudipta Sengupta; Minghua Chen; Philip A Chou; Jin Li,We consider multi-source multicast communication scenarios in which each node has anaggregate outbound traffic capacity and can directly communicate with any other node. Thisis motivated by peer-to-peer (P2P) information dissemination applications on the Internet inwhich the uplink capacity of nodes is usually the bottleneck; being several times smallerthan the downlink capacity. We also allow the communication in a group to be helped bynon-receiver nodes (with respect to that group) as relays. Extending an earlier result for thesingle source case; we show that when coding is not allowed across sources; routing isoptimal. Also; as a rather surprising discovery; we show that when all groups have pairwiseidentical or disjoint receivers; routing is optimal even when coding across sources isallowed. Moreover; routing along a linear number of trees per source is sufficient to …,Information Theory; 2008. ISIT 2008. IEEE International Symposium on,2008,8

Efficient and robust routing of highly variable traffic,Sudipta Sengupta,Many emerging applications for the Internet are characterized by highly variable trafficbehavior over time that is difficult to predict. Classical approaches to network design rely ona model in which a single traffic matrix is estimated.

Capacity allocation and routing of locally restorable bandwidth guaranteed connections,Randeep S Bhatia; S Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,An important feature of MPLS networks is local restoration where detour paths are set-up apriori. The detour is such that failed links or nodes can be bypassed locally from the firstnode that is upstream from the failures. This local bypass activation from the first detectionpoint for failures permits much faster recovery than end-to-end path based mechanisms thatrequire failure information to propagate to the network edges. However; local restoration ofbandwidth guaranteed connections can be expensive in the additional network capacityneeded. Hence; it is important to minimize and share restoration capacity. The problem ofrouting with local restoration requirements has been studied previously in a dynamic on-linesetting. However; there are no satisfactory algorithms for the problem of pre-provisioning fastrestorable connections when the aggregate traffic demands are known (as would be the …,INFOCOM 2005. 24th Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies.

The second concept; called eoptimization provides an alternativeapproach to approximation schemes for measuring distance from optimality. In contrast tothe worst-case relative error; the notion of an eoptimal solution is invariant under subtractionof a constant from the objective function; and it is properly defined even if the objectivefunction takes on negative values.

Today's data centers use expensive enterprise-class networkingequipment and associated best-practices that were not designed for the requirements ofInternet-scale data center services--they severely limit server-to-server network capacity;create fragmented pools of servers that do not allow any service to run on any server; andhave poor reliability and utilization.

Guaranteed performance routing of unpredictable traffic with fast path restoration,Murali Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract Two-phase routing; where traffic is first distributed to intermediate nodes beforebeing routed to the final destination; has been recently proposed for handling widelyfluctuating traffic without the need to adapt network routing to changing traffic. Preconfiguringthe network in a traffic-independent manner using two-phase routing simplifies networkoperation considerably. In this paper; we extend this routing scheme by providing resiliencyagainst link failures through fast path restoration along disjoint end-to-end backup paths. Weview this as important progress toward adding carrier-class reliability to the robustness of thescheme so as to facilitate its future deployment in Internet service provider (ISP) networks.On the theoretical side; the main contribution of the paper is the development of linear-programming-based and fast combinatorial algorithms for two-phase routing with fast …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2009,2
Peer-to-peer utility maximization,Minghua Chen; Sudipta Sengupta; Miroslav Ponec; Philip A Chou; Jin Li,In this paper; we study the problem of utility maximization in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems; inwhich aggregate utilities are maximized by running distributed algorithms on P2P nodes thatare constrained by their uplink capacities. This may be understood as extending the seminalflow control framework in [1] and [2] from single-path unicast over general topology to multi-path multicast over P2P topology; with network coding allowed. For single-rate multicastover certain popular P2P topologies; we show that routing along a linear number of trees persource can achieve the largest rate region that can be possibly obtained by (inter-session)network coding. This simplification result allows us to develop a new multi-tree routingformulation for the problem. Despite of the negative results in literature on convergence ofPrimal-dual algorithms under multi-path settings; we have been able to develop a delay …,Information Sciences and Systems; 2008.

Weak chaos and strong intermittency in DC-DC converters operating in discontinuous conduction mode,S Parui; S Banerjee; S Sengupta; B Basak,We show that when a current mode controlled DC-DC converter shifts from continuousconduction mode to discontinuous conduction mode; the system trajectory can no longer bestrongly chaotic as is possible under CCM. If the current reaches zero value in at least oneclock period within the period of the current waveform; the orbit becomes intermittentlyperiodic even when the system is globally chaotic.

Routing and grooming in two-tier survivable optical mesh networks,Somdip Datta; Subir Biswas; Sudipta Sengupta; Debanjan Saha,Abstract While deploying the next generation of optical networks with a mesh topology;telecommunications carriers are being confronted with a choice between wavelengthswitches that can switch traffic at SONET STS-48 (2.5 Gbps) granularity and sub-wavelengthgrooming capable switches that can switch at STS-1 (51 Mbps) granularity. The formercannot switch circuits of capacity lower than STS-48 without the help of external groomingdevices; and consumes high fragmented/unused capacity to support low capacity end to endcircuits using high capacity STS-48 channels. The latter almost eliminates such capacitywastage by supporting STS-1 level switching; but involves larger switching delays leading toslower restoration and requires more complicated hardware design that decreases switchscalability with increasing port count.

Capacity of multi-hop wireless networks with incomplete traffic specification,M Kodialam; TV Lakshman; Sudipta Sengupta,The capacity of wireless channels has been studied extensively by the information theorycommunity over the years. There have been several efforts to extend this theory to multi-hopwireless networks. One approach to estimating the capacity of multihop wireless networks isto determine asymptotically how the capacity scales as the number of nodes in the networkincreases. In these models; the traffic is typically assumed to be uniform. Another approachassumes that node locations and channel conditions are known and the question is todetermine whether a given traffic matrix can be routed on the wireless network. This usuallyinvolves solving jointly; routing; scheduling and power control problems to achieve the giventraffic matrix. In practice; it is quite difficult to estimate the traffic matrix and further; the trafficmatrix typically changes over time.

ε-optimization schemes and L-bit precision: Alternative perspectives for solving combinatorial optimization problems,James B Orlin; Andreas S Schulz; Sudipta Sengupta,Abstract Motivated by the need to deal with imprecise data in real-world optimizationproblems; we introduce two new models for algorithm design and analysis. The first model;called the L-bit precision model; leads to an alternate concept of polynomial-time solvability.Expressing numbers in L-bit precision reflects the format in which large numbers are storedin computers today. The second concept; called ε-optimization; provides an alternativeapproach to approximation schemes for measuring distance from optimality. In contrast tothe worst-case relative error; the notion of an ε-optimal solution is invariant under subtractionof a constant from the objective function; and it is properly defined even if the objectivefunction takes on negative values. Besides discussing the relation between these twomodels and preexisting concepts; we focus on designing polynomial-time algorithms for …,Discrete Optimization,2008,1
Erraticity moment of bin multiplicity and rapidity gap of fast TFs from 84 Kr-Ag/Br interaction at 0.95 A GeV/c,B Bhattacharjee; B Debnath; S Sengupta; A Mukhopadhyay,Here we report the emission characteristics of spatial distribution of target associated fastparticles from 84 Kr-Ag/Br interaction at 0.95 A GeV. The erraticity analysis of bin multiplicityof knocked out protons confirms a power law behavior of the form C p; q∝ M ψ q (p). The ψq (p) are found to have non zero values confirming erractic behavior of spatial pattern. Tofurther characterise the spatial pattern of emitted fast particles; erraticity moments of rapiditygap between the tracks have also been estimated. The entropy like quantity S q are found todiffer significantly from 1 thereby confirming again the erratic behavior of target associatedfast particles. Due to low averaged multiplicity; the conclusions drawn from gap analysis arefound to be more convincing than those from erraticity analysis of bin multiplicity.(author),Indian Journal of Physics and Proceedings of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science,2007,1
SRLG Diversity Aware Protection Routing in Optical Mesh Networks,Mansoor Alicherry; Randeep Bhatia; Iraj Saniee; Sudipta Sengupta,Survivability is an important requirement in optical transport networks. Under 1+ 1-pathbased protection mechanism; a connection consists of two" diverse" paths; one of whichcould be designated as primary (eg; the shorter hop path) and the other as backup. Thesignal is transmitted by the source on both paths. Under no-failure condition; the receiverselects the primary path signal; and upon failure; it switches to the backup path signal. 1+ 1-path protection is characterized by simplicity and low restoration latency (receiver switchingtime of typically few to 10 msec) and meets the design target of 50 msec associated withrestoration in SONET/SDH rings. Thus; in spite of its bandwidth expensive nature; manycarriers currently plan to implement this as the first restoration protocol as they deploy orevolve to optical mesh networks. same risk,National Fiber Optic Engineers Conference,2005,1

P2p streaming capacity,Sudipta Sengupta; Shao Liu; Minghua Chen; Mung Chiang; Jin Li; Philip A Chou,Abstract—Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems provide a scalable way to stream content to multiplereceivers over the Internet. The maximum rate achievable by all receivers is the capacity of aP2P streaming session. We provide a taxonomy of sixteen problem formulations; dependingon whether there is a single P2P session or there are multiple concurrent sessions; whetherthe given topology is a full mesh graph or an arbitrary graph; whether the number of peers anode can have is bounded or not; and whether there are non-receiver relay nodes or not. Ineach formulation; computing P2P streaming capacity requires the computation of an optimalset of multicast trees; with an exponential complexity; except in three simplest formulationsthat have been recently solved with polynomial time algorithms. These solutions; however;do not extend to the other more general formulations. In this paper; we develop a family of …,TechReport number: Msr-tr-2009-68,*,1

Online Deduplication for Databases,Lianghong Xu; Andrew Pavlo; Sudipta Sengupta; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract dbDedup is a similarity-based deduplication scheme for on-line databasemanagement systems (DBMSs). Beyond block-level compression of individual databasepages or operation log (oplog) messages; as used in today's DBMSs; dbDedup uses byte-level delta encoding of individual records within the database to achieve greater savings.dbDedup's single-pass encoding method can be integrated into the storage and loggingcomponents of a DBMS to provide two benefits:(1) reduced size of data stored on diskbeyond what traditional compression schemes provide; and (2) reduced amount of datatransmitted over the network for replication services. To evaluate our work; we implementeddbDedup in a distributed NoSQL DBMS and analyzed its properties using four real datasets.Our results show that dbDedup achieves up to 37x reduction in the storage size and …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,*

Similarity-based Deduplication for Databases,Lianghong Xu; Andrew Pavlo; Sudipta Sengupta; Gregory R Ganger,The rate of data growth outpaces the decline of hardware costs. Database compression isone solution to this problem. For database storage; in addition to space saving; compressionhelps reduce the number of disk I/Os and improve performance; because queried data fits infewer pages. For distributed databases replicated across geographical regions; there is alsoa strong need to reduce the amount of data transfer used to keep replicas in sync. The mostwidely used approach for data reduction in DBMSs is block-level compression [29; 36; 44;41; 3; 16]. Although this method is simple and effective; it fails to address redundancy acrossblocks and therefore leaves significant room for improvement for many applications (eg; dueto app-level versioning in wikis or partial record copying in message boards).

In this paper themean multiplicities of the different charged secondaries emitted in the interaction of 24 Mg-Em at 4.5 A GeV have been investigated as a function of the total charge Q pf of theprojectile spectator fragments. It has been observed that the average number of theproduced particles; and the heavily ionizing particles; decreases exponentially with theincrease of Q pf showing strong correlation with the geometry of the collision.

We focus on techniques for scheduling a set ofindependent jobs with the flexibility of rejecting a subset of the jobs in order to guarantee anaverage good quality of service for the scheduled jobs.
