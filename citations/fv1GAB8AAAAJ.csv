Pertussisvaccines have been available since the 1920s; but the worst pertussis epidemic since 1959occurred in 2012; with more than 38;000 cases nationwide reported by last December. 4; 5Outbreaks of measles also continue to occur; even though a measles vaccine has beenlicensed in the United States since 1963. 6 The current low overall incidence of contagiousdiseases has resulted in a perception that the risk of these diseases is low—andparadoxically—in increased concerns about the costs and consequences of vaccinationprograms (eg; adverse events; expenses; and inconvenience). 7–9 Low perceived risk of …,The New England journal of medicine,2013,142
Learning response time for websources using query feedback and application in query optimization,Jean-Robert Gruser; Louiqa Raschid; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Tao Zhan,Abstract The rapid growth of the Internet and support for interoperability protocols hasincreased the number of Web accessible sources; WebSources. Current wrapper mediatorarchitectures need to be extended with a wrapper cost model (WCM) for WebSources thatcan estimate the response time (delays) to access sources as well as other relevantstatistics. In this paper; we present a Web prediction tool (WebPT); a tool that is based onlearning using query feedback from WebSources. The WebPT uses dimensions time of day;day; and quantity of data; to learn response times from a particular WebSource; and topredict the expected response time (delay) for some query. Experiment data was collectedfrom several sources; and those dimensions that were significant in estimating the responsetime were determined. We then trained the WebPT on the collected data; to use the three …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2000,96
Efficient evaluation of queries in a mediator for websources,Vladimir Zadorozhny; Louiqa Raschid; Maria Esther Vidal; Tolga Urhan; Laura Bright,Abstract We consider an architecture of mediators and wrappers for Internet accessibleWebSources of limited query capability. Each call to a source is a WebSourceImplementation (WSI) and it is associated with both a capability and (a possibly dynamic)cost. The multiplicity of WSIs with varying costs and capabilities increases the complexity ofa traditional optimizer that must assign WSIs for each remote relation in the query whilegenerating an (optimal) plan. We present a two-phase Web Query Optimizer (WQO). In a pre-optimization phase; the WQO selects one or more WSIs for a pre-plan; a pre-plan representsa space of query evaluation plans (plans) based on this choice of WSIs. The WQO uses cost-based heuristics to evaluate the choice of WSI assignment in the pre-plan and to choose agood pre-plan. The WQO uses the pre-plan to drive the extended relational optimizer to …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,77
A user modeling server for contemporary adaptive hypermedia: An evaluation of the push approach to evidence propagation,Michael Yudelson; Peter Brusilovsky; Vladimir Zadorozhny,Abstract Despite the growing popularity of user modeling servers; little attention has beenpaid to optimizing and evaluating the performance of these servers. We argue thatimplementation issues and their influence on server performance should become the centralfocus of the user modeling community; since there is a sharply increasing real-life load onuser modeling servers; This paper focuses on a specific implementation-level aspect of usermodeling servers–the choice of push or pull approaches to evidence propagation. Wepresent a new push-based implementation of our user modeling server CUMULATE andcompare its performance with the performance of the original pull-based CUMULATE server.,International conference on user modeling,2007,41
A distributed and scalable time slot allocation protocol for wireless sensor networks,Chih-Kuang Lin; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Prashant Krishnamurthy; Ho-Hyun Park; Chan-Gun Lee,There are performance deficiencies that hamper the deployment of Wireless SensorNetworks (WSNs) in critical monitoring applications. Such applications are characterized byconsiderable network load generated as a result of sensing some characteristics of themonitored system. Excessive packet collisions lead to packet losses and retransmissions;resulting in significant overhead costs and latency. In order to address this issue; weintroduce a distributed and scalable scheduling access scheme that mitigates high data lossin data-intensive sensor networks and can also handle some mobility. Our approachalleviates transmission collisions by employing virtual grids that adopt Latin Squarescharacteristics to time slot assignments. We show that our algorithm derives conflict-free timeslot allocation schedules without incurring global overhead in scheduling. Furthermore …,IEEE Transactions on mobile computing,2011,38
A framework for extending the synergy between MAC layer and query optimization in sensor networks,Vladimir I Zadorozhny; Panos K Chrysanthis; Prashant Krishnamurthy,Abstract Queries in sensor networks are expected to produce results in a timely manner andfor long periods; as needed. This implies that sensor queries need to be optimized withrespect to both response time and energy consumption. With these requirements in mind;we develop novel cross-layer optimization techniques that utilize information about how themedium access control (MAC) layer operates while processing queries in large scale sensornetwork environments. The central framework of our approach is a Data TransmissionAlgebra that uniformly captures the structure of data transmissions along with theirconstraints and requirements. Our framework enables both qualitative analysis andquantitative cost-based optimization of sensor queries. We illustrate the effectiveness of ourframework by developing a collision-aware scheduler and evaluating it experimentally.,Proceeedings of the 1st international workshop on Data management for sensor networks: in conjunction with VLDB 2004,2004,32
A novel approach to trust management in unattended wireless sensor networks,Yi Ren; Vladimir I Zadorozhny; Vladimir A Oleshchuk; Frank Y Li,Unattended Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are characterized by long periods ofdisconnected operation and fixed or irregular intervals between sink visits. The absence ofan online trusted third party implies that existing WSN trust management schemes are notapplicable to UWSNs. In this paper; we propose a trust management scheme for UWSNs toprovide efficient and robust trust data storage and trust generation. For trust data storage; weemploy a geographic hash table to identify storage nodes and to significantly decreasestorage cost. We use subjective logic based consensus techniques to mitigate trustfluctuations caused by environmental factors. We exploit a set of trust similarity functions todetect trust outliers and to sustain trust pollution attacks. We demonstrate; through extensiveanalyses and simulations; that the proposed scheme is efficient; robust and scalable.,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2014,30

Algebraic optimization of data delivery patterns in mobile sensor networks,Vladimir Zadorozhny; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Database-like query processing over a network of sensors has become an attractiveparadigm for building sensor applications. A sensor query is characterized by data streamsamong participating sensor nodes with possible in-node data filtering or aggregation; andcan be described as a tree-like data delivery pattern. The data delivery pattern can also beconsidered as a query execution plan; or query routing tree. We propose an algebraicoptimization of the query routing tree construction and reconfiguration. In particular; we aimat generating query trees that maximize collision-free concurrent data transmissions hencereducing energy and time wastes due to retransmissions. Towards this; we introduce a datatransmission algebra (DTA) and apply it for efficient generation of such query trees.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2004.

Towards adaptive sensor data management for distributed fire evacuation infrastructure,Andrii Cherniak; Vladimir Zadorozhny,We introduce a novel strategy for data processing in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) inthe case of emergency fire evacuation with stringent delay constraints. Such networksshould perform distributed emergency assessment; continuous emergency monitoring; anddynamic selection of optimal evacuation strategies. The obvious complexity of these tasksrestricts applying existing WSN optimization solutions. Our approach is based onconsidering the WSN as a complex adaptive system where a complicated task of multi-agentscheduling is factored into a set of smaller subtasks. In this case; decisions made locally byindividual sensors can efficiently converge into desirable information processing patterns. Anotable feature of our method is its scalability; which allows the sensornet to operate withsufficient quality of service under heavy information loads.

Latency profiles: Performance monitoring for wide area applications,Louiqa Raschid; Hui-Fang Wen; Avigdor Gal; Vladimir Zadorozhny,Recent technological advances have enabled the deployment of wide area applicationsagainst Internet accessible sources. A performance challenge to applications in such asetting is the unpredictable end-to-end latency of accessing these sources. We use passiveinformation gathering mechanisms to learn end-to-end latency distributions and constructlatency profiles (LPs). We hypothesize that a group of clients; within an autonomous system(AS); that are accessing a content server; in another AS; may be represented by (one ormore) LPs. Related networking research on IDMaps; points of congestion; and BGP routessupport such hypothesis. We develop aggregate LPs to provide coverage of groups(clusters) of client-server pairs.

Scalable catalog infrastructure for managing access costs and source selection in wide area networks,Vladimir Zadorozhny; Louiqa Raschid; Avigdor Gal,A WAN environment; such as the Internet; connects a federation of hundreds of servers withtens of thousands of clients; which poses a substantial scalability challenge. Clients maychoose among sources that vary in both their content and quality as well as in their accesslatencies. At the same time; Internet accessible data sources exhibit transient behavior; theunpredictable behavior of a dynamic WAN results in a wide variability in access cost (end-to-end latency). This motivates a need for a source selection strategy that requires maintainingaccess cost distributions (latency profiles) for each client/server pair. However; in thepresence of hundreds of servers and thousands of clients; managing latency profiles cannotscale.

Towards an integrated CORBA/RAISE semantic interoperable environment,Vladimir Zadorozhny,Abstract The report describes the concept of an integrated CORBA/RAISE environment foraddressing problems in the semantic-based reuse of distributed CORBA-compliant software.Such environment could support a highly con dent reasoning about re-usability andconsistent composability of pre-existing software components under applicationrequirements. The reasoning is based on the re nement of the application speci cation by aspeci cation of the components. We clarify the concept of Semantic InteroperableEnvironment (SIE) wrt CORBA and RAISE; and de ne a general architecture ofCORBA/RAISE SIE based on OMG IDL/RSL mapping and IDL extensions. We also considerquestions of client/component adaptation; in particular; by decomposition of client specications.

Adaptive Social Learning Based On Crowdsourcing,Evgeny Karataev; Vladimir Zadorozhny,Many techniques have been developed to enhance learning experience with computertechnology. A particularly great influence of technology on learning came with theemergence of the web and adaptive educational hypermedia systems. While the webenables users to interact and collaborate with each other to create; organize; and shareknowledge via user-generated content; majority of e-learning systems do not utilize thepower of their users to create high quality educational content and provide data for adaptivealgorithms. In this paper; we introduce a novel social learning framework that allowsanybody to author educational content in a form of mini-lessons; learn lessons by followingadaptive learning pathways as well as interact with their peers as in any social network. Theproposed approach combines concepts of crowd-sourcing; online social networks; and …,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,2016,4
A Cognitive-based scheme for user reliability and expertise assessment in Q&A social networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Vladimir Oleshchuk,Q&A social media has gained a great deal of attention during recent years. People rely onthese sites to obtain information due to the number of advantages they offer as compared toconventional sources of knowledge (eg; asynchronous and convenient access). However;for the same question one may find highly contradictory answers; causing ambiguity withrespect to the correct information. This can be attributed to the presence of unreliable and/ornon-expert users. In this work; we propose a novel approach for estimating the reliability andexpertise of a user based on human cognitive traits. Every user can individually estimatethese values based on local pairwise interactions. We examine the convergenceperformance of our algorithm and we find that it can accurately assess the reliability and theexpertise of a user and can successfully react to the latter's behavior change.,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,4

With the growth of adaptive educational systems available to students; integrationof these systems is changing from an interesting research problem into an importantpractical task. One of the challenges that need to be accepted on the way is thedevelopment of mechanisms for student model integration. The architectural principles andrepresentation technologies employed by the adaptive educational systems define theapplicability of a particular integration approach.

Efficient Data Delivery in Wireless Sensor Networks: Algebraic Cross-layer Optimization Versus CSMA-CA.,Chih-Kuang Lin; Divyasheel Sharma; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Prashant Krishnamurthy,There are performance deficiencies that hamper the deployment of Wireless SensorNetworks (WSNs) in critical monitoring applications. Such applications are characterized byconsiderable network load generated as a result of sensing some characteristic (s) of themonitored system. Excessive packet collisions lead to packet losses and retransmissions;resulting in significant energy costs and latency. In order to address this issue; we proposean algebraic optimization framework based on Data Transmission Algebra (DTA) thatperforms collision-aware query scheduling in WSNs. In this paper; we compare ourframework with the existing 802.15. 4 CSMA-CA scheme. Our simulation-based study showsthat DTA considerably outperforms CSMA-CA; allowing the network to operate with sufficientquality of service even at higher data rates and heavy network loads.,Ad Hoc & Sensor Wireless Networks,2007,4
A systematic approach to reliability assessment in integrated databases,Vladimir Zadorozhny; John Grant,Abstract We provide a novel framework based on a systematic treatment of datainconsistency and the related concept of data reliability in integrated databases. Our maincontribution is the formalization of reliability assessment for historical data whereredundancy and inconsistency are common. We discover data inconsistency through theanalysis of relationships between existing reports in the integrated database. We present anew approach by defining properties (rules) that a good measure of reliability should satisfy.We then propose such measures and show which properties they satisfy. We also report ona simulation-based study of the introduced framework.,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2016,3
Process monitoring using maximum sequence divergence,Yihuang Kang; Vladimir Zadorozhny,Abstract Process monitoring involves tracking a system's behaviors; evaluating the currentstate of the system; and discovering interesting events that require immediate actions. In thispaper; we consider monitoring temporal system state sequences to help detect the changesof dynamic systems; check the divergence of the system development; and evaluate thesignificance of the deviation. We begin with discussions of data reduction; symbolic datarepresentation; and anomaly detection in temporal discrete sequences. Time-seriesrepresentation methods are also discussed and used in this paper to discretize raw data intosequences of system states. Markov chains and stationary-state distributions arecontinuously generated from temporal sequences to represent snapshots of the systemdynamics in different time frames. We use generalized Jensen–Shannon divergence as …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2016,3
An efficient; robust; and scalable trust management scheme for unattended wireless sensor networks,Yi Ren; Vladimir I Zadorozhny; Vladimir A Oleshchuk; Frank Y Li,Unattended Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are characterized by long periods ofdisconnected operation and fixed or irregular intervals between visits by the sink. Theabsence of an online trusted third party; ie; an on-site sink; makes existing trust managementschemes used in legacy wireless sensor networks not applicable to UWSNs directly. In thispaper; we propose a trust management scheme for UWSNs to provide efficient; robust andscalable trust data storage. For trust data storage; we employ geographic hash table toefficiently identify data storage nodes and to significantly reduce storage cost. Wedemonstrate; through detailed analyses and extensive simulations; that the proposedscheme is efficient; robust; and scalable.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,3
Sensor queries: Algebraic optimization for time and energy,Vladimir I Zadorozhny; Panos K Chrysanthis; Divyasheel Sharma,Sensor networks naturally apply to a broad range of applications that involve systemmonitoring and information tracking (eg; airport security infrastructure; monitoring of childrenin metropolitan areas; product transition in warehouse networks; fine-grained weather/environmental measurements; etc.). Meanwhile; there are considerable performancedeficiencies in applying existing sensornets in the applications that have stringentrequirements for efficient mechanisms for querying sensor data and delivering the queryresult. The amount of data collected from all relevant sensors may be quite large and willrequire high data transmission rates to satisfy time constraints. It implies that excessivepacket collisions can lead to packet losses and retransmissions resulting in significantenergy costs and latency.

Wide area performance monitoring using aggregate latency profiles,Vladimir Zadorozhny; Avigdor Gal; Louiqa Raschid; Qiang Ye,Abstract A challenge in supporting Wide Area Applications (WAA) is that of scalableperformance management. Individual Latency Profiles (iLPs) were proposed in the literatureto capture latency distributions experienced by clients when connecting to a server; it is apassive measurement made by client applications and is gathered on a continuous basis. Inthis paper; we propose a scalable technique for managing iLPs by aggregating them intoaggregate Latency Profiles (aLPs). We use measures such as mutual information andcorrelation to compare the similarity of pairs of iLPs.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2004,3
Logical approach to capability-based rewriting in a mediator for websources,John Grant; Vladimir Zadorozhny,Abstract A logic-based specification for Capability-Based Rewriting (CBR) in web queryprocessing is presented. Within this approach it is shown how Semantic Query Optimization(SQO) can be used to improve the performance of a web query optimizer. Our approachallows for the characterization of different CBR tools and their properties in a uniform andgeneric manner. It also reveals important optimization opportunities (based on SQO) whichare commonly ignored in existing CBR tools.,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2001,3
Efficient metaobject control using mediators,Victor Ivannikov; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Rainer Kossmann; Boris Novikov,Abstract In this paper we propose an approach to optimization of reflection which combinesflexibility and efficiency while implementing metaobject-based systems. The main idea is toflatten nested metainterpreter layers using a particular kind of mediator objects; whichprovide object/metaobject connection. One of the most significant features of the approach isthat it allows to carry out what we called metaupgrading of existing software systems in asystematic way; efficient and transparent for the application. The meta-upgrading approachbased on Interface Object technology can be efficiently used for system integration and re-use of legacy software components.,International Andrei Ershov Memorial Conference on Perspectives of System Informatics,1996,3

Using non-random associations for predicting latency in WANs,Vladimir Zadorozhny; Louiqa Raschid; Avigdor Gal; Qiang Ye; Hyma Murthy,Abstract In this paper; we propose a scalable performance management tool for Wide AreaApplications. Our objective is to scalably identify non-random associations between pairs ofindividual Latency Profiles (iLPs)(ie; latency distributions experienced by clients whenconnecting to a server) and exploit them in latency prediction. Our approach utilizesRelevance Networks (RNs) to manage tens of thousands of iLPs. Non-random associationsbetween iLPs can be identified by topology-independent measures such as correlation andmutual information. We demonstrate that these non-random associations do indeed have asignificant impact in improving the error of latency prediction.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2005,2
Data Transmission Algebra for Collision-Aware Scheduling in Sensor Networks,V Zadorozhny; Divyasheel Sharma; P Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Sensor databases extend database technology to query and monitor the physical world as ahighly distributed database. In this paper we consider a Data Transmission Algebra (DTA)that allows a query optimizer to utilize lower layer communication protocols in schedulingsensor database queries. By being able to determine the order in which data are processedat sensor nodes and transmitted between sensor nodes in a query routing tree; a queryoptimizer can both improve the response time and reduce the energy consumption perquery. We use a logical framework to specify DTA semantics and to prove its soundness andcompleteness. Further; we prove that DTA query execution schedules have the key propertyof being collision-free.,Formal Methods in Compositional infrastructures of Heterogeneous Distributed Information Systems; Russian Academy of Science Publ,2005,2
H-FUSE: Efficient fusion of aggregated historical data,Zongge Liu; Hyun Ah Song; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Christos Faloutsos; Nicholas Sidiropoulos,Abstract In this paper; we address the challenge of recovering a time sequence of countsfrom aggregated historical data. For example; given a mixture of the monthly and weeklysums; how can we find the daily counts of people infected with flu? In general; what is thebest way to recover historical counts from aggregated; possibly overlapping historicalreports; in the presence of missing values? Equally importantly; how much should we trustthis reconstruction? We propose H-Fuse; a novel method that solves above problems byallowing injection of domain knowledge in a principled way; and turning the task into a well-defined optimization problem. H-Fuse has the following desirable properties:(a)Effectiveness; recovering historical data from aggregated reports with high accuracy;(b) Self-awareness; providing an assessment of when the recovery is not reliable;(c) Scalability …,*,2017,1

Adaptive Information Delivery in Data-Intensive Sensor Networks,Divyasheel Sharma; Vladimir Zadorozhny,The combined effect of various problems such as congestion; collisions and routeunavailability for data in Data-Intensive Sensor Networks is hard to estimate. This is one ofthe major reasons why existing solutions that try to optimize all these do not scale and havelimited applicability. Our light-weight approach uses decisions made locally by individualsensors to efficiently discover desirable information processing patterns. Since; each nodemakes decisions based on local knowledge; this approach is more scalable.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2011 12th IEEE International Conference on,2011,1
Alternative path selection in resilient web infrastructure using performance dependencies,Vladimir I Zadorozhny; Louiqa Raschid,Abstract We propose an approach to efficiently identify and substitute alternate paths inresilient Web infrastructure using overlay networks for reliable information access. Ourapproach is based on scalable topology-independent analysis of network behavior toidentify dependencies among paths in the overlay network. Such dependencies can becharacterized as non-random associations between client/server pairs and will be measuredusing correlation and mutual information metrics. We demonstrate that these metrics reflectphysical topology characteristics; e; g.; the overlap of BGP paths.,Journal of Web Engineering,2007,1
An Optimizer Strategy to Generate Good Low Cost Plans for Mediator Queries,Marıa Esther Vidal; Louiqa Raschid; Vladimir Zadorozhny,Recent technology advances have enabled mediated query processing in the wide areaenvironment with remote relations that are resident on Internet accessible WebSources.There are many characteristics of mediated query processing in this environment that posesubstantial challenges. One characteristic is that typically there are several alternateWebSources for each remote relation. This is due to architectures of mirror sites or replicas;proxy sites with cached copies; or portals that gather information from several different sites.Thus; a subquery on a relation can be submitted to multiple candidate WebSources. Anothercharacteristic is that unlike DBMS sources; the API for WebSources has limited queryprocessing capabilities; eg; they require a binding for some input attribute; in order to returnvalues for output attributes of the remote relation. These capabilities introduce …,*,2001,1

Considering CORBA in a general context ofspeci cation and implementation barriers between request and an operation; we constructtwo independent speci cation hierarchies; characterising correspondingly brokerimplementation and object model aspects of CORBA. Though being orthogonal; thehierarchies can be easily composed resulting in a number of CORBA speci cations of dierent abstraction levels; focused on di erent classes of CORBA features. It allows us todescribe CORBA in a uniform and modular manner. We also considered how di erentCORBA features can be de ned on top of the basic speci cations.

GB-R: A Fast and Effective Gray-Box Reconstruction of Cascade Time-Series,Hyun Ah Song; Fan Yang; Zongge Liu; Wilbert van Panhuis; Nicholas Sidiropoulos; Christos Faloutsos; Vladimir Zadorozhny,Given some (but not all) monthly totals of people with measles (or counts of product-unitssold; or counts of retweets); how can we recover the weekly counts? Requiring smoothnessbetween successive weeks is reasonable-but can we do better; if we have some domainknowledge? For example; we know that measles (flu; count-of-retweets; etc) follow a specificcascade model; like the so-called'SIS'. The answer is' yes'.

User-centered design and evaluation of RxMAGIC: A Prescription Management And General Inventory Control system for free clinic dispensaries,Arielle M Fisher; Harry Hochheiser; Lauren Jonkman; Julia Driessen; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Gerald P Douglas,Medication management is a complex and expensive multistage process that covers theprescribing and ordering; order communication; dispensing; administering; and monitoringand use of prescription medications. While challenges in medication management areubiquitous across all settings; they can be particularly exacerbated in a free clinic that servesa medically vulnerable population. These patients suffer from financial constraints; poorhealth literacy; multiple chronic conditions; and medication non-adherence. Clinicalpharmacists play an integral role in the provision of healthcare services to these patientsand could benefit from the use of medication management information technology (MMIT) toprovide efficiencies in the tracking; provision; and use of medications.

Two novel subjective logic-based in-network data processing schemes in wireless sensor networks,Farhad Firoozi; Frank Y Li; Vladimir I Zadorozhny,Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of connected low-cost and small-size sensornodes. The sensor nodes are characterized by various limitations; such as energyavailability; processing power; and storage capacity. Typically; nodes collect data from anenvironment and transmit the raw or processed data to a sink. However; the collected datacontains often redundant information. An in-network processing scheme attempts toeliminate or reduce such redundancy in sensed data. In this paper; we propose two in-network data processing schemes for WSNs; which are built based on a lightweight algebrafor data processing. The schemes bring also benefits like decreased network traffic load andincreased reliability for a network.

Data Intensive Mobile Sensornets: Killer Applications and Grand Deterrents,Vladimir Zadorozhny; Prashant Krishnamurthy,Data Intensive Mobile Sensor Networks (DIMSNs) introduce a promising but still under-utilized technology. Meanwhile; there is a growing confidence that certain applications(Killer Apps) have a potential to create a sustained market for this technology. For example;a large team of cooperative mobile robots can be considered as a wireless sensornetcomposed of a number of mobile nodes most of which are powerconstrained. Such mobilerobots can be deployed in conjunction with stationary sensor nodes to acquire and processdata for surveillance and tracking; environmental monitoring for highly sensitive areas; orexecute search and rescue operations.

Biermann & Co,William Treharne Jones,'The relationship between the Party and artists in our country is exemplary; but we can't goaround boasting about it because of the less fortunate situation facing writers and artists inother socialist countries-such as Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.'This remark wasmade to me by a leading East German writer in the summer of 1973. It is perhaps sad thatjust at the time when knowledge of the GDR'S more tolerant Kulturpolitik had begun to seepthrough to the West a series of events; climaxing in the expatriation of the dissident poet andsinger; Wolf Biermann; should throw the whole achievement of the Honecker leadership intodoubt. At the time of writing; the signs are that yet another attempt to liberalise cultural life inEast Germany has ended in failure. The crisis began not with Biermann; but with the lyricistReiner Kunze.

Efficient Data Delivery in Sensor Networks: Algebraic Cross-layer Optimization Versus CSMA/CA,Chih-Kuang Lin; Divyasheel Sharma; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Prashant Krishnamurthy,Abstract—Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) naturally apply to a broad range ofapplications that involve system monitoring and information tracking. However; there areperformance deficiencies that hamper the deployment of WSNs based on existing standardsin critical monitoring applications. As such applications are characterized by considerablenetwork load created in response to ambient or forced excitation of the monitored system;we see excessive packet collisions leading to packet losses and retransmissions; resultingin significant energy costs and latency. In order to address this issue; we develop cross-layerquery processing strategies that fuse techniques from the areas of databases andnetworking. In particular; we proposed an algebraic optimization framework based on DataTransmission Algebra (DTA) that performs collision-aware query scheduling in WSNs. In …,*,*,*

Using Non-random Associations for Predicting Latency in WANs,Louiqa Raschid; Qiang Ye; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Avigdor Gal; Hyma Murthy,Abstract Wide area applications (WAAs) utilize a WAN infrastructure; eg; the Internet; toconnect a federation of hundreds of servers with tens of thousands of clients and they posesubstantial challenges. The diversity of sources means that clients may choose amongsources that vary both in their content and quality as well as their access latencies. However;Internet accessible data sources exhibit transient behavior; the unpredictable behavior of adynamic WAN results in a wide variability in access latency (end-to-end delay). IndividualLatency Profiles (iLPs) were proposed to capture latency distributions experienced by clientswhen connecting to a server; it is a passive measurement made by client applications and isgathered on a continuous basis. In this paper; we propose a management tool based onRelevance Networks (RNs) to managed tens of thousands of iLPs. Our objective is to …,*,*,*

Sensor Queries: Algebraic Optimization for Data Quality; Time and Energy,Vladimir I Zadorozhny; Panos K Chrysanthis; Divyasheel Sharma,Abstract Sensor databases extend database technology to query and monitor the physicalworld as a highly distributed database. In this paper we consider a Data TransmissionAlgebra (DTA) that allows a query optimizer to utilize lower layer communication protocols inscheduling sensor database queries. By being able to determine the order in which data areprocessed at sensor nodes and transmitted between sensor nodes in a query routing tree; aquery optimizer can both improve the response time and reduce the energy consumptionper query. We use a logical framework to specify DTA semantics and to prove its soundnessand completeness. Further; we prove that DTA query execution schedules have the keyproperty of being collision-free.,*,*,*

Wide Area Performance Monitoring Using Aggregate Latency Profiles,Qiang Ye; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Avigdor Gal; Louiqa Raschid,Abstract. A challenge in supporting Wide Area Applications (WAA) is that of scalableperformance management. In particular; the unpredictable behavior of a dynamic WANresults in a considerable variability of latencies; which calls for models to predict the accesslatency (end-to-end delay) between a client and a server. Networking research has hadsignificant success in developing models to predict latency; based on physical topologiesand grounded in network protocols and behavior. However; such solutions are not designedto scale to the continuous monitoring and maintenance required for end-to-end support ofmillions of clients. Individual Latency Profiles (iLPs) capture latency distributionsexperienced by clients when connecting to a server; it is a passive measurement made byclient applications and is gathered on a continuous basis.
