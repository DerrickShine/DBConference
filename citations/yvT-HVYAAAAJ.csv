BG: A Benchmark to Evaluate Interactive Social Networking Actions.,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract BG is a benchmark that rates a data store for processing interactive socialnetworking actions using a pre-specified service level agreement; SLA. An example SLAmay require 95% of issued requests to observe a response time faster than 100milliseconds. BG computes two different ratings named SoAR and Socialites. In addition; itelevates the amount of unpredictable data produced by a data store to a first class metric;including it as a key component of the SLA and quantifying it as a part of the benchmarkingprocess. One may use BG for a variety of purposes ranging from comparing different datastores with one another; evaluating alternative physical data organization techniques givena data store; quantifying the performance characteristics of a data store in the presence offailures (either CP or AP in CAP theorem); among others. This study illustrates BG's first …,CIDR,2013,62
A comparison of two physical data designs for interactive social networking actions,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap,Abstract This paper compares the performance of an SQL solution that implements arelational data model with a document store named MongoDB. We report on theperformance of a single node configuration of each data store and assume the database issmall enough to fit in main memory. We analyze utilization of the CPU cores and the networkbandwidth to compare the two data stores. Our key findings are as follows. First; for thosesocial networking actions that read and write a small amount of data; the join operator of theSQL solution is not slower than the JSON representation of MongoDB. Second; with a mix ofactions; the SQL solution provides either the same performance as MongoDB or outperformsit by 20%. Third; a middle-tier cache enhances the performance of both data stores as queryresult look up is significantly faster than query processing with either system.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,24
COSAR-CQN: an application transparent approach to cache consistency,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap; Sumita Barahmand,Abstract Cache managers speed up the performance of data intensive applications whoseworkload is dominated by queries. An example is memcached which is in use by very largewell-known sites such as Facebook. A key challenge of such systems is how to maintain thestate of the cache consistent with that of the database in the presence of updates. With SQLbased database management systems (DBMSs) that support query change notificationmechanism; one possible approach would require the cache manager to a) register queriesused to compute a key-value pair with the DBMS to subscribe for notifications when thequery result sets change; and b) delete the cached key-value pair (s) once notified of achange by the DBMS. This approach is independent of how the application updates thedatabase; eliminating application specific software for cache consistency. This reduces …,Twenty First International Conference On Software Engineering and Data Engineering,2012,13
D-Zipfian: a decentralized implementation of Zipfian,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract Zipfian distribution is used extensively to generate workloads to test; tune; andbenchmark data stores. This paper presents a decentralized implementation of thistechnique; named D-Zipfian; using N parallel generators to issue requests. A request is areference to a data item from a fixed population of data items. The challenge is for eachgenerator to reference a disjoint set of data items. Moreover; they should finish atapproximately the same time by performing work proportional to their processing capability.Intuitively; D-Zipfian assigns a total probability of 1/N to each of the N generators andrequires each generator to reference data items with a scaled probability. In the case ofheterogeneous generators; the total probability of each generator is proportional to itsprocessing capability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of D-Zipfian using empirical …,Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Testing Database Systems,2013,10
Benchmarking correctness of operations in big data applications,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,With a wide variety of big data applications; the past few years have witnessed an increasingnumber of data stores with novel design decisions that may sacrifice the correctness of anapplication's operations to enhance performance. This paper presents our work-in-progresson a framework that generates a validation component. The input to the framework is thecharacteristics of an application. Its output is a validation module that plugs-in to either anapplication or a benchmark to measure the amount of unpredictable data produced by adata store.,Modelling; Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS); 2014 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on,2014,9
Benchmarking interactive social networking actions,Sumita Barahmand,Abstract Social networking sites such as Google+; Facebook; Twitter and LinkedIn; are cloudservice providers for person to person communications. There are different approaches tobuilding these sites ranging from SQL to NoSQL and NewSQL; Cache Augmented SQL;graph databases and others. Some provide a tabular representation of data while othersoffer alternative models that scale out. Some may sacrifice strict ACID (Atomicity;Consistency; Isolation; Durability) properties and opt for BASE (Basically Available; Soft-state; Eventual consistency) to enhance performance. Independent of a qualitativediscussion of these approaches and their merits; a key question is how do these systemscompare with one another quantitatively? This dissertation investigates the viability of abenchmark to address this question.,*,2014,8
A mid-flight synopsis of the BG social networking benchmark,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Sumita Barahmand,Abstract BG is a benchmark that rates the performance of a data store for processinginteractive social networking actions such as view a member's profile; invite a member to befriends; accept a friend request; and others. It is motivated by a proliferation of data storesfrom a variety of academic and industrial contributors including social networkingcompanies; eg; Voldemort by LinkedIn. BG is designed to provide a system architect withinsights into alternative design principles such as the use of a weak consistency techniqueinstead of a strong one; different physical data models such as relational and JSON; factorsthat impact vertical and horizontal scalability of a data store; the consistency versusavailability tradeoff in the CAP theorem; among others. While BG is a recently introducedbenchmark (less than a year old as of this writing); it combines elements of maturer …,Workshop on Big Data Benchmarks,2013,8
An Evaluation of Alternative Physical Graph Data Designs for Processing Interactive Social Networking Actions,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Reihane Boghrati; Sumita Barahmand,Abstract This study quantifies the tradeoff associated with alternative physicalrepresentations of a social graph for processing interactive social networking actions. Weconduct this evaluation using a graph data store named Neo4j deployed in a client-server(REST) architecture using the BG benchmark. In addition to the average response time of adesign; we quantify its SoAR defined as the highest observed throughput given the followingservice level agreement: 95% of actions to observe a response time of 100 ms or faster. Foran action such as computing the shortest distance between two members; we observe atradeoff between speed and accuracy of the computed result. With this action; a relationaldata design provides a significantly faster response time than a graph design. The graphdesigns provide a higher SoAR than a relational one when the social graph includes …,Technology Conference on Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking,2014,7
Extensions of BG for testing and benchmarking alternative implementations of feed following,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Dobromir Montauk,Abstract Social networking sites are cloud service providers for person-to-personcommunication. Feed following is a key service where a member follows activity streams ofother members and entities such as fan pages. A follower receives a personalized fusion ofstreams produced by those followed. There are alternative definitions of the quality of feeddisplayed to a follower that might be impacted by the highly variable fan-out of the followsgraphs. This makes both an implementation of feed following and a validation of itscorrectness as big data challenges. This paper presents extensions of an interactive socialnetworking benchmark named BG with feed following actions. An implementation of theseactions is agnostic to a data store and can be customized for different data models anddesigns. We illustrate this extensibility feature of BG by evaluating two alternative …,ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Reliable Data Services and Systems (RDSS),2014,6

Expedited rating of data stores using agile data loading techniques,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract To benchmark and rate a data store; one must repeat experiments that impose adifferent amount of load on the data store. Workloads that modify the benchmark databasemay require the same database to be loaded repeatedly. This may constitute a significantportion of the time to rate a data store. This paper presents several agile data loadingtechniques to expedite the rating process. These techniques include generating the diskimage of the database once and re-using it; restoring the updated data items to their originalvalue; maintaining in-memory state of the database across different experiments to avoidrepeated loading of the database all together; and a hybrid of the third technique incombination with the other two. These techniques are general purpose and apply to avariety of cloud benchmarks.

An Analysis of BG’s Implementation of the Zipfian Distribution,Jason Yap; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Sumita Barahmand,This research note reports on the behavior of BG's implementation of the Zipfian distribution[2] with different exponents that control its degree of skew. We focus on how BG generatesrequests while preserving the intended distribution. We conclude with an analysis of thedegree of skew with the different exponents for the Zipfian distribution. BG [1] is a benchmarkthat emulates a member of a social networking site performing an interactive action such asviewing another member's profile; inviting a member to be friends; confirming friendshiprequests and others. One may utilize a Zipfian distribution to emulate the frequency at whicha member issues a social networking action. Assuming M is the number of members; theprobability of member i issuing an action is: pi (M; θ)= 1 i (1− θ)∑ M m= 1 (1 m (1− θ)) wherethe exponent θ characterizes the Zipfian distribution. The value of θ is greater than zero …,*,2013,4
On Scalability of Two NoSQL Data Stores for Processing Interactive Social Networking Actions,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jia Li,This paper quantifies the scalability of a document store named MongoDB and an extensiblestore named HBase for processing simple operations using a social networking benchmarknamed BG (www. bgbenchmark. org). We report on the vertical and the horizontal scalabilityof both data stores. We quantify speedup and scaleup characteristics of each data store'sSocial Action Rating (SoAR). SoAR is the highest observed throughput with a data storewhile satisfying a Service Level Agreement (SLA) such as 95% of requests observing aresponse time of 100 milliseconds or faster. While the speedup experiments maintain a fixsized social graph and vary the number of nodes; the scaleup experiments vary both thesize of the social graph and the number of nodes proportionally. A system provides a super-linear SoAR speedup as a function of the number of nodes when it transitions from fully …,Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA); 2016 27th International Workshop on,2016,2
Chase display of social live streams (SOLISs),Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract Advances in networking; processing; and mass storage devices have enabledsocial live streams (SOLISs) and their chase display. This paper focuses on public SOLISsand presents the user interface of RAYS and its system architecture. In addition; we presentseveral novel memory management techniques that produce summary data to minimize thelikelihood of cache misses. One technique; named Data-Aware CLRU (DA-CLRU); standsout for both enhancing the cache hit rate and utility of data. This technique is parallelizableand ideal for multi-core CPUs.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGMM international workshop on Social media,2011,2
On Expedited Rating of Data Stores,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract To rate a data store is to compute a value that describes the performance of thedata store with a database and a workload. A common performance metric of interest is thehighest throughput provided by the data store given a pre-specified service level agreementsuch as 95% of requests observing a response time faster than 100 ms. This is termed theaction rating of the data store. This paper presents a framework consisting of two searchtechniques with slightly different characteristics to compute the action rating. With both; toexpedite the rating process; the framework employs agile data loading techniques andstrategies that reduce the duration of conducted experiments. We show these techniquesenhance the rating of a data store by one to two orders of magnitude. The rating frameworkand its optimization techniques are implemented using a social networking benchmark …,*,2016,1
Expedited Benchmarking of Social Networking Actions with Faster Data Load Techniques,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract To benchmark and rate a data store; one might be required to repeatedly load thesame benchmark database onto the data store. This may constitute a significant portion ofthe benchmarking process. This paper focuses on the BG benchmark (www. bgbenchmark.org) and presents three techniques to expedite loading of its database. These includegenerating the disk image of the database once and reusing it many times; restoring theupdated data items to their original value in between experiments; and maintaining in-memory state of the database across different experiments to avoid repeated loading of thedatabase all together. BG may use a hybrid of the proposed techniques when evaluating adata store. When evaluating MongoDB with a million member BG database; we show thesetechniques expedite BG's rating of MongoDB from 4 months (123 days) of continuous …,*,2013,1
Three highly available data streaming techniques and their tradeoffs,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Anurag Ojha; Jason Yap,Abstract The Recall All Your Senses (RAYS) project envisions a social networking systemthat empowers its users to store; retrieve; and share data produced by streaming devices. Anexample device is the popular Apple iPhone that produces continuous media; audio andvideo clips. This paper focuses on the stream manager of RAYS; RAYS-SM; and its peer-to-peer overlay network. For a request that streams data from a device; RAYS-SM initiatesmore than one stream in order to minimize loss of data when nodes in its network fail. Wepresent the design of 3 data availability techniques; quantifying their throughput and MeanTime To Data Loss (MTTDL). These two metrics highlight the tradeoff between the resourceusage of each technique during normal mode of operation in order to minimize loss of datain the presence of node failures.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM workshop on Advanced video streaming techniques for peer-to-peer networks and social networking,2010,1
BG: A scalable benchmark for interactive social networking actions,Yazeed Alabdulkarim; Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract BG is a benchmark that rates a data store for processing interactive socialnetworking actions such as view a member profile and extend a friend invitation to amember. It elevates the amount of stale; inconsistent; and erroneous (termed unpredictable)data produced by a data store to a first class metric; quantifying it as a part of thebenchmarking phase. It summarizes the performance of a data store in one metric; SocialAction Rating (SoAR).

A data aware admission control technique for social live streams (SOLISs),Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,A SOcial LIve Stream; SOLIS; is a live stream produced by a device whose owner is sharingthe stream with her friends; granting each friend to perform time shifted viewing for a pre-specified duration. The system buffers this chase data to facilitate its browsing and display.In the presence of many Solis; memory may overflow and prevent display of some chasedata. This paper presents a novel data-aware admission control; DA-AdmCtrl; technique thatsummarizes chase data pro-actively to maximize the number of admissible SOLISs with nomemory overflow. It is designed for use with multi-core CPUs and maximizes utility of datawhenever the user's level of satisfaction (utility) with different data formats is available.,Multimedia (ISM); 2012 IEEE International Symposium on,2012,*
