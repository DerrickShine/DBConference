Preventing location-based identity inference in anonymous spatial queries,Panos Kalnis; Gabriel Ghinita; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias,The increasing trend of embedding positioning capabilities (for example; GPS) in mobiledevices facilitates the widespread use of location-based services. For such applications tosucceed; privacy and confidentiality are essential. Existing privacy-enhancing techniquesrely on encryption to safeguard communication channels; and on pseudonyms to protectuser identities. Nevertheless; the query contents may disclose the physical location of theuser. In this paper; we present a framework for preventing location-based identity inferenceof users who issue spatial queries to location-based services. We propose transformationsbased on the well-established K-anonymity concept to compute exact answers for range andnearest neighbor search; without revealing the query source. Our methods optimize theentire process of anonymizing the requests and processing the transformed spatial …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2007,747
Conceptual partitioning: An efficient method for continuous nearest neighbor monitoring,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias; Marios Hadjieleftheriou,Abstract Given a set of objects P and a query point q; ak nearest neighbor (k-NN) queryretrieves the k objects in P that lie closest to q. Even though the problem is well-studied forstatic datasets; the traditional methods do not extend to highly dynamic environments wheremultiple continuous queries require real-time results; and both objects and queries receivefrequent location updates. In this paper we propose conceptual partitioning (CPM); acomprehensive technique for the efficient monitoring of continuous NN queries. CPMachieves low running time by handling location updates only from objects that fall in thevicinity of some query (and ignoring the rest). It can be used with multiple; static or movingqueries; and it does not make any assumptions about the object moving patterns. Weanalyze the performance of CPM and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,378
Continuous nearest neighbor monitoring in road networks,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Man Lung Yiu; Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Recent research has focused on continuous monitoring of nearest neighbors (NN)in highly dynamic scenarios; where the queries and the data objects move frequently andarbitrarily. All existing methods; however; assume the Euclidean distance metric. In thispaper we study k-NN monitoring in road networks; where the distance between a query anda data object is determined by the length of the shortest path connecting them. We proposetwo methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns; as well asfluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing onlyupdates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the sharedexecution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular; it groups together thequeries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network; and …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,289
Group nearest neighbor queries,Dimitris Papadias; Qiongmao Shen; Yufei Tao; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Given two sets of points P and Q; a group nearest neighbor (GNN) query retrieves the point(s) of P with the smallest sum of distances to all points in Q. Consider; for instance; threeusers at locations q/sub 1/q/sub 2/and q/sub 3/that want to find a meeting point (eg; arestaurant); the corresponding query returns the data point p that minimizes the sum ofEuclidean distances| pq/sub i/| for 1/spl les/i/spl les/3. Assuming that Q fits in memory and Pis indexed by an R-tree; we propose several algorithms for finding the group nearestneighbors efficiently. As a second step; we extend our techniques for situations where Qcannot fit in memory; covering both indexed and nonindexed query points. An experimentalevaluation identifies the best alternative based on the data and query properties.,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,258
Aggregate nearest neighbor queries in spatial databases,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Chun Kit Hui,Abstract Given two spatial datasets P (eg; facilities) and Q (queries); an aggregate nearestneighbor (ANN) query retrieves the point (s) of P with the smallest aggregate distance (s) topoints in Q. Assuming; for example; n users at locations q 1;… qn; an ANN query outputs thefacility p∈ P that minimizes the sum of distances &verbar; pq i &verbar; for 1≤ i≤ n that theusers have to travel in order to meet there. Similarly; another ANN query may report the pointp∈ P that minimizes the maximum distance that any user has to travel; or the minimumdistance from some user to his/her closest facility. If Q fits in memory and P is indexed by anR-tree; we develop algorithms for aggregate nearest neighbors that capture several versionsof the problem; including weighted queries and incremental reporting of results. Then; weanalyze their performance and propose cost models for query optimization. Finally; we …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2005,249
Continuous monitoring of top-k queries over sliding windows,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Given a dataset P and a preference function f; a top-k query retrieves the k tuples inP with the highest scores according to f. Even though the problem is well-studied inconventional databases; the existing methods are inapplicable to highly dynamicenvironments involving numerous long-running queries. This paper studies continuousmonitoring of top-k queries over a fixed-size window W of the most recent data. The windowsize can be expressed either in terms of the number of active tuples or time units. Wepropose a general methodology for top-k monitoring that restricts processing to the sub-domains of the workspace that influence the result of some query. To cope with high streamrates and provide fast answers in an on-line fashion; the data in W reside in main memory.The valid records are indexed by a grid structure; which also maintains book-keeping …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,246
A threshold-based algorithm for continuous monitoring of k nearest neighbors,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias; Spiridon Bakiras; Yufei Tao,Assume a set of moving objects and a central server that monitors their positions over time;while processing continuous nearest neighbor queries from geographically distributedclients. In order to always report up-to-date results; the server could constantly obtain themost recent position of all objects. However; this naive solution requires the transmission ofa large number of rapid data streams corresponding to location updates. Intuitively; currentinformation is necessary only for objects that may influence some query result (ie; they maybe included in the nearest neighbor set of some client). Motivated by this observation; wepresent a threshold-based algorithm for the continuous monitoring of nearest neighbors thatminimizes the communication overhead between the server and the data objects. Theproposed method can be used with multiple; static; or moving queries; for any distance …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,121
Scalable verification for outsourced dynamic databases,HweeHwa Pang; Jilian Zhang; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract Query answers from servers operated by third parties need to be verified; as thethird parties may not be trusted or their servers may be compromised. Most of the existingauthentication methods construct validity proofs based on the Merkle hash tree (MHT). TheMHT; however; imposes severe concurrency constraints that slow down data updates. Weintroduce a protocol; built upon signature aggregation; for checking the authenticity;completeness and freshness of query answers. The protocol offers the important property ofallowing new data to be disseminated immediately; while ensuring that outdated valuesbeyond a pre-set age can be detected. We also propose an efficient verification techniquefor ad-hoc equijoins; for which no practical solution existed. In addition; for servers that needto process heavy query workloads; we introduce a mechanism that significantly reduces …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,91
Anonymous query processing in road networks,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Man Lung Yiu,The increasing availability of location-aware mobile devices has given rise to a flurry oflocation-based services (LBSs). Due to the nature of spatial queries; an LBS needs the userposition in order to process her requests. On the other hand; revealing exact user locationsto a (potentially untrusted) LBS may pinpoint their identities and breach their privacy. Toaddress this issue; spatial anonymity techniques obfuscate user locations; forwarding to theLBS a sufficiently large region instead. Existing methods explicitly target processing in theeuclidean space and do not apply when proximity to the users is defined according tonetwork distance (eg; driving time through the roads of a city). In this paper; we propose aframework for anonymous query processing in road networks. We design locationobfuscation techniques that:(1) provide anonymous LBS access to the users and (2) allow …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,87
Partially materialized digest scheme: an efficient verification method for outsourced databases,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Sacharidis; Hweehwa Pang,Abstract In the outsourced database model; a data owner publishes her database through athird-party server; ie; the server hosts the data and answers user queries on behalf of theowner. Since the server may not be trusted; or may be compromised; users need a means toverify that answers received are both authentic and complete; ie; that the returned data havenot been tampered with; and that no qualifying results have been omitted. We propose aresult verification approach for one-dimensional queries; called Partially Materialized Digestscheme (PMD); that applies to both static and dynamic databases. PMD uses separateindexes for the data and for their associated verification information; and only partiallymaterializes the latter. In contrast with previous work; PMD avoids unnecessary costs whenprocessing queries that do not request verification; achieving the performance of an …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,87
Authenticating the query results of text search engines,HweeHwa Pang; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract The number of successful attacks on the Internet shows that it is very difficult toguarantee the security of online search engines. A breached server that is not detected intime may return incorrect results to the users. To prevent that; we introduce a methodologyfor generating an integrity proof for each search result. Our solution is targeted at searchengines that perform similarity-based document retrieval; and utilize an inverted listimplementation (as most search engines do). We formulate the properties that define acorrect result; map the task of processing a text search query to adaptations of existingthreshold-based algorithms; and devise an authentication scheme for checking the validityof a result. Finally; we confirm the efficiency and practicality of our solution through anempirical evaluation with real documents and benchmark queries.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,73
Continuous monitoring of spatial queries in wireless broadcast environments,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Wireless data broadcast is a promising technique for information dissemination thatleverages the computational capabilities of the mobile devices in order to enhance thescalability of the system. Under this environment; the data are continuously broadcast by theserver; interleaved with some indexing information for query processing. Clients may thentune in the broadcast channel and process their queries locally without contacting theserver. Previous work on spatial query processing for wireless broadcast systems has onlyconsidered snapshot queries over static data. In this paper; we propose an air indexingframework that 1) outperforms the existing (ie; snapshot) techniques in terms of energyconsumption while achieving low access latency and 2) constitutes the first methodsupporting efficient processing of continuous spatial queries over moving objects.,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2009,66
Continuous nearest neighbor queries over sliding windows,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias,This paper studies continuous monitoring of nearest neighbor (NN) queries over slidingwindow streams. According to this model; data points continuously stream in the system; andthey are considered valid only while they belong to a sliding window that contains 1) the Wmost recent arrivals (count-based) or 2) the arrivals within a fixed interval W covering themost recent time stamps (time-based). The task of the query processor is to constantlymaintain the result of long-running NN queries among the valid data. We present twoprocessing techniques that apply to both count-based and time-based windows. The firstone adapts conceptual partitioning; the best existing method for continuous NN monitoringover update streams; to the sliding window model. The second technique reduces theproblem to skyline maintenance in the distance-time space and precomputes the future …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2007,66
On-line discovery of hot motion paths,Dimitris Sacharidis; Kostas Patroumpas; Manolis Terrovitis; Verena Kantere; Michalis Potamias; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract We consider an environment of numerous moving objects; equipped with location-sensing devices and capable of communicating with a central coordinator. In this setting; weinvestigate the problem of maintaining hot motion paths; ie; routes frequently followed bymultiple objects over the recent past. Motion paths approximate portions of objects'movement within a tolerance margin that depends on the uncertainty inherent in positionalmeasurements. Discovery of hot motion paths is important to applications requiringclassification/profiling based on monitored movement patterns; such as targeted advertising;resource allocation; etc. To achieve this goal; we delegate part of the path extraction processto objects; by assigning to them adaptive lightweight filters that dynamically suppressunnecessary location updates and; thus; help reducing the communication overhead.

Efficient verification of shortest path search via authenticated hints,Man Lung Yiu; Yimin Lin; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Shortest path search in transportation networks is unarguably one of the most importantonline search services nowadays (eg; Google Maps; MapQuest; etc); with applicationsspanning logistics; spatial optimization; or everyday driving decisions. Often times; theowner of the road network data (eg; a transport authority) provides its database to third-partyquery services; which are responsible for answering shortest path queries posed by theirclients. The issue arising here is that a query service might be returning sub-optimal pathseither purposely (in order to serve its own purposes like computational savings orcommercial reasons) or because it has been compromised by Internet attackers who falsifythe results. Therefore; for the above applications to succeed; it is essential that eachreported path is accompanied by a proof; which allows clients to verify the path's …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,60
Spatial queries in the presence of obstacles,Jun Zhang; Dimitris Papadias; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Manli Zhu,Abstract Despite the existence of obstacles in many database applications; traditional spatialquery processing utilizes the Euclidean distance metric assuming that points in space aredirectly reachable. In this paper; we study spatial queries in the presence of obstacles;where the obstructed distance between two points is defined as the length of the shortestpath that connects them without crossing any obstacles. We propose efficient algorithms forthe most important query types; namely; range search; nearest neighbors; e-distance joinsand closest pairs; considering that both data objects and obstacles are indexed by R-trees.The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is verified through extensive experiments.,Advances in Database Technology-EDBT 2004,2004,55
Shortest path computation on air indexes,Georgios Kellaris; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract Shortest path computation is one of the most common queries in location-basedservices that involve transportation networks. Motivated by scalability challenges faced inthe mobile network industry; we propose adopting the wireless broadcast model for suchlocation-dependent applications. In this model the data are continuously transmitted on theair; while clients listen to the broadcast and process their queries locally. Although spatialproblems have been considered in this environment; there exists no study on shortest pathqueries in road networks. We develop the first framework to compute shortest paths on theair; and demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of our techniques through experimentswith real road networks and actual device specifications.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,49
Capacity constrained assignment in spatial databases,Man Lung Yiu; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Given a point set P of customers (eg; WiFi receivers) and a point set Q of serviceproviders (eg; wireless access points); where each q∈ Q has a capacity qk; the capacityconstrained assignment (CCA) is a matching M⊆ Q× P such that (i) each point q∈ Q (p∈ P)appears at most k times (at most once) in M;(ii) the size of M is maximized (ie; it comprisesmin {| P|;∑ q∈ Q q. k} pairs); and (iii) the total assignment cost (ie; the sum of Euclideandistances within all pairs) is minimized. Thus; the CCA problem is to identify the assignmentwith the optimal overall quality; intuitively; the quality of q's service to p in a given (q; p) pairis anti-proportional to their distance. Although max-flow algorithms are applicable to thisproblem; they require the complete distance-based bipartite graph between Q and P. Forlarge spatial datasets; this graph is expensive to compute and it may be too large to fit in …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,48
Shortest path computation with no information leakage,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract Shortest path computation is one of the most common queries in location-basedservices (LBSs). Although particularly useful; such queries raise serious privacy concerns.Exposing to a (potentially untrusted) LBS the client's position and her destination may revealpersonal information; such as social habits; health condition; shopping preferences; lifestylechoices; etc. The only existing method for privacy-preserving shortest path computationfollows the obfuscation paradigm; it prevents the LBS from inferring the source anddestination of the query with a probability higher than a threshold. This implies; however;that the LBS still deduces some information (albeit not exact) about the client's location andher destination. In this paper we aim at strong privacy; where the adversary learns nothingabout the shortest path query. We achieve this via established private information …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,42
Constrained shortest path computation,Manolis Terrovitis; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract This paper proposes and solves a-autonomy and k-stops shortest path problems inlarge spatial databases. Given a source s and a destination d; an a-autonomy queryretrieves a sequence of data points connecting s and d; such that the distance between anytwo consecutive points in the path is not greater than a. A k-stops query retrieves asequence that contains exactly k intermediate data points. In both cases our aim is tocompute the shortest path subject to these constraints. Assuming that the dataset is indexedby a data-partitioning method; the proposed techniques initially compute a sub-optimal pathby utilizing the Euclidean distance information provided by the index. The length of theretrieved path is used to prune the search space; filtering out large parts of the input dataset.In a final step; the optimal (a-autonomy or k-stops) path is computed (using only the non …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,39
k-Anonymity in the Presence of External Databases,Dimitris Sacharidis; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias,The concept of k-anonymity has received considerable attention due to the need of severalorganizations to release microdata without revealing the identity of individuals. Although allprevious k-anonymity techniques assume the existence of a public database (PD) that canbe used to breach privacy; none utilizes PD during the anonymization process. Specifically;existing generalization algorithms create anonymous tables using only the microdata table(MT) to be published; independently of the external knowledge available. This omissionleads to high information loss. Motivated by this observation; we first introduce the concept ofk-join-anonymity (KJA); which permits more effective generalization to reduce theinformation loss. Briefly; KJA anonymizes a superset of MT; which includes selected recordsfrom PD. We propose two methodologies for adapting k-anonymity algorithms to their KJA …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,38
Preference queries in large multi-cost transportation networks,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Yimin Lin; Man Lung Yiu,Research on spatial network databases has so far considered that there is a single costvalue associated with each road segment of the network. In most real-world situations;however; there may exist multiple cost types involved in transportation decision making. Forexample; the different costs of a road segment could be its Euclidean length; the drivingtime; the walking time; possible toll fee; etc. The relative significance of these cost types mayvary from user to user. In this paper we consider such multi-cost transportation networks(MCN); where each edge (road segment) is associated with multiple cost values. Weformulate skyline and top-k queries in MCNs and design algorithms for their efficientprocessing. Our solutions have two important properties in preference-based querying; theskyline methods are progressive and the top-k ones are incremental.

Tree-based partition querying: a methodology for computing medoids in large spatial datasets,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias; Spiros Papadimitriou,Abstract Besides traditional domains (eg; resource allocation; data mining applications);algorithms for medoid computation and related problems will play an important role innumerous emerging fields; such as location based services and sensor networks. Since thek-medoid problem is NP-hard; all existing work deals with approximate solutions onrelatively small datasets. This paper aims at efficient methods for very large spatialdatabases; motivated by:(1) the high and ever increasing availability of spatial data; and (2)the need for novel query types and improved services. The proposed solutions exploit theintrinsic grouping properties of a data partition index in order to read only a small part of thedataset. Compared to previous approaches; we achieve results of comparable or betterquality at a small fraction of the CPU and I/O costs (seconds as opposed to hours; and …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,34
Spatial cloaking revisited: Distinguishing information leakage from anonymity,Kar Way Tan; Yimin Lin; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract Location-based services (LBS) are receiving increasing popularity as they provideconvenience to mobile users with on-demand information. The use of these services;however; poses privacy issues as the user locations and queries are exposed to untrustedLBSs. Spatial cloaking techniques provide privacy in the form of k-anonymity; ie; theyguarantee that the (location of the) querying user u is indistinguishable from at least k-1others; where k is a parameter specified by u at query time. To achieve this; they form agroup of k users; including u; and forward their minimum bounding rectangle (termedanonymizing spatial region; ASR) to the LBS. The rationale behind sending an ASR insteadof the distinct k locations is that exact user positions (querying or not) should not bedisclosed to the LBS. This results in large ASRs with considerable dead-space; and leads …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,33
Efficient evaluation of continuous text search queries,Kyriakos Mouratidis; HweeHwa Pang,Consider a text filtering server that monitors a stream of incoming documents for a set ofusers; who register their interests in the form of continuous text search queries. The task ofthe server is to constantly maintain for each query a ranked result list; comprising the recentdocuments (drawn from a sliding window) with the highest similarity to the query. Such asystem underlies many text monitoring applications that need to cope with heavy documenttraffic; such as news and email monitoring. In this paper; we propose the first solution forprocessing continuous text queries efficiently. Our objective is to support a large number ofuser queries while sustaining high document arrival rates.

Query processing in spatial databases containing obstacles,Jun Zhang; Dimitris Papadias; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Zhu Manli,Despite the existence of obstacles in many database applications; traditional spatial queryprocessing assumes that points in space are directly reachable and utilizes the Euclideandistance metric. In this paper; we study spatial queries in the presence of obstacles; wherethe obstructed distance between two points is defined as the length of the shortest path thatconnects them without crossing any obstacles. We propose efficient algorithms for the mostimportant query types; namely; range search; nearest neighbours; e‐distance joins; closestpairs and distance semi‐joins; assuming that both data objects and obstacles are indexedby R‐trees. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is verified through extensiveexperiments.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2005,23
Optimal matching between spatial datasets under capacity constraints,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Consider a set of customers (eg; WiFi receivers) and a set of service providers (eg;wireless access points); where each provider has a capacity and the quality of serviceoffered to its customers is anti-proportional to their distance. The Capacity ConstrainedAssignment (CCA) is a matching between the two sets such that (i) each customer isassigned to at most one provider;(ii) every provider serves no more customers than itscapacity;(iii) the maximum possible number of customers are served; and (iv) the sum ofEuclidean distances within the assigned provider-customer pairs is minimized. Althoughmax-flow algorithms are applicable to this problem; they require the complete distance-based bipartite graph between the customer and provider sets. For large spatial datasets;this graph is expensive to compute and it may be too large to fit in main memory …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,21
Medoid queries in large spatial databases,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias; Spiros Papadimitriou,Abstract Assume that a franchise plans to open k branches in a city; so that the averagedistance from each residential block to the closest branch is minimized. This is an instanceof the k-medoids problem; where residential blocks constitute the input dataset and the kbranch locations correspond to the medoids. Since the problem is NP-hard; research hasfocused on approximate solutions. Despite an avalanche of methods for small and moderatesize datasets; currently there exists no technique applicable to very large databases. In thispaper; we provide efficient algorithms that utilize an existing data-partition index to achievelow CPU and I/O cost. In particular; we exploit the intrinsic grouping properties of the index inorder to avoid reading the entire dataset.

Computing immutable regions for subspace top-k queries,Kyriakos Mouratidis; HweeHwa Pang,Abstract Given a high-dimensional dataset; a top-k query can be used to shortlist the k tuplesthat best match the user's preferences. Typically; these preferences regard a subset of theavailable dimensions (ie; attributes) whose relative significance is expressed by user-specified weights. Along with the query result; we propose to compute for each involveddimension the maximal deviation to the corresponding weight for which the query resultremains valid. The derived weight ranges; called immutable regions; are useful forperforming sensitivity analysis; for finetuning the query weights; etc. In this paper; we focuson top-k queries with linear preference functions over the queried dimensions. We codify theconditions under which changes in a dimension's weight invalidate the query result; anddevelop algorithms to compute the immutable regions. In general; this entails the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,15
Joint search by social and spatial proximity,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Jing Li; Yu Tang; Nikos Mamoulis,The diffusion of social networks introduces new challenges and opportunities for advancedservices; especially so with their ongoing addition of location-based features. We show howapplications like company and friend recommendation could significantly benefit fromincorporating social and spatial proximity; and study a query type that captures these two-fold semantics. We develop highly scalable algorithms for its processing; and enhance themwith elaborate optimizations. Finally; we use real social network data to empirically verify theefficiency and efficacy of our solutions.,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2015,14
Continuous medoid queries over moving objects,Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Sacharidis; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract In the k-medoid problem; given a dataset P; we are asked to choose k points in P asthe medoids. The optimal medoid set minimizes the average Euclidean distance betweenthe points in P and their closest medoid. Finding the optimal k medoids is NP hard; andexisting algorithms aim at approximate answers; ie; they compute medoids that achieve asmall; yet not minimal; average distance. Similarly in this paper; we also aim at approximatesolutions. We consider; however; the continuous version of the problem; where the points inP move and our task is to maintain the medoid set on-the-fly (trying to keep the averagedistance small). To the best of our knowledge; this work constitutes the first attempt oncontinuous medoid queries. First; we consider centralized monitoring; where the pointsissue location updates whenever they move.

Enhancing access privacy of range retrievals over B+-trees,HweeHwa Pang; Jilian Zhang; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Users of databases that are hosted on shared servers cannot take for granted that theirqueries will not be disclosed to unauthorized parties. Even if the database is encrypted; anadversary who is monitoring the I/O activity on the server may still be able to infer someinformation about a user query. For the particular case of a B+-tree that has its nodesencrypted; we identify properties that enable the ordering among the leaf nodes to bededuced. These properties allow us to construct adversarial algorithms to recover the B+-tree structure from the I/O traces generated by range queries. Combining this structure withknowledge of the key distribution (or the plaintext database itself); the adversary can inferthe selection range of user queries. To counter the threat; we propose a privacy-enhancingPB+-tree index which ensures that there is high uncertainty about what data the user has …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,12
Efficient evaluation of multiple preference queries,Nikos Mamoulis; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Consider multiple users searching for a hotel room; based on size; cost; distance to thebeach; etc. Users may have variable preferences expressed by different weights on theattributes of the searched objects. Although individual preference queries can be evaluatedby selecting the object in the database with the highest aggregate score; in the case ofmultiple requests at the same time; a single object cannot be assigned to more than oneusers. The challenge is to compute a fair 1-1 matching between the queries and a subset ofthe objects. We model this as a stable-marriage problem and propose an efficient techniquefor its evaluation. Our algorithm is an iterative process; which finds at each step the query-object pair with the highest score and removes it from the problem. This is done efficiently bymaintaining and matching the skyline of the remaining objects with the remaining queries …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,11
Global immutable region computation,Jilian Zhang; Kyriakos Mouratidis; HweeHwa Pang,Abstract A top-k query shortlists the k records in a dataset that best match the user'spreferences. To indicate her preferences; the user typically determines a numeric weight foreach data dimension (ie; attribute). We refer to these weights collectively as the query vector.Based on this vector; each data record is implicitly mapped to a score value (via a weightedsum function). The records with the k largest scores are reported as the result. In this paperwe propose an auxiliary feature to standard top-k query processing. Specifically; wecompute the maximal locus within which the query vector incurs no change in the current top-k result. In other words; we compute all possible query weight settings that produce exactlythe same top-k result as the user's original query. We call this locus the global immutableregion (GIR). The GIR can be used as a guide to query vector readjustments; as a …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,9
Continuous spatial assignment of moving users,U Leong Hou; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Consider a set of servers and a set of users; where each server has a coverageregion (ie; an area of service) and a capacity (ie; a maximum number of users it can serve).Our task is to assign every user to one server subject to the coverage and capacityconstraints. To offer the highest quality of service; we wish to minimize the average distancebetween users and their assigned server. This is an instance of a well-studied problem inoperations research; termed optimal assignment. Even though there exist several solutionsfor the static case (where user locations are fixed); there is currently no method for dynamicsettings. In this paper; we consider the continuous assignment problem (CAP); where anoptimal assignment must be constantly maintained between mobile users and a set ofservers.

A fair assignment algorithm for multiple preference queries,Nikos Mamoulis; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract Consider an internship assignment system; where at the end of each academicyear; interested university students search and apply for available positions; based on theirpreferences (eg; nature of the job; salary; office location; etc). In a variety of facility; task orposition assignment contexts; users have personal preferences expressed by differentweights on the attributes of the searched objects. Although individual preference queriescan be evaluated by selecting the object in the database with the highest aggregate score;in the case of multiple simultaneous requests; a single object cannot be assigned to morethan one users. The challenge is to compute a fair 1--1 matching between the queries andthe objects. We model this as a stable-marriage problem and propose an efficient method forits processing. Our algorithm iteratively finds stable query-object pairs and removes them …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,9
Data Stream Processing: An Overview of Recent Research,Kyriakos I Mouratidis,Traditional data base management systems are designed to handle persistent data andanswer transient queries. However; due to the evolution of network; telecommunication andsensor technologies; a new data processing model has recently arisen. In this scenario;continuous and long-running queries are posed over transient streaming data ([BBDMW02;GO03]). Example applications include among others; financial tickers; network trafficmonitoring; web and transaction log analysis; and sensor networks. In such environments;data arrive in the form of multiple high-speed data streams that have to be processed onlineand provide near-real time answers to the queries. A data stream is a continuous; time-varying; unbounded sequence of data-items. Stream items usually take the form of relationaltuples that are disposed after they get processed; implying that online stream algorithms …,Hong Kong; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,2003,7
Maximum rank query,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Jilian Zhang; HweeHwa Pang,Abstract The top-k query is a common means to shortlist a number of options from a set ofalternatives; based on the user's preferences. Typically; these preferences are expressed asa vector of query weights; defined over the options' attributes. The query vector implicitlyassociates each alternative with a numeric score; and thus imposes a ranking among them.The top-k result includes the k options with the highest scores. In this context; we define themaximum rank query (MaxRank). Given a focal option in a set of alternatives; the MaxRankproblem is to compute the highest rank this option may achieve under any possible userpreference; and furthermore; to report all the regions in the query vector's domain where thatrank is achieved. MaxRank finds application in market impact analysis; customer profiling;targeted advertising; etc. We propose a methodology for MaxRank processing and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,6
Strong location privacy: A case study on shortest path queries,Kyriakos Mouratidis,The last few years have witnessed an increasing availability of location-based services(LBSs). Although particularly useful; such services raise serious privacy concerns. Forexample; exposing to a (potentially untrusted) LBS the client's position may reveal personalinformation; such as social habits; health condition; shopping preferences; lifestyle choices;etc. There is a large body of work on protecting the location privacy of the clients. In thispaper; we focus on shortest path queries; describe a framework based on privateinformation retrieval (PIR); and conclude with open questions about the practicality of PIRand other location privacy approaches.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,6
Best upgrade plans for single and multiple source-destination pairs,Yimin Lin; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract In this paper; we study Resource Constrained Best Upgrade Plan (BUP)computation in road network databases. Consider a transportation network (weighted graph)G where a subset of the edges are upgradable; ie; for each such edge there is a cost; whichif spent; the weight of the edge can be reduced to a specific new value. In the single-pairversion of BUP; the input includes a source and a destination in G; and a budget B (resourceconstraint). The goal is to identify which upgradable edges should be upgraded so that theshortest path distance between source and destination (in the updated network) isminimized; without exceeding the available budget for the upgrade. In the multiple-pairversion of BUP; a set Q of source-destination pairs is given; and the problem is to choose forupgrade those edges that lead to the smallest sum of shortest path distances across all …,GeoInformatica,2015,5
Heuristic algorithms for balanced multi-way number partitioning,Jilian Zhang; Kyriakos Mouratidis; HweeHwa Pang,Abstract Balanced multi-way number partitioning (BMNP) seeks to split a collection ofnumbers into subsets with (roughly) the same cardinality and subset sum. The problem isNP-hard; and there are several exact and approximate algorithms for it. However; existingexact algorithms solve only the simpler; balanced two-way number partitioning variant;whereas the most effective approximate algorithm; BLDM; may produce widely varyingsubset sums. In this paper; we introduce the LRM algorithm that lowers the expected spreadin subset sums to one third that of BLDM for uniformly distributed numbers and odd subsetcardinalities. We also propose Meld; a novel strategy for skewed number distributions. Acombination of LRM and Meld leads to a heuristic technique that consistently achieves anarrower spread of subset sums than BLDM.,IJCAI Proceedings-International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2011,5

Historical traffic-tolerant paths in road networks,Pui Hang Li; Man Lung Yiu; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract Historical traffic information is valuable for transportation analysis and planning; aswell as for route search services. In view of these applications; we propose the k traffic-tolerant paths problem (TTP) on road networks; which takes a source-destination pair andhistorical traffic information as input; and returns k paths that minimize the aggregate(historical) travel time. Unlike the shortest path problem; the TTP problem has acombinatorial search space that renders the optimal solution expensive to compute. Wepropose an exact algorithm and a heuristic algorithm for this problem. Experiments on realtraffic data demonstrate the effectiveness of TTP paths and the efficiency of our proposedalgorithms.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,3
Best upgrade plans for large road networks,Yimin Lin; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract In this paper; we consider a new problem in the context of road network databases;named Resource Constrained Best Upgrade Plan computation (BUP; for short). Consider atransportation network (weighted graph) G where a subset of the edges are upgradable; ie;for each such edge there is a cost; which if spent; the weight of the edge can be reduced to aspecific new value. Given a source and a destination in G; and a budget (resourceconstraint) B; the BUP problem is to identify which upgradable edges should be upgradedso that the shortest path distance between source and destination (in the updated network)is minimized; without exceeding the available budget for the upgrade. In addition totransportation networks; the BUP query arises in other domains too; such astelecommunications.

Determining the impact regions of competing options in preference space,Bo Tang; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract In rank-aware processing; user preferences are typically represented by a numericweight per data attribute; collectively forming a weight vector. The score of an option (datarecord) is defined as the weighted sum of its individual attributes. The highest-scoringoptions across a set of alternatives (dataset) are shortlisted for the user as the recommendedones. In that setting; the user input is a vector (equivalently; a point) in a d-dimensionalpreference space; where d is the number of data attributes. In this paper we study theproblem of determining in which regions of the preference space the weight vector should lieso that a given option (focal record) is among the top-k score-wise. In effect; these regionscapture all possible user profiles for which the focal record is highly preferable; and aretherefore essential in market impact analysis; potential customer identification; profile …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,2
Continuous Top-k monitoring on document streams,Junjie Zhang; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Ye Li,The efficient processing of document streams plays an important role in many informationfiltering systems. Emerging applications; such as news update filtering and social networknotifications; demand presenting end-users with the most relevant content to theirpreferences. In this work; user preferences are indicated by a set of keywords. A centralserver monitors the document stream and continuously reports to each user the top-kdocuments that are most relevant to her keywords. Our objective is to support large numbersof users and high stream rates; while refreshing the top-k results almost instantaneously. Oursolution abandons the traditional frequency-ordered indexing approach. Instead; it followsan identifier-ordering paradigm that suits better the nature of the problem. Whencomplemented with a novel; locally adaptive technique; our method offers (i) proven …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,1
Efficient motif discovery in spatial trajectories using discrete fréchet distance,Bo Tang; Man Lung Yiu; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Kai Wang,Abstract The discrete Fréchet distance (DFD) captures perceptual andgeographicalsimilarity between discrete trajectories. It has been successfullyadopted in amultitude of applications; such as signatureand handwriting recognition; computer graphics;as well as geographicapplications. Spatial applications; eg; sports analysis; traffic analysis;etc. require discovering the pair of most similarsubtrajectories; be them parts of the same orof different input trajectories. The identified pair of subtrajectories is called a motif. Theadoption of DFD as the similarity measure in motif discovery; although semantically ideal; ishindered by the high computationalcomplexity of DFD calculation. In this paper; we proposeasuite of novel lower bound functions and a grouping-based solutionwith multi-level pruningin order to compute motifs with DFD ef-ficiently.

Discovering historic traffic-tolerant paths in road networks,Pui Hang Li; Man Lung Yiu; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract Historic traffic information is valuable in transportation analysis and planning; eg;evaluating the reliability of routes for representative source-destination pairs. Also; it can beutilized to provide efficient and effective route-search services. In view of these applications;we propose the k traffic-tolerant paths (TTP) problem on road networks; which takes asource-destination pair and historic traffic information as input; and returns k paths thatminimize the aggregate (historic) travel time. Unlike the shortest path problem; the TTPproblem has a combinatorial search space that renders the optimal solution expensive tofind. First; we propose an exact algorithm with effective pruning rules to reduce the searchtime.

Shortlisting top-K assignments,Yimin Lin; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract In this paper we identify a novel query type; the top-K assignment query (αTop-K).Consider a set of objects and a set of suppliers; where each object must be assigned to onesupplier. Assume that there is a cost associated with every object-supplier pair. If we allocateeach object to the server with the smallest cost (for the specific object); the derived overallassignment will have the minimum total cost. In many scenarios; however; runner-upassignments may be required too; like for example when a decision maker needs to makeadditional considerations; not captured by individual object-supplier costs. In this case; it isnecessary to examine several shortlisted assignments before choosing one. This motivatesthe αTop-K query; which computes the K best assignments; ie; those achieving the Ksmallest total costs. Algorithms for the traditional assignment ranking problem could be …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,1
Spatial queries in wireless broadcast environments,Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract Wireless data broadcasting is a promising technique for information disseminationthat exploits the computational capabilities of mobile devices; in order to enhance thescalability of the system.

Dynamic Nearest Neighbor Queries in Euclidean Space,Sarana Nutanong; Mohammed Eunus Ali; Egemen Tanin; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Given a query point q and a set P of data points; a nearest neighbor (NN) query returns thedata point p in P that minimizes the distance DIST (q; p); where the distance function DIST (;)is the L2 norm. One important variant of this query type is kNN query; which returns k datapoints with the minimum distances. When taking the temporal dimension into account; thekNN query result may change over a period of time due to changes in locations of the querypoint and/or data points. Formally; the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) query is defined as follows.,*,2015,*
Direct neighbor search,Jilian Zhang; Kyriakos Mouratidis; HweeHwa Pang,Abstract In this paper we study a novel query type; called direct neighbor query. Two objectsin a dataset are direct neighbors (DNs) if a window selection may exclusively retrieve thesetwo objects. Given a source object; a DN search computes all of its direct neighbors in thedataset. The DNs define a new type of affinity that differs from existing formulations (eg;nearest neighbors; nearest surrounders; reverse nearest neighbors; etc.) and findsapplication in domains where user interests are expressed in the form of windows; ie; multi-attribute range selections. Drawing on key properties of the DN relationship; we develop anI/O optimal processing algorithm for data indexed with a spatial access method. In additionto plain DN search; we also study its K-DN and all-DN variants. The former relaxes the DNcondition–two objects are K-DNs if a window query may retrieve them and only up to K− 1 …,Information Systems,2014,*

1. IMPORTANT DATES,Carmen Tang,It is widely understood that China shelters one of the richest mycofloras in the world. Thevariety of ecological zones; topological relief; and geographical extent supports this fact. Theoldest and largest mycological collection in the country is that maintained at the Institute ofMicrobiology; Academia Sinica; in Beijing. The Beijing herbarium (acronym: HMAS) wasestablished in 1953 and now houses over 75;000 specimens of fungi. The rapiddevelopment of mycology in China during the last two decades has not been brought tointernational attention (but see Bartholomew; Brittonia 3 1: 1-25; 1979; Ma; Taxon 38: 617-620; 1989). It is a pleasure; therefore; to introduce the mycological herbarium at Kunming;Yunnan; and to welcome foreign visitors and loan requests.,*,2013,*
1) Continuous Query Monitoring,Kyriakos MOURATIDIS,Traditional database systems are designed to answer transient; snapshot queries overpersistent data. However; the evolution of wireless communications; positioning devices (eg;GPS) and sensor technologies has recently given rise to a new data processing model. Inthis model; multiple long-running queries require continuous evaluation as the datadynamically change. These queries are called continuous (or standing); and they arise inlocation-based services (eg;“keep me updated about who are the 10 SMU students that areclosest to my location as I walk along Orchard road”); network traffic monitoring (eg;“monitorthe 100 users that cause the highest network overhead”); online decision support systems(eg;“continuously report the 5 most interesting stocks according to my investment criteria”);and many other domains.

Often times; theowner of the road network data (eg; a transport authority) provides its database to third-partyquery services; which are responsible for answering shortest path queries posed by theirclients. The issue arising here is that a query service might be returning sub-optimal pathseither purposely (in order to serve its own purposes like computational savings orcommercial reasons) or because it has been compromised by Internet attackers who falsifythe results. Therefore; for the above applications to succeed; it is essential that eachreported path is accompanied by a proof; which allows clients to verify the path's …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Data Engineering,2010,*

Continuous monitoring of multi-dimensional queries,Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract This thesis studies the monitoring of continuous multi-dimensional queries. Acontinuous query runs over long periods of time and requests reporting of its result as thedata dynamically change. Initially; we focus on nearest neighbor (NN) monitoring; a problemthat typically arises in location-based services. In this context; the query points and the dataobjects move arbitrarily; and the task of a central server is to report the k closest objects (ie;the k NNs) to each query point. First; we propose a method that aims at minimizing thecommunication cost spent in message exchanges between the data objects and the server.Our second contribution is an algorithm that minimizes the processing cost at the server;assuming that the distance between objects and queries is defined according to theEuclidean metric. Next; we present efficient NN monitoring techniques targeted to …,*,2006,*

Global Immutable Region Computation.(2014),Jilian Zhang; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Hwee Hwa Pang,ABSTRACT A top-k query shortlists the k records in a dataset that best match the user'spreferences. To indicate her preferences; the user typically determines a numeric weight foreach data dimension (ie; attribute). We refer to these weights collectively as the query vector.Based on this vector; each data record is implicitly mapped to a score value (via a weightedsum function). The records with the k largest scores are reported as the result. In this paperwe propose an auxiliary feature to standard top-k query processing. Specifically; wecompute the maximal locus within which the query vector incurs no change in the current top-k result. In other words; we compute all possible query weight settings that produce exactlythe same top-k result as the user's original query. We call this locus the global immutableregion (GIR). The GIR can be used as a guide to query vector readjustments; as a …,ACM Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD),*,*
