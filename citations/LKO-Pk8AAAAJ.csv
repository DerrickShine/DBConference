Chlorites and hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite and smectite,Richard I Barnhisel; Paul M Bertsch,Chlorites are not as abundant as some other clay minerals in soils; but when present theyplay significant roles in the chemical environment. Chlorites are less stable than most of theother clays when placed into acidic environments; and therefore may be rapidly altered. Thisweathering process may account for significant amounts of Mg2+ and other cations thatoccupy exchange sites of clay minerals of such soils. In addition to the minerals consideredfor this chapter; the chlorite layer may be an important part of mixed layer sequences (seeSawhney; chapter 16; this book). Confusion may occur from casual reading of the literature;since the word chlorite appears in many earlier reports. Such minerals are presentlyclassified as a type of interstratified mineral sequence. For example the term" swelling"chlorite was first used by Stephen and MacEwan (1950; 1951) to describe a mineral …,Minerals in soil environments,1989,646
Aluminum,Richard Barnhisel; Paul M Bertsch,In general; the initial phase of total AI analysis when Al is to be determined spectrometricallyinvolves fusion and/or complete dissolution of the sample to convert AI to a soluble form.This phase is then followed by the determination of the liberated AI. Methods such as x-rayfluorescence spectrometry and neutron activation may not require the dissolution process;but other preparatory steps are required. The total Al content of a sample is useful data forcharacterization of soils with respect to origin of parent materials and weathering; and itserves as a basis for computing the mineralogical composition of the sample. The choice ofpreparatory methods is dependent on the use that is to be made of the data; the need foranalysis of other elements in the sample; and perhaps most important; the availability ofequipment. The sodium carbonate fusion method is one of the most commonly used …,Methods of Soil Analysis. Part 2. Chemical and Microbiological Properties,1982,343
Molecular dynamics modeling of clay minerals. 1. Gibbsite; kaolinite; pyrophyllite; and beidellite,Brian J Teppen; Kjeld Rasmussen; Paul M Bertsch; David M Miller; Lothar Schäfer,A molecular dynamics model for clays and the oxide minerals is desirable for studying thekinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption processes. To this end; a valence force field foraluminous; dioctahedral clay minerals was developed. Novel aspects of this developmentinclude the bending potential for octahedral O− Al− O angles; which uses a quarticpolynomial to create a double-well potential with minima at both 90° and 180°. Also; atomicpoint charges were derived from comparisons of ab initio molecular electrostatic potentialswith X-ray diffraction-based deformation electron densities. Isothermal− isobaric moleculardynamics simulations of quartz; gibbsite; kaolinite; and pyrophyllite were used to refine thepotential energy parameters. The resultant force field reproduced all the major structuralparameters of these minerals to within 1% of their experimentally determined values …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,1997,267
Trace element speciation in poultry litter,Brian P Jackson; PM Bertsch; ML Cabrera; JJ Camberato; JC Seaman; CW Wood,Abstract Trace elements are added to poultry feed for disease prevention and enhancedfeed efficiency. High concentrations are found in poultry litter (PL); which raises concernsregarding trace element loading of soils. Trace metal cation solubility from PL may beenhanced by complexation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Mineralization of organo–As compounds may result in more toxic species such as As (III) and As (V). Speciation ofthese elements in PL leachates should assist in predicting their fate in soil. Elementalconcentrations of 40 PL samples from the southeastern USA were determined. Water-soluble extractions (WSE) were fractionated into hydrophobic; anionic; and cationic specieswith solid-phase extraction columns.

Evidence for biomagnification of gold nanoparticles within a terrestrial food chain,Jonathan D Judy; Jason M Unrine; Paul M Bertsch,Nanoparticles from the rapidly increasing number of consumer products that containmanufactured nanomaterials are being discharged into waste streams. Increasing evidencesuggests that several classes of nanomaterials may accumulate in sludge derived fromwastewater treatment and ultimately in soil following land application as biosolids. Littleresearch has been conducted to evaluate the impact of nanoparticles on terrestrialecosystems; despite the fact that land application of biosolids from wastewater treatment willbe a major pathway for the introduction of manufactured nanomaterials to the environment.To begin addressing this knowledge gap; we used the model organisms Nicotiana tabacumL. cv Xanthi and Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) to investigate plant uptake and thepotential for trophic transfer of 5; 10; and 15 nm diameter gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) …,Environmental science & technology,2010,240
Immobilization of uranium in contaminated sediments by hydroxyapatite addition,J Samuel Arey; John C Seaman; Paul M Bertsch,Batch equilibrations were performed to investigate the ability of hydroxyapatite (Ca5 (PO4)3OH) to chemically immobilize U in two contaminated sediment samples having differentorganic carbon contents (123 and 49 g kg-1; respectively). Apatite additions loweredaqueous U to near proposed drinking water standards in batch equilibrations of two distinctsediment strata having total U concentrations of 1703 and 2100 mg kg-1; respectively.Apatite addition of 50 g kg-1 reduced the solubility of U to values less than would beexpected if autunite (Ca (UO2) 2 (PO4) 2· 10H2O) was the controlling solid phase. Acomparison of the two sediment types suggests that aqueous phase U may be controlled byboth the DOC content through complexation and the equilibrium pH for a given apatiteapplication rate.

Changes in transition and heavy metal partitioning during hydrous iron oxide aging,Robert G Ford; Paul M Bertsch; Kevin J Farley,The fate and transport of metal ions in soils and sediments may be controlled by sorption tothe metastable iron (hydr) oxide; ferrihydrite. The reversibility of metal partitioning toferrihydrite can be significantly influenced by its transformation to more thermodynamicallystable structures such as goethite or hematite. We studied changes in metal partitioningduring aging of coprecipitates of ferrihydrite containing Cd (II); Mn (II); Ni (II); or Pb (II) at pH 6and tem peratures of 40 or 70° C and as a function of metal surface loading. Aqueous metalconcentrations as well as the fraction extracted by 0.2 M ammonium oxalate werecontinuously monitored. At the end of aging; solids were characterized by thermogravimetricanalysis and X-ray diffraction. Prior to aging; the extent of metal sorption decreased in theorder Pb (II)>> Ni (II)> Mn (II)≌ Cd (II). However; with ferrihydrite transformation; the …,Environmental Science & Technology,1997,236
Identification and quantification of the" Al13" tridecameric aluminum polycation using ferron,David R Parker; Paul M Bertsch,Division of Biogeochemistry; Savannah River Ecology Laboratory; University of Georgia;Aiken; South Carolina 29802 w Historically; 27A1-NMR spectroscopy has been required fordefinitive identification of the A104A112 (OH);(H20) 1J+ polycation (“A113n); but recentstudies suggest that it might be equatable to the polynuclear A1 fraction that exhibits amoderate reaction rate with the spectrophotometric ferron reagent (Alb). Our objectives wereto further test this correspondence and to critically evaluate the ferron-All; reaction kinetics.Partially neutralized solutions were prepared with [All;= 10-4-10-2 mol Ll; hydrolysis ratios of0.8-2.4; and base injection rates of 0.2-20 mL hl.

Determination of arsenic speciation in poultry wastes by IC-ICP-MS,Brian P Jackson; Paul M Bertsch,The aromatic organoarsenic compounds 4-hydroxy 3-nitrobenzenearsenic acid (Roxarsone;ROX) or 4-aminobenzenearsenic acid (p-arsanilic acid; p-ASA) are used as feed additives inthe poultry industry for disease control and enhanced feed efficiency. While federalregulations govern acceptable As concentrations in edible tissue; elevated Asconcentrations occur in poultry litter; which raises concerns over repeated land applicationof poultry litter in agriculture. As a precursor to studying the fate of these organoarseniccompounds in soils; three speciation methodologies were developed to separate ROX and p-ASA from the more common and more toxic As species arsenate; arsenite; dimethyl arsenicacid (DMA); and monomethyl arsenic acid (MMA). The six arsenic species were separatedon a Dionex AS14 column using a PO4 eluant; an AS16 column using a OH-eluant; and …,Environmental Science & Technology,2001,202
Direct measurement of aluminum uptake and distribution in single cells of Chara corallina,Gregory J Taylor; Julie L McDonald-Stephens; Douglas B Hunter; Paul M Bertsch; David Elmore; Zdenko Rengel; Robert J Reid,Quantitative information on the uptake and distribution of Al at the cellular level is required tounderstand mechanisms of Al toxicity; but direct measurement of uptake across the plasmamembrane has remained elusive. We measured rates of Al transport across membranes insingle cells of Chara corallina using the rare 26 Al isotope; an emerging technology(accelerator mass spectrometry); and a surgical technique for isolating subcellularcompartments. Accumulation of Al in the cell wall dominated total uptake (71–318 μg m− 2min− 1); although transport across the plasma membrane was detectable (71–540 ng m− 2min− 1) within 30 min of exposure. Transport across the tonoplast was initially negligible; butaccelerated to rates approximating uptake across the plasma membrane. The avacuolateprotoplasm showed signs of saturation after 60 min; but continued movement across the …,Plant Physiology,2000,196
In situ Cr (VI) reduction within coarse-textured; oxide-coated soil and aquifer systems using Fe (II) solutions,John C Seaman; Paul M Bertsch; L Schwallie,Batch and column techniques were used to evaluate the in situ Cr (VI) reduction andimmobilization using Fe (II) solutions within the sediments of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.Remediation treatments included Cr-free groundwater and buffered and unbuffered Fe (II)solutions as either FeCl2 and FeSO4. The slow release of Cr (VI) from the Fe-oxide richsubsurface sediment following exposure to Cr-free solutions indicated that simple pump-and-treat procedures would require extended operation time to meet regulatory standards. In situreduction was confirmed by the loss of Cr (VI) and Fe (II) from solution and a drop in pHcompared to control systems. Batch and column-effluent Cr (VI) decreased with increasingFe (II); generally falling below detection limits as the persistence of Fe (II) occurred.However; CrDissolved; presumably Cr (III); exceeded regulatory limits due to the low pH …,Environmental Science & Technology,1999,193
Immobilization of nickel and other metals in contaminated sediments by hydroxyapatite addition,John C Seaman; J Samuel Arey; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract Batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the ability of hydroxyapatite (HA) toreduce the solubility of metals; including the primary contaminants of concern; Ni and U;from contaminated sediments located on the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site;near Aiken; SC. Hydroxyapatite was added to the sediments at application rates of 0; 5; 15.8;and 50 g kg− 1 After equilibrating in either 0.02 M KCl or 0.01 M CaCl 2; the samples werecentrifuged and the supernatants filtered prior to metal; dissolved organic C; and PO 4analyses. The treated soils were then air-dried and changes in solid-phase metaldistribution were evaluated using sequential extractions and electron-based microanalysistechniques. Hydroxyapatite was effective at reducing the solubility of U and; to a lesserdegree; Ni. Hydroxyapatite was also effective in reducing the solubility of Al; Ba; Cd; Co …,Journal of Environmental Quality,2001,186
Soil-borne mobile colloids as influenced by water flow and organic carbon,Daniel I Kaplan; Paul M Bertsch; Domy C Adriano; William P Miller,Paucity of understanding mechanisms relevant to the generation of subsurface mobilecolloids is a major limitation to our current knowledge of colloid-facilitated contaminanttransport. To evaluate the roles of natural organic materials and pore water velocity onmobile colloid generation; colloids generated from 14-m3 lysimeters containingreconstructed soil profiles were collected and characterized. Colloids generated during lowflow rates were 1030% less abundant; contained at least 65% more iron oxides andgibbsite; were 80% smaller; and had 40% greater electrophoretic mobility than colloidsgenerated during higher flow rates. Quartz; kaolinite; and hydroxyinterlayered vermiculitewere enriched by at least 32% in colloids generated during faster flow rates. Mobile colloidsurface charge was greatly enhanced by organic carbon (OC) coatings. Concentrations of …,Environmental Science & Technology,1993,184
Conditions for Al13 polymer formation in partially neutralized aluminum solutions1,Paul M Bertsch,Abstract The influence of synthesis methodology on the formation of the Al 13 ([AlO 4 Al 12(OH) 24 (H 2 O) 12] 7+) polymer was investigated to better establish boundary conditions forits formation. The amount of Al 13 polymer formed in solutions ranging in Al concentrationfrom 3.34× 10− 4 to 3.34× 10− 2 mol L− 1 was found to be highly dependent on OH/Al ratio(ñ); neutralization rate; mixing conditions; and initial Al concentration. For the 3.34× 10− 3mol Al L− 1 solution synthesized at 1.2 cm 3 min− 1; the Al 13 polymer formed only when ñexceeded 1.5; whereas this polymer predominated in a solution 3.34× 10− 2 mol L− 1 withrespect to Al at ñ≥ 0.4. There was no evidence for Al 13 polymer formation in solutions≤3.34× 10− 4 mol Al L− 1 with ñ= 2.5 synthesized at the 1.2 cm 3 min− 1 base injection rate;however; the formation of this species could be induced in the 3.34× 10− 4 mol Al L− 1 …,Soil Science Society of America Journal,1987,175
In situ chemical speciation of uranium in soils and sediments by micro X-ray absorption spectroscopy,Paul M Bertsch; Douglas B Hunter; Stephen R Sutton; Sasa Bajt; Mark L Rivers,The ability to develop adequate models for predicting the fate of inorganic contaminants inboth surface and subsurface environments is highly dependent on accurate knowledge ofthe partitioning of these constituents between the solid and solution phases and ultimatelyon the capability to provide molecular-level information on chemical species distributions inboth of these phases. Furthermore; the development of environmentally sound yet cost-effective remediation strategies requires an understanding of the chemical speciation of thecontaminants within the soil or sediment matrix in which they are contained. Owing toanalytical difficulties; traditional methods for determining speciation of metals in soils andsediments have relied heavily on indirect chemical extraction techniques; in which variousphases within the matrix are operationally defined and inferences on chemical …,Environmental science & technology,1994,170
Formation of the" Al13" tridecameric aluminum polycation under diverse synthesis conditions,David R Parker; Paul M Bertsch,Recent studies using 27A1-NMR spectroscopy indicate that the polynuclear hydroxo-A1fraction that exhibits a moderate reaction rate with the ferron reagent can be equated to theAll; tridecamer; and we utilized this correspondence to examine the formation of All3 over abroad range of synthesis conditions; including some pertinent to natural waters. Ferron andNMR analyses revealed that solutions ([All;= 2 x 10-5-5 x mol Ll) partially neutralized withaqueous NaHCO; contained from 26 to 87% of A1T as the tridecamer. Solutions neutralizedwith solid CaC03 or MgO; or with NH3 vapor; also contained substantial quantities (14-46%of AIT) of Al13. Bicarbonate-neutralized solutions were also prepared by injecting base intoan acidic A1 solution (forward method); by injecting the Al solution into the base (reversemethod); and by simultaneous injection of the two solutions. The latter two methods …,Environmental science & technology,1992,166
Effect of silver nanoparticle surface coating on bioaccumulation and reproductive toxicity in earthworms (Eisenia fetida),William A Shoults-Wilson; Brian C Reinsch; Olga V Tsyusko; Paul M Bertsch; Gregory V Lowry; Jason M Unrine,Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of surface coating on thetoxicity of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) soil. Earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed toAgNO3 and Ag NPs with similar size ranges coated with either polyvinylpyrrolidone(hydrophilic) or oleic acid (amphiphilic) during a standard sub-chronic reproduction toxicitytest. No significant effects on growth or mortality were observed within any of the testtreatments. Significant decreases in reproduction were seen in earthworms exposed toAgNO3;(94.21 mg kg-1) as well as earthworms exposed to Ag NPs with either coating (727.6mg kg-1 for oleic acid and 773.3 mg kg-1 for polyvinylpyrrolidone). The concentrations of AgNPs at which effects were observed are much higher than predicted concentrations of AgNPs in sewage sludge amended soils; however; the concentrations at which adverse …,Nanotoxicology,2011,163
Potassium status of temperate region soils,Paul M Bertsch; Grant W Thomas,A comprehensive review of the K status of temperate region soils is very difficult to present.The published literature is far too voluminous to treat equitably in a single chapter. Theavailable soil classification; soil analysis; and fertilizer use statistics represent; at best; pointestimates or averages over large land masses. Furthermore; data on losses of K byleaching; runoff; and erosion are few. Such factors have to be interpolated; and; at times;extrapolated to arrive at reasonable estimates of the amounts involved. As a result; thefigures are somewhat suspect; yet they represent the best available. Other problems includethe sensitivity of K soil tests; the availability of reliable measurements of K release from soils;and even the unreliability of the numbers representing K removal by crops. Nevertheless; wehave made an attempt to consider the aforementioned factors in addition to fertilizer …,Potassium in agriculture,1985,158
Role of particle size and soil type in toxicity of silver nanoparticles to earthworms,W Aaron Shoults-Wilson; Brian C Reinsch; Olga V Tsyusko; Paul M Bertsch; Greg V Lowry; Jason M Unrine,Abstract Silver nanoparticles (NPs) are an emerging contaminant of concern due to theirincreased use. The earthworm Eisenia fetida was exposed to a range of concentrations ofAgNO 3 and two polyvinylpyrolidone coated Ag NPs with different particle size distributions.They were exposed in two different soils: a naturally occurring sandy loam and astandardized artificial soil. The AgNO 3 significantly reduced E. fetida growth andreproduction at 7.41±0.01 mg kg− 1 Ag in the sandy loam but only reproduction was affectedat concentrations of 94.1±3.2 mg kg− 1 in the artificial soil. In the artificial soil; significant (α=0.05) reproductive toxicity was only observed in organisms exposed to the Ag NPs atconcentrations approximately eight times higher than those at which the effects from ionic Agwere observed.

Mineral associations and average oxidation states of sorbed Pu on tuff,MC Duff; DB Hunter; IR Triay; PM Bertsch; DT Reed; SR Sutton; G Shea-McCarthy; J Kitten; P Eng; SJ Chipera; DT Vaniman,Subsurface transport of groundwater contaminants is greatly influenced by chemicalspeciation; precipitation; and sorption processes. The transport of Pu potentially releasedfrom spent nuclear fuel disposal and storage sites will be dependent on its interaction withmineral surfaces and speciation in the subsurface. The sorption of dissolved Pu (V) on anatural zeolitic tuff that was equilibrated with synthetic groundwater was examined usingsynchrotron-based microanalytical techniques. The tuff contained trace quantities ofsmectites and iron and manganese oxides; which are present as fracture fill and pore spacematerials. Synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) showed that Pu ispredominately associated with manganese oxides (rancieite) and smectites but not with ironoxides (hematite).

Characterization of complex mineral assemblages: Implications for contaminant transport and environmental remediation,Paul M Bertsch; John C Seaman,Abstract Surface reactive phases of soils and aquifers; comprised of phyllosilicate and metaloxohydroxide minerals along with humic substances; play a critical role in the regulation ofcontaminant fate and transport. Much of our knowledge concerning contaminant-mineralinteractions at the molecular level; however; is derived from extensive experimentation onmodel mineral systems. Although these investigations have provided a foundation forunderstanding reactive surface functional groups on individual mineral phases; theinformation cannot be readily extrapolated to complex mineral assemblages in naturalsystems. Recent studies have elucidated the role of less abundant mineral and organicsubstrates as important surface chemical modifiers and have demonstrated complexcoupling of reactivity between permanent-charge phyllosilicates and variable-charge Fe …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,1999,152

Applications of synchrotron-based X-ray microprobes,Paul M Bertsch; Douglas B Hunter,The past decade has witnessed significant advances in technologies related to X-rayspectroscopic techniques; both as a result of advances in X-ray optics; focusing devices; anddetectors and because of greater availability of high-brilliance synchrotron facilitiesworldwide. The result is that synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy(XAFS) has become a mainstream technique in a number of scientific disciplines and isproviding molecular-level information not previously available using other techniques. TheXAFS spectrum is typically separated into the X-ray absorption near-edge structure(XANES); also known as the near-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS)region; and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region. The XANES orNEXAFS spectrum is represented by the energy region just below to∼ 50 eV above the …,Chemical Reviews,2001,149
Effects of particle size on chemical speciation and bioavailability of copper to earthworms (Eisenia fetida) exposed to copper nanoparticles,Jason M Unrine; Olga V Tsyusko; Simona E Hunyadi; Jonathan D Judy; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract To investigate the role of particle size on the oxidation; bioavailability; and adverseeffects of manufactured Cu nanoparticles (NPs) in soils; we exposed the earthworm Eiseniafetida to a series of concentrations of commercially produced NPs labeled as 20-to 40-nmor< 100-nm Cu in artificial soil media. Effects on growth; mortality; reproduction; andexpression of a variety of genes associated with metal homeostasis; general stress; andoxidative stress were measured. We also used X-ray absorption spectroscopy and scanningX-ray fluorescence microscopy to characterize changes in chemical speciation and spatialdistribution of the NPs in soil media and earthworm tissues. Exposure concentrations of CuNPs up to 65 mg kg− 1 caused no adverse effects on ecologically relevant endpoints.Increases in metallothionein expression occurred at concentrations exceeding 20 mg kg …,Journal of environmental quality,2010,142
Toxicity of manufactured zinc oxide nanoparticles in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,Hongbo Ma; Paul M Bertsch; Travis C Glenn; Nadine J Kabengi; Phillip L Williams,Abstract Information describing the possible impacts of manufactured nanoparticles onhuman health and ecological receptors is limited. The objective of the present study was toevaluate the potential toxicological effects of manufactured zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs; 1.5 nm) compared to aqueous zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) in the free-living nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans. Toxicity of both types of Zn was investigated using the ecologicallyrelevant endpoints of lethality; behavior; reproduction; and transgene expression in a mtl-2::GFP (gene encoding green fluorescence protein fused onto the metallothionein-2 genepromoter) transgenic strain of C. elegans.

Evidence for bioavailability of Au nanoparticles from soil and biodistribution within earthworms (Eisenia fetida),Jason M Unrine; Simona E Hunyadi; Olga V Tsyusko; William Rao; W Aaron Shoults-Wilson; Paul M Bertsch,Because Au nanoparticles (NPs) are resistant to oxidative dissolution and are easilydetected; they have been used as stable probes for the behavior of nanomaterials withinbiological systems. Previous studies provide somewhat limited evidence for bioavailability ofAu NPs in food webs; because the spatial distribution within tissues and the speciation of Auwas not determined. In this study; we provide multiple lines of evidence; includingorthogonal microspectroscopic techniques; as well as evidence from biological responses;that Au NPs are bioavailable from soil to a model detritivore (Eisenia fetida). We also presentlimited evidence that Au NPs may cause adverse effects on earthworm reproduction. This isperhaps the first study to demonstrate that Au NPs can be taken up by detritivores from soiland distributed among tissues. We found that primary particle size (20 or 55 nm) did not …,Environmental science & technology,2010,135
Characterization of Hydroxy-Aluminum Solutions by Aluminum-27 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy1,Paul M Bertsch; Grant W Thomas; RICHARD I BARNHisEL,Abstract Laboratory synthesized hydroxy-Al solutions were characterized by nuclearmagnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Solutions ranging in Al concentration from 3.4×10− 3 to 1.0 mol L− 1 at OH/Al ratios (ñ) of 0; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.25;and 2.50 prepared with base injection rates of 0.6 and 1.2 cm 3 min− 1 were investigated.For concentrated solutions (0.5 mol L− 1); two polymeric species produced observableresonance peaks; the [AlO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 2] 7+ polynuclear (ie;“Al 13”) species witha chemical shift (δ) 63-ppm downfield of the hexaaquaaluminum species; and the dimer Al 2(OH) 2 (H 2 O) 4+ 8; which displayed a broad resonance≅ 3-ppm downfield from thehexaaqua-Al cation.

Microfluorescence and microtomography analyses of heterogeneous earth and environmental materials,Stephen R Sutton; Paul M Bertsch; Matthew Newville; Mark Rivers; Antonio Lanzirotti; Peter Eng,Analytical techniques with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution are crucial forunderstanding the chemical properties of complex earth materials and environmentalsamples; and these so-called “microprobes” have become workhorses of the geochemicalcommunity as well as important tools for environmental scientists. These microanalyticalinstruments are based on various forms of sample excitation and detection. They arecomplementary in terms of spatial resolution; element sensitivity; energy deposition and non-destructiveness. Several techniques fall in the class of methods employing charged particleexcitation of X-ray fluorescence; including electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) andparticleinduced X-ray emission (PIXE).

Pyrene sorption by water-soluble organic carbon,Bruce E Herbert; Paul M Bertsch; Jeff M Novak,Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil solution has the potential to facilitate thetransport of nonionic organic contaminants (NOC). The interactions between pyrene andultrafiltration fractions of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC); humic acid; and fulvic acidwere quantified using fluorescence-quenching spectroscopy. Pyrene partition coefficients tothe smaller WSOC fractions varied between 4.1 X l. 03 and 6.8 X lo3 L kg-l; while partitioncoefficients for the largest fraction of WSOC; humic acid; and fulvic acid were 1.5 X lo4; 1.7 Xlo5; and 1.1 X lo4 L kg-l; respectively. These results demonstrate that the use of the samecKK; value to describe NOC partitioning to both immobile organic matter and soil solutionDOM will overestimate the ability of DOM to facilitate the transport of NOC. Conversely;pyrene partitioning data to the largest WSOC fraction suggest that the presence of …,Environmental science & technology,1993,124
Evidence for avoidance of Ag nanoparticles by earthworms (Eisenia fetida),WA Shoults-Wilson; Oksana I Zhurbich; David H McNear; Olga V Tsyusko; Paul M Bertsch; Jason M Unrine,Abstract Silver nanoparticles have been incorporated into a wide variety of consumerproducts; ideally acting as antimicrobial agents. Silver exposure has long been known tocause toxic effects to a wide variety of organisms; making large scale production of silvernanoparticles a potential hazard to environmental systems. Here we describe the firstevidence that an organism may be able to sense manufactured nanoparticles in a complex;environmentally relevant exposure and that the presence of nanoparticles alters theorganism's behavior. We found that earthworms (Eisenia fetida) consistently avoid soilscontaining silver nanoparticles and AgNO 3 at similar concentrations of Ag. However;avoidance of silver nanoparticles occurred over 48 h; while avoidance of AgNO 3 wasimmediate. It was determined that avoidance of silver nanoparticles could not be …,Ecotoxicology,2011,123
Fate of arsenic compounds in poultry litter upon land application,BP Jackson; JC Seaman; PM Bertsch,Abstract The use of the organic As compound; roxarsone; as an antibiotic additive to poultryfeed continues to raise concern over potential negative environmental impacts. Total Asconcentration in poultry litter can reach> 40 mg kg− 1 and both roxarsone and itsmineralization product As (V) have been identified in poultry litters (PL). To investigate thefate of these As species upon land application of PL we conducted two studies. In the first;an Orangeburg soil (Ultisol from the Atlantic Coastal Plain) was spiked with either 20 mg kg−1 As (V) or roxarsone and incubated at 10% moisture content for 4 months. ExchangeableAs was determined periodically by extraction with 0.1 M PO 4. Both As (V) and roxarsonedisplayed similar desorption; initially; approximately 70% of added As was ligandexchangeable and this decreased to 35% after 4 months incubation; presumably due to …,Chemosphere,2006,123
Actinide association with groundwater colloids in a coastal plain aquifer,DI Kaplan; PM Bertsch; DC Adriano; KA Orlandini,Abstract Trace levels of Pu; Am; Cm; and U in an acidic plume have been traveling through asurface aquifer underlying the Savannah River Site; Aiken; SC; at rates appreciably greaterthan anticipated. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which each ofthese actinides was associated with groundwater colloids; a potential cause for the apparentenhanced transport. Contaminated groundwater was recovered along a 1.02 km transect atapproximately the rate of groundwater flow; passed though an ultrafiltration system; and thenchemically characterized. The filterable (> 500 molecular weight) fraction of nuclidesincreased with reported nuclide distribution coefficients (Kd values): Pu> Th> U> Am= Cm>Ra> tritium. The filterable fractions of the strongersorbing nuclides (Pu and Th) increased;whereas those of the weaker-sorbing nuclides (Am; Cm; and Ra) generally decreased …,Radiochimica Acta,1994,121
Forest sources and pathways of organic matter transport to a blackwater stream: a hydrologic approach,Michael G Dosskey; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract Quantitative information regarding landscape sources and pathways of organicmatter transport to streams is important for assessing impacts of terrestrial processes onaquatic ecosystems. We quantified organic C; a measure of organic matter; flowing from ablackwater stream draining a 12.6 km 2 watershed on the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain inSouth Carolina; and utilized a hydrologic approach to partition this outflow between itsvarious pathways from upland and wetland forest sources. Results of this study indicate that28.9 tonnes C yr− 1 were exported in stream flow; which was estimated to be 0.5% of theannual C input from forest detritus to the watershed. Upland forest; which covers 94% of thewatershed area; contributed only 2.0 tonnes C yr− 1 to stream flow; which amounted to0.04% of detritus annually produced by the upland forest. Organic matter was transported …,Biogeochemistry,1994,117
Speciation of aluminum in aqueous solutions using ion chromatography,Paul M Bertsch; Michael A Anderson,An Ion chromatographic method In which aluminum (Al) Is quantitatively determined viapostcolumn derlvatlzation with Tlron (4; 5-dlhydroxy-m-benzenedlsulfonlc acid) wasevaluated for Its utility as a method for speclating Al In aqueous solutions. Fluro-; oxalato-;and cltratoalumlnum complexes were Identified by distinct peaks within chromatograms of Alsolu-tions when the appropriate ligand was added. Excellent quantitative agreementbetween predicted species concen-trations (via the thermodynamic speciation modelGEOCHEM) and those determined by ion chromatography was obtained for samplesprepared In the eluent matrix.

Comparative phototoxicity of nanoparticulate and bulk ZnO to a free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans: the importance of illumination mode and primary parti...,H Ma; NJ Kabengi; PM Bertsch; JM Unrine; TC Glenn; PL Williams,Abstract The present study evaluated phototoxicity of nanoparticulate ZnO and bulk-ZnOunder natural sunlight (NSL) versus ambient artificial laboratory light (AALL) illumination to afree-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Phototoxicity of nano-ZnO and bulk-ZnO waslargely dependent on illumination method as 2-h exposure under NSL caused significantlygreater mortality in C. elegans than under AALL. This phototoxicity was closely related tophotocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by the ZnO particles as indicatedby concomitant methylene blue photodegradation. Both materials caused mortality in C.elegans under AALL during 24-h exposure although neither degraded methylene blue;suggesting mechanisms of toxicity other than photocatalytic ROS generation were involved.Particle dissolution of ZnO did not appear to play an important role in the toxicity observed …,Environmental Pollution,2011,102
Evidence that the ZNT3 protein controls the total amount of elemental zinc in synaptic vesicles,David H Linkous; Jane M Flinn; Jae Y Koh; Antonio Lanzirotti; Paul M Bertsch; Blair F Jones; Leonard J Giblin; Christopher J Frederickson,The ZNT3 protein decorates the presynaptic vesicles of central neurons harboring vesicularzinc; and deletion of this protein removes staining for zinc. However; it has been unclearwhether only histochemically reactive zinc is lacking or if; indeed; total elemental zinc ismissing from neurons lacking the Slc30a3 gene; which encodes the ZNT3 protein. Thelimitations of conventional histochemical procedures have contributed to this enigma.However; a novel technique; microprobe synchrotron X-ray fluorescence; reveals that thenormal 2-to 3-fold elevation of zinc concentration normally present in the hippocampalmossy fibers is absent in Slc30a3 knockout (ZNT3) mice. Thus; the ZNT3 protein evidentlycontrols not only the “stainability” but also the actual mass of zinc in mossy-fiber synapticvesicles. This work thus confirms the metal-transporting role of the ZNT3 protein in the …,Journal of Histochemistry & Cytochemistry,2008,97

The primary objective of this study was toassess uptake; biodistribution and toxicity associated with exposure of tobacco plants(Nicotiana xanthi) to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We employed synchrotron-based X-raymicroanalysis with X-ray absorption near-edge microspectroscopy and high resolutionelectron microscopy to localize AuNPs within plants. Results from these experiments revealthat AuNPs entered plants through the roots and moved into the vasculature. Aggregatebodies were also detected within root cell cytoplasm. Furthermore; AuNP uptake was sizeselective as 3.5 nm AuNP spheres were detected in plants but 18 nm AuNPs remainedagglomerated on the root outer surfaces.

Speciation of Hydroxy-Aluminum Solutions by Wet Chemical and Aluminum-27 NMR Methods1,Paul M Bertsch; W John Layton; RI Barnhisel,Abstract Partially neutralized Al solutions with OH/Al molar (ñ) ratios ranging from 0.25 to 2.5were studied employing 27 Al nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the ferron-timed colorimetric assay. The monomeric Al concentrations (Al a) estimated by the ferronassay were consistently higher than the actual concentration determined by NMRspectroscopy. The differences between the methods indicate the presence of a smallpolymer which reacts rapidly with ferron and is erroneously assigned to the monomeric Alfraction. The polymeric Al component (Al b) estimated by the ferron method could bepartitioned into a more rapidly reacting fraction (≤ 1 h) and a slowly reacting fraction (> 1 h).The amount of Al associated with the rapidly reacting polymeric fraction corresponded to theamount of [AlO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 12] 7+ polymer directly determined by NMR …,Soil Science Society of America Journal,1986,94

Deconstruction of the chemical effects of road salt on stream water chemistry,Charles F Mason; Stephen A Norton; Ivan J Fernandez; Lynn E Katz,Abstract The chemistry of a first-order stream in Amherst; ME; with a catchment area of 103ha has been strongly altered as a result of road salt application at a rate of approximately 4 tof NaCl per year in the lower 15% of the catchment. Downstream from the road; elevatedstream Cl is accompanied by elevated Ca; K; Mg; and Na. The chemistry of the stream wasdeconstructed to identify the impact of the salt on total stream chemistry. Componentsquantified include precipitation (including dry deposition); chemical weathering; road salt;and cation exchange. Sodium from the road salt displaces Ca; K; and Mg from the soil on anequivalent basis. The displacement was at a maximum in late Fall and early Spring;indicating a long residence time for the NaCl. The exchange process was reversible. Withcontinued loading of NaCl the water chemistry should reach a steady state such that Na …,Journal of Environmental Quality,1999,92
Transport of dissolved organic matter through a sandy forest soil,MG Dosskey; PM Bertsch,Abstract We assessed the transport of dissolved organic matter (DOM) through a sandy;Ultisol forest soil on the southeastern US Coastal Plain; and contrasted the results withsimilar studies from other forest regions; to test the hypothesis that DOM transport is greaterthrough sandy Ultisols than finer textured Ultisols and Spodosols. Within a small headwatercatchment; concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC); a measure of DOM; weremeasured in soil solution at three depths (10; 30; and 90 cm) in sand A and E horizons ofsoil profiles; and in sand along the valley bottom at 198-to 264-cm depth in shallowgroundwater. Water samples were collected after every rainfall event for 21 mo using zero-tension lysimeters; suction samplers; and piezometers. Mean concentration of DOC in soilwater decreased from 25.5 mg CL-1 at 10-cm depth to 13.7 mg CL-1 at 30 cm; and to 1.8 …,Soil Science Society of America Journal,1997,92
Chemical controls on colloid generation and transport in a sandy aquifer,John C Seaman; Paul M Bertsch; William P Miller,Colloid generation and transport in a highly weathered subsurface material from the UpperCoastal Plain (Aiken; SC) was controlled by factors other than the Na-concentration of theleaching solution. Repacked columns were leached with solutions of various Na-to Ca2'andMg2--ratios. Following injection of the treatment solution; the columns were leached withdeionized water (DIW). For the mixed cation solutions prepared from CI-salts; colloidgeneration occurred only when the treatment solution was replaced with DIW; but the levelof effluent turbidity decreased with increasing Na+ concentration and increasing duration ofexposure to the high Na+ solution. CaC12 solutions produced substantial mobile colloidsduring injection that coincided with a decrease in effluent pH. The mobile colloidspossessed a positive electrophoretic mobility; suggesting that the drop in pH during salt …,Environmental science & technology,1995,92
Trophic transfer of Au nanoparticles from soil along a simulated terrestrial food chain.,Jason M Unrine; W Aaron Shoults-Wilson; Oksana Zhurbich; Paul M Bertsch; Olga V Tsyusko,To determine if nanoparticles (NPs) could be transferred from soil media to invertebratesand then to secondary consumers; we examined the trophic transfer of Au NPs along asimulated terrestrial food chain. Earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to Au NPs inartificial soil media and fed to juvenile bullfrogs (Rana catesbeina). Earthworm Auconcentrations were continuously monitored so that the cumulative dose to bullfrogs couldbe accurately estimated throughout the experiment. We exposed a second group of bullfrogsto equivalent doses of Au NPs by oral gavage to compare the bioavailability of NPs throughdirect exposure to trophic exposure. We observed accumulation of Au in liver; kidney;spleen; muscle; stomach; and intestine in both treatment groups. Tissue concentrationsdecreased on average of approximately 100-fold with each trophic-step. The total …,Environmental science & technology,2012,91
Mineralogical and physicochemical differences between mobile and nonmobile colloidal phases in reconstructed pedons,Daniel I Kaplan; Paul M Bertsch; Domy C Adriano,Abstract Ultisols can be highly dispersive and therefore a potential source for mobile colloidsto underlying aquifers. In this study; mobile colloids were collected after a rain from 13.5-m 3lysimeters containing reconstructed pedons of two Ultisols. The mobile colloids wereenriched with kaolinite; Fe oxides; and gibbsite and were more dilute in quartz and hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (HIV) relative to the total clay fractions of the originating pedons. Thecolloids were< 1000 nm in diameter and had a bimodal size distribution: the larger colloids(≈ 760 nm) consisted primarily of quartz and HIV; the much more abundant smaller colloids(≈ 230 nm) consisted primarily of Fe oxides; kaolinite; and gibbsite. The colloids also hadexceptionally high negative surface charges that probably originated from organic coatings(10 g kg− 1). These organic coatings indicate that the majority of the colloids originated …,Soil Science Society of America Journal,1997,90
Characterization of colloidal and humic-bound Ni and U in the “dissolved” fraction of contaminated sediment extracts,Brian P Jackson; James F Ranville; Paul M Bertsch; Andrew G Sowder,The dissolved phase of environmental aqueous samples is generally defined by filtration at0.2 μm or even 0.45 μm. However; it is also acknowledged that colloids< 0.2 μm suspendedin the aqueous phase can be important for determining contaminant availability and mobility.We have used flow field-flow fractionation (Fl FFF) and size exclusion chromatography(SEC) coupled to UV-absorbance (UVA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry(ICP-MS) to study the dissolved organic matter (DOM) and colloidal binding of U and Ni inwater extracts of sediments collected from a contaminated area of the Savannah River Site;a US Department of Energy former nuclear materials production and processing facility; nearAiken; SC.

Chemical conditions conducive to the release of mobile colloids from ultisol profiles,Daniel I Kaplan; Malcolm E Sumner; Paul M Bertsch; Domy C Adriano,Abstract Dispersed colloidal clay particles may enhance the transport of environmentalcontaminants adsorbed to the colloid surfaces. The objective of this study was to determinehow soil pH (4.3–6.9); low total electrolyte concentration (TEC; 0.4–2.8 mol c m-3); and lowNa adsorption ratios (SAR; 0.3–1.8 [mol c m-3] 0.5) affected the concentration of mobilecolloids released from 13.5-m 3 reconstructed Ultisol profiles. Critical flocculationconcentration (CFC; the minimum TEC to induce flocculation of a clay suspension) testswere conducted using the water-dispersible clay fraction of the Ap horizon of these profiles;which is the primary source for the mobile colloids. Surface soil pH; TEC; and SAR levels ofthe profiles that released high concentrations of colloids fell within the dispersion domainidentified by the laboratory CFC tests. The effect of SAR on dispersion appears to be a …,Soil Science Society of America Journal,1996,85
Plutonium oxidation and subsequent reduction by Mn (IV) minerals in Yucca Mountain tuff,Brian A Powell; Martine C Duff; Daniel I Kaplan; Robert A Fjeld; Matthew Newville; Douglas B Hunter; Paul M Bertsch; John T Coates; Peter Eng; Mark L Rivers; Steven M Serkiz; Stephen R Sutton; Ines R Triay; David T Vaniman,Plutonium oxidation state distribution on Yucca Mountain tuff and synthetic pyrolusite (β-MnO2) suspensions was measured using synchrotron X-ray micro-spectroscopy andmicroimaging techniques as well as ultrafiltration/solvent-extraction techniques. Plutoniumsorbed to the tuff was preferentially associated with manganese oxides. For both YuccaMountain tuff and synthetic pyrolusite; Pu (IV) or Pu (V) was initially oxidized to more mobilePu (V/VI); but over time; the less mobile Pu (IV) became the predominant oxidation state ofthe sorbed Pu. The observed stability of Pu (IV) on oxidizing surfaces (eg; pyrolusite); isproposed to be due to the formation of a stable hydrolyzed Pu (IV) surface species. Thesefindings have important implications in estimating the risk associated with the geologicalburial of radiological waste in areas containing Mn-bearing minerals; such as at the …,Environmental science & technology,2006,84
Speciation and crystal chemistry of iron (III) chloride hydrolyzed in the presence of SiO4 ligands. 1. An Fe K-edge EXAFS study,Emmanuel Doelsch; Jérome Rose; Armand Masion; Jean Yves Bottero; Daniel Nahon; Paul M Bertsch,The hydrolysis of Fe− Si systems with Si/Fe ratios between 0 and 4 leads to the formation ofpoorly crystalline or; more frequently; of long-range disorganized precipitates. The increaseof Si/Fe molar ratios results in an dramatic change of Fe polymerization. The formation ofdouble and single corner-sharing Fe linkages is reduced compared to pure Fe hydrolysisproducts. The growth regime depends on the Si concentration in the system. Three-dimensional and two-dimensional growth of Fe colloids occurs at low and high Si/Fe ratios;respectively; systems with Si/Fe ratios around 1 representing a crossover between these tworegimes. Though Si neighbors cannot be detected unequivocally by Fe K-edge EXAFS; theirpresence in the close environment of Fe atoms is evident from the change in Fe speciation.,Langmuir,2000,83
Behavior of Ag nanoparticles in soil: effects of particle surface coating; aging and sewage sludge amendment,Annie R Whitley; Clément Levard; Emily Oostveen; Paul M Bertsch; Chris J Matocha; Frank von der Kammer; Jason M Unrine,Abstract This study addressed the relative importance of particle coating; sewage sludgeamendment; and aging on aggregation and dissolution of manufactured Ag nanoparticles(Ag MNPs) in soil pore water. Ag MNPs with citrate (CIT) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)coatings were incubated with soil or municipal sewage sludge which was then amended tosoil (1% or 3% sludge (w/w)). Pore waters were extracted after 1 week and 2 and 6 monthsand analyzed for chemical speciation; aggregation state and dissolution. Ag MNP coatinghad profound effects on aggregation state and partitioning to pore water in the absence ofsewage sludge; but pre-incubation with sewage sludge negated these effects. This suggeststhat Ag MNP coating does not need to be taken into account to understand fate of AgMNPsapplied to soil through biosolids amendment. Aging of soil also had profound effects that …,Environmental pollution,2013,80
Influence of sorbate-sorbent interactions on the crystallization kinetics of nickel-and lead-ferrihydrite coprecipitates,Robert G Ford; KM Kemner; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract Metals sorbed to or coprecipitated with ferrihydrite can significantly inhibittransformation to more crystalline endproducts. We hypothesized that metals with a higherstability constant for a metal-ferrihydrite surface complex would retard the transformationprocess to a greater extent. To test this hypothesis; we examined the influence of Ni or Pbsorption on the kinetics of ferrihydrite crystallization to goethite/hematite. Reported surfacestability constants for Ni and Pb sorbed to ferrihydrite are logK 1; int= 0.37 and 4.0;respectively (Dzombak and Morel; 1990). The structural evolution of nickel-and lead-ferrihydrite coprecipitates was studied for various metal loadings during aging at pH 6 or 11and 70° C. Results of aging studies demonstrated that the influence on transformationkinetics was not related to the magnitude of the stability constant of the Ni-or Pb …,Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,1999,79
In situ examination of uranium contaminated soil particles by micro-X-ray absorption and micro-fluorescence spectroscopies,D Hunter; P Bertsch,Abstract Two complimentary spectroscopic techniques; X-ray absorption and fluorescencespectroscopy have been conducted at spatial scales of 1 to 25 μm on uranium contaminatedsoil sediments collected from two former nuclear materials processing facilities of the DOE:Fernald; OH and Savannah River Site; SC.

Immobilization of cesium-137 and uranium in contaminated sediments using soil amendments,John C Seaman; T Meehan; PM Bertsch,Abstract Batch and dynamic leaching methods were used to evaluate the effectiveness ofhydroxyapatite (HA); illite; and zeolite; alone and in combination; as soil additives forreducing the migration of cesium-137 (137 Cs+) and uranium (U) from contaminatedsediments. Amendment treatments ranging from 0 to 50 g kg− 1 were added to the sedimentand equilibrated in 0.001 M CaCl 2 After equilibration; the treatment supernatants wereanalyzed for 137 Cs+; U; PO 4; and other metals. The residual sediments were thenextracted overnight using one of the following: 1.0 M NH 4 Cl; 0.5 M CaCl 2; or the ToxicityCharacteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) extractant. Cesium was strongly sorbed to thecontaminated sediments; presumably due to interlayer fixation within native illitic clays.

Preparation and FT–IR Characterization of Metal Phytate Compounds Trade or manufacturer's names mentioned in the paper are for information only and do not con...,Zhongqi He; C Wayne Honeycutt; Tiequan Zhang; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract Phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphoric acid; IP6) has long been recognized as thepredominant organic P form in soil and animal manure. Whereas many studies haveinvestigated the wet chemistry of IP6; there is little information on the characterization ofsolid metal IP6 compounds. This information is essential for further understanding andassessing the chemical behavior of IP6 in diverse soil–plant–water ecosystems. As the firststep in full characterization; we synthesized eight metal phytate compounds andinvestigated their structural features using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR).The absorption features from 900 to 1200 cm− 1 in FT–IR could be used to identify thesephytates as:(i) light divalent metal (Ca and Mg) compounds with a sharp band and a broadband;(ii) heavy divalent metal (Cu and Mn) compounds with splitting broad bands; and (iii …,Journal of environmental quality,2006,70
Facilitated transport of contaminant metals through an acidified aquifer,Daniel I Kaplan; Paul M Bertsch; Domy C Adriano,Abstract A highly acidic aqueous waste containing metals was released into unlinedseepage basins between 1955 and 1988 resulting in the contamination of the underlyingaquifer. To provide insight about the mechanism (s) responsible for the facilitated movementof several of these contaminant metals; ground-water samples were recovered from theaquifer along a 1.02-km transect at approximately the rate of ground-water flow. Facilitatedcontaminant transport was attributed primarily to the poor cation-sorbing capacity of theaquifer matrix and the soluble nature of the metals in the acidic plume. Based on chemicalequilibrium calculations of ground-water ultrafiltrates which agreed with results from cationicand anionic resin-exchange experiments; over 90% of each contaminant metal (Cr; Ni; Cu;Cd; Pb; and U) existed in cationic forms in the aquifer: either as soluble metals or as …,Groundwater,1995,70

The chemistry of uranium in evaporation pond sediment in the San Joaquin Valley; California; USA; using X-ray fluorescence and XANES techniques,Martine C Duff; Christopher Amrhein; Paul M Bertsch; Douglas B Hunter,Abstract Evaporation ponds in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV); CA; used for the disposal ofirrigation drainage waters; contain elevated levels of uranium. The ponds are filledperiodically and support algae which upon evaporation become incorporated in thesediments as layers of decaying organic matter. This rich source of organic matter promotesreducing conditions in the sediments. Our research was conducted to characterizeoxidation/reduction reactions that affect soluble and sediment U (IV)/U (VI) concentrations inthe SJV ponds.

Chemistry and structure of colloids obtained by hydrolysis of Fe (III) in the presence of SiO4 ligands,Emmanuel Doelsch; Armand Masion; Jérôme Rose; William EE Stone; Jean Yves Bottero; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract Fe (III)–Si systems at various Si/Fe molar ratios and pH values were examined atthe local and semi-local scale. The growth of Fe species is strongly dependent on the Siconcentration: at Si/Fe< 1; the presence of edge and corner Fe–Fe linkages indicates athree dimensional growth regime; whereas for Si/Fe> 1; the predominance of edge linkagescorresponds to a two dimensional growth. Si–O–Fe and Si–O–Si bonds are formedsimultaneously from the lowest pH and the lowest Si/Fe. At low pH; silica domains ofapproximately 2 nm are detected within the samples having the highest Si/Fe ratios. Thepolymerization level of Si strongly decreases at high pH; whereas Fe polymerization is onlymoderately sensitive to pH variations. The high fractal dimension of these amorphousphases indicates dense aggregation.

In sequential extractions of four sediments thatranged from 12.7 to 82.2 g kg− 1 in organic carbon; U was found almost exclusively inmoderately labile fractions (93% in acid-soluble+ organically bound). Nickel was distributedacross all operationally defined fractions; including substantial amounts in the very labilefractions (4–15% in water-soluble+ exchangeable); noncrystalline and crystalline ironoxides (38–49%); and in the nonlabile residual fraction (25–34%).

Spectroscopic characterization of uranium in evaporation basin sediments,MC Duff; DE Morris; DB Hunter; PM Bertsch,Abstract Evaporation ponds in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV); CA; used for the containmentof irrigation drainage waters contain elevated levels of uranium (U) resulting from theextensive leaching by carbonate-rich irrigation waters of the local agricultural soils thatcontain low levels of naturally-occurring U. The SJV ponds are subjected to changes inredox chemistry with cycles of drying and flooding. Our past studies have shown that U in theSJV Pond 14 surface sediments is present as mostly the oxidized and soluble form; U (VI).However; we were uncertain whether the U in the soil was only present as a U oxide ofmixed stoichiometry; such as U 3 O 8 (s)(pitchblende) or other species.

Factors influencing uranium reduction and solubility in evaporation pond sediments,Martine C Duff; Douglas B Hunter; Paul M Bertsch; Christopher Amrhein,Abstract Evaporation ponds in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV); CA; USA that are used for thedisposal of irrigation drainage waters; contain elevated levels of U that may be a threat topond wildlife. The ponds support euryhaline algae; which become incorporated in thesediments as depositional organic matter (OM)–facilitating reducing conditions. Our earlierstudies have shown that U in one SJV sediment was primarily present as the highly solubleU (VI) species (as opposed to the less soluble U (IV) species); despite the presence ofvolatile sulfides. In this research; we investigated the effects of native pond algae (Chlorella)and potential reducing agents on U redox chemistry of SJV pond sediments. San JoaquinValley pond sediments were equilibrated with natural and synthetic pond inlet waterscontaining approximately 10 mg U (VI) L-1 to which reducing agents (acetate; sucrose …,Biogeochemistry,1999,57
Differential cultivar response to polynuclear hydroxo-aluminum complexes,JR Shann; PM Bertsch,Abstract Recent evidence has indicated that polynuclear hydroxo-Al complexes may bemore toxic to certain plant species in solution culture than the hexaaqua or othermononuclear Al complexes. The objective of this study was to investigate the response of sixwheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars; having a demonstrated differential tolerance to Alunder field conditions; to mononuclear and polynuclear Al when exposed in a solutionculture bioassay system. The order of cultivar tolerance to mononuclear Al observed in thisinvestigation was 'Yecora Rojo'>'Titan'>'Caldwell'>'Wampum'>'Hart;'which is identical to thatreported for these cultivars grown in acid soils. This observation demonstrates the utility ofthe hydroponic bioassay technique as a simple and effective means for screeninggenetically diverse plants for Al tolerance.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy study of immobilization processes for heavy metals in calcium silicate hydrates: 1. Case of lead,Jérôme Rose; Isabelle Moulin; Jean-Louis Hazemann; Armand Masion; Paul M Bertsch; Jean-Yves Bottero; Françis Mosnier; Claude Haehnel,Trace amounts of heavy metals can be detected in cement. The major source is due toheavy metals naturally present in some of the raw materials used for clinkers manufacture.One way to predict the long-term behavior of these metals is to know which types of linksoccur between heavy metals and major elements (Ca; Si; Al; Fe). Since tricalcium silicate(C3S) is the major phase of cement-base material; a XAS study at the Pb− LIII edge hasbeen carried out to elucidate the binding mechanisms of Pb by calcium silicate. At lowconcentration; under the precipitation of the oxide and oxy-hydroxide; a strong retardation ofthe hydration of the C3S has been observed for C3S doped with Pb. EXAFS resultsconfirmed by XANES at the Pb− LIII edge indicate that Pb is chemically adsorbed at thesurface of the C3S. This Pb layer acts as a diffusional barrier to water and leads to the …,Langmuir,2000,55
Surface complexation of aluminum on isolated fish gill cells,Kevin J Wilkinson; Paul M Bertsch; Charles H Jagoe; Peter GC Campbell,Cells from the gills of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were isolated and exposedto dilute solutions of Al; A1 in the presence of fluoride; or A1 plus dissolved organic matter(DOM) to determine the cells' metal binding potential in an acidic medium.Microelectrophoresis was employed to monitor the extent of aluminum sorption to cells in thepresence of added ligand. In the absence of Al; the gill cells exhibit an appreciable negativecharge; A1 binding to the cell surface increases the electric potential at the shear plane andleads to a reduction in the cell's (negative) electrophoretic mobility. In the presence of bothA1 and F; aluminum complexation at the gill surface is only marginally reduced; theformation of a mixed ligand complex;{F-Al-L-cell); is proposed to account for the observedresults. The presence of such ternary complexes was subsequently verified by 19F …,Environmental science & technology,1993,53
Transport of anthropogenic uranium from sediments to surface waters during episodic storm events,Vicky L Batson; PM Bertsch; BE Herbert,Abstract Remobilization of sediment-associated uranium (U) from contaminated floodplainsediments to a stream adjacent to a nuclear weapons processing facility during episodic rainevents was investigated. In addition; U solid phase associations in suspended sedimentswere assessed by a sequential chemical extraction procedure to gauge U chemical lability.Mass flux estimates determined from base flow measurements potentially underestimate theamount of U transported from contaminated terrestrial sources to surface water systems.Erosional processes can effectively mobilize sediment-associated contaminants duringstorms or flooding. During the various storm events measured; approximately 1500 to2800% more U was exported to Upper Three Runs Creek (UTRC) relative to base flowmeasurements. Sequential extraction results suggest the suspended sediment load …,Journal of Environmental Quality,1996,51
X-ray absorption spectroscopy study of immobilization processes for heavy metals in calcium silicate hydrates. 2. Zinc,Jérôme Rose; Isabelle Moulin; Armand Masion; Paul M Bertsch; Mark R Wiesner; Jean-Yves Bottero; Francis Mosnier; Claude Haehnel,Tricalcium silicate (C3S); the major phase of cement-based materials; contains naturally afew hundred parts per million of heavy metals. An X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)study at the Zn K-edge has been carried out to elucidate the binding mechanisms of Zn bycalcium silicate hydrates; which is important to predict the long-term behavior of Zn. At lowconcentration; under the threshold of precipitation of the oxide; oxy hydroxide; and calciumzinc hydroxide; no retardation of the hydration of the C3S has been observed for C3S dopedwith Zn. A previous 29Si NMR (Moulin; I.; Stone; WEE; Sanz; J.; Bottero; J.-Y.; Mosnier; J− Y.;Haehnel; C. Langmuir 1999; 15; 2829− 2835) study has demonstrated that the structure ofthe hydrated C3S (called CSH for calcium silicate hydrates) does not change if Zn is presentinitially or not. XAS experiments have shown that Zn tetrahedra are incorporated within …,Langmuir,2001,45
Ionic tracer movement through highly weathered sediments,JC Seaman; PM Bertsch; WP Miller,Abstract A highly-weathered; sandy aquifer material from the Upper Coastal Plain region ofthe southeastern USA (Aiken; South Carolina) was used to determine the impact of ionicstrength and solution composition on the determination of physical transport parametersusing ionic tracers. The mineralogy of the clay fraction consisted primarily of kaolinite;goethite and mica. Repacked saturated columns (bulk density∼ 1.5 g cm− 3) were leachedat a constant rate (∼ 0.25 cm min− 1) with a given tracer solution. For comparison; tritium (∼200 pCi mL− 1) was included in leachate of selected columns and several of theexperiments were replicated in columns of acid-washed sand. Pore volume estimates basedon tritium breakthrough were consistent with those calculated from the bulk density of therepacked matrix. In contrast; solute breakthrough for the sandy geologic material was …,Journal of Contaminant Hydrology,1995,45
Application of synchrotron X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis to identify contaminant metals on groundwater colloids,Daniel I Kaplan; Douglas B Hunter; Paul M Bertsch; Sasa Bajt; Domy C Adriano,It has become increasingly evident that mobile colloids may be a primary vector fortransporting contaminants in subsurface environments (1). A difficulty with studying andmodeling this contaminant transport process has been in defining clearly whether thecontaminants exist in the mobile-solid (colloidal) or mobile-aqueous phase. Traditionally;researchers have assumed that contaminants were in the colloidal fraction when differencesin contaminant concentrations of ultrafiltrates were measured (2; 3). This technique is notentirely satisfactory because it provides only indirect evidence; is subject to a number ofartifacts; and usually requires high analytical precision at very low contaminantconcentrations (I; 2; 4; 5). The Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) microprobe at theNational Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory; Upton; NY; may …,Environmental science & technology,1994,45
Isolation and characterization of four Gram-positive nickel-tolerant microorganisms from contaminated sediments,Joy D Van Nostrand; Tatiana V Khijniak; Terry J Gentry; Michelle T Novak; Andrew G Sowder; Jizhong Z Zhou; Paul M Bertsch; Pamela J Morris,Abstract Microbial communities from riparian sediments contaminated with high levels of Niand U were examined for metal-tolerant microorganisms. Isolation of four aerobic Ni-tolerant; Gram-positive heterotrophic bacteria indicated selection pressure from Ni. Theseisolates were identified as Arthrobacter oxydans NR-1; Streptomyces galbus NR-2;Streptomyces aureofaciens NR-3; and Kitasatospora cystarginea NR-4 based on partial 16SrDNA sequences. A functional gene microarray containing gene probes for functionsassociated with biogeochemical cycling; metal homeostasis; and organic contaminantdegradation showed little overlap among the four isolates. Fifteen of the genes weredetected in all four isolates with only two of these related to metal resistance; specifically totellurium. Each of the four isolates also displayed resistance to at least one of six …,Microbial ecology,2007,44
Impact of sulfidation on the bioavailability and toxicity of silver nanoparticles to Caenorhabditis elegans,Daniel L Starnes; Jason M Unrine; Catherine P Starnes; Blanche E Collin; Emily K Oostveen; Rui Ma; Gregory V Lowry; Paul M Bertsch; Olga V Tsyusko,Abstract Sulfidation is a major transformation product for manufactured silver nanoparticles(Ag-MNPs) in the wastewater treatment process. We studied the dissolution; uptake; andtoxicity of Ag-MNP and sulfidized Ag-MNPs (sAg-MNPs) to a model soil organism;Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results show that reproduction was the most sensitive endpointtested for both Ag-MNPs and sAg-MNPs. We also demonstrate that sulfidation not onlydecreases solubility of Ag-MNP; but also reduces the bioavailability of intact sAg-MNP. Therelative contribution of released Ag+ compared to intact particles to toxicity wasconcentration dependent. At lower total Ag concentration; a greater proportion of the toxicitycould be explained by dissolved Ag; whereas at higher total Ag concentration; the toxicityappeared to be dominated by particle specific effects.,Environmental pollution,2015,42
Quantitative determination of aluminum-27 by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry,PM Bertsch; RI Barnhisel; GW Thomas; WJ Layton; SL Smith,Quantitative determination of Al in aqueous solution not containing interfering substancescan be made by a variety of spectroscopic and potentiometric methods reliably and withrelative ease (1). Aluminum is; however; an element that is frequently analyzed in the studyof geologic materials; sediments; sludges; and plant and/or animal tissues and in manyindustrial processes. For most of these analytical applications; the presence of interferingsubstances is ubiquitous; often resulting in the introduction of tedious; error-inducing pre-treatments that can complicate the analysis. In addition; the reagents commonly used tosolubilize and/or extract Al in many of the aforementioned applications often cause matrixeffects which make the analysis even more cumbersome. Many of the methods utilized forthe quantitative deter-mination of soluble Al in different matrix solutions attempt to …,Analytical Chemistry,1986,42
Bioaccumulation of gold nanomaterials by Manduca sexta through dietary uptake of surface contaminated plant tissue,Jonathan D Judy; Jason M Unrine; William Rao; Paul M Bertsch,We investigated the potential for bioaccumulation of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) bytobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) caterpillars resulting from the ingestion of plant tissuesurface contaminated with ENMs. Caterpillars were fed tomato leaf tissue that had beensurface contaminated with 12 nm tannate coated Au ENMs. After dosing was complete; bulkAu concentrations in individual caterpillars were measured after 0; 1; 4; and 7 days ofelimination. Growth; mortality; and ingestion rate were monitored. This experiment revealed(1) no evidence that caterpillars were affected by ingestion of ENM contaminated planttissue;(2) low bioaccumulation factors (BAF= 0.16) compared to a previous study wherehornworm caterpillars were fed plants that had previously bioaccumulated Au ENMs (BAF=6.2–11.6);(3) inefficient elimination of accumulated Au ENMs not associated with …,Environmental science & technology,2012,41
Micro-XAS studies with sorbed plutonium on tuff,MC Duff; M Newville; DB Hunter; PM Bertsch; SR Sutton; IR Triay; DT Vaniman; P Eng; ML Rivers,The bonding environment of sorbed species at rock-water interfaces provides information ontheir mobility in natural systems. To investigate Pu sorption at a natural surface on amicroscopic scale; we studied the bonding environment of sorbed Pu on zeolitic tuff withmicro-XAS techniques. Using a focused 4 by 7 l. trn 2 beam; XAS spectra were taken atMnsmectite regions where high levels of sorbed Pu were found. The Pu did not sorb to Fe-rich regions. XANES spectra show the presence of Pu (VI); based on edge energy.Preliminary analyses of the micro-EXAFS spectra indicate the absence of a first shellsplitting of axial and equatorial Pu-O bonds--an environment unlike what is observed formost hexavalent actinides.,Journal of synchrotron radiation,1999,41
Application of Synchrotron X‐Ray Microbeam Spectroscopy to the Determination of Metal Distribution and Speciation in Biological Tissues,T Punshon; BP Jackson; A Lanzirotti; WA Hopkins; PM Bertsch; J Burger,Abstract Resolving the distribution and speciation of metal (loid) s within biologicalenvironmental samples is essential for understanding bioavailability; trophic transfer; andenvironmental risk. We used synchrotron x‐ray microspectroscopy to analyze a range ofsamples that had been exposed to metal (loid) contamination. Microprobe x‐rayfluorescence elemental mapping (µSXRF) of decomposing rhizosphere microcosmsconsisting of Ni‐and U‐contaminated soil planted with wheat (Triticum aestivum) showedthe change in Ni and U distribution over a 27‐day period; with a progressive movement of Uinto decaying tissue. µSXRF maps showed the micrometer‐scale distribution of Ca; Mn; Fe;Ni; and U in roots of willow (Salix nigra L.) growing on a former radiological settling pond;with U located outside of the epidermis and Ni inside the cortex.

Geochemical signature of contaminated sediment remobilization revealed by spatially resolved X-ray microanalysis of annual rings of Salix nigra,Tracy Punshon; Paul M Bertsch; Antonio Lanzirotti; Ken McLeod; Joanna Burger,An X-ray microprobe was used to determine the concentration and distribution of Ni; U; andother metals within annual rings of willows (Salix nigra L.) from a former de facto radiologicalsettling basin (Steed Pond; SP) and a depositional environment downstream (Tims Branch;TB) on the Savannah River Site (SRS). Geochemical and historical information about bothareas are well documented. Following spillway breaches at SP in 1984 and the early 1990s;TB is inundated with contaminated sediments during storms. Bulk elemental composition oftree cores was determined using ICP− OES. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF)analysis showed that the metal contents of SP and TB cores were an order of magnitudehigher than those from a reference site. TB cores were enriched with Ni in 1984 and 1991;corresponding with SP spillway breaches (containing 790 mg kg-1 Ni in 1991). Cores …,Environmental science & technology,2003,39
Bioavailability of uranium and nickel to vegetation in a contaminated riparian ecosystem,Tracy Punshon; Karen F Gaines; Paul M Bertsch; Joanna Burger,Abstract The lower portion of Tims Branch (TB); a second-order stream system on theSavannah River site (SC; USA); receives influx of mixed waste-contaminated sedimentsfrom Steed Pond; a former settling basin for target processing wastes for over three decades.The magnitude and distribution of U; Ni; and other metals and the potential for trophicmovement were studied to facilitate risk assessment and determine potential remedialaction. Total and sequential extraction of TB soils demonstrated contaminant heterogeneityboth spatially and between operationally defined fractions. Metal concentrations wereelevated within riparian zone soils in contrast to stream sediments; suggesting off-sitetransport. Leaf tissue from TB contained an order of magnitude more Ni than tissue fromreference sites. Leaves from streamside trees contained no U but elevated Ni up to 75.4 …,Environmental toxicology and chemistry,2003,38
Physicochemical Controls on Nonconservative Anion Migration in Coarse‐Textured Alluvial Sediments,JC Seaman; PM Bertsch; SF Korom; WP Miller,Abstract Three sandy subsurface materials and a sandy surface soil (Orangeburg Series)from the Upper Coastal Plain; were used to assess the influence of mineralogy and surfacechemistry on the determination of physical transport parameters using ionic tracers. The claymineralogy of the surface soil consisted primarily of kaolinite; hydroxy-interlayeredvermiculite; and gibbsite; while the dominant clay mineralogy of the subsurface materialsconsisted of kaolinite; goethite; and mica (illite). Repacked columns of the four differingstrata were leached with tritiated (∼ 200 pCi mL–1) Bromide solutions; either MgBr 2 or KBr;of varying ionic strengths (0.1–0.001 N). Pore-water velocities estimated by bulk density andmass flux were consistent with those estimated from tritium breakthrough. In contrast; Br–breakthrough differed drastically within the four materials and was altered by …,Groundwater,1996,38
In situ measurements of tetraphenylboron degradation kinetics on clay mineral surfaces by IR,Douglas B Hunter; Paul M Bertsch,An attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopic methodhas been developed to quantitatively measure; in situ; the surface-facilitated degradation oftetraphenylboron (TPB) in fully aquated clay pastes. Two pathways for degradation of TPBcould be studied both independently and simultaneously. Surface-facilitated oxidation ofTPB to diphenylboric acid (DPBA) at Lewis acid sites on clay mineral surfaces wasinvestigated on three members of the smectite family of clays. No degradation of TPBoccurred on hectorite; which contains no structural Fe. TPB degraded to DPBA onmontmorillonite and nontronite. A color change in nontronite indicated the production ofmixed valance Fe3+-O-Fe2+ states and clearly demonstrates the reduction of structural ironduring the course of the reaction. The degradation of TPB to triphenylboron (TriPB) at …,Environmental science & technology,1994,38
Sodium and chloride sorption by imogolite and allophanes,Chunming Su; James B Harsh; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract--The surface excesses of Na and CI on synthetic imogolite and allophanes withvarying A1/Si molar ratios in 0. I0 M and 0.01 M NaC1 solutions were determined using22Na and 36C1 as ion probes. The point of zero net charge (PZNC) values ranged from 4.1to 8.4; increasing with the Al/Si molar ratio for the allophanes; and was highest for imogolite(A1/Si= 2.01). The PZNC values were significantly lower than the point of zero charge (PZC)values previously determined by microelectrophoresis for the same material; indicating thatNa resided within the shear plane to a greater extent than C1. The PZNC values ofallophanes were lower than their PZSE values; indicating that permanent charge existed inallophanes; and increased as A1/Si decreased. Conversely; the PZNC of imogolite washigher than its point of zero salt effect (PZSE) determined by potentiometric titration …,Clays and Clay Minerals,1992,38
Mass loading of nickel and uranium on plant surfaces: application of laser ablation-ICP-MS,Tracy Punshon; Brian P Jackson; Paul M Bertsch; Joanna Burger,Transport of contaminated sediments from a former radiological settling pond results in thedeposition of U and Ni in the Lower Tims Branch (LTB)(Aiken; SC; USA). Uranium isunavailable for plant uptake; but elevated U and Ni concentrations associated with foliage ofunderstory plants suggested mass loading. Mass loading of contaminated soil onAndropogon elliottii Chapman (Poaceae) was investigated using laser ablation inductivelycoupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The technique allows for rapid quantitativeelemental depth profiling. Fresh washed and unwashed leaves (n= 5) from the contaminatedarea were compared with those from an uncontaminated area; analysing Ni and U at tenrandomly chosen points on each leaf. Nickel and U concentrations differed significantlybetween washed and unwashed leaves from LTB. Particles on unwashed leaves …,Journal of Environmental Monitoring,2004,37
Fluoro-aluminum complexes on model and soil exchangers,MA Anderson; LW Zelazny; PM Bertsch,Abstract A number of investigators have suggested that complexes may exist as discretespecies on the exchange phase and; thus; be important to a complete description ofexchange reactions. Little evidence establishing the presence of complexes on theexchange phase has hitherto been provided; however. Adsorption experiments in which µMF solutions were equilibrated with K-; Ca-; and Al-saturated cation-exchange resinsdemonstrated substantial F removal to the Al-saturated resin; with the adsorbed Fquantitatively recovered with a single wash with 1.0 M NH 4 Cl; whereas no F removal wasobserved when either K or Ca occupied the exchange sites. Removal of both Al and F fromAl-F solutions equilibrated with K-and Ca-saturated resins provided additional evidence foradsorption as fluoro-Al complexes.

Aluminium speciation in the presence of wheat root cell walls: a wet chemical study,A Masion; PM Bertsch,ABSTRACT Hydrolysis of Al 3+ was performed in the presence of isolated root cell wallsfrom a series of wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) known to have differential tolerance toAl contamination. Aluminium speciation was dependent on the cell wall concentration. Atlow cell wall concentrations; significant amounts of the very toxic Al 13 species were formed.At higher cell wall concentrations; formation of the tridecamer was hindered or completelyinhibited. The sensitive wheat cultivars displayed a higher affinity for aluminium than thetolerant cultivars. A possible Al tolerance mechanism based on cell wall permeability isdiscussed.,Plant; Cell & Environment,1997,35
Bioavailability; toxicity; and fate of manufactured nanomaterials in terrestrial ecosystems,Jonathan D Judy; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract The use of manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) in consumer products hasincreased steadily over the past decade. MNMs from these consumer products are beingdischarged into waste streams and subsequently entering terrestrial ecosystems; primarilyvia land application of biosolids. As a result; the concentrations of MNMs in terrestrialecosystems are increasing exponentially. Despite this; the majority of research investigatingthe bioavailability; fate; and effects of MNMs has focused on aquatic ecosystems. We reviewthe current state of the knowledge on the fate of MNMs in terrestrial ecosystems as well astheir effects on critical terrestrial ecoreceptors; including plants; bacteria; fungi; and soilinvertebrates. While research on the bioavailability; toxicity; and ultimate fate of MNMs interrestrial ecosystems is in its infancy; we conclude that there are critical knowledge gaps …,*,2014,33
Multitechnique investigation of the pH dependence of phosphate induced transformations of ZnO nanoparticles,Sewwandi Rathnayake; Jason M Unrine; Jonathan Judy; Anne-Frances Miller; William Rao; Paul M Bertsch,In order to properly evaluate the ecological and human health risks of ZnO manufacturednanomaterials (MNMs) released to the environment; it is critical to understand the likelytransformation products in various environments; such as soils; surface and ground waters;and wastewater treatment processes. To address this knowledge gap; we examined thetransformation of 30 nm ZnO MNMs in the presence of different concentrations of phosphateas a function of time and pH using a variety of orthogonal analytical techniques. The datareveal that ZnO MNMs react with phosphate at various concentrations and transform into twodistinct morphological/structural phases: a micrometer scale crystalline zinc phosphatephase (hopeite-like) and a nanoscale phase that likely consists of a ZnO core with anamorphous Zn3 (PO4) 2 shell. The P species composition was also pH dependent; with …,Environmental science & technology,2014,32
Evidence for biogenic pyromorphite formation by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,BP Jackson; PL Williams; A Lanzirotti; PM Bertsch,The determination of chemical speciation and spatial distribution is a prerequisite for amechanistic understanding of contaminant bioavailability and toxicity to an organism. Wehave employed synchrotron X-ray techniques to study Cu and Pb speciation and spatialdistribution in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Nematodes were exposed to eachmetal ion singly or simultaneously in solution for 24 h and were then rinsed thoroughly andpreserved in formalin for transportation to the National Synchrotron Light Source.Experiments were conducted at the microprobe beamline X26A employing a focused beamof approximately 10 μm in diameter.

Effect of pH on the toxicity of nickel and other divalent metals to Burkholderia cepacia PR1301,Joy D Van Nostrand; Andrew G Sowder; Paul M Bertsch; Pamela J Morris,Abstract Nickel (Ni) is a common cocontaminant at many waste sites where the soils andsediments often are acidic; thereby influencing metal availability. Growth of Burkholderiacepacia PR1 301 was not affected at 3.41 mM Ni at pH 5; but was inhibited by 73.2% at pH 6and inhibited completely at pH 7 compared to growth without Ni. This pH effect was notobserved in the Niresistant strains; Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 and 31A. Predicted Nispeciation did not explain the observed toxicity trends. Sorption of Ni to PR1 increased withincreasing pH (1.49; 1.12; and 3.88 mg Ni/g dry weight at pH 5; 6; and 7; respectively); butwas low at all three pH values; and most likely does not explain the observed pH effect.Growth inhibition of PR1 with increasing pH also was observed for other divalent cations;with growth observed at 4.24 mM Co; 2.22 mM Cd; and 3.82 mM Zn at pH 5 and 6; but …,Environmental toxicology and chemistry,2005,30
Distinguishing between surface and bulk dehydration–dehydroxylation reactions in synthetic goethites by high-resolution thermogravimetric analysis,G Robert; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract--Synthetic goethites studied by high-resolution thermogravimetry (HRTGA) showvariability in surface characteristics and structural stability as a function of aging conditions.Goethites were synthesized at either pH 6 or 11; at temperatures of 40 or 70~ and in thepresence or absence of sorbed Mn or Pb. Data from HRTGA analysis revealed at least fourdistinct weight-loss events near goethite dehydroxylation that relate to 1) three eventsinvolving the evolution of water associated with surface Fe-O functional groups and 2) bulkdehydroxylation of goethite during transformation to hematite. The relative mass of evolvedsurface and bulk structural water was related to the predominant particle morphology asdetermined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Differentiation of surface and bulkdecomposition reactions allowed the identification of bulk structural dehydroxylation …,Clays and Clay Minerals,1999,30
Comparison of two micro-analytical methods for detecting the spatial distribution of sorbed Pu on geologic materials,MC Duff; DB Hunter; IR Triay; PM Bertsch; J Kitten; DT Vaniman,Abstract Subsurface transport of groundwater contaminants is greatly influenced bychemical speciation; precipitation and sorption processes at the mineral–water interface.The retardation of contaminants is often greatest at boundaries between minerals and infractures and pore spaces. The investigation of the spatial distribution of sorbedcontaminants along these boundaries requires micro-analytical techniques. The sorption ofdissolved Pu (V) on a natural zeolitic tuff from Yucca Mountain (NV; USA) was examinedusing microautoradiography (MAR); X-ray diffraction (XRD); electron microprobe (EM)techniques; and synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (micro-SXRF).

Determination of site specific binding environments of surface sorbed cesium on clay minerals by Cs-EXAFS,KM Kemner; DB Hunter; PM Bertsch; JP Kirkland; WT Elam,Abstract Transport behavior of 137 Cs in the environment is regulated by surface sorptionreactions on clay mineral surfaces. To provide greater understanding of Cs transportprocesses; XAFS investigations of the local environments of 133 Cs sorbed to clay mineralswere conducted on Cs-Ca exchanged clay suspensions at the Cs LIII-edge. With decreasedsurface loadings of Cs; the Cs local environment exhibited increased long range orderbeyond 6 Å. Identification of Cs in expanded; semi-collapsed and collapsed interlayerenvironments was determined by correlating radial distances and Fourier transform peakamplitudes representing Cs-O and Cs-Al/Si in the octahedral and tetrahedral layers. Despitethe difficulties of analyzing XAFS data of adsorbed atoms in multiple environments; isolationof Cs in more specific sites by selective exchange should allow detailed analysis and …,Le Journal de Physique IV,1997,29
Aluminum speciation: methodology and applications,Paul M Bertsch,Abstract There exists ample evidence to suggest that chemical speciation regulates Almobility in the environment and its bioavailability and toxicity to many aquatic organisms andplant species. Several Al speciation methods are useful for providing estimates oforganically and inorganically complexed Al and adequately differentiating soluble fromcolloidal Al components. Additionally; comprehensive geochemical speciation models canbe used effectively to delimit the boundary conditions describing Al solubility and solutionspecies distribution. Neither of these approaches; however; can provide reliable informationregarding specific molecular distributions of Al. Little work has focused on Al speciestransformation in natural systems; yet such reactions may be the primary regulators of Almobility in natural systems; particularly during episodic events.,*,1990,29
Dynamics of aluminum complexation in multiple ligand systems,Michael A Anderson; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract The role of complexing ligands in attenuating aluminum (Al) toxicity and ininfluencing Al transport in soils and waters has been recognized for some time though thekinetics of such complexation reactions within complicated multi-ligand aqueous solutionshave not been previously evaluated. As a result; this study was undertaken to examine thedynamics of Al complexation in the presence of multiple ligands; specifically fluoride (F);oxalate (Ox); and citrate (Cit); utilizing an ion chromatographic speciation method. The rateconstant for formation (kf) of AlF 2+ under the experimental conditions used in thisinvestigation was found to be 12.3±1.1 M− 1 s− 1 in the absence of competing ligands; butwas observed to increase to 23.4±0.6 and 52.0±5.7 M− 1 s− 1 in the presence of Ox and Cit;respectively.

This study used synchrotron X-ray fluorescence(SXRF) compositional imaging to investigate the spatial distribution of Ni; Mn; Cu; Zn; and Fein annual rings of black willow (Salix nigra L.) collected from a metal-contaminated area; andused X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate Ni and Mn speciation in regions ofthe annual rings with elevated Ni concentrations. Annual rings were recollected in early2003 from an individual known to be enriched with Ni from previous studies. Compositionalimaging showed Ni and associated co-contaminants conservatively located in an annualring. When compared with a corresponding photomicrograph; SXRF compositional imagesshowed that metals were sharply constrained by the boundaries of the annual ring …,Journal of environmental quality,2005,27
Effects of silver sulfide nanomaterials on mycorrhizal colonization of tomato plants and soil microbial communities in biosolid-amended soil,Jonathan D Judy; Jason K Kirby; Courtney Creamer; Mike J McLaughlin; Cathy Fiebiger; Claire Wright; Timothy R Cavagnaro; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract We investigated effects of Ag 2 S engineered nanomaterials (ENMs);polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coated Ag ENMs (PVP-Ag); and Ag+ on arbuscular mycorrhizalfungi (AMF); their colonization of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum); and overall microbialcommunity structure in biosolids-amended soil. Concentration-dependent uptake wasmeasured in all treatments. Plants exposed to 100 mg kg− 1 PVP-Ag ENMs and 100 mg kg−1 Ag+ exhibited reduced biomass and greatly reduced mycorrhizal colonization. Bacteria;actinomycetes and fungi were inhibited by all treatment classes; with the largest reductionsmeasured in 100 mg kg− 1 PVP-Ag ENMs and 100 mg kg− 1 Ag+. Overall; Ag 2 S ENMswere less toxic to plants; less disruptive to plant-mycorrhizal symbiosis; and less inhibitory tothe soil microbial community than PVP-Ag ENMs or Ag+.

Elucidating fundamental mechanisms in soil and environmental chemistry: The role of advanced analytical; spectroscopic; and microscopic methods,Paul M Bertsch; Douglas B Hunter,Soil chemists have a rich history of using advanced analytical and spectroscopic methodsfor the characterization of soil constituents and for the examination of solute interactions withmineral surfaces and humic macromolecules. The term advanced is; of course; arbitrary aswell as relative. Whereas x-ray diffractometers and atomic absorption (AA) spectrometers(Table 5-1) were once thought of as sophisticated instrumentation that; at the time; providedimportant insights into the nature of soil constituents and soil solution components; they noware quite routine and standard. In fact; the sophisticated replacements of the AA; ie; the ICPand then ICP-MS spectrometer have become routine in most soil chemistry laboratories.Other analytical methods for chemical analyses; such as HPLC; IC; GC-GC-MS; and a hostof the so-called hyphenated techniques also have become common; yet powerful tools …,Future prospects for soil chemistry,1998,25
Trace element speciation in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from a fly ash settling basin by liquid chromatography-ICP-MS,B Jackson; P Shaw Allen; W Hopkins; P Bertsch,Abstract. Analytical techniques used to examine the chemical speciation of multiple traceelements are important for the investigation of biological systems. Size exclusionchromatography (SEC) coupled to ICP-MS was used to investigate the speciation of Se; As;Cu; Cd and Zn in tissue extracts from a largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) collectedfrom a coal fly ash basin and results were compared to a largemouth bass collected at areference site. Using a Biosil SEC column; with an effective separation range of 100–7 KDa;Cu; Zn and Cd were shown to be bound to metallothionein (MT) in the liver; gill and; to alesser extent; gonad tissue extract. In liver; muscle and gill of the ash basin bass; Se waspredominantly present as low molecular weight species. Only in the gonad extract was themajor fraction of Se associated with high molecular weight species. For the liver and gill …,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2002,23
Selective colloid mobilization through surface-charge manipulation,John C Seaman; Paul M Bertsch,The objective of the current study was to evaluate the use of aminehexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA) to enhance the mobilization andsubsequent transport of colloidal iron oxides by selectively blocking negatively charged siteswithin soil or aquifer sediments. Two materials were used in a series of column leachingstudies; a surface soil (Orangeburg Series) and an iron oxide-rich subsurface sediment(Tobacco Rd. Formation) both from Aiken; SC. For comparison; the same materials wereleached with sodium hexametaphosphate (Na− P) as a nonselective dispersing agent. As acationic surfactant; HDTMA is generally considered a strong flocculent for soils because ofits ability to shield the electrostatic repulsion on opposing negatively charged clays; whichwas observed in leaching experiments for the surface soil material.

Role of root cell walls in iron deficiency of soybean (Glycine max) and aluminium toxicity of wheat (Triticum aestivum),DL Allan; JR Shann; PM Bertsch,Abstract Cell walls of soybean and wheat roots were isolated by a non-destructivetechnique. Titration and adsorption experiments were performed to determine whethervarietal differences in tolerance to Al toxicity or Fe stress were related to differences insurface chemical properties of the cell walls. Results of the soybean experiments indicatesome differences in total binding capacity and Fe adsorption of the walls; but no differencesin amounts of Ca adsorbed. The wheat cultivars do show a correlation of increased titratableacidity and Al adsorption with higher tolerance; but no differences in their relativepreferences for Al or Ca.,*,1990,23
Distribution and chemical speciation of metals and metalloids in biota collected from contaminated environments by spatially resolved XRF; XANES; and EXAFS,DB Hunter; PM Bertsch; KM Kemner; SB Clark,Abstract Shell fragments from turtles collected in a wetland receiving outfall from coalcombustion ash basins were elevated in a number of contaminants; notably Se and As.Micro-XANES analysis of the epithelial layer on the shell and of the bone tissue revealedthat the keratin associated Se was present exclusively in seleno-amino acid coordinationenvironments; whereas Se in the bone tissue was a mixture of selenate and proteinaceousSe. Elemental distribution maps of hyperaccumulating plants generated by XRF reveal aheterogeneous distribution of Se and Cr; with Se being concentrated within the nuclei ofcells and Cr within discrete aggregates in the cytoplasm. Micro-XANES measurements takenon these same regions demonstrated the total loss of the Cr (VI) diagnostic pre-edge feature;indicating the complete reduction of the Cr (VI) to Cr (III) after uptake by the plants.,Le Journal de Physique IV,1997,22
Tracer migration in a radially divergent flow field: longitudinal dispersivity and anionic tracer retardation,JC Seaman; PM Bertsch; M Wilson; J Singer; F Majs; SA Aburime,Abstract Hydrodynamic dispersion; the combined effects of chemical diffusion anddifferences in solute path length and flow velocity; is an important factor controllingcontaminant migration in the subsurface environment. However; few comprehensive three-dimensional datasets exist for critically evaluating the impact of travel distance and siteheterogeneity on solute dispersion; and the conservative nature of several commonly usedgroundwater tracers is still in question. Therefore; we conducted a series of field-scaleexperiments using tritiated water (3 H 1 HO); bromide (Br−); and two fluorobenzoates (2; 4 Di-FBA; 2; 6 Di-FBA) as tracers in the water-table aquifer on the USDOE's Savannah River Site(SRS); located on the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain. For each experiment; tracer-freegroundwater was injected for approximately 24 h (56.7 L min− 1) to establish a steady …,Vadose Zone Journal,2007,21
Speciation and crystal chemistry of iron (III) chloride hydrolyzed in the presence of SiO4 ligands. 3. Semilocal scale structure of the aggregates,Armand Masion; Emmanuel Doelsch; Jérôme Rose; Stéphane Moustier; Jean Yves Bottero; Paul M Bertsch,A series of fresh and 7 day aged Fe− Si samples have been investigated at the semilocalscale by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). All the scattering curves are typical ofamorphous aggregates. The subunits of the precipitates could not be determined precisely.However; the trend derived from SAXS modeling indicates that almost all the Fe is withinsubunits smaller than 7.5 Å. The high fractal dimension (D f) values of the aggregatesranging from about 2.0 to 2.7 are attributed to the presence of Si ligands. However; the valueof D f as a function of pH and Si concentration varies linearly with the polymerization state ofiron.,Langmuir,2001,21

EXCHANGE AND APPARENT FIXATION OF LITHIUM IN SELECTED SOILS AND CLAY MINERALS.,Michael A Anderson; Paul M Bertsch; William P Miller,Abstract Relatively few data exist on the exchange reactions of Li in soils; rather; the bulk ofthe literature has dealt with simple ion exchange reactions on ideal exchangers; usuallysynthetic resins or pure clay minerals. Occasional observations of anomalous exchange ofLi have been reported; without any clear explanation. This study was initiated to morecarefully examine Li exchange in complex soil-solution and clay mineral systems. At the lowconcentrations employed; Li was sorbed preferentially by the southeastern US soilsevaluated over excesses of Na; K; Mg; and Ca in the adsorption solution phase. Traceamounts of Li were also sorbed to bentonite; kaolinite; and vermiculite clay samples in thepresence of 0.01 M Mg (NO3) 2 (5.82; 3.67; and 8.37 [mu] g g-1; respectively).

Goethite morphologies investigated via X-ray diffraction of oriented samples,Robert G Ford; Paul M Bertsch; John C Seaman,Synthetic and natural goethites display a variety of particle morphologies that are dependenton solution conditions during formation (Schwertmann 1990). Factors influencing goethitemorphology include pH and the presence or absence of specifically adsorbing ions insolution. Particle morphology can affect goethite dissolution behavior and will govern thedistribution of coordination sites available on the particle surface (Cornell et al. 1974;Colombo et al. 1994). Morphological information can be obtained via electron microscopicimaging (Schulze and Schwertmann 1984) or profile analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD)patterns (Koch et al. 1986). These methods are essential for determination of absoluteparticle dimensions; but they may require a significant time commitment or advanced level ofanalysis. In order to facilitate rapid preliminary comparison of synthetic goethite samples …,Clays and clay minerals,1997,19
The influence of topography on the nature of humic substances in soil organic matter at a site in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of South Carolina,Jeffrey M Novak; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract The effect of topography on the nature of humic substances; isolated as watersoluble organic carbon (WSOC); fulvic acid (FA); and humic acid (HA) was evaluated bycomparing relative proportion and chemical characteristics of these fractions in upland andbottomland Coastal Plain soils in South Carolina. The fractions were characterized byelemental analysis and 13 C cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magneticresonance (CPMAS NMR) spectroscopy. The majority of humic substances occur as humicacids; with bottomland soils having higher HA/FA ratios when compared to upland soils. Wefound no significant differences between upland and bottomland humic substances withrespect to yields of WSOC and fulvic acids; and in the C and N content of humic and fulvicacids.

XAFS studies of solution-phase complexes of cesium with dibenzo-18-crown-6 ethers,KM Kemner; DB Hunter; WT Elam; PM Bertsch,X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements have been made at the Cs LIIIabsorption edge on (1) 0.04 M acetonitrile solutions with respect to both CsBr and dibenzo-18-crown-6 ether (Cs− D18C6);(2) solids produced by drying the aforementioned Cs−D18C6 solution complex; and (3) crystalline CsBr; CsCl; and CsF powders that were usedas standards. XAFS measurements have also been made at the Br K absorption edge on thesame 0.04 M solution mentioned above. Due to the many difficulties associated withobtaining high-quality XAFS data on these systems; a custom-manufactured 5-mil-thick Scfoil was used in conjunction with a Soller slit assembly to improve the XAFS signal-to-noiseratio by almost a factor of 6.

Can the soil bacterium Cupriavidus necator sense ZnO nanomaterials and aqueous Zn2+ differentially?,Andrew L Neal; Nadine Kabengi; Arthur Grider; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract Synthetic metal oxide nanomaterials exert toxicity via two general mechanisms:Release of free ions at concentrations which exert toxic effects upon the target cell; orspecific surface-mediated physicochemical processes leading to the formation of hydroxylfree radicals and other reactive oxygen species which act to disrupt cell membranes andorganelles. From a regulatory standpoint this presents a potential problem since it is nottrivial to detect free metal ions in the presence of nanoparticles in biological or naturalmedia. This makes efforts to identify the route of uptake difficult. Although in vitro studies ofzinc oxide nanoparticles suggest that toxicity to the soil bacterium Cupriavidus necator isexerted in a similar manner to zinc acetate; we found no free Zn ion is associated withnanoparticle suspensions.

Hydrolysis of iron (II) chloride under anoxic conditions and influence of SiO4 ligands,Emmanuel Doelsch; Jérôme Rose; Armand Masion; Jean Yves Bottero; Daniel Nahon; Paul M Bertsch,This study describes the evolution of the nanoscale aqueous ferrous species as a function ofthe hydrolysis ratio and the influence of SiO4 ligands. Samples were synthesized underanoxic conditions and studied by EXAFS at the Fe K-edge. At low hydrolysis ratio (R=[OH-]added/[Fe (II)] initial= 0.1); the data are consistent with the formation of a planar Fe clusterwith five Fe (II) octahedra. Although Si neighbors cannot be detected unequivocally by Fe K-edge EXAFS; they affect the condensation of ferrous species by hindering the linkagesbetween Fe (II) octahedra. Indeed; at low hydrolysis ratio (R= 0.1) and Si/Fe= 1; only smallsized Fe clusters such as planar Fe (II) trimers are formed. Moreover; this study clearlyindicates that the polymerization of Fe (II) is more affected by the presence of SiO4 than inthe case of Fe (III).,Langmuir,2002,16

Degradation of tetraphenylboron at hydrated smectite surfaces studied by time resolved IR and X-ray absorption spectroscopies,DB Hunter; WP Gates; PM Bertsch; KM Kemner,The surface catalyzed redox reactivity of an organoboron probe molecule (tetraphenylboron;or TPB) with fully hydrated clay mineral surfaces is described wherein one or both of twodegradation pathways can occur. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared(ATR-IR) spectroscopy can quantitatively measure; in situ; both acid hydrolytic and oxidativedegradation of TPB as controlled by the exchange cation identity and the structuraloctahedral Fe content of the clay mineral. Oxidation of TPB at smectite surfaces is directlyattributable to octahedral Fe (III) in the clay structure. The concomitant reduction of Fe (III)during TPB oxidation can be analytically measured by X-ray absorption near edge structure(XANES) spectroscopy. The resultant distortion of the clay mineral structure during thereduction of structural Fe could be probed directly by extended X-ray absorption fine …,*,1998,15
The distribution of lithium in selected soils and surface waters of the southeastern USA,Michael A Anderson; Paul M Bertsch; William P Miller,Abstract The distribution of Li in the environment is not well documented although itsgeochemistry is thought to influence human health and agriculture. This study examined thedistribution of Li in the soils and surface waters of the southeastern USA; contrasting thePiedmont and Coastal Plain regions. Previous studies have been limited to total; and to alesser extent exchangeable; soil Li; usually at a single soil depth. This study evaluated morecarefully the distribution of Li between the soil solution; exchange; and solid phases; and itsdistribution within soil profiles. Total soil Li was found to correlate strongly with clay content;and ranged from 3.74 to 59.93 mg/kg. Exchangeable Li ranged from 0.1 to 21.8 μmol/kg soiland constituted an insignificant portion of the total exchangeable cations (< 0.09%) and totalLi present (< 1.1%) in the soils studied.

Aluminum‐27 nuclear magnetic resonance studies of ferron—hydroxo—polynuclear Al interactions,Paul M Bertsch; Michael A Anderson; W John Layton,Abstract The [AIO 4 AI 12 (OH) 24+ n (H 2 O) 12− n] 7− n+(AI 13) polynuclear species wasfound to interact with the commonly employed complexation agent ferron (8-hydroxy-7-iodo-5-quinoline-sulfonic acid) according to multiple reaction pathways. After the addition offerron to the partially neutralized Al solution; a large portion of the Al 13 polymer was nolonger observed by 27 Al NMR spectroscopy. The data indicated that the observed initialloss in Al 13 concentration resulted from precipitation with acetate (OAc) in the buffer; sincethe loss was not related to the ferron: Al molar ratio; because no corresponding increase inthe Al-ferron (δ= 3.4 ppm) resonance was observed and also because similar losses werenoted in solutions where only NaOAc was added. The Al 13 remaining in solution wascharacterized by a resonance with an identical chemical shift (δ= 62.5 ppm); yet having …,Magnetic Resonance in Chemistry,1989,14

Beryllium in selected southeastern soils,Michael A Anderson; Paul M Bertsch; William P Miller,Abstract Data regarding the distribution and lability of beryllium (Be) in soils is limited. Aninterest in the dynamics of Be in soil and aquatic systems prompted this evaluation of thedistribution of Be within selected soils of the Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographicregions of the southeastern USA. Water-soluble soil Be was below detection limits (< 0.2 µgL− 1) for all series and depths. Exchangeable Be ranged from< 0.1 to 2.2 µmol c kg− 1; wasconsistently higher in the Piedmont relative to the Coastal Plain soils; and comprised only0.0003 to 0.0083% of CEC. Total Be ranged from 0.3 to 30.5 mg kg− 1 and; as withexchangeable Be; was consistently higher in the Piedmont soils. No significant correlationbetween exchangeable and total Be was found (r= 0.28).

Electrophoretic mobility and particle size of clays using laser Doppler velocimetry-photon correlation spectroscopy,MA Anderson; PM Bertsch,Abstract Laser Doppler velocimetry-photon correlation spectroscopy (LDV-PCS) wasevaluated for the characterization of clay minerals. Electrophoretic mobility and particle sizeof pure and mixed suspensions of KGa-2 kaolinite and SWy-1 bentonite were determined asa function of pH; ionic strength; and suspension concentration ratios. Kaolinite mobilitychanged from significant positive values at low pH to negative values at high pH; consistentwith the variable-charge nature of kaolinite. Evidence for a contribution of positive chargeoriginating at bentonite edges at low pH (< 4) was also found. Ionic strength also affectedmobility of kaolinite and; at low pH; bentonite. Mixtures of kaolinite and bentonite at low pHyielded mobility distribution spectra intermediate to those of the component clays.

Changes in protein expression in Burkholderia vietnamiensis PR1301 at pH 5 and 7 with and without nickel,Joy D Van Nostrand; John M Arthur; Lisa E Kilpatrick; Benjamin A Neely; Paul M Bertsch; Pamela J Morris,Burkholderia vietnamiensis PR1301 (PR1) exhibits pH-dependent nickel (Ni) tolerance; withlower Ni toxicity observed at pH 5 than at pH 7. The Ni tolerance mechanism in PR1 iscurrently unknown; and traditional mechanisms of Ni resistance do not appear to be present.Therefore; 2D gel electrophoresis was used to examine changes in protein expression inPR1 with and without Ni (3.4 mM) at pH 5 and 7. Proteins with both a statistically significantand at least a twofold difference in expression level between conditions (pH; Ni) wereselected and identified using MALDI-TOF-MS or LC-MS. Results showed increasedexpression of proteins involved in cell shape and membrane composition at pH 5 comparedwith pH 7. Scanning electron microscopy indicated elongated cells at pH 5 and 6 comparedwith pH 7 in the absence of Ni. Fatty acid methyl ester analysis showed a statistically …,Microbiology,2008,7
Cesium-137 in floodplain sediments of the lower three runs creek on the DOE Savannah River site,PM Bertsch,Summary The legacy of nuclear weapons production has resulted in vast tracks of landcontaminated with fission products; mainly 137Cs; and at the US Department of Energy'sSavannah River Site (SRS) alone there is over 120 km2 of land contaminated with low-levels of 137Cs. Soils on the SRS are highly weathered and dominated by sand-sizedquartz grains with the clay fraction consisting primarily of kaolinite and crystalline and poorlycrystalline iron oxides (< 5%). Our results showed that the majority of 137Cs in the LowerThree Runs Creek floodplain were retained in the sand-sized fraction (> 52 mm) of the soil.Frayed edge site measurements were performed in order to probe the interaction between137Cs and the sand fraction; with the results indicating that the vast majority of the 137Cswas strongly retained and existed in the residual fraction. These results prompted …,Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry,2005,7

The hydrolytic products of aluminum and their biological significance,Paul M Bertsch,Abstract The relative distribution of Al between its various organic and inorganic complexesdictates its mobility in the environment; bioavailability; and toxicity. In recent years; there hasbeen significant progress made in understanding the differential bioavailability and toxicityof various chemical species of Al to plants and certain aquatic organisms. Far lessinformation concerning chemical speciation and differential uptake and transport of Al inhumans is available. Among the important inorganic complexes of interest are thehydrolyzed-Al species; particularly the nonequilibrium; metastable polynuclear complexes;which form readily; have a fairly wide stability range; and have been demonstrated toxic toplants and fish.

Reduction of nickel and uranium toxicity and enhanced trichloroethylene degradation to Burkholderia vietnamiensis PR1301 with hydroxyapatite amendment,Joy D Van Nostrand; Tatiana J Khijniak; Benjamin Neely; M Abdus Sattar; Andrew G Sowder; Gary Mills; Paul M Bertsch; Pamela J Morris,The use of hydroxyapatite (HA) to sequester metals at mixed waste sites may reduce metaltoxicity and facilitate microbial degradation of cocontaminant organics. The constitutivetrichloroethylene (TCE) degrader; Burkholderia vietnamiensis PR1301; grew at 34.1 and 1.7mM Ni at pH 5 and 7; respectively; with 0.01 g mL-1 HA compared to 17 and 0.85 mM Niwithout HA. PR1 grew at 4.2 mM U at pH 5 and 7 with 0.01 g mL-1 HA compared to 1.1 mMU without HA. A similar decrease in the toxicity of Ni and U in combination was observedwith HA. The ability of PR1 to degrade TCE at 0.85; 1.7; and 3.4 mM Ni and at 0.42 and 1.1mM U was examined. The presence of TCE resulted in a decreased tolerance of PR1 to Niand U; however; HA facilitated TCE degradation in the presence of Ni and U; effectivelydoubling the metal concentrations at which TCE degradation proceeded.

Phosphorus application to newly‐cleared coastal plain soils: Corn (Zea mays L.) response and soil test calibration data,MM Alley; PM Bertsch,Abstract Phosphorus applications ranging from 0 to 288 kg P/ha were broadcast alone andin combination with band treatments of 22 kg P/ha to two newlycleared Kempsville sandyloam (Typic Hapludults) soils for the purpose of measuring corn (Zea mays L.) yieldresponses and obtaining soil test calibration data. Four to 10‐fold corn grain yield increasesresulted from P additions. Broadcast applications of 96 kg P/ha in combination with bandtreatments of 22 kg P/ha from either diammonium phosphate or ammonium polyphosphatewere most efficient in increasing corn grain yields to 80% or more of maximum yield. Criticalextractable soil P values for the two sites of 31 and 42; 29 and 37; 18 and 19; and 47 and 43ppm were obtained for the Bray I; North Carolina (NC); Olsen; and Mehlich III soil testprocedures; respectively.

Symbiosis between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and Medicago truncatula is not significantly affected by silver and silver sulfide nanomaterials,Jonathan D Judy; Jason K Kirby; Mike J McLaughlin; David McNear Jr; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract Silver (Ag) engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are being released into wastestreams and are being discharged; largely as Ag 2 S aged-ENMs (a-ENMs); intoagroecosystems receiving biosolids amendments. Recent research has demonstrated thatbiosolids containing an environmentally relevant mixture of ZnO; TiO 2; and Ag ENMs andtheir transformation products; including Ag 2 S a-ENMs; disrupted the symbiosis betweennitrogen-fixing bacteria and legumes. However; this study was unable to unequivocallydetermine which ENM or combination of ENMs and a-ENMs was responsible for theobserved inhibition. Here; we examined further the effects of polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP)coated pristine Ag ENMs (PVP-Ag); Ag 2 S a-ENMs; and soluble Ag (as AgSO 4) at 1; 10;and 100 mg Ag kg− 1 on the symbiosis between the legume Medicago truncatula and the …,Environmental Pollution,2016,4

The potential role of sediment mineralogy in regulating aluminum concentrations in lakewater,Louis M McDonald; VP Evangelou; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract An understanding of the controls on aluminum solubility is essential because Al canreach toxic levels in waters that are affected by acidic precipitation or acid mine drainage.One factor which has received little attention is the role of in-lake sinks for Al. Wehypothesized that a chloritization mechanism was capable of removing large amounts of Alfrom solution when sediments contained 2: 1 minerals without well-developed Al-hydroxyinterlayers. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the potential role of lakesediments in regulating Al equilibria in the overlying waters. Water chemistry data; sedimentmineralogy and exchange phase composition; and Al sorption isotherms were used.Sediments with well developed Al-hydroxy interlayers sorbed less total Al; accumulatedmore Al on the readily reversible exchange phase; and had less pH buffering capacity …,Water; Air; and Soil Pollution,1998,4

Reference samples were prepared by reducing varyingamounts of structural Fe with Na-dithionite in an inert atmosphere. Analysis of the K α X-rayfluorescence near edge structure of reference and TPB-treated samples was accomplishedby comparing the ratios of edge crest intensities at energies corresponding to oxidized anddithionite-reduced samples following intensity normalization and energy calibration. About15% of nontronite structural Fe was reduced during the course of the reaction with TPB;whereas more than 50% of the structural Fe in montmorillonite was reduced.

EXAFS studies of CsBr-dibenzo-18-crown-6 ether solutions,KM Kemner; WT Elam; DB Hunter; PM Bertsch,Abstract An understanding of the structural binding properties of 137 Cs with ligands isparamount in designing chelates for waste treatment and isolation applications as well as forunderstanding sorption mechanisms to natural organic and inorganic colloids. We haveinvestigated Cs bonding environments in crown ether complexes by employing 133 Cs as aprobe for XAFS studies. Crown ethers represent a good first choice for XAFS structuralstudies because they have well-defined first and second shell environments. Additionally;the oxygen functional groups and bond distances can be easily manipulated by choice ofspecific crown ether molecules. The ability of XAFS to elucidate the structural environment ofCs within the crown ether complex will be useful in additional investigations in which the Csis selectively bound within a cage of electronegative oxygen donors including humic and …,Physica B: Condensed Matter,1995,4
Nanoparticles composed of Zn and ZnO inhibit Peronospora tabacina spore germination in vitro and P. tabacina infectivity on tobacco leaves,George Wagner; Victor Korenkov; Jonathan D Judy; Paul M Bertsch,Manufactured nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly being used for commercial purposesand certain NP types have been shown to have broad spectrum antibacterial activity. Incontrast; their activities against fungi and fungi-like oomycetes are less studied. Here; weexamined the potential of two types of commercially available Zn NPs (Zn NPs and ZnONPs) to inhibit spore germination and infectivity on tobacco leaves resulting from exposureto the fungi-like oomycete pathogen Peronospora tabacina (P. tabacina). Both types of NPs;as well as ZnCl 2 and bulk ZnO control treatments; inhibited spore germination compared toa blank control. ZnO ENMs were shown to be a much more powerful suppressor of sporegermination and infectivity than bulk ZnO. ZnO and Zn NPs significantly inhibited leafinfection at 8 and 10 mg· L− 1; respectively.

However; the overwhelmingmajority of these studies were conducted using hydroponic systems and the degree to whichthe addition of the biological and chemical components present in the soil mightfundamentally alter the potential of plant bioaccumulation of ENMs is unclear. Here; we usedtwo genotypes of Solanum lycopersicum (tomato); reduced mycorrhizal colonization (rmc); amutant which does not allow arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization; and itsprogenitor; 76R; to examine how colonization by AMF alters trends of gold ENMbioaccumulation from a natural soil.

Crystal Chemistry of Colloids Obtained by Hydrolysis of Fe (III) in the Presence of SiO 4 Ligands,Emmanuel Doelsch; Armand Masion; Jérôme Rose; William EE Stone; Jean Yves Bottero; Paul M Bertsch,Abstract The crystal chemistry of a number of Fe-Si systems (Si/Fe 0-4; pH 3-10) wasinvestigated by combining local scale spectroscopic methods (EXAFS; FTIR and NMR) andat the semi local scale (SAXS). The Fe clusters within the precipitates have two growthregimes depending on the Si/Fe ratio: the growth is three and two dimensional for Si/Fe fland Si/Fe≤ 1 respectively. The presence of Fe-O-Si bonds within the precipitated phaseshas been demonstrated. Their formation and relative proportion was found to be verydependent on the pH and Si concentration The size of silica domains within the precipitateswas shown to increase with increasing Si/Fe and/or decreasing pH. The high fractaldimension (D f) of the aggregates is attributed to the presence of the SiO 4 ligands; but theevolution of D f linearly depends on the polymerization state of iron.,MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive,2000,2

Reshaping land grant institutions to solve the global grand challenges of the 21st century,Paul Bertsch; Gary Pierzynski,Sustainable intensification is a term that is widely associ- ated with the need to roughly doubleproduction of food on existing agricultural lands by 2050. The US agriculture enterprise successfullydoubled yields of key crops between ~1960 and 2004 although the reality is that this incredibleachievement was possible by creating production systems that; in some cases; were notsustainable. Further; there is evidence that the rate of increase for yields is beginning todiminish. To double yields again; and to do so sustainably; will require the development anddeployment of a multi- tude of technologies.

Analysis of tracer migration in a diverging radial flow field,John C Seaman; František Majs; Julian Singer; Sunnie Aburime; SO Dennis; M Wilson; Paul M Bertsch,Hydrodynamic dispersion is an important factor controlling contaminant migration in thesubsurface environment. However; few comprehensive data sets exist for criticallyevaluating the impact of travel distance and site heterogeneity on solute dispersion.Therefore; a series of field-scale experiments using tritiated water (³H₂O); and bromide (Br-)as tracers was conducted on the US Department of Energy's Savannah River Site. For eachexperiment; tracer-free groundwater was injected at a fixed rate of 56.7 L min-1 to establisha forced radial gradient prior to the introduction of a tracer pulse. After the tracer pulse; theforced gradient was maintained throughout the experiment using non-labeled groundwater.Tracer migration was monitored using six sampling wells radially spaced at approximatedistances of 2.0-; 3.0-; and 4.5-m from the injection well.

Behavior of aluminum in complex solutions and its role in the exchange equilibria of soils,Paul Michael Bertsch,Abstract The general objectives were to study the reactions of Al in various complexsolutions employing a quantitative/sup 27/Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniqueand to further investigate the role of Al in the exchange equilibria of soils. Quantification ofmonomeric and polymeric Al species in aqueous solutions ranging in concentration from3.34 x 10/sup-4/to 3.34 x 10/sup-2/M and in OH/Al ratios (n) of 0.25 to 2.50 was made by theNMR technique. The results indicate that single polymeric Al form predominates and is firstdetectable at n= 0.50 for the 3.34 x 10/sup-2/M solution. The NMR spectroscopic evidencesuggest that the polymer is of the composition (AIO/sub 4/Al/sub 12/(OH)/sub 24/(H/sub2/O)/sub 12/)/sup 7+/. The mechanism for its formation is discussed.

Longitudinal Dispersivity in a Radial Diverging Flow Field,JC Seaman; M Wilson; PM Bertsch; SA Aburime,Abstract Hydrodynamic dispersion is an important factor controlling contaminant migration inthe subsurface environment. However; few comprehensive data sets exist for evaluating theimpact of travel distance and site heterogeneity on solute dispersion under non-uniform flowconditions. In addition; anionic tracers are often used to estimate physical transportparameters based on an erroneous assumption of conservative (ie; non-reactive) behavior.Therefore; a series of field experiments using tritiated water and several other commonlyused hydrologic tracers (Br; Cl; FBAs) were conducted in the water-table aquifer on the USDepartment of Energy's Savannah River Site (Aiken; SC) to evaluate solute transportprocesses in a diverging radial flow field.

Plutonium Oxidation and Subsequent Reduction by Mn (IV) Minerals,DANIEL KAPLAN,Synopsis. Aqueous plutonium (V) initially oxidizes and then eventually undergoes reductionwhen it comes in contact with Mn (IV) minerals. Abstract. Plutonium sorbed to rock tuff waspreferentially associated with manganese oxides. On tuff and synthetic pyrolusite (Mn IVO2); Pu (IV) or Pu (V) was initially oxidized; but over time Pu (IV) became the predominantoxidation state of sorbed Pu. Reduction of Pu (V/VI); even on non-oxidizing surfaces; isproposed to result from a lower Gibbs free energy of the hydrolyzed Pu (IV) surface speciesversus that of the Pu (V) or Pu (VI) surface species. This work suggests that despite initialoxidation of sorbed Pu by oxidizing surfaces to more soluble forms; the less mobile form ofPu; Pu (IV); will dominate Pu solid phase speciation during long term geologic storage.,*,2005,*

Lipid Composition of Soil Profiles and Water-Soluble Colloids Collected Within the Atlantic Coastal Plain in South Carolina,GL Mills; BE Herbert; PM Bertsch,Abstract The Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic unit of the eastern US represents a largeland area ranging from Mississippi to New Jersey. Soils widely distributed in thisphysiographic unit are characterized by highly weathered; deep coarse textured vadosezones; located on mature landscapes. Furthermore; soil types common in the upper coastalplain (UCP) region have strong similarities to soils widely distributed in watersheds of theAmazon Basin. Thus; an understanding of the biogeochemical dynamics controlling carbonfluxes in these systems has significant implications for natural resource management oflarge land areas and for the potential to enhance C-sequestration in the terrestrialbiosphere.

Indeed; 17x 1020 moles of Fe are stored inthe sedimentary rocks and 3.5 x1012 moles/year are transformed from oxidized to reducedreservoirs and vice versa. Most of the studies dealing with the Fe (II)-Fe (III) system concernthe composition and the structure of final products from the oxidation of a Fe (II) solution. Inacidic conditions (pH< 5); the Fe oxides precipitate directly from Fe (III) aqueous species (Fe(II) ions oxidizes before precipitation) and the final products can be ferrihydrite; goethite orhematite depending on temperature and the nature of ferrous salt used. 2 In alkalinesolutions (pH> 8); the end product is magnetite. 2 For slightly acidic to slightly alkalineconditions; intermediate Fe (II)-Fe (III) hydroxysalts phases are formed. 2 The effects of a …,*,2003,*

However; there has been limited success in translatinginformation generated at the molecular level to explain observations made at larger scales.While several explanations for this conundrum can be advanced; a prominent one is thatmuch of our knowledge concerning the surface chemistry of clay and oxide minerals isderived from experiments conducted on model monomineralic phases.

Physicochemical and mineralogical controls on colloid migration and deposition within sediments on the Savannah River Site,RN Strom; BB Looney; JC Seaman; PM Bertsch; WP Miller,Reinjection of treated groundwater from the F-Area and H-Area seepage basins mayproduce conditions where stable colloidal suspensions are generated that lead topermeability reductions in receiving zones in the aquifer or to anomalously highconcentrations of particulates in monitoring well samples. In order to determine theconditions under which stable colloids are generated in Savannah River Site (SRS)sediments; the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL) and the University of Georgia(UGA) undertook bulk dispersibility and column experiments. The sediments used arerepresentative of the natural matrix materials in the upper most aquifers in the generalseparations area.

Pyrene Sorption by Water-Soluble Organic Carbon,Paul M Bertsch,El Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil solution has the potential to facilitate thetransport of nonionic organic contaminants (NOC). The interactions between pyrene andultrafiltration fractions of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC); humic acid; and fulvic acidwere quantified using fluorescence-quenching spectroscopy. Pyrene partition coefficients tothe smaller WSOC fractions varied between 4.1 X 1.0" and 6.8 X 10 L kg"; while partitioncoefficients for the largest fraction of WSOC; humic acid; and fulvic acid were 1.5 X 10 “; 1.7X 10; and 1.1 X 10* L kg"; respectively. These results demonstrate that the use of the same“K; value to describe NOC partitioning to both immobile organic matter and soil solutionDOM will overestimate the ability of DOM to facilitate the transport of NOC. Conversely;pyrene partitioning data to the largest WSOC fraction suggest that the presence of …,*,1993,*
Probing inorganic and organic sorbate-sorbent environments by multi-NMR spectroscopy,PM Bertsch; DB Hunter; BE Herbert,The ability to develop adequate models for predicting the fate of inorganic and organiccontaminants in both surface and subsurface environments is highly coupled to an accuratedescription of the partitioning of these constituents between the solid and solution phasesand ultimately on the capability to provide specific molecular level information on speciesdistribution in both of these phases. The authors' investigations have utilized high resolutionmulti-NMR spectroscopy to investigate the chemical speciation of cations on mineral andbiological surfaces and to provide information on the dynamics of sorbed cations andnonionic organic contaminants (NOC) associated with a variety of mode exchanger; mineral;and humic phases (NOM).

Effect of Fly Ash and Gypsum on Dispersion; Hydraulic Conductivity; and Contaminant Leaching in Soil Columns,John C Seaman; Che Fauziah Ishak; William P Miller; Paul M Bertsch,Fly ash (FA) is the major coal combustion by-product produced in electric power generation;nearly 3.5 million tons of this waste product are produced in Georgia annually. To date; nopower plants in Georgia have installed stack scrubbers for the removal of sulfur dioxide gasduring coal combustion; however; beginning in 1995; the electrical utilities will have toreduce sulfur emissions under the Clean Air Act (Reisch; 1992). This will lead to theproduction of flue-gas desulfurization gypsum (FGJXi.) as an additional by-product. landapplication has been proposed as a disposal option for fly ash and flue-gas gypsum;however; there is some concern that heavy metals found in the ash may pollute surfacewater or leach into groundwater. High levels of soluble boron found in the fly ash have beenshown to cause toxicity problems for plants under greenhouse conditions (Ciravolo and …,*,1993,*

THE BEHAVIOR OF ALUMINUM IN COMPLEX SOLUTIONS AND ITS ROLE IN THE EXCHANGE EQUILIBRIA OF SOILS (VERMICULITE; DIMER; POLYMERIZATIO...,PM Bertsch,Quantification of monomeric and polymeric Al species in aqueous solutions ranging in concentrationfrom 3.34 x 10(''-4) to 3.34 x 10(''-2) M and in OH/Al ratios (n) of 0.25 to 2.50 was made by theNMR technique. The results indicate that single polymeric Al form predominates and is first detectableat n = 0.50 for the 3.34 x 10(''-2) M solution. The NMR spectroscopic evidence suggest that thepolymer is of the composition {AlO(;4)AL(;12)(OH)(;24)(H(;2)O)(;12)}(''7+). This polymeric speciespreviously proposed for solutions of high Al concentration also seems predominant in solutionscontaining several orders of magnitude less Al.

Speciation and availability of silver from Agand Ag2S nanoparticle-amended biosolids and a biosolid/soils mixture,Brian Carl Reinsch; Nadine Kabengi; Mathew Woodson; Stacey Turcotte; Paul Bertsch; Gregory V Lowry,Abstract The potential for silver nanoparticle (Ag NP) releases to the environment isincreasing. Most of these Ag NPs will be to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) andultimately will reside in the biosolids leaving the plant; half of which will be deposited tocroplands. In order to compare the speciation behavior of Ag NPs and Ag+ both sources ofAg were exposed for 2 weeks to biosolid and analyzed for Ag-speciation using synchrotronextended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) linear combination fitting (LCF). In themajority of cases the Ag NPs were completely sulfidized; any unsulfidized fraction was theoriginal Ag. In contrast; added Ag-ion was only partially transformed to Ag2S; reacted withacetate and sulfhydryl groups; and a portion remained as unreacted Ag+.

Elemental Distribution of U and Ni in Contaminated Riparian Sediments,A Sowder; P Bertsch,Results: Spatially resolved SXRF mapping data generally corroborated previous results fromindirect and bulk methods such as chemical extractions [1]. However; the ability to probeelemental compositions at the m scale also demonstrated substantial heterogeneouspartitioning of U and Ni in sediments. Similar results were reported previously for lowerresolution mapping of intact soil particles with 50 to 300 m beam sizes [2; 3]. Frequently; Uand Ni associations were mutually exclusive; ie; U was associated with organic matter whileNi was associated with non-organic Fe-rich regions (Fig. 1). In other cases; U and Nihotspots were spatially correlated. Observations of intact organic structures not enriched inanthropogenic metals; presumably root cross-sections; suggest a strong link between thedegradation of organic matter and contaminant partitioning.

Crystal Chemistry of Trace Metals in Cementitious Hydraulic Binders,J Rose; I Moulin; A Masion; JY Bottero; PM Bertsch,The use of hazardous waste as fuel for the kilns in the cement industry leads to anenrichment of the clinkers (cement) in heavy metals whose concentration can reach 2000ppm [1]. To assess the environmental risks linked to the use of these materials; it is essentialto study of the physico-chemical stability of these metals in hydrated hydraulic binders.Hydration of cements lead to the dissolution of the primary cement phases followed by theprecipitation of new hydrated phases. Thus; the metals trapped in the anhydrous phases arealso dissolved. Standard leaching tests performed on cements manufactured withhazardous waste have revealed low levels of soluble metals; however; the total metalrelease was dependent on cement and secondary hydrate phase composition [1].
