Progressive skyline computation in database systems,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Greg Fu; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract The skyline of a d-dimensional dataset contains the points that are not dominatedby any other point on all dimensions. Skyline computation has recently receivedconsiderable attention in the database community; especially for progressive methods thatcan quickly return the initial results without reading the entire database. All the existingalgorithms; however; have some serious shortcomings which limit their applicability inpractice. In this article we develop branch-and-bound skyline (BBS); an algorithm based onnearest-neighbor search; which is I/O optimal; that is; it performs a single access only tothose nodes that may contain skyline points. BBS is simple to implement and supports alltypes of progressive processing (eg; user preferences; arbitrary dimensionality; etc).Furthermore; we propose several interesting variations of skyline computation; and show …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2005,865
An optimal and progressive algorithm for skyline queries,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Greg Fu; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract The skyline of a set of d-dimensional points contains the points that are notdominated by any other point on all dimensions. Skyline computation has recently receivedconsiderable attention in the database community; especially for progressive (or online)algorithms that can quickly return the first skyline points without having to read the entiredata file. Currently; the most efficient algorithm is NN (< u> n</u> earest< u> n</u>eighbors); which applies the divide-and-conquer framework on datasets indexed by R-trees.Although NN has some desirable features (such as high speed for returning the initialskyline points; applicability to arbitrary data distributions and dimensions); it also presentsseveral inherent disadvantages (need for duplicate elimination if d> 2; multiple accesses ofthe same node; large space overhead).

Query processing in spatial network databases,Dimitris Papadias; Jun Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,Abstract Despite the importance of spatial networks in real-life applications; most of thespatial database literature focuses on Euclidean spaces. In this paper we propose anarchitecture that integrates network and Euclidean information; capturing pragmaticconstraints. Based on this architecture; we develop a Euclidean restriction and a networkexpansion framework that take advantage of location and connectivity to efficiently prune thesearch space. These frameworks are successfully applied to the most popular spatialqueries; namely nearest neighbors; range search; closest pairs and e-distance joins; in thecontext of spatial network databases.,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,771
Preventing location-based identity inference in anonymous spatial queries,Panos Kalnis; Gabriel Ghinita; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias,The increasing trend of embedding positioning capabilities (for example; GPS) in mobiledevices facilitates the widespread use of location-based services. For such applications tosucceed; privacy and confidentiality are essential. Existing privacy-enhancing techniquesrely on encryption to safeguard communication channels; and on pseudonyms to protectuser identities. Nevertheless; the query contents may disclose the physical location of theuser. In this paper; we present a framework for preventing location-based identity inferenceof users who issue spatial queries to location-based services. We propose transformationsbased on the well-established K-anonymity concept to compute exact answers for range andnearest neighbor search; without revealing the query source. Our methods optimize theentire process of anonymizing the requests and processing the transformed spatial …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2007,745
The TPR*-tree: an optimized spatio-temporal access method for predictive queries,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Jimeng Sun,Abstract A predictive spatio-temporal query retrieves the set of moving objects that willintersect a query window during a future time interval. Currently; the only access method forprocessing such queries in practice is the TPR-tree. In this paper we first perform an analysisto determine the factors that affect the performance of predictive queries and show thatseveral of these factors are not considered by the TPR-tree; which uses theinsertion/deletion algorithms of the R*-tree designed for static data. Motivated by this; wepropose a new index structure called the TPR*-tree; which takes into account the uniquefeatures of dynamic objects through a set of improved construction algorithms. In addition;we provide cost models that determine the optimal performance achievable by any data-partition spatio-temporal access method. Using experimental comparison; we illustrate …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,713
Continuous nearest neighbor search,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Qiongmao Shen,A continuous nearest neighbor query retrieves the nearest neighbor (NN) of every point on aline segment. The result contains a set of tuples; such that point is the NN of all points in thecorresponding interval. Existing methods for continuous nearest neighbor search are basedon the repetitive application of simple NN algorithms; which incurs significant overhead. Inthis paper; one proposes techniques that solve the problem by performing a single query forthe whole input segment. As a result; the cost; depending on the query and datasetcharacteristics; may drop by orders of magnitude. CNN queries are essential for severalapplications such as location-based commerce and geographic informationsystems.Continuous Nearest Neighbor Search Yufei Tao Dimitris Papadias Qiongmao ShenDepartment of Computer Science Hong Kong University of Science and Technology …,*,2002,577
Efficient OLAP operations in spatial data warehouses,Dimitris Papadias; Panos Kalnis; Jun Zhang; Yufei Tao,Abstract Spatial databases store information about the position of individual objects inspace. In many applications however; such as traffic supervision or mobile communications;only summarized data; like the number of cars in an area or phones serviced by a cell; isrequired. Although this information can be obtained from transactional spatial databases; itscomputation is expensive; rendering online processing inapplicable. Driven by the non-spatial paradigm; spatial data warehouses can be constructed to accelerate spatial OLAPoperations. In this paper we consider the star-schema and we focus on the spatialdimensions. Unlike the non-spatial case; the groupings and the hierarchies can benumerous and unknown at design time; therefore the well-known materialization techniquesare not directly applicable. In order to address this problem; we construct an ad-hoc …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,437
The mv3r-tree: A spatio-temporal access method for timestamp and interval queries,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Among the various types of spatio-temporal queries; the most common ones involve windowqueries in time. In particular; timestamp (or timeslice) queries retrieve all the objects thatintersect a window at a specific timestamp. Interval queries include multiple consecutivetimestamps. Although several indexes have been developed for either type; currently theredoes not exist a structure that can efficiently process both query types. This is a significantproblem due to the fundamental importance of these queries in any spatio-temporal systemthat deals with historical information retrieval. Our paper addresses the problem byproposing the MV3R-tree; a structure that utilizes the concepts of multi-version B-trees and3D R-trees. Extensive experimentation proves that MV3R-trees compare favorably withspecialized structures aimed at timestamp and interval window queries; both in terms of …,Proceedings of Very Large Data Bases Conference (VLDB); 11-14 September; Rome,2001,436
Computer supported argumentation and collaborative decision making: the HERMES system,Nikos Karacapilidis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Collaborative decision making problems can be addressed through argumentativediscourse and collaboration among the users involved. Consensus is achieved through theprocess of collaboratively considering alternative understandings of the problem; competinginterests; priorities and constraints. The application of formal modeling and analysis tools tosolve the related processes is impossible before the problem can be articulated in a conciseand agreed upon manner. This paper describes H ermes; a system that augments classicaldecision making approaches by supporting argumentative discourse among decisionmakers. It is fully implemented in Java and runs on the Web; thus providing relativelyinexpensive access to a broad public. Using an illustrative example; we present theargumentation elements; discourse acts and reasoning mechanisms involved in H ermes …,Information systems,2001,386
Conceptual partitioning: An efficient method for continuous nearest neighbor monitoring,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias; Marios Hadjieleftheriou,Abstract Given a set of objects P and a query point q; ak nearest neighbor (k-NN) queryretrieves the k objects in P that lie closest to q. Even though the problem is well-studied forstatic datasets; the traditional methods do not extend to highly dynamic environments wheremultiple continuous queries require real-time results; and both objects and queries receivefrequent location updates. In this paper we propose conceptual partitioning (CPM); acomprehensive technique for the efficient monitoring of continuous NN queries. CPMachieves low running time by handling location updates only from objects that fall in thevicinity of some query (and ignoring the rest). It can be used with multiple; static or movingqueries; and it does not make any assumptions about the object moving patterns. Weanalyze the performance of CPM and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,377
Location-based spatial queries,Jun Zhang; Manli Zhu; Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract In this paper we propose an approach that enables mobile clients to determine thevalidity of previous queries based on their current locations. In order to make this possible;the server returns in addition to the query result; a validity region around the client's locationwithin which the result remains the same. We focus on two of the most common spatial querytypes; namely nearest neighbor and window queries; define the validity region in each caseand propose the corresponding query processing algorithms. In addition; we provideanalytical models for estimating the expected size of the validity region. Our techniques cansignificantly reduce the number of queries issued to the server; while introducing minimalcomputational and network overhead compared to traditional spatial queries.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,353
Topological relations in the world of minimum bounding rectangles: A study with R-trees,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis; Yannis Theodoridis; Max J Egenhofer,Abstract Recent developments in spatial relations have led to their use in numerousapplications involving spatial databases. This paper is concerned with the retrieval oftopological relations in Minimum Bounding Rectangle-based data structures. We study thetopological information that Minimum Bounding Rectangles convey about the actual objectsthey enclose; using the concept of projections. Then we apply the results to R-trees and theirvariations; R+-trees and R*-trees in order to minimise disk accesses for queries involvingtopological relations. We also investigate queries that involve complex spatial conditions inthe form of disjunctions and conjunctions and we discuss possible extensions.,ACM Sigmod Record,1995,331
Time-parameterized queries in spatio-temporal databases,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Time-parameterized queries (TP queries for short) retrieve (i) the actual result at thetime that the query is issued;(ii) the validity period of the result given the current motion of thequery and the database objects; and (iii) the change that causes the expiration of the result.Due to the highly dynamic nature of several spatio-temporal applications; TP queries areimportant both as standalone methods; as well as building blocks of more complexoperations. However; little work has been done towards their efficient processing. In thispaper; we propose a general framework that covers time-parameterized variations of themost common spatial queries; namely window queries; k-nearest neighbors and spatialjoins. In particular; each of these TP queries is reduced to nearest neighbor search wherethe distance functions are defined according to the query type. This reduction allows the …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,320
Reverse kNN search in arbitrary dimensionality,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Xiang Lian,Abstract Given a point q; a reverse k nearest neighbor (RkNN) query retrieves all the datapoints that have q as one of their k nearest neighbors. Existing methods for processing suchqueries have at least one of the following deficiencies:(i) they do not support arbitrary valuesof k (ii) they cannot deal efficiently with database updates;(iii) they are applicable only to 2Ddata (but not to higher dimensionality); and (iv) they retrieve only approximate results.Motivated by these shortcomings; we develop algorithms for exact processing of RkNN witharbitrary values of k on dynamic multidimensional datasets. Our methods utilize aconventional data-partitioning index on the dataset and do not require any pre-computation.In addition to their flexibility; we experimentally verify that the proposed algorithmsoutperform the existing ones even in their restricted focus.,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,318
Prediction and indexing of moving objects with unknown motion patterns,Yufei Tao; Christos Faloutsos; Dimitris Papadias; Bin Liu,Abstract Existing methods for peediction spatio-temporal databases assume that objectsmove according to linear functions. This severely limits their applicability; since in practicemovement is more complex; and individual objects may follow drastically diffferent motionpatterns. In order to overcome these problems; we first introduce a general framework formonitoring and indexing moving objects; where (i) each boject computes individually thefunction that accurately captures its movement and (ii) a server indexes the object locationsat a coarse level and processes queries using a filter-refinement mechanism. Our secondcontribution is a novel recursive motion function that supports a broad class of non-linearmotion patterns. The function does not presume any a-priori movement but can postulate theparticular motion of each object by examining its locations at recent timestamps. Finally …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,293
Continuous nearest neighbor monitoring in road networks,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Man Lung Yiu; Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Recent research has focused on continuous monitoring of nearest neighbors (NN)in highly dynamic scenarios; where the queries and the data objects move frequently andarbitrarily. All existing methods; however; assume the Euclidean distance metric. In thispaper we study k-NN monitoring in road networks; where the distance between a query anda data object is determined by the length of the shortest path connecting them. We proposetwo methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns; as well asfluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing onlyupdates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the sharedexecution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular; it groups together thequeries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network; and …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,291
Maintaining sliding window skylines on data streams,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,The skyline of a multidimensional data set contains the" best" tuples according to anypreference function that is monotonic on each dimension. Although skyline computation hasreceived considerable attention in conventional databases; the existing algorithms areinapplicable to stream applications because 1) they assume static data that are stored in thedisk (rather than continuously arriving/expiring); 2) they focus on" one-time" execution thatreturns a single skyline (in contrast to constantly tracking skyline changes); and 3) they aimat reducing the I/O overhead (as opposed to minimizing the CPU-cost and main-memoryconsumption). This paper studies skyline computation in stream environments; where queryprocessing takes into account only a" sliding window" covering the most recent tuples. Wepropose algorithms that continuously monitor the incoming data and maintain the skyline …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,278
Group nearest neighbor queries,Dimitris Papadias; Qiongmao Shen; Yufei Tao; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Given two sets of points P and Q; a group nearest neighbor (GNN) query retrieves the point(s) of P with the smallest sum of distances to all points in Q. Consider; for instance; threeusers at locations q/sub 1/q/sub 2/and q/sub 3/that want to find a meeting point (eg; arestaurant); the corresponding query returns the data point p that minimizes the sum ofEuclidean distances| pq/sub i/| for 1/spl les/i/spl les/3. Assuming that Q fits in memory and Pis indexed by an R-tree; we propose several algorithms for finding the group nearestneighbors efficiently. As a second step; we extend our techniques for situations where Qcannot fit in memory; covering both indexed and nonindexed query points. An experimentalevaluation identifies the best alternative based on the data and query properties.,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,258
Aggregate nearest neighbor queries in spatial databases,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Chun Kit Hui,Abstract Given two spatial datasets P (eg; facilities) and Q (queries); an aggregate nearestneighbor (ANN) query retrieves the point (s) of P with the smallest aggregate distance (s) topoints in Q. Assuming; for example; n users at locations q 1;… qn; an ANN query outputs thefacility p∈ P that minimizes the sum of distances &verbar; pq i &verbar; for 1≤ i≤ n that theusers have to travel in order to meet there. Similarly; another ANN query may report the pointp∈ P that minimizes the maximum distance that any user has to travel; or the minimumdistance from some user to his/her closest facility. If Q fits in memory and P is indexed by anR-tree; we develop algorithms for aggregate nearest neighbors that capture several versionsof the problem; including weighted queries and incremental reporting of results. Then; weanalyze their performance and propose cost models for query optimization. Finally; we …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2005,249
Continuous monitoring of top-k queries over sliding windows,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Given a dataset P and a preference function f; a top-k query retrieves the k tuples inP with the highest scores according to f. Even though the problem is well-studied inconventional databases; the existing methods are inapplicable to highly dynamicenvironments involving numerous long-running queries. This paper studies continuousmonitoring of top-k queries over a fixed-size window W of the most recent data. The windowsize can be expressed either in terms of the number of active tuples or time units. Wepropose a general methodology for top-k monitoring that restricts processing to the sub-domains of the workspace that influence the result of some query. To cope with high streamrates and provide fast answers in an on-line fashion; the data in W reside in main memory.The valid records are indexed by a grid structure; which also maintains book-keeping …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,246
Spatial relations; minimum bounding rectangles; and spatial data structures,Dimitris Papadias; Yannis Theodoridis,Spatial relations are important in numerous domains; such as Spatial Query Languages;Image and Multimedia Databases; Reasoning and Geographic Applications. This paper isconcerned with the retrieval of topological and direction relations using spatial datastructures based on Minimum Bounding Rectangles. We describe topological and directionrelations between region objects and we study the spatial information that MinimumBounding Rectangles convey about the actual objects they enclose. Then we apply theresults in R-trees and their variations; R-trees and R*-trees; in order to minimize the numberof disk accesses for queries involving topological and direction relations. We alsoinvestigate queries that express complex conditions in the form of disjunctions andconjunctions; and discuss possible extensions.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,1997,245
Aggregate nearest neighbor queries in road networks,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Aggregate nearest neighbor queries return the object that minimizes an aggregate distancefunction with respect to a set of query points. Consider; for example; several users at specificlocations (query points) that want to find the restaurant (data point); which leads to theminimum sum of distances that they have to travel in order to meet. We study the processingof such queries for the case where the position and accessibility of spatial objects areconstrained by spatial (eg; road) networks. We consider alternative aggregate functions andtechniques that utilize Euclidean distance bounds; spatial access methods; and/or networkdistance materialization structures. Our algorithms are experimentally evaluated withsynthetic and real data. The results show that their relative performance depends on theproblem characteristics.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,213
Topological inference,Michelangelo Grigni; Dimitris Papadias; Christos Papadimitriou,Abstract Geographical database systems deal with certain basic topological relations suchas\A overlaps B" and\B contains C" between simply connected regions in the plane. It is ofgreat interest to make sound inferences from elementary statements of this form. Thisproblem has been identi ed extensively in the recent literature; but very limited progress hasbeen made towards addressing the considerable technical di culties involved. In this paperwe study the computational problems involved in developing such an inference system. Wepoint out that the problem has two distinct components that interact in rather complex ways:relational consistency; and planarity. We develop polynomial-time algorithms for severalimportant special cases; and prove almost all the others to be NP-hard.,IJCAI (1),1995,212
Qualitative representation of spatial knowledge in two-dimensional space,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract Various relation-based systems; concerned with the qualitative representation andprocessing of spatial knowledge; have been developed in numerous application domains. Inthis article; we identify the common concepts underlying qualitative spatial knowledgerepresentation; we compare the representational properties of the different systems; and weoutline the computational tasks involved in relation-based spatial information processing.We also describe symbolic spatial indexes; relation-based structures that combine severalideas in spatial knowledge representation. A symbolic spatial index is an array thatpreserves only a set of spatial relations among distinct objects in an image; called themodeling space; the index array discards information; such as shape and size of objects;and irrelevant spatial relations.

Computational imagery,Janice Glasgow; Dimitri Papadias,Abstract After many years of neglect; the topic of mental imagery has recently emerged as anactive area of research and debate in the cognitive science community. This article proposesa concept of computational imagery; which has potential applications to problems whosesolutions by humans involve the use of mental imagery. Computational imagery can bedefined as the ability to represent; retrieve; and reason about spatial and visual informationnot explicitly stored in long-term memory.,Cognitive science,1992,196
Indexing spatio-temporal data warehouses,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; P Kanis; Jun Zhang,Spatio-temporal databases store information about the positions of individual objects overtime. In many applications; however; such as traffic supervision or mobile communicationsystems; only summarized data; like the average number of cars in an area for a specificperiod; or the number of phones serviced by a cell each day; is required. Although thisinformation can be obtained from operational databases; its computation is expensive;rendering online processing inapplicable. A vital solution is the construction of a spatio-temporal data warehouse. In this paper; we describe a framework for supporting OLAPoperations over spatio-temporal data. We argue that the spatial and temporal dimensionsshould be modeled as a combined dimension on the data cube and we present datastructures which integrate spatio-temporal indexing with pre-aggregation.

Spatio-temporal aggregation using sketches,Yufei Tao; George Kollios; Jeffrey Considine; Feifei Li; Dimitris Papadias,Several spatio-temporal applications require the retrieval of summarized information aboutmoving objects that lie in a query region during a query interval (eg; the number of mobileusers covered by a cell; traffic volume in a district; etc.). Existing solutions have the distinctcounting problem: if an object remains in the query region for several timestamps during thequery interval; it will be counted multiple times in the result. We solve this problem byintegrating spatio-temporal indexes with sketches; traditionally used for approximate queryprocessing. The proposed techniques can also be applied to reduce the space requirementsof conventional spatio-temporal data and to mine spatio-temporal association rules.,Data Engineering; 2004.

An adaptive peer-to-peer network for distributed caching of olap results,Panos Kalnis; Wee Siong Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Dimitris Papadias; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are becoming increasingly popular as they enableusers to exchange digital information by participating in complex networks. Such systemsare inexpensive; easy to use; highly scalable and do not require central administration.Despite their advantages; however; limited work has been done on employing databasesystems on top of P2P networks. Here we propose the PeerOLAP architecture for supportingOn-Line Analytical Processing queries. A large number low-end clients; each containing acache with the most useful results; are connected through an arbitrary P2P network. If aquery cannot be answered locally (ie by using the cache contents of the computer where it isissued); it is propagated through the network until a peer that has cached the answer isfound. An answer may also be constructed by partial results from many peers. Thus …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,162
Reverse nearest neighbors in large graphs,Man Lung Yiu; Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,A reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query returns the data objects that have a query point astheir nearest neighbor (NN). Although such queries have been studied quite extensively inEuclidean spaces; there is no previous work in the context of large graphs. In this paper; weprovide a fundamental lemma; which can be used to prune the search space whiletraversing the graph in search for RNN. Based on it; we develop two RNN methods; aneager algorithm that attempts to prune network nodes as soon as they are visited and a lazytechnique that prunes the search space when a data point is discovered. We study retrievalof an arbitrary number k of reverse nearest neighbors; investigate the benefits ofmaterialization; cover several query types; and deal with cases where the queries and thedata objects reside on nodes or edges of the graph. The proposed techniques are …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,157
Nearest neighbor search with strong location privacy,Stavros Papadopoulos; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The tremendous growth of the Internet has significantly reduced the cost ofobtaining and sharing information about individuals; raising many concerns about userprivacy. Spatial queries pose an additional threat to privacy because the location of a querymay be sufficient to reveal sensitive information about the querier. In this paper we focus onk nearest neighbor (kNN) queries and define the notion of strong location privacy; whichrenders a query indistinguishable from any location in the data space. We argue thatprevious work fails to support this property for arbitrary kNN search. Towards this end; weintroduce methods that offer strong location privacy; by integrating private informationretrieval (PIR) functionality. Specifically; we employ secure hardware-aided PIR; which hasbeen proven very efficient and is currently considered as a practical mechanism for PIR …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,152
Querying about the past; the present; and the future in spatio-temporal databases,Jimeng Sun; Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Bin Liu,Moving objects (eg; vehicles in road networks) continuously generate large amounts ofspatio-temporal information in the form of data streams. Efficient management of suchstreams is a challenging goal due to the highly dynamic nature of the data and the need forfast; online computations. We present a novel approach for approximate query processingabout the present; past; or the future in spatio-temporal databases. In particular; we firstpropose an incrementally updateable; multidimensional histogram for present-time queries.Second; we develop a general architecture for maintaining and querying historical data.Third; we implement a stochastic approach for predicting the results of queries that refer tothe future. Finally; we experimentally prove the effectiveness and efficiency of ourtechniques using a realistic simulation.,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,137
A threshold-based algorithm for continuous monitoring of k nearest neighbors,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias; Spiridon Bakiras; Yufei Tao,Assume a set of moving objects and a central server that monitors their positions over time;while processing continuous nearest neighbor queries from geographically distributedclients. In order to always report up-to-date results; the server could constantly obtain themost recent position of all objects. However; this naive solution requires the transmission ofa large number of rapid data streams corresponding to location updates. Intuitively; currentinformation is necessary only for objects that may influence some query result (ie; they maybe included in the nearest neighbor set of some client). Motivated by this observation; wepresent a threshold-based algorithm for the continuous monitoring of nearest neighbors thatminimizes the communication overhead between the server and the data objects. Theproposed method can be used with multiple; static; or moving queries; for any distance …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,121
An efficient cost model for optimization of nearest neighbor search in low and medium dimensional spaces,Yufei Tao; Jun Zhang; Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis,Existing models for nearest neighbor search in multidimensional spaces are not appropriatefor query optimization because they either lead to erroneous estimation or involve complexequations that are expensive to evaluate in real-time. This article proposes an alternativemethod that captures the performance of nearest neighbor queries using approximation. Foruniform data; our model involves closed formulae that are very efficient to compute andaccurate for up to 10 dimensions. Further; the proposed equations can be applied onnonuniform data with the aid of histograms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the modelby using it to solve several optimization problems related to nearest neighbor search.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,119
Efficient historical R-trees,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,The historical R-tree (HR-tree) is a spatio-temporal access method aimed at the retrieval ofwindow queries in the past. The concept behind the method is to keep an R-tree for eachtimestamp in history; but to allow consecutive trees to share branches when the underlyingobjects do not change. New branches are only created to accommodate updates from theprevious timestamp. Although existing implementations of HR-trees process timestamp(window) queries very efficiently; they are hardly applicable in practice due to excessivespace requirements and poor interval query performance. This paper addresses theseproblems by proposing the HR+-tree; which occupies a small fraction of the space requiredfor the corresponding HR-tree (for typical conditions about 20%); while improving intervalquery performance several times. Our claims are supported by extensive experimental …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2001. SSDBM 2001. Proceedings. Thirteenth International Conference on,2001,119
All-nearest-neighbors queries in spatial databases,Jun Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao,Given two sets A and B of multidimensional objects; the all-nearest-neighbors (ANN) queryretrieves for each object in A its nearest neighbor in B. Although this operation is common inseveral applications; it has not received much attention in the database literature. In thispaper we study alternative methods for processing ANN queries depending on whether Aand B are indexed: Our algorithms are evaluated through extensive experimentation usingsynthetic and real datasets. The performance studies show that they are an order ofmagnitude faster than a previous approach based on closest-pairs query processing.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004.

Processing and optimization of multiway spatial joins using R-trees,Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Yannis Theodoridis,ABSTRACT One of the most important types of query processing in spatial databases andgeographic information systems is the spatial join; an operation that selects; from tworelations; all object pairs satisfying some spatial predicate. A multiway join combines dataoriginated from more than two relations. Although several techniques have been proposedfor pairwise spatial joins; only limited work has focused on multiway spatial join processing.This paper solves multiway spatial joins by applying systematic search algorithms thatexploit R-trees to efficiently guide search; without building temporary indexes ormaterializing intermediate results. In addition to general methodologies; we propose costmodels and an optimization algorithm; and evaluate them through extensiveexperimentation.,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,115
Authenticated join processing in outsourced databases,Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias; Stavros Papadopoulos; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Database outsourcing requires that a query server constructs a proof of resultcorrectness; which can be verified by the client using the data owner's signature. Previousauthentication techniques deal with range queries on a single relation using anauthenticated data structure (ADS). On the other hand; authenticated join processing isinherently more complex than ranges since only the base relations (but not theircombination) are signed by the owner. In this paper; we present three novel join algorithmsdepending on the ADS availability:(i) Authenticated Indexed Sort Merge Join (AISM); whichutilizes a single ADS on the join attribute;(ii) Authenticated Index Merge Join (AIM) thatrequires an ADS (on the join attribute) for both relations; and (iii) Authenticated Sort MergeJoin (ASM); which does not rely on any ADS.

Spatial queries in dynamic environments,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Conventional spatial queries are usually meaningless in dynamic environmentssince their results may be invalidated as soon as the query or data objects move. In thispaper we formulate two novel query types; time parameterized and continuous queries;applicable in such environments. A time-parameterized query retrieves the actual result atthe time when the query is issued; the expiry time of the result given the current motion of thequery and database objects; and the change that causes the expiration. A continuous queryretrieves tuples of the form< result; interval>; where each result is accompanied by a futureinterval; during which it is valid. We study time-parameterized and continuous versions of themost common spatial queries (ie; window queries; nearest neighbors; spatial joins);proposing efficient processing algorithms and accurate cost models.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2003,107
Evaluation of iceberg distance joins,Yutao Shou; Nikos Mamoulis; Huiping Cao; Dimitris Papadias; David W Cheung,Abstract The iceberg distance join returns object pairs within some distance from each other;provided that the first object appears at least a number of times in the result; eg;“find hotelswhich are within 1km to at least 10 restaurants”. The output of this query is the subset of thecorresponding distance join (eg;“find hotels which are within 1km to some restaurant”) thatsatisfies the additional cardinality constraint. Therefore; it could be processed by using aconventional spatial join algorithm and then filtering-out the non-qualifying pairs. Thisapproach; however; is expensive; especially when the cardinality constraint is highlyselective. In this paper; we propose output-sensitive algorithms that prune the search spaceby integrating the cardinality with the distance constraint. We deal with cases of indexed/non-indexed datasets and evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques with …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,105
View selection using randomized search,Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract An important issue in data warehouse development is the selection of a set of viewsto materialize in order to accelerate On-line analytical processing queries; given certainspace and maintenance time constraints. Existing methods provide good results but theirhigh execution cost limits their applicability for large problems. In this paper; we explore theapplication of randomized; local search algorithms to the view selection problem. Theefficiency of the proposed techniques is evaluated using synthetic datasets; which cover awide range of data and query distributions. The results show that randomized searchmethods provide near-optimal solutions in limited time; being robust to data and query skew.Furthermore; they can be easily adapted for various versions of the problem; including thesimultaneous existence of size and time constraints; and view selection in dynamic …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2002,105
RPJ: Producing fast join results on streams through rate-based optimization,Yufei Tao; Man Lung Yiu; Dimitris Papadias; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract We consider the problem of" progressively" joining relations whose records arecontinuously retrieved from remote sources through an unstable network that may incurtemporary failures. The objectives are to (i) start reporting the first output tuples as soon aspossible (before the participating relations are completely received); and (ii) produce theremaining results at a fast rate. We develop a new algorithm RPJ (< u> R</u> ate-based< u>P</u> rogressive< u> J</u> oin) based on solid theoretical analysis. RPJ maximizes theoutput rate by optimizing its execution according to the characteristics of the join relations(eg; data distribution; tuple arrival pattern; etc.). Extensive experiments prove that ourtechnique delivers results significantly faster than the previous methods.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,102
Selectivity estimation for predictive spatio-temporal queries,Yufei Tao; Jimeng Sun; Dimitris Papadias,We propose a cost model for selectivity estimation of predictive spatio-temporal windowqueries. Initially; we focus on uniform data proposing formulae that capture both points andrectangles; and any type of object/query mobility combination (ie; dynamic objects; dynamicqueries or both). Then; we apply the model to nonuniform datasets by introducing spatio-temporal histograms; which in addition to the spatial; also consider the velocity distributionsduring partitioning. The advantages of our techniques are (i) high accuracy (1-2 orders ofmagnitude lower error than previous techniques);(ii) ability to handle all query types; and (iii)efficient handling of updates.,Data Engineering; 2003.

Multiway spatial joins,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Due to the evolution of Geographical Information Systems; large collections ofspatial data having various thematic contents are currently available. As a result; the interestof users is not limited to simple spatial selections and joins; but complex query types thatimplicate numerous spatial inputs become more common. Although several algorithms havebeen proposed for computing the result of pairwise spatial joins; limited work exists onprocessing and optimization of multiway spatial joins. In this article; we review pairwisespatial join algorithms and show how they can be combined for multiple inputs. In addition;we explore the application of synchronous traversal (ST); a methodology that processessynchronously all inputs without producing intermediate results. Then; we integrate the twoapproaches in an engine that includes ST and pairwise algorithms; using dynamic …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2001,101
Query by document,Yin Yang; Nilesh Bansal; Wisam Dakka; Panagiotis Ipeirotis; Nick Koudas; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract We are experiencing an unprecedented increase of content contributed by users inforums such as blogs; social networking sites and microblogging services. Such abundanceof content complements content on web sites and traditional media forums such as newspapers; news and financial streams; and so on. Given such plethora of information there is apressing need to cross reference information across textual services. For example;commonly we read a news item and we wonder if there are any blogs reporting relatedcontent or vice versa. In this paper; we present techniques to automate the process of crossreferencing online information content. We introduce methodologies to extract phrases froma given" query document" to be used as queries to search interfaces with the goal to retrievecontent related to the query document. In particular; we consider two techniques to extract …,Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2009,98
Algorithms for querying by spatial structure,Dimitrios Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; B Delis,Structural queries constitute a special form of content-based retrieval where the userspecifies a set of spatial constraints among query variables and asks for all configurations ofactual objects that (totally or partially) match these constraints. Processing such queries canbe thought of as a general form of spatial joins; ie; instead of pairs; the result consists of n-tuples of objects; where n is the number of query variables. In this paper we describe aflexible framework which permits the representation of configurations in different resolutionlevels and supports the automatic derivation of similarity measures. We subsequentlypropose three algorithms for structural query processing which integrate constraintsatisfaction with spatial indexing (R-trees). For each algorithm we apply several optimizationtechniques and experimentally evaluate performance using real data.,Proceedings of Very Large Data Bases Conference (VLDB); New York,1998,93
Spatial outsourcing for location-based services,Yin Yang; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,The embedding of positioning capabilities in mobile devices and the emergence of location-based applications have created novel opportunities for utilizing several types of multi-dimensional data through spatial outsourcing. In this setting; a data owner (DO) delegates itsdata management tasks to a location-based service (LBS) that processes queries originatingfrom several clients/subscribers. Because the LBS is not the real owner of the data; it mustprove (to each client) the correctness of query output using an authenticated structuresigned by the DO. Currently there is very narrow selection of multi-dimensionalauthenticated structures; among which the VR-tree is the best choice. Our first contribution isthe MR-tree; a novel index suitable for spatial outsourcing. We show; analytically andexperimentally; that the MR-tree outperforms the VR-tree; usually by orders of magnitude …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,92
Integration of spatial join algorithms for processing multiple inputs,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Several techniques that compute the join between two spatial datasets have beenproposed during the last decade. Among these methods; some consider existing indices forthe joined inputs; while others treat datasets with no index; providing solutions for the casewhere at least one input comes as an intermediate result of another database operator. Inthis paper we analyze previous work on spatial joins and propose a novel algorithm; calledslot index spatial join (SISJ); that efficiently computes the spatial join between two inputs;only one of which is indexed by an R-tree. Going one step further; we show how SISJ andother spatial join algorithms can be implemented as operators in a database environmentthat joins more than two spatial datasets. We study the differences between relational andspatial multiway joins; and propose a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,92
Keyword search on relational data streams,Alexander Markowetz; Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Increasing monitoring of transactions; environmental parameters; homelandsecurity; RFID chips and interactions of online users rapidly establishes new data sourcesand application scenarios. In this paper; we propose keyword search on relational datastreams (S-KWS) as an effective way for querying in such intricate and dynamicenvironments. Compared to conventional query methods; S-KWS has several benefits. First;it allows search for combinations of interesting terms without a-priori knowledge of the datastreams in which they appear. Second; it hides the schema from the user and allows it tochange; without the need for query re-writing. Finally; keyword queries are easy to express.Our contributions are summarized as follows.(i) We provide formal semantics for S-KWS;addressing the temporal validity and order of results.(ii) We propose an efficient algorithm …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,91
Authenticated indexing for outsourced spatial databases,Yin Yang; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,Abstract In spatial database outsourcing; a data owner delegates its data management tasksto a location-based service (LBS); which indexes the data with an authenticated datastructure (ADS). The LBS receives queries (ranges; nearest neighbors) originating fromseveral clients/subscribers. Each query initiates the computation of a verification object (VO)based on the ADS. The VO is returned to the client that can verify the result correctnessusing the public key of the owner. Our first contribution is the MR-tree; a space-efficient ADSthat supports fast query processing and verification. Our second contribution is the MR*-tree;a modified version of the MR-tree; which significantly reduces the VO size through a novelembedding technique. Finally; whereas most ADSs must be constructed and maintained bythe owner; we outsource the MR-and MR*-tree construction and maintenance to the LBS …,The VLDB Journal,2009,90
Range aggregate processing in spatial databases,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,A range aggregate query returns summarized information about the points falling in a hyper-rectangle (eg; the total number of these points instead of their concrete ids). This paperstudies spatial indexes that solve such queries efficiently and proposes the aggregate Point-tree (aP-tree); which achieves logarithmic cost to the data set cardinality (independently ofthe query size) for two-dimensional data. The aP-tree requires only small modifications tothe popular multiversion structural framework and; thus; can be implemented and appliedeasily in practice. We also present models that accurately predict the space consumptionand query cost of the aP-tree and are therefore suitable for query optimization. Extensiveexperiments confirm that the proposed methods are efficient and practical.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,89
Agnostic diagnosis: Discovering silent failures in wireless sensor networks,Xin Miao; Kebin Liu; Yuan He; Dimitris Papadias; Qiang Ma; Yunhao Liu,In wireless sensor networks (WSNs); diagnosis is a crucial and challenging task due to thedistributed nature and stringent resources. Most previous approaches are supervised;relying on a-priori knowledge of network faults. Our experience with GreenOrbs; a long-termlarge-scale WSN system; reveals the need of diagnosis in an agnostic manner. Specifically;in addition to predefined faults (ie; with known types and symptoms); silent failures that areunknown beforehand; account for a large fraction of network performance degradation.Currently; there is no effective solution for silent failures because they are often diverse andhighly system-related. In this paper; we propose Agnostic Diagnosis (AD); an onlinelightweight failure detection approach. AD is motivated by the fact that the system metrics(eg; radio-on time; number of packets transmitted) of sensor nodes usually exhibit certain …,IEEE transactions on wireless communications,2013,88
Continuous authentication on relational streams,Stavros Papadopoulos; Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract According to the database outsourcing model; a data owner delegates databasefunctionality to a third-party service provider; which answers queries received from clients.Authenticated query processing enables the clients to verify the correctness of query results.Despite the abundance of methods for authenticated processing in conventional databases;there is limited work on outsourced data streams. Stream environments pose newchallenges such as the need for fast structure updating; support for continuous queryprocessing and authentication; and provision for temporal completeness. Specifically; inaddition to the correctness of individual results; the client must be able to verify that there areno missing results in between data updates. This paper presents a comprehensive set ofmethods covering relational streams. We first describe REF; a technique that achieves …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,88
Processing fuzzy spatial queries: a configuration similarity approach,Dimitris Papadias,Increasing interest in configuration similarity is currently developing in the context of DigitalLibraries; Spatial Databases and Geographical Information Systems. The correspondingqueries retrieve all database configurations that match an input description (eg'find allconfigurations where an object x0 is about 5 km north-east of another x1; which; in turn; isinside object x2'). This paper introduces a framework for configuration similarity that takesinto account all major types of spatial constraints (topology; direction; and distance). Wedefine appropriate fuzzy similarity measures for each type of constraint to provide flexibilityand allow the system to capture real-life needs. Then we apply preprocessing techniques toexplicate constraints in the query; and present algorithms that effectively solve the problem.Extensive experimental results demonstrate the applicability of our approach to images …,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,1999,85
Multidimensional reverse kNN search,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Xiang Lian; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Given a multidimensional point q; a reverse k nearest neighbor (R k NN) queryretrieves all the data points that have q as one of their k nearest neighbors. Existing methodsfor processing such queries have at least one of the following deficiencies: they (i) do notsupport arbitrary values of k;(ii) cannot deal efficiently with database updates;(iii) areapplicable only to 2D data but not to higher dimensionality; and (iv) retrieve onlyapproximate results. Motivated by these shortcomings; we develop algorithms for exact R kNN processing with arbitrary values of k on dynamic; multidimensional datasets. Ourmethods utilize a conventional data-partitioning index on the dataset and do not require anypre-computation. As a second step; we extend the proposed techniques to continuous R kNN search; which returns the R k NN results for every point on a line segment. We …,The VLDB Journal,2007,83
Hierarchical reasoning about direction relations,Dimitris Papadias; Max J Egenhofer; Jayant Sharma,ABSTRACT Spatial reasoning is an important area of geographic information systems (GIS)and spatial databases research. This paper deals with reasoning about direction relations(cast; northeast) in spatial hierarchies. We assume a database that stores the directionrelations between objects in the same geographic region and propose algorithms for theinference of relations between objects in different regions. We present two types ofinference: the first one uses the relations of ancestor regions in the hierarchy; while thesecond one is based on compositions of spatial relations and path consistency. For bothtypes we provide inference rules; illustrate examples; and study the computationalcomplexity. Although we use a specilic set of relations for demonstration purposes; thealgorithms are npplicablc to any set of direction relations provided with appropriate …,Proceedings of the 4th ACM international workshop on Advances in geographic information systems,1996,82
A pictorial query-by-example language,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract A symbolic image is an array representing a set of objects and a set of spatialrelations among them. Symbolic images and related structures have been used in a numberof applications including image databases; spatial reasoning; path planning and spatialpattern matching. In this paper we describe a pictorial query-by-example (PQBE) languageaimed at the retrieval of direction relations from symbolic images. As in the case of verbalquery-by-example; PQBE generalizes from the example given by the user; but; instead ofhaving queries in the form of skeleton tables showing the relation scheme; we have skeletonimages which are themselves symbolic images. PQBE provides an intuitive interface for usein geographic applications because of its close correspondence with the structure of space.,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,1995,82
The retrieval of direction relations using R-trees,Dimitris Papadias; Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis,Abstract R-trees and related structures; like R+-trees and R*-trees; have been used toanswer queries involving topological information about objects represented by theirminimum bounding rectangles (MBRs). This paper describes how the R-tree method can beused for the storage and retrieval of direction relations. Direction relations deal with order inspace; as for instance; left; above; north; southeast etc. In this paper we define directionrelations between points and extend the definitions to relations between objects. Then wepresent our tests regarding the retrieval of direction relations between objects using R-treesand discuss the representational properties of MBR approximations with respect todirections in 2D space.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1994,78
Historical spatio-temporal aggregation,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Spatio-temporal databases store information about the positions of individualobjects over time. However; in many applications such as traffic supervision or mobilecommunication systems; only summarized data; like the number of cars in an area for aspecific period; or phone-calls serviced by a cell each day; is required. Although thisinformation can be obtained from operational databases; its computation is expensive;rendering online processing inapplicable. In this paper; we present specialized methods;which integrate spatio-temporal indexing with pre-aggregation. The methods supportdynamic spatio-temporal dimensions for the efficient processing of historical aggregatequeries without a priori knowledge of grouping hierarchies. The superiority of the proposedtechniques over existing methods is demonstrated through a comprehensive probabilistic …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2005,76
A graph method for keyword-based selection of the top-k databases,Quang Hieu Vu; Beng Chin Ooi; Dimitris Papadias; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract While database management systems offer a comprehensive solution to datastorage; they require deep knowledge of the schema; as well as the data manipulationlanguage; in order to perform effective retrieval. Since these requirements pose a problem tolay or occasional users; several methods incorporate keyword search (KS) into relationaldatabases. However; most of the existing techniques focus on querying a single DBMS. Onthe other hand; the proliferation of distributed databases in several conventional andemerging applications necessitates the support for keyword-based data sharing andquerying over multiple DMBSs. In order to avoid the high cost of searching in numerous;potentially irrelevant; databases in such systems; we propose G-KS; a novel method forselecting the top-K candidates based on their potential to contain results for a given query …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,74
Branch-and-bound processing of ranked queries,Yufei Tao; Vagelis Hristidis; Dimitris Papadias; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Despite the importance of ranked queries in numerous applications involving multi-criteria decision making; they are not efficiently supported by traditional database systems.In this paper; we propose a simple yet powerful technique for processing such queriesbased on multi-dimensional access methods and branch-and-bound search. Theadvantages of the proposed methodology are:(i) it is space efficient; requiring only a singleindex on the given relation (storing each tuple at most once);(ii) it achieves significant (ie;orders of magnitude) performance gains with respect to the current state-of-the-art;(iii) it canefficiently handle data updates; and (iv) it is applicable to other important variations ofranked search (including the support for non-monotone preference functions); at no extraspace overhead. We confirm the superiority of the proposed methods with a detailed …,Information Systems,2007,72
Analysis of predictive spatio-temporal queries,Yufei Tao; Jimeng Sun; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Given a set of objects S; a spatio-temporal window query q retrieves the objects of Sthat will intersect the window during the (future) interval q T. A nearest neighbor query qretrieves the objects of S closest to q during q T. Given a threshold d; a spatio-temporal joinretrieves the pairs of objects from two datasets that will come within distance d from eachother during q T. In this article; we present probabilistic cost models that estimate theselectivity of spatio-temporal window queries and joins; and the expected distance betweena query and its nearest neighbor (s). Our models capture any query/object mobilitycombination (moving queries; moving objects or both) and any data type (points andrectangles) in arbitrary dimensionality. In addition; we develop specialized spatio-temporalhistograms; which take into account both location and velocity information; and can be …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2003,71
Algorithms for hierarchical spatial reasoning,Dimitris Papadias; Max J Egenhofer,Abstract In several applications; there is the need to reason about spatial relations usingmultiple local frames of reference that are hierarchically organized. This paper focuses onhierarchical reasoning about direction relations; a special class of spatial relations thatdescribe order in space (eg; north or northeast). We assume a spatial database of pointsand regions. Points belong to regions; which may recursively be parts of larger regions. Thedirection relations between points in the same region are explicitly represented (and notcalculated from coordinates). Inference mechanisms are applied to extract direction relationsbetween points located in different regions and to detect inconsistencies. We study twocomplementary types of inference. The first one derives the direction relation between pointsfrom the relations of their ancestor regions. The second type derives the relation through …,GeoInformatica,1997,70
An overview of data replication on the Internet,Thanasis Loukopoulos; Ishfaq Ahmad; Dimitris Papadias,The proliferation of the Internet is leading to high expectation of the fast turnaround time.Clients abandoning their connections due to excessive downloading delays translatesdirectly to profit losses. Hence; minimizing the latency perceived by end-users has becomethe primary performance objective compared to more traditional issues; such as serverutilization. The two promising techniques for improving Internet responsiveness are cachingand replication. In this paper we present an overview of recent research in replication. Webegin by arguing on the important role of replication in decreasing client perceived responsetime and illustrate the main topics that affect its successful deployment on the Internet. Weanalyze and characterize existing research; providing taxonomies and classificationswhenever possible.

Continuous monitoring of spatial queries in wireless broadcast environments,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Wireless data broadcast is a promising technique for information dissemination thatleverages the computational capabilities of the mobile devices in order to enhance thescalability of the system. Under this environment; the data are continuously broadcast by theserver; interleaved with some indexing information for query processing. Clients may thentune in the broadcast channel and process their queries locally without contacting theserver. Previous work on spatial query processing for wireless broadcast systems has onlyconsidered snapshot queries over static data. In this paper; we propose an air indexingframework that 1) outperforms the existing (ie; snapshot) techniques in terms of energyconsumption while achieving low access latency and 2) constitutes the first methodsupporting efficient processing of continuous spatial queries over moving objects.,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2009,66
Continuous nearest neighbor queries over sliding windows,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias,This paper studies continuous monitoring of nearest neighbor (NN) queries over slidingwindow streams. According to this model; data points continuously stream in the system; andthey are considered valid only while they belong to a sliding window that contains 1) the Wmost recent arrivals (count-based) or 2) the arrivals within a fixed interval W covering themost recent time stamps (time-based). The task of the query processor is to constantlymaintain the result of long-running NN queries among the valid data. We present twoprocessing techniques that apply to both count-based and time-based windows. The firstone adapts conceptual partitioning; the best existing method for continuous NN monitoringover update streams; to the sliding window model. The second technique reduces theproblem to skyline maintenance in the distance-time space and precomputes the future …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2007,66
Spatial; temporal and spatio-temporal databases-hot issues and directions for phd research,John F Roddick; Erik Hoel; Max J Egenhofer; Dimitris Papadias; Betty Salzberg,Abstract Spatial and temporal database systems; both in theory and in practice; havedeveloped dramatically over the past two decades to the point where usable commercialsystems; underpinned by a robust theoretical foundation; are now starting to appear. Whilemuch remains to be done; topics for research must be chosen carefully to avoid embarkingon impractical or unprofitable areas. This is particularly true for doctoral research where thecandidate must build a tangible contribution in a relatively short time. The panel session atthe Eighth International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases (SSTD 2003) heldon Santorini Island; Greece [7] in July 2003 thus took as its focus the question What to focuson (and what to avoid) in Spatial and Temporal Databases: recommendations for doctoralresearch.

Slot index spatial join,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Efficient processing of spatial joins is very important due to their high cost and frequentapplication in spatial databases and other areas involving multidimensional data. This paperproposes slot index spatial join (SISJ); an algorithm that joins a nonindexed data set withone indexed by an R-tree. We explore two optimization techniques that reduce the spacerequirements and the computational cost of SISJ and we compare it; analytically andexperimentally; with other spatial join methods for two cases: 1) when the nonindexed inputis read from disk and 2) when it is an intermediate result of a preceding database operator ina complex query plan. The importance of buffer splitting between consecutive join operatorsis also demonstrated through a two-join case study and a method that estimates the optimalsplitting is proposed. Our evaluation shows that SISJ outperforms alternative methods in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,60
Minimizing the communication cost for continuous skyline maintenance,Zhenjie Zhang; Reynold Cheng; Dimitris Papadias; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Existing work in the skyline literature focuses on optimizing the processing cost.This paper aims at minimization of the communication overhead in client-serverarchitectures; where a server continuously maintains the skyline of dynamic objects. Our firstcontribution is a Filter method that avoids transmission of updates from objects that cannotinfluence the skyline. Specifically; each object is assigned a filter so that it needs to issue anupdate only if it violates its filter. Filter achieves significant savings over the naive approachof transmitting all updates. Going one step further; we introduce the concept of frequentskyline query over a sliding window (FSQW). The motivation is that snapshot skylines arenot very useful in streaming environments because they keep changing over time. Instead;FSQW reports the objects that appear in the skylines of at least θ⋅ s of the s most recent …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,59

A reciprocal framework for spatial k-anonymity,Gabriel Ghinita; Keliang Zhao; Dimitris Papadias; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Spatial K-anonymity (SKA) exploits the concept of K-anonymity in order to protectthe identity of users from location-based attacks. The main idea of SKA is to replace theexact location of a user U with an anonymizing spatial region (ASR) that contains at least K−1 other users; so that an attacker can pinpoint U with probability at most 1/K. Simplygenerating an ASR that includes K users does not guarantee SKA. Previous work definedthe reciprocity property as a sufficient condition for SKA. However; the only existingreciprocal method; Hilbert Cloak; relies on a specialized data structure. In contrast; wepropose a general framework for implementing reciprocal algorithms using any existingspatial index on the user locations. We discuss ASR construction methods with differenttradeoffs on effectiveness (ie; ASR size) and efficiency (ie; construction cost). Then; we …,Information Systems,2010,57
Cost models for overlapping and multiversion structures,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Jun Zhang,Abstract Overlapping and multiversion techniques are two popular frameworks thattransform an ephemeral index into a multiple logical-tree structure in order to supportversioning databases. Although both frameworks have produced numerous efficientindexing methods; their performance analysis is rather limited; as a result there is no clearunderstanding about the behavior of the alternative structures and the choice of the bestone; given the data and query characteristics. Furthermore; query optimization based onthese methods is currently impossible. These are serious problems due to the incorporationof overlapping and multiversion techniques in several traditional (eg; financial) andemerging (eg; spatiotemporal) applications. In this article; we reduce performance analysisof overlapping and multiversion structures to that of the corresponding ephemeral …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2002,56
Differentially private event sequences over infinite streams,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos; Xiaokui Xiao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Numerous applications require continuous publication of statistics or monitoringpurposes; such as real-time traffic analysis; timely disease outbreak discovery; and socialtrends observation. These statistics may be derived from sensitive user data and; hence;necessitate privacy preservation. A notable paradigm for offering strong privacy guaranteesin statistics publishing is ε-differential privacy. However; there is limited literature that adaptsthis concept to settings where the statistics are computed over an infinite stream of"events"(ie; data items generated by the users); and published periodically. These works aimat hiding a single event over the entire stream. We argue that; in most practical scenarios;sensitive information is revealed from multiple events occurring at contiguous timeinstances. Towards this end; we put forth the novel notion of w-event privacy over infinite …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,55
Spatial queries in the presence of obstacles,Jun Zhang; Dimitris Papadias; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Manli Zhu,Abstract Despite the existence of obstacles in many database applications; traditional spatialquery processing utilizes the Euclidean distance metric assuming that points in space aredirectly reachable. In this paper; we study spatial queries in the presence of obstacles;where the obstructed distance between two points is defined as the length of the shortestpath that connects them without crossing any obstacles. We propose efficient algorithms forthe most important query types; namely; range search; nearest neighbors; e-distance joinsand closest pairs; considering that both data objects and obstacles are indexed by R-trees.The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is verified through extensive experiments.,International conference on extending database technology,2004,55
Range queries involving spatial relations: A performance analysis,Yannis Theodoridis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Spatial relations are becoming an important aspect of spatial access methodsbecause of the increasing interest on qualitative spatial information processing. In this paperwe show how queries involving spatial relations can be transformed to range queries andimplemented in existing DBMSs. We provide a performance analysis of B-and R-treeindexing methods to support such queries and we evaluate the analytical formulas usingexperimental results. The proposed analytical models for the expected retrieval cost ofspatial relations are proved to be good guidelines for a spatial query optimiser.,International Conference on Spatial Information Theory,1995,54
Topologically sorted skylines for partially ordered domains,Dimitris Sacharidis; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias,The vast majority of work on skyline queries considers totally ordered domains; whereas inmany applications some attributes are partially ordered; as for instance; domains of setvalues; hierarchies; intervals and preferences. The only work addressing this issue haslimited progressiveness and pruning ability; and it is only applicable to static skylines. Thispaper overcomes these problems with the following contributions.(i) We introduce a genericframework; termed TSS; for handling partially ordered domains using topological sorting.(ii)We propose a novel dominance check that eliminates false hits/misses; further enhancingprogressiveness and pruning ability.(iii) We extend our methodology to dynamic skylineswith respect to an input query. In this case; the dominance relationships change according tothe query specification; and their computation is rather complex. We perform an extensive …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Continuous k-means monitoring over moving objects,Zhenjie Zhang; Yin Yang; Anthony KH Tung; Dimitris Papadias,Given a data set P; a k-means query returns k points in space (called centers); such that theaverage squared distance between each point in P and its nearest center is minimized.Since this problem is NP-hard; several approximate algorithms have been proposed andused in practice. In this paper; we study continuous k-means computation at a server thatmonitors a set of moving objects. Reevaluating k-means every time there is an object updateimposes a heavy burden on the server (for computing the centers from scratch) and theclients (for continuously sending location updates). We overcome these problems with anovel approach that significantly reduces the computation and communication costs; whileguaranteeing that the quality of the solution; with respect to the reevaluation approach; isbounded by a user-defined tolerance. The proposed method assigns each moving object …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,51
Proxy-server architectures for olap,Panos Kalnis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Data warehouses have been successfully employed for assisting decision makingby offering a global view of the enterprise data and providing mechanisms for On-LineAnalytical processing. Traditionally; data warehouses are utilized within the limits of anenterprise or organization. The growth of Internet and WWW however; has created newopportunities for data sharing among ad-hoc; geographically spanned and possibly mobileusers. Since it is impractical for each enterprise to set up a worldwide infrastructure; currentlysuch applications are handled by the central warehouse. This often yields poorperformance; due to overloading of the central server and low transfer rate of the network. Inthis paper we propose an architecture for OLAP cache servers (OCS). An OCS is theequivalent of a proxy-server for web documents; but it is designed to accommodate data …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,46
A general framework for geo-social query processing,Nikos Armenatzoglou; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The proliferation of GPS-enabledmobile devises and the popularity of socialnetworking have recently led to the rapid growth of Geo-Social Networks (GeoSNs). GeoSNshave created a fertile ground for novel location-based social interactions and advertising.These can be facilitated by GeoSN queries; which extract useful information combining boththe social relationships and the current location of the users. This paper constitutes the firstsystematic work on GeoSN query processing. We propose a general framework that offersflexible data management and algorithmic design.

Hybmig: A hybrid approach to dynamic plan migration for continuous queries,Yin Yang; Jurgen Kramer; Dimitris Papadias; Bernhard Seeger,In data stream environments; the initial plan of a long-running query may gradually becomeinefficient due to changes of the data characteristics. In this case; the query optimizergenerates a more efficient plan based on the current statistics. The online transition from theold to the new plan is called dynamic plan migration. In addition to correctness; an effectivetechnique for dynamic plan migration should achieve the following objectives: 1) minimizethe memory and CPU overhead of the migration; 2) reduce the duration of the transition; and3) maintain a steady output rate. The only known solutions for this problem are the movingstates (MS) and parallel track (PT) strategies; which have some serious shortcomingsrelated to the above objectives. Motivated by these shortcomings; we first propose HybMig;which combines the merits of MS and PT and outperforms both in every aspect.

Using case-based reasoning for argumentation with multiple viewpoints,Nikos Karacapilidis; Brigitte Trousse; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The integration of classical case-based reasoning with other problem solvingmethods attracts increasing research interest in the broader area of information and decisionsupport systems. This paper presents a framework where CBR and Argumentation BasedReasoning jointly aid agents to address various discourse instances in group decisionmaking processes. The ability to comprehend and engage in arguments is essential forthese environments; while use of precedent cases is well-suited. Cases in our model are notmerely considered as representations of past data; but as flexible entities associated withthe underlying viewpoint of an agent and the evolution of the corresponding discussion. Thepaper provides an object-oriented description of the elements involved; and illustrates theirdependencies through a comprehensive example.,International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning,1997,43
Kernel-based skyline cardinality estimation,Zhenjie Zhang; Yin Yang; Ruichu Cai; Dimitris Papadias; Anthony Tung,Abstract The skyline of a d-dimensional dataset consists of all points not dominated byothers. The incorporation of the skyline operator into practical database systemsnecessitates an efficient and effective cardinality estimation module. However; existingtheoretical work on this problem is limited to the case where all d dimensions areindependent of each other; which rarely holds for real datasets. The state of the art LogSampling (LS) technique simply applies theoretical results for independent dimensions tonon-independent data anyway; sometimes leading to large estimation errors. To solve thisproblem; we propose a novel Kernel-Based (KB) approach that approximates the skylinecardinality with nonparametric methods. Extensive experiments with various real datasetsdemonstrate that KB achieves high accuracy; even in cases where LS fails. At the same …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,42
Top-k spatial joins,Manli Zhu; Dimitris Papadias; Dik Lun Lee; Jun Zhang,Given two spatial data sets A and B; a top-k spatial join retrieves the k objects from A or Bthat intersect the largest number of objects from the other data set. Depending on theapplication requirements; there exist several variations of the problem. For instance; B maybe a point data set; and the goal may be to retrieve the regions of A that contain themaximum number of points. The processing of such queries with conventional spatial joinalgorithms is expensive. However; several improvements are possible based on the fact thatwe only require a small subset of the result (instead of all intersection/containments pairs). Inthis paper; we propose output-sensitive algorithms for top-k spatial joins that utilize a varietyof optimizations for reducing the overhead.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,42
Collaborative filtering with personalized skylines,Ilaria Bartolini; Zhenjie Zhang; Dimitris Papadias,Collaborative filtering (CF) systems exploit previous ratings and similarity in user behavior torecommend the top-k objects/records which are potentially most interesting to the userassuming a single score per object. However; in various applications; a record (eg; hotel)maybe rated on several attributes (value; service; etc.); in which case simply returning theones with the highest overall scores fails to capture the individual attribute characteristicsand to accommodate different selection criteria. In order to enhance the flexibility of CF; wepropose Collaborative Filtering Skyline (CFS); a general framework that combines theadvantages of CF with those of the skyline operator. CFS generates a personalized skylinefor each user based on scores of other users with similar behavior. The personalized skylineincludes objects that are good on certain aspects; and eliminates the ones that are not …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,41
Selectivity estimation of complex spatial queries,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Several studies have focused on the efficient processing of simple spatial querytypes such as selections and spatial joins. Little work; however; has been done towards theoptimization of queries that process several spatial inputs and combine them through joinand selection conditions. This paper identifies the dependencies between spatial operatorsand illustrates how they can affect the outcome of complex queries. A thorough analysisyields selectivity estimations that can be used to optimize any combination of spatial andnon-spatial selection and join operators. The accuracy of the formulae is evaluated throughexperimentation with various queries. In addition to their importance for spatial databases;the presented results can be applied in several other domains; where dependencies existbetween operators.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,41
Exact in-network aggregation with integrity and confidentiality,Stavros Papadopoulos; Aggelos Kiayias; Dimitris Papadias,In-network aggregation reduces the energy cost of processing aggregate queries (such asSUM; MAX; etc.) in wireless sensor networks. Recently; research has focused on secure in-network aggregation; motivated by the following two scenarios: 1) the sensors are deployedin open and unsafe environments; and 2) the aggregation process is outsourced to anuntrustworthy service. Despite the bulk of work on the topic; there is currently no solutionproviding both integrity and confidentiality in the above scenarios. Moreover; existingsolutions either return approximate results; or have limited applicability to certain types ofaggregate queries. Our paper is the first work that provides both integrity and confidentialityin the aforementioned scenarios; while covering a wide range of aggregates and returningexact results. We initially present SIES; a scheme that solves exact SUM queries through …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,40
Multi-query optimization for on-line analytical processing,Panos Kalnis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Multi-dimensional expressions (MDX) provide an interface for asking severalrelated OLAP queries simultaneously. An interesting problem is how to optimize theexecution of an MDX query; given that most data warehouses maintain a set of redundantmaterialized views to accelerate OLAP operations. A number of greedy and approximationalgorithms have been proposed for different versions of the problem. In this paper weevaluate experimentally their performance; concluding that they do not scale well for realisticworkloads. Motivated by this fact; we develop two novel greedy algorithms. Our algorithmsconstruct the execution plan in a top–down manner by identifying in each step the mostbeneficial view; instead of finding the most promising query. We show by extensiveexperimentation that our methods outperform the existing ones in most cases.,Information Systems,2003,40
The semantics of relations in 2D space using representative points: Spatial indexes,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract The paper describes spatial indexes; a 2D array structure which can be used for therepresentation of spatial information. A spatial index preserves only a set of spatial relationsof interest; called the modelling space; and discards visual information (such as shape; sizeetc.) and information about irrelevant spatial relations. Every relation in the modelling spacecan be defined using a set of special points; called the representative points. By filling theindex array cells with representative points we can gain adequate expressive power toanswer queries regarding the spatial relations of the modelling space without the need toaccess the initial image or an object database.,European Conference on Spatial Information Theory,1993,40
Constrained shortest path computation,Manolis Terrovitis; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract This paper proposes and solves a-autonomy and k-stops shortest path problems inlarge spatial databases. Given a source s and a destination d; an a-autonomy queryretrieves a sequence of data points connecting s and d; such that the distance between anytwo consecutive points in the path is not greater than a. A k-stops query retrieves asequence that contains exactly k intermediate data points. In both cases our aim is tocompute the shortest path subject to these constraints. Assuming that the dataset is indexedby a data-partitioning method; the proposed techniques initially compute a sub-optimal pathby utilizing the Euclidean distance information provided by the index. The length of theretrieved path is used to prune the search space; filtering out large parts of the input dataset.In a final step; the optimal (a-autonomy or k-stops) path is computed (using only the non …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,39
k-Anonymity in the Presence of External Databases,Dimitris Sacharidis; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias,The concept of k-anonymity has received considerable attention due to the need of severalorganizations to release microdata without revealing the identity of individuals. Although allprevious k-anonymity techniques assume the existence of a public database (PD) that canbe used to breach privacy; none utilizes PD during the anonymization process. Specifically;existing generalization algorithms create anonymous tables using only the microdata table(MT) to be published; independently of the external knowledge available. This omissionleads to high information loss. Motivated by this observation; we first introduce the concept ofk-join-anonymity (KJA); which permits more effective generalization to reduce theinformation loss. Briefly; KJA anonymizes a superset of MT; which includes selected recordsfrom PD. We propose two methodologies for adapting k-anonymity algorithms to their KJA …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,38
Direction relations and two-dimensional range queries: optimisation techniques,Yannis Theodoridis; Dimitris Papadias; Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,Abstract This paper defines direction relations (eg; north; northeast) between two-dimensional objects and shows how they can be efficiently retrieved using B-; KDB-and R-tree-based data structures. Essentially; our work studies optimisation techniques for 2Drange queries that arise during the processing of direction relations. We test the efficiency ofalternative indexing methods through extensive experimentation and present analyticalmodels that estimate their performance. The analytical estimates are shown to be very closeto the actual results and can be used by spatial query optimizers in order to predict theretrieval cost. In addition; we implement modifications of the existing structures that yieldbetter performance for certain queries. We conclude the paper by discussing the mostsuitable method depending on the type of the range and the properties of the data.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1998,36
Tree-based partition querying: a methodology for computing medoids in large spatial datasets,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias; Spiros Papadimitriou,Abstract Besides traditional domains (eg; resource allocation; data mining applications);algorithms for medoid computation and related problems will play an important role innumerous emerging fields; such as location based services and sensor networks. Since thek-medoid problem is NP-hard; all existing work deals with approximate solutions onrelatively small datasets. This paper aims at efficient methods for very large spatialdatabases; motivated by:(1) the high and ever increasing availability of spatial data; and (2)the need for novel query types and improved services. The proposed solutions exploit theintrinsic grouping properties of a data partition index in order to read only a small part of thedataset. Compared to previous approaches; we achieve results of comparable or betterquality at a small fraction of the CPU and I/O costs (seconds as opposed to hours; and …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,34
Aggregate processing of planar points,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Jun Zhang,Abstract Aggregate window queries return summarized information about objects that fallinside a query rectangle (eg; the number of objects instead of their concrete ids). Traditionalapproaches for processing such queries usually retrieve considerable extra information;thus compromising the processing cost. The paper addresses this problem for planar pointsfrom both theoretical and practical points of view. We show that; an aggregate window querycan be answered in logarithmic worst-case time by an indexing structure called the aPtree.Next we study the practical behavior of the aP-tree and propose efficient cost models thatpredict the structure size and actual query cost. Extensive experiments show that the aP-tree; while involving more space consumption; accelerates query processing by up to anorder of magnitude compared to a specialized method based on R-trees. Furthermore …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,34
Secure and efficient in-network processing of exact SUM queries,Stavros Papadopoulos; Aggelos Kiayias; Dimitris Papadias,In-network aggregation is a popular methodology adopted in wireless sensor networks;which reduces the energy expenditure in processing aggregate queries (such as SUM;MAX; etc.) over the sensor readings. Recently; research has focused on secure in-networkaggregation; motivated (i) by the fact that the sensors are usually deployed in open andunsafe environments; and (ii) by new trends such as outsourcing; where the aggregationprocess is delegated to an untrustworthy service. This new paradigm necessitates thefollowing key security properties: data confidentiality; integrity; authentication; and freshness.The majority of the existing work on the topic is either unsuitable for large-scale sensornetworks; or provides only approximate answers for SUM queries (as well as theirderivatives; eg; COUNT; AVG; etc). Moreover; there is currently no approach offering both …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,33
An argumentation based framework for defeasible and qualitative reasoning,Nikos I Karacapilidis; Dimitris Papadias; Thomas F Gordon,Abstract Multiagent settings are usually characterized by numerous goals; diverse opinionsand conflicts of interest. In order to reach understanding and achieve cooperation; agentsneed a means of expressing their individual arguments which may contain explanations;justifications or any other kind of information. Furthermore; existing information may usuallybe incomplete; inconsistent and expressed in qualitative terms. In this paper; we present anargumentation-based framework that supports defeasible and qualitative reasoning in suchenvironments. An interval-based qualitative value logic is applied; together with an inferencemechanism in order to refine agents' knowledge; check consistency and; eventually;conclude the issue. The model is currently under development in Java; the aim being todeploy it on the World Wide Web.,Brazilian Symposium on Artificial Intelligence,1996,33
Separating authentication from query execution in outsourced databases,Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; Weiwei Cheng; Kian-Lee Tan,In the database outsourcing paradigm; a data owner (DO) delegates its DBMSadministration to a specialized service provider (SP) that receives and processes queriesfrom clients. The traditional outsourcing model (TOM) requires that the DO and the SPmaintain authenticated data structures to enable authentication of query results. In thispaper; we present SAE; a novel outsourcing model that separates authentication from queryexecution. Specifically; the DO does not perform any task except for maintaining its dataset(if there are updates). The SP only stores the DO's dataset and computes the query resultsusing a conventional DBMS. All security-related tasks are outsourced to a separate trustedentity (TE); which maintains limited authentication information about the original dataset. Aclient contacts the TE when it wishes to establish the correctness of a result returned by …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,32

To reduce hardware overhead; the proposed BISTtechnique uses the coherent under-sampling principle; and measures implicitly the timeinterval in a two-pass manner. Simulation results are shown to validate the proposedtechnique.,VLSI Test Symposium; 19th IEEE Proceedings on. VTS 2001,2001,31
Content-based retrieval using heuristic search,Dimitris Papadias; Marios Mantzourogiannis; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Ishfaq Ahmad,ABSTRACT The fast growth of multimedia information in image and video databases hastriggered research on efficient retrieval methods. This paper deals with structural queries; atype of content-based retrieval where similarity is not defined on visual properties such ascolor and texture; but on object relations in space. We propose the application of heuristicalgorithms which provide good; but not necessarily optimal; solutions in a pre-determinedtime period; and compare our approach with systematic search methods which areguaranteed to find optimal solutions but require exponential time in the worst case. Thequality of the output is calculated using a relation framework which is an extension of Allen'srelations. With this framework our methods can be applied in multiple resolutions anddimensions; thus covering a wide range of applications in spatial; multimedia and video …,Proceedings of the 22nd annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,1999,31
Skyline processing on distributed vertical decompositions,George Trimponias; Ilaria Bartolini; Dimitris Papadias; Yin Yang,We assume a data set that is vertically decomposed among several servers; and a client thatwishes to compute the skyline by obtaining the minimum number of points. Existing solutionsfor this problem are restricted to the case where each server maintains exactly onedimension. This paper proposes a general solution for vertical decompositions of arbitrarydimensionality. We first investigate some interesting problem characteristics regarding thepruning power of points. Then; we introduce vertical partition skyline (VPS); an algorithmicframework that includes two steps. Phase 1 searches for an anchor point P anc thatdominates; and hence eliminates; a large number of records. Starting with P anc; Phase 2constructs incrementally a pruning area using an interesting union-intersection property ofdominance regions. Servers do not transmit points that fall within the pruning area in their …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,30

Supporting direction relations in spatial database systems,Yannis Theodoridis; Dimitris Papadias; Emmanuel Stefanakis,Abstract Despite the attention that direction relations have attracted in domains such asSpatial Query Languages; Image and Multimedia Databases; Reasoning and GeographicApplications; they have not been extensively applied in spatial access methods. In thispaper we define direction relations between two-dimensional objects in different levels ofqualitative resolution and we show how these relations can be efficiently retrieved in existingDBMSs using several indexing techniques. Then we describe our implementations andprovide experimental results on B-and R-tree-based data structures to support directionrelations efficiently.,Proc. 7th Int. Symp.

Approximate temporal aggregation,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Christos Faloutsos,Temporal aggregate queries retrieve summarized information about records with time-evolving attributes. Existing approaches have at least one of the following shortcomings:(i)they incur large space requirements;(ii) they have high processing cost and (iii) they arebased on complex structures; which are not available in commercial systems. We solvethese problems by approximation techniques with bounded error. We propose two methods:the first one is based on multiversion B-trees and has logarithmic worst-case query cost;while the second technique uses off-the-shelf B-and R-trees; and achieves the sameperformance in the expected case. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposedmethods consume an order of magnitude less space than their competitors and aresignificantly faster; even for cases that the permissible error bound is very small.,Data Engineering; 2004.

Spatial reasoning using symbolic arrays,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract Research in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science has suggested thedistinction between visual knowledge (such as shape; volume and colour of objects) andspatial knowledge (that is; spatial relationships among the different objects of a visualscene). We find this distinction applicable to Information Systems concerned with spatialreasoning and especially to Geographic Information Systems. In particular; this paper dealswith the representation of spatial information in GIS. The paper presents a representationalformalism which captures the knowledge embedded in spatial relationships and providesthe ability to represent; retrieve and reason about spatial information not explicitly stored inmemory.,*,1992,28
Reachability indexes for relational keyword search,Alexander Markowetz; Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias,Due to its considerable ease of use; relational keyword search (R-KWS) has becomeincreasingly popular. Its simplicity; however; comes at the cost of intensive query processing.Specifically; R-KWS explores a vast search space; comprised of all possible combinations ofkeyword occurrences in any attribute of every table. Existing systems follow two generalmethodologies for query processing:(i) graph based; which traverses a materialized datagraph; and (ii) operator based; which executes relational operator trees on an underlyingDBMS. In both cases; computations are largely wasted on graph traversals or operator treeexecutions that fail to return results. Motivated by this observation; we introduce acomprehensive framework for reachability indexing that eliminates such fruitless operations.We describe a range of indexes that capture various types of join reachability.

Relation-based similarity,Dimitris Papadias; Vasilis Delis,Abstract: Similarity queries constitute an active area in spatial query processing. The paperaddresses the problem of qualitative similarity based on spntial relntions. On the one handspatial similarity entails mechanisms for representing and reasoning on spatial relations;while on the other it introduces n high level of uncertainty. Several spatial queries can berather fuzzy and user or application dependent. Moreover; relations such as near; norhzustetc. lack universally accepted semantics; and ns a result their processing in SpatialDatnbnses and GIS has to provide a high level of flexibility in order to satisfy renl-life needs.Our work extends the notion of conceptual neighbourhood (originnlly defined for ID spnce)to include higher dimensions and proposes n unified multiresolution framework for thehnndling of topological; directional and distance relations.

Appropriate decision making procedures are needed inorder to jointly consider their individual approaches and achieve collaboration.

Venn sampling: A novel prediction technique for moving objects,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Jian Zhai; Qing Li,Given a region q/sub R/and a future timestamp q/sub T/; a" range aggregate" queryestimates the number of objects expected to appear in q/sub R/at time q/sub T/. Currently theonly methods for processing such queries are based on spatio-temporal histograms; whichhave several serious problems. First; they consume considerable space in order to provideaccurate estimation. Second; they incur high evaluation cost. Third; their efficiencycontinuously deteriorates with time. Fourth; their maintenance requires significant updateoverhead. Motivated by this; we develop Venn sampling (VS); a novel estimation methodoptimized for a set of" pivot queries" that reflect the distribution of actual ones. In particular;given m pivot queries; VS achieves perfect estimation with only O (m) samples; as opposedto O (2/sup m/) required by the current state of the art in workload-aware sampling …,Data Engineering; 2005.

Performance analysis of R*-trees with arbitrary node extents,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Existing analysis for R-trees is inadequate for several traditional and emerging applicationsincluding; for example; temporal; spatio-temporal; and multimedia databases because it isbased on the assumption that the extents of a node are identical on all dimensions; which isnot satisfied in these domains. We propose analytical models that can accurately predict R*-tree performance without this assumption. Our derivation is based on the novel concept ofextent regression function; which computes the node extents as a function of the number ofnode splits. Detailed experimental evaluation reveals that the proposed models areaccurate; even in cases where previous methods fail completely.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,26
Constraint-based processing of multiway spatial joins,Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract. A multiway spatial join combines information found in three or more spatialrelations with respect to some spatial predicates. Motivated by their close correspondencewith constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs); we show how multiway spatial joins can beprocessed by systematic search algorithms traditionally used for CSPs. This paper describestwo different strategies; window reduction and synchronous traversal; that take advantage ofunderlying spatial indexes to prune the search space effectively. In addition; we provide costmodels and optimization methods that combine the two strategies to compute more efficientexecution plans. Finally; we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed techniques and theaccuracy of the cost models through extensive experimentation with several query and datacombinations.,Algorithmica,2001,26
Spatio-temporal join selectivity,Jimeng Sun; Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,Abstract Given two sets S 1; S 2 of moving objects; a future timestamp tq; and a distancethreshold d; a spatio-temporal join retrieves all pairs of objects that are within distance d at tq. The selectivity of a join equals the number of retrieved pairs divided by the cardinality ofthe Cartesian product S 1× S 2. This paper develops a model for spatio-temporal joinselectivity estimation based on rigorous probabilistic analysis; and reveals the factors thataffect the selectivity. Initially; we solve the problem for 1D (point and rectangle) objectswhose location and velocities distribute uniformly; and then extend the results to multi-dimensional spaces. Finally; we deal with non-uniform distributions using a specializedspatio-temporal histogram. Extensive experiments confirm that the proposed formulae arehighly accurate (average error below 10%).,Information Systems,2006,25
Approximate processing of multiway spatial joins in very large databases,Dimitris Papadias; Dinos Arkoumanis,Abstract Existing work on multiway spatial joins focuses on the retrieval of all exact solutionswith no time limit for query processing. Depending on the query and data properties;however; exhaustive processing of multiway spatial joins can be prohibitively expensive dueto the exponential nature of the problem. Furthermore; if there do not exist any exactsolutions; the result will be empty even though there may exist solutions that match the queryvery closely. These shortcomings motivate the current work; which aims at the retrieval of thebest possible (exact or approximate) solutions within a time threshold; since fast retrieval ofapproximate matches is the only way to deal with the ever increasing amounts of multimediainformation in several real time systems. We propose various techniques that combine localand evolutionary search with underlying indexes to prune the search space.

Indexing and retrieval of historical aggregate information about moving objects,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Jun Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; Qiongmao Shen; Jimeng Sun,Spatio-temporal databases store information about the positions of individual objects overtime. In many applications however; such as traffic supervision or mobile communicationsystems; only summarized data; like the average number of cars in an area for a specificperiod; or phones serviced by a cell each day; is required. Although this information can beobtained from operational databases; its computation is expensive; rendering onlineprocessing inapplicable. A vital solution is the construction of a spatiotemporal datawarehouse. In this paper; we describe a framework for supporting OLAP operations overspatiotemporal data. We argue that the spatial and temporal dimensions should be modeledas a combined dimension on the data cube and present data structures; which integratespatiotemporal indexing with pre-aggregation.

Adaptive index structures,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,This chapter proposes a general framework for adaptive indexes that improve overall querycost. The performance gain is achieved by allowing index nodes to contain a variablenumber of disk pages. Update algorithms dynamically restructure adaptive indexesdepending on the data and query characteristics. Extensive experiments show that adaptiveB-and R-trees significantly outperform their conventional counterparts; while incurringminimal update overhead. Traditional indexes aim at optimizing the node accesses duringquery processing; which; however; does not necessarily minimize the total cost due to thepossibly large number of random accesses. A single disk access usually includes a seekoperation that positions the disk head at the requested sector (including cylinder seek androtation); and data transfer to/from the main memory. Thus; the total query cost is the sum …,*,2002,25

The pursuit of a good possible world: extracting representative instances of uncertain graphs,Panos Parchas; Francesco Gullo; Dimitris Papadias; Franceseco Bonchi,Abstract Data in several applications can be represented as an uncertain graph; whoseedges are labeled with a probability of existence. Exact query processing on uncertaingraphs is prohibitive for most applications; as it involves evaluation over an exponentialnumber of instantiations. Even approximate processing based on sampling is usuallyextremely expensive since it requires a vast number of samples to achieve reasonablequality guarantees. To overcome these problems; we propose algorithms for creatingdeterministic representative instances of uncertain graphs that maintain the underlyinggraph properties. Specifically; our algorithms aim at preserving the expected vertex degreesbecause they capture well the graph topology. Conventional processing techniques canthen be applied on these instances to closely approximate the result on the uncertain …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2014,23
Query processing in spatial databases containing obstacles,Jun Zhang; Dimitris Papadias; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Zhu Manli,Despite the existence of obstacles in many database applications; traditional spatial queryprocessing assumes that points in space are directly reachable and utilizes the Euclideandistance metric. In this paper; we study spatial queries in the presence of obstacles; wherethe obstructed distance between two points is defined as the length of the shortest path thatconnects them without crossing any obstacles. We propose efficient algorithms for the mostimportant query types; namely; range search; nearest neighbours; e‐distance joins; closestpairs and distance semi‐joins; assuming that both data objects and obstacles are indexedby R‐trees. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is verified through extensiveexperiments.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2005,23

We initially describe a binary stringencoding for 1D relations that permits the automatic derivation of similarity measures. Wethen extend this model to various granularity levels and many dimensions; and show thatreasoning on spatio-temporal structure is significantly facilitated in the new framework.Finally; we provide algorithms and optimization methods for four types of queries:(i) objectretrieval based on some spatio-temporal relations with respect to a reference object;(ii)spatial joins; ie; retrieval of object pairs that satisfy some input relation;(iii) structural queries;which retrieve configurations matching a particular spatio-temporal structure; and (iv) specialcases of motion queries.

On the retrieval of similar configurations,Dimitris Papadias; Dinos Arkoumanis; Nikos Karacapilidis,The search for similar configurations is an important research topic for content-based imageretrieval in GISs and Spatial Databases. In the corresponding queries; the user imposes aset of spatial constraints among a set of objects asking for the images that best match theseconstraints. The paper defines configuration similarity using fuzzy measures and describesalgorithms for retrieval from image databases. We distinguish three cases of querysatisfiability: hard; where all the constraints of the query must be totally satisfied; soft; wheresome constraints may be (totally or partially) violated in solutions that are good on theaverage; and semi-hard; where each constraint must be at least partially satisfied. Althoughthese problems are exponential in nature (NP-hard) we propose heuristics which; whencombined with pre-processing strategies; yield good real-time performance even for large …,*,1997,22
Medoid queries in large spatial databases,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias; Spiros Papadimitriou,Abstract Assume that a franchise plans to open k branches in a city; so that the averagedistance from each residential block to the closest branch is minimized. This is an instanceof the k-medoids problem; where residential blocks constitute the input dataset and the kbranch locations correspond to the medoids. Since the problem is NP-hard; research hasfocused on approximate solutions. Despite an avalanche of methods for small and moderatesize datasets; currently there exists no technique applicable to very large databases. In thispaper; we provide efficient algorithms that utilize an existing data-partition index to achievelow CPU and I/O cost. In particular; we exploit the intrinsic grouping properties of the index inorder to avoid reading the entire dataset. Furthermore; we apply our framework to solvemedoid-aggregate queries; where k is not known in advance; instead; we are asked to …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,21
Validity information retrieval for spatio-temporal queries: Theoretical performance bounds,Yufei Tao; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The results of traditional spatial queries (ie; range search; nearest neighbor; etc.)are usually meaningless in spatio-temporal applications; because they will be invalidated bythe movements of query and/or data objects. In practice; a query result R should beaccompanied with validity information specifying (i) the (future) time T that R will expire; and(ii) the change C of R at time T (so that R can be updated incrementally). Although severalalgorithms have been proposed for this problem; their worst-case performance is the sameas that of sequential scan. This paper presents the first theoretical study on validity queries;and develops indexes and algorithms with attractive I/O complexities. Our discussion coversnumerous important variations of the problem and different query/object mobilitycombinations. The solutions involve a set of non-trivial reductions that reveal the problem …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,21
Multi-dimensional range query processing with spatial relations,Dimitris Papadias; Yannis Theodoridis; Emmanuel Stefanakis,Abstract The processing of multi-dimensional range queries involving spatial relations arisesin many application areas including Spatial Databases and GISs. In this paper we show howa variety of three-or four-dimensional queries that correspond to different relations can beprocessed using spatial data structures. We provide analytical formulas that describe theexpected cost of retrieval and test the accuracy of the formulas through extensiveexperimentation. We also propose alternative methods aimed at the efficient processing ofcertain queries. The paper concludes by discussing the most suitable data structure for eachtype of query taking into account the properties of the data.,Geographical Systems,1997,21
pCloud: A distributed system for practical PIR,Stavros Papadopoulos; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Computational Private Information Retrieval (cPIR) protocols allow a client to retrieve one bitfrom a database; without the server inferring any information about the queried bit. Theseprotocols are too costly in practice because they invoke complex arithmetic operations forevery bit of the database. In this paper; we present pCloud; a distributed system thatconstitutes the first attempt toward practical cPIR. Our approach assumes a disk-basedarchitecture that retrieves one page with a single query. Using a striping technique; wedistribute the database to a number of cooperative peers; and leverage their computationalresources to process cPIR queries in parallel. We implemented pCloud on the PlanetLabnetwork; and experimented extensively with several system parameters. Our results indicatethat pCloud reduces considerably the query response time compared to the traditional …,IEEE transactions on dependable and secure computing,2012,20
Rapid prototyping of micropatterned substrates using conventional laser printers,Michael L Branham; Roger Tran-Son-Tay; Christopher Schoonover; Patrick S Davis; Susan D Allen; Wei Shyy,Abstract We demonstrated rapid prototyping of templates for replica molding using aconventional laser printer. A polymer; polydimethylsiloxane; was cast directly on thetransparency templates to make the replicas. The templates and replicas were characterizedby scanning electron microscopy; profilometry; and optical microscopy. Four patterns;including an Electronic Industries Association resolution test pattern; were printed ontransparencies at 600 dots per inch on a HP LaserJet 4M printer (Hewlett-Packard; PaloAlto; CA). Optimal precision and clarity occurred between intensity settings of 50–100. Meanpattern height/depth ranged from 8–13 μm; and width was as small as a few tenths of amillimeter. Mean surface roughness of the template patterns ranged from 1 to 4 μm on thetop surface and from 5 to 10 nm on the bare transparency surface.

Active caching of on-line-analytical-processing queries in www proxies,Thanasis Loukopoulos; Panos Kalnis; Ishfaq Ahmad; Dimitris Papadias,The Internet is offering more than just regular Web pages to the users. Decision makers cannow issue analytical; as opposed to transactional; queries that involve massive data (suchas; aggregations of millions of rows in a relational database) in order to identify useful trendsand patterns. Such queries are referred to as On-Line-Analytical-Processing (OLAP)queries. Typically; pages carrying query results do not exhibit temporal locality and;therefore; are not considered for caching at WWW proxies. In OLAP processing; thisbecomes a major hurdle as the cost of such queries is much higher than traditionaltransactional queries. This paper proposes a systematic technique to reduce the responsetime for OLAP queries originating from geographically distributed private LANs and issuedthrough the Web towards the central data warehouse (DW) of an enterprise.

The power-method: a comprehensive estimation technique for multi-dimensional queries,Yufei Tao; Christos Faloutsos; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Existing estimation approaches for multi-dimensional databases often rely on theassumption that data distribution in a small region is uniform; which seldom holds inpractice. Moreover; their applicability is limited to specific estimation tasks under certaindistance metric. This paper develops the Power-method; a comprehensive techniqueapplicable to a wide range of query optimization problems under various metrics. The Power-method eliminates the local uniformity assumption and is accurate even in scenarios whereexisting approaches completely fail. Furthermore; it performs estimation by evaluating onlyone simple formula with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments confirmthat the Power-method outperforms previous techniques in terms of accuracy andapplicability to various optimization scenarios.,Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2003,18
Authenticated multistep nearest neighbor search,Stavros Papadopoulos; Lixing Wang; Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias; Panagiotis Karras,Multistep processing is commonly used for nearest neighbor (NN) and similarity search inapplications involving high-dimensional data and/or costly distance computations. Today;many such applications require a proof of result correctness. In this setting; clients issue NNqueries to a server that maintains a database signed by a trusted authority. The serverreturns the NN set along with supplementary information that permits result verification usingthe data set signature. An adaptation of the multistep NN algorithm incurs prohibitivenetwork overhead due to the transmission of false hits; ie; records that are not in the NN set;but are nevertheless necessary for its verification. In order to alleviate this problem; wepresent a novel technique that reduces the size of each false hit. Moreover; we generalizeour solution for a distributed setting; where the database is horizontally partitioned over …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,17
Continuous spatial authentication,Stavros Papadopoulos; Yin Yang; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Recent advances in wireless communications and positioning devices havegenerated a tremendous amount of interest in the continuous monitoring of spatial queries.However; such applications can incur a heavy burden on the data owner (DO); due to veryfrequent location updates. Database outsourcing is a viable solution; whereby the DOdelegates its database functionality to a service provider (SP) that has the infrastructure andresources to handle the high workload. In this framework; authenticated query processingenables the clients to verify the correctness of the query results that are returned by the SP.In addition to correctness; the dynamic nature of the monitored data requires the provisionfor temporal completeness; ie; the clients must be able to verify that there are no missingresults in between data updates.

Random sampling for continuous streams with arbitrary updates,Yufei Tao; Xiang Lian; Dimitris Papadias; Marios Hadjieleftheriou,The existing random sampling methods have at least one of the following disadvantages:they 1) are applicable only to certain update patterns; 2) entail large space overhead; or 3)incur prohibitive maintenance cost. These drawbacks prevent their effective application instream environments (where a relation is updated by a large volume of insertions anddeletions that may arrive in any order); despite the considerable success of randomsampling in conventional databases. Motivated by this; we develop several fully dynamicalgorithms for obtaining random samples from individual relations; and from the join result oftwo tables. Our solutions can handle any update pattern with small space and computationaloverhead. We also present an in-depth analysis that provides valuable insight into thecharacteristics of alternative sampling strategies and leads to precision guarantees …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,16
Dynamic plan migration for snapshot-equivalent continuous queries in data stream systems,Jürgen Krämer; Yin Yang; Michael Cammert; Bernhard Seeger; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract A data stream management system executes a large number of continuous queriesin parallel. As stream characteristics and query workload change over time; the plan initiallyinstalled for a continuous query may become inefficient. As a consequence; the queryoptimizer will re-optimize this plan based on the current statistics. The replacement of therunning plan with a more efficient but semantically equivalent plan at runtime is calleddynamic plan migration. In order to have a sound semantic foundation for queryoptimization; we investigate dynamic plan migration for snapshot-equivalent plans. Wedevelop a general method for dynamic plan migration that treats the old and new plan assnapshot-equivalent black boxes. This enables the query optimizer to apply theconventional transformation rules during re-optimization. As a consequence; our …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,16
Hierarchical constraint satisfaction in spatial databases,Dimitris Papadias; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Several content-based queries in spatial databases and geographic informationsystems (GISs) can be modelled and processed as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).Regular CSP algorithms; however; work for main memory retrieval without utilizing indices toprune the search space. This paper shows how systematic and local search techniques cantake advantage of the hierarchical decomposition of space; preserved by spatial datastructures; to efficiently guide search. We study the conditions under which hierarchicalconstraint satisfaction outperforms traditional methods with extensive experimentation.,Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1999,16
A pictorial language for the retrieval of spatial relations from image databases,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract The paper describes a Pictorial Query-By-Example (PQBE) aimed at the retrieval ofdirection relations from Image Databases. PQBE incorporates several features such asobject; image and relation retrieval; union; intersection etc. Unlike verbal query languages itdoes not presume knowledge of keywords for spatial relations on behalf of the user; norfamiliarity with database models; but complex spatial conditions are expressed in astraightforward manner. Furthermore; with the incorporation of some additional features;such as topological relations; distances and class retrieval; PQBE can be used as anintuitive GIS interface; independently of the underlying representation.,the Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling (SDH),1994,16
Mixed language query disambiguation,Pascale Fung; LIU Xiaohu; Cheung Chi Shun,Abstract We propose a mixed language query disambiguation approach by using co-occurrence information from monolingual data only. A mixed language query consists ofwords in a< i> primary language</i> and a< i> secondary language</i>. Our methodtranslates the query into monolingual queries in either language. Two novel features fordisambiguation; namely contextual word voting and 1-best contextual word; are introducedand compared to a baseline feature; the nearest neighbor. Average query translationaccuracy for the two features are 81.37% and 83.72%; compared to the baseline accuracy of75.50%.,Proceedings of the 37th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Computational Linguistics,1999,15

Just-in-time processing of continuous queries,Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias,In a data stream management system; a continuous query is processed by an executionplan consisting of multiple operators connected via the" consumer-producer" relationship; ie;the output of an operator (the" producer") feeds to another downstream operator (the"consumer") as input. Existing techniques execute each operator separately and push allresults to its consumers; without considering whether the consumers need them.Consequently; considerable CPU and memory resources are wasted on producing andstoring useless intermediate results. Motivated by this; we propose just-in-time (JIT)processing; a novel methodology that enables a consumer to return feedback expressing itscurrent demand to the producer. The latter selectively generates results based on thisinformation. We show; through extensive experiments; that JIT achieves significant …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Constraint-Based Reasoning in Geographic Databases: the Case of Symbolic Arrays.,Dimitris Papadias; Andrew U Frank; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract Symbolic arrays are hierarchical constraint-based representations that preservedirection relations (eg; north; northeast) among the distinct components of complex spatialentities. They have been used in problems involving pattern matching and spatialinformation retrieval. In this paper we demonstrate how inference can be achieved ingeographic databases of symbolic arrays using composition of direction relations. Inparticular; we distinguish two types of spatial inference: the first is concerned with theinference of constraints between objects that exist at different levels in the hierarchy; whilethe second type involves the inference of constraints between objects that exist at the samelevel but in different arrays.,Workshop on Deductive Databases and Logic Programming,1994,14
Hill climbing algorithms for content-based retrieval of similar configurations,Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The retrieval of stored images matching an input configuration is an important formof content-based retrieval. Exhaustive processing (ie; retrieval of the best solutions) ofconfiguration similarity queries is; in general; exponential and fast search for sub-optimalsolutions is the only way to deal with the vast (and ever increasing) amounts of multimediainformation in several real-time applications. In this paper we discuss the utilization of hillclimbing heuristics that can provide very good results within limited processing time. Wepropose several heuristics; which differ on the way that they search through the solutionspace; and identify the best ones depending on the query and image characteristics.

Collaborative Spatial Decision Making with Qualitative Constraints.,Nikos I Karacapilidis; Dimitris Papadias; Max J Egenhofer,Abstract: Usually spatial planning problems involve a large number of decision makers withdifferent backgrounds and interests. The process of Collaborative Spatial Decision Making(CSDM) has to reconcile the individual approaches and lead to solutions that satisfy allparticipants. In this paper we deal with a particular instance of CSDM that involvesqualitative constraints. Qualitative CSDM is very important for practical applications wheredecision makers communicate spatial knowledge using relations in space rather thanabsolute coordinates. It is also an interesting topic from the scientific point of view; because itcombines several research areas related to Geographic Information Systems such asSpatial Query Languages; Constraint Satisfaction Mechanisms; Heterogeneous Databases;Spatial Access Methods and Group Decision Making.

Magneto-optical determination of the T-point energy gap in bismuth,JP Omaggio; JR Meyer; CA Hoffman; A DiVenere; XJ Yi; CL Hou; HC Wang; JB Ketterson; GK Wong; JP Heremans,Abstract We have carried out infrared magnetotransmission measurements on a 5000-Å-thick bismuth film grown by molecular-beam epitaxy onto a CdTe substrate. The data forphoton energies below 300 meV display at least ten orders of minima due to interbandtransitions at the L points. In contrast to previous results from magnetoreflectivityexperiments on bulk Bi; two concurrent series of resonances separated by a nearly constantenergy of≊ 5 meV are observed. An additional series of strong oscillations emerges atsomewhat higher photon energies; due to interband transitions at the T point. The energydispersion of these resonances are fit quite well by a simple nonparabolic model; allowingus to directly determine the T-point energy gap (407 meV) and the electron-hole reducedmass (0.027 m 0; which implies an electron mass of 0.048 m 0).,Physical Review B,1993,12

Uncertain graph processing through representative instances,Panos Parchas; Francesco Gullo; Dimitris Papadias; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract Data in several applications can be represented as an uncertain graph whoseedges are labeled with a probability of existence. Exact query processing on uncertaingraphs is prohibitive for most applications; as it involves evaluation over an exponentialnumber of instantiations. Thus; typical approaches employ Monte-Carlo sampling; which (i)draws a number of possible graphs (samples);(ii) evaluates the query on each of them; and(iii) aggregates the individual answers to generate the final result. However; this approachcan also be extremely time consuming for large uncertain graphs commonly found inpractice. To facilitate efficiency; we study the problem of extracting a single representativeinstance from an uncertain graph. Conventional processing techniques can then be appliedon this representative to closely approximate the result on the original graph. In order to …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,10

We first introduce a general GSK framework that covers a wide range of real-world tasks; including advertisement; context-based search; and market analysis. Then; wepresent three concrete GSK queries:(i) NPRU that returns the top-k users based on theirspatial proximity to a given query location; their popularity; and their similarity to an input setof terms;(ii) NSTP that outputs the top-k POIs based on their proximity to a user v; the numberof check-ins by friends of v; and their similarity to a set of terms;(iii) FSKR that discovers thetop-k keywords based on their frequency in pairs of friends located within a spatial area.

Real-time multi-criteria social graph partitioning: A game theoretic approach,Nikos Armenatzoglou; Huy Pham; Vasilis Ntranos; Dimitris Papadias; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Graph partitioning has attracted considerable attention due to its high practicality forreal-world applications. It is particularly relevant to social networks because it enables thegrouping of users into communities for market analysis and advertising purposes. In thispaper; we introduce RMGP; a type of real-time multi-criteria graph partitioning for socialnetworks that groups the users based on their connectivity and their similarity to a set ofinput classes. We consider RMGP as an on-line task; which may be frequently performed fordifferent query parameters (eg; classes). In order to overcome the serious performanceissues associated with the large social graphs found in practice; we develop solutions basedon a game theoretic framework. Specifically; we consider each user as a player; whose goalis to find the class that optimizes his objective function.

Adaptive schemes for distributed web caching,Spiridon Bakiras; Thanasis Loukopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; Ishfaq Ahmad,Abstract In distributed web caching architectures; institutional proxies take advantage of theirneighbors' contents in order to reduce the number of requests forwarded to the server.Intuitively; the maximum benefit from this cooperation is expected when the proxies thatexhibit similar requests are grouped together. The current practice is to follow a static andmanual configuration of neighbors. Such an approach has a number of drawbacks:(i) staticallocation may not determine the best neighbors; especially if global knowledge of theparticipating proxies is not available;(ii) a manual allocation places significant administrativeburden;(iii) static schemes are insensitive to changes in access patterns; and (iv) theycannot deal with the introduction of new; potentially useful; proxies.

In thispaper; we focus on the efficient processing and optimization of complex spatial queries thatinvolve combinations of spatial selections and joins. Our contribution is manifold; we firstprovide formulae that accurately estimate the selectivity of such queries. These formulae;paired with cost models for selections and joins can be used to combine spatial operators inan optimal way. Second; we propose algorithms that process spatial joins and selectionssimultaneously and are typically more efficient than combinations of simple operators.Finally we study the problem of optimizing complex spatial queries using these operators; byproviding (i) cost models; and (ii) rules that reduce the optimization space significantly …,GeoInformatica,2004,10

Optimization algorithms for simultaneous multidimensional queries in OLAP environments,Panos Kalnis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Multi-Dimensional Expressions (MDX) provide an interface for asking severalrelated OLAP queries simultaneously. An interesting problem is how to optimize theexecution of an MDX query; given that most data warehouses maintain a set of redundantmaterialized views to accelerate OLAP operations. A number of greedy and approximationalgorithms have been proposed for different versions of the problem. In this paper weevaluate experimentally their performance using the APB and TPC-H benchmarks;concluding that they do not scale well for realistic workloads. Motivated by this fact; wedeveloped two novel greedy algorithms. Our algorithms construct the execution plan in a top-down manner by identifying in each step the most beneficial view; instead of finding the mostpromising query. We show by extensive experimentation that our methods outperform the …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2001,9

For these problems; systematic CSP algorithms can takeadvantage of temporal indexing to accelerate search.

Vertical dimensioning: A novel DRR implementation for efficient fair queueing,Spiridon Bakiras; Feng Wang; Dimitris Papadias; Mounir Hamdi,Abstract Fair bandwidth allocation is an important mechanism for traffic management in theInternet. Round robin schedulers; such as Deficit Round Robin (DRR); are well-suited forimplementing fair queueing in multi-Gbps routers; as they schedule packets in constant timeregardless of the total number of active flows. The main drawback of these schemes;however; lies in the maintenance of per flow queues; which complicates the buffermanagement module and limits the sharing of the buffer space among the competing flows.In this paper; we introduce a novel packet scheduling mechanism; called VerticalDimensioning (VD) that modifies the original DRR algorithm to operate without per flowqueueing. In particular; VD is based on an array of FIFO buffers; whose size is constant andindependent of the total number of active flows. Our results; both analytical and …,Computer communications,2008,8

Geo-social ranking: functions and query processing,Nikos Armenatzoglou; Ritesh Ahuja; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Given a query location q; Geo-Social Ranking (GSR) ranks the users of a Geo-Social Network based on their distance to q; the number of their friends in the vicinity of q;and possibly the connectivity of those friends.

Fast retrieval of similar configurations,Dimitris Papadias; Marios Mantzourogiannis; Ishfaq Ahmad,Configuration similarity is a special form of content-based image retrieval that considersrelative object locations. It can be used as a standalone method; or to complement retrievalbased on visual or semantic features.

Consider; for instance; that a user wants to" find all imageswhere there exists a building adjacent to the west side of a park which is southwest and neara commercial center". This query can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem(CSF) where the query variables are nodes of the corresponding constraint network and theimage objects constitute the domain of each variable. The arcs of the network correspond tospatial constraints (eg; adjacent л west (Xi; X2); southwest л near (X2; X3)). Problems of theabove nature are; in general; intractable. In addition; spatial constraints (eg; southwest;near) lack universally accepted semantics and cannot always be modeled by crisp relations;a fact that further complicates query processing.

Qualitative Collaborative Planning in Geographical Space: Some Computational Issues,Dimitris Papadias; Max Egenhofer,Frequently people communicate spatial information usingqualitative relations (constraints)between distinct objects rather than absolute coordinates. The constraints that have beenused in the GIS literature are topological (eg; disjoint; overlap); direction (eg; north; east) anddistance constraints (eg; near; far). The importance of qualitative spatial constraints has ledto their application in several domains related to GIS and Spatial Databases (for anexpended discussion see Papadias and Sellis; 94).In this paper we study computationalissuesinvolved in qualitative collaborative planning in geographic space. We assume anumber of decision makers (thereafter called agents) each having a set of beliefs about agiven spatial planning problem. These beliefs are expressed in the form of qualitative spatialconstraints between a set of objects. The problem is to generate spatial plans that are …,NCGIA Initiative 17 Position Paper; 16-19 September,1995,7
Reverse nearest neighbor query,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao,Many organizations; eg; government statistical offices and search engine companies; collectpotentially sensitive information regarding individuals either to publish this data for research;or in return for useful services. While some data collection organizations; like the census; arelegally required not to breach the privacy of the individuals; other data collectionorganizations may not be trusted to uphold privacy. Hence; if U denotes the original datacontaining sensitive information about a set of individuals; then an untrusted data collectoror researcher should only have access to an anonymized version of the data; U*; that doesnot disclose the sensitive information about the individuals. A randomized anonymizationalgorithm R is said to be a privacy preserving randomization method if for every table T; andfor every output T*= R (T); the privacy of all the sensitive information of each individual in …,*,2009,6
Spatial Joins: Algorithms; Cost Models and Optimization,Nikos Mamoulis; Yannis Theodoridis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract This chapter describes algorithms; cost models and optimization techniques forspatial joins. Joins are among the most common queries in Spatial Database ManagementSystems. Due to their importance and high processing cost; a number of algorithms havebeen proposed covering all possible cases of indexed and non-indexed inputs. We firstdescribe some popular methods for processing binary spatial joins and provide models forselectivity and cost estimation. Then; we discuss evaluation of multiway,Spatial Databases,2005,6
Building an interactive multimedia information system: The GeoMed case study,Nikos Karacapilidis; Thomas Gordon; Dimitris Papadias; Hans Voss,Abstract. Implementation of information systems has witnessed a movement towards datatypes of increasing complexity. This is widely facilitated by recent advances in computingand communication. At the same time; the user community does not only need access toexisting information in various systems; but efficient ways to contribute its own. This paperdiscusses issues on the development of an Interactive Multimedia Information System on theWorld-Wide Web. Reporting work on GeoMed; a new EU-funded project aiming at building aGeographical Mediation System; we indicate means of indexing; organization andmanagement of information. Multimedia information is represented in GeoMed withinelectronic documents and messages; not only as passive data but as graphical userinterfaces to external Information Systems.

Spatial query estimation without the local uniformity assumption,Yufei Tao; Christos Faloutsos; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Existing estimation approaches for spatial databases often rely on the assumptionthat data distribution in a small region is uniform; which seldom holds in practice. Moreover;their applicability is limited to specific estimation tasks under certain distance metric. Thispaper develops the Power-method; a comprehensive technique applicable to a wide rangeof query optimization problems under both L∞ and L 2 metrics. The Power-methodeliminates the local uniformity assumption and is; therefore; accurate even for datasetswhere existing approaches fail. Furthermore; it performs estimation by evaluating only onesimple formula with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments confirm thatthe Power-method outperforms previous techniques in terms of accuracy and applicability tovarious optimization scenarios.,Geoinformatica,2006,5
Search algorithms for multiway spatial joins,Dimitris Papadias; Dinos Arkoumanis,This paper deals with multiway spatial joins when (i) there is limited time for queryprocessing and the goal is to retrieve the best possible solutions within this limit (ii) there isunlimited time and the goal is to retrieve a single exact solution; if such a solution exists; orthe best approximate one otherwise. The first case is motivated by the high cost of joinprocessing in real-time systems involving large amounts of multimedia data; while thesecond one is motivated by applications that require 'negative'examples. We proposeseveral search algorithms for query processing under theses conditions. For the limited-timecase we develop some non-deterministic search heuristics that can quickly retrieve goodsolutions. However; these heuristics are not guaranteed to find the best solutions; evenwithout a time limit. Therefore; for the unlimited-time case we describe systematic search …,International journal of geographical information science,2002,5
Querying by Spatial Structure,Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Vasilis Delis,Abstract: Structural queries constitute a special form of content-based retrieval where theuser specifies a set of spatial constraints among query variables and searches for allconfigurations of actual objects that (totally or partially) match these constraints. Processingof such queries can be thought of as a general form of spatial joins; ie; instead of pairs; theresult consists of n-tuples of objects; where n is the number of query variables. In this paperwe propose a flexible framework which permits the representation of configurations indifferent resolution levels and supports the automatic derivation of similarity measures. Wesubsequently describe three algorithms for structural query processing which integrateconstraint satisfaction with spatial indexing. For each algorithm we apply severaloptimization techniques and experimentally evaluate performance using real data.,Proceedings of VLDB,1998,5
Combining differential privacy and pir for efficient strong location privacy,Eric Fung; Georgios Kellaris; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Data privacy is a huge concern nowadays. In the context of location based services;a very important issue regards protecting the position of users issuing queries. Stronglocation privacy renders the user position indistinguishable from any other location. Thisnecessitates that every query; independently of its location; should retrieve the same amountof information; determined by the query with the maximum requirements. Consequently; theprocessing cost and the response time are prohibitively high for datasets of realistic sizes. Inthis paper; we propose a novel solution that offers both strong location privacy and efficiencyby adjusting the accuracy of the query results. Our framework seamlessly combines theconcepts of ϵ-differential privacy and private information retrieval (PIR); exploiting querystatistics to increase efficiency without sacrificing privacy. We experimentally show that …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,3

Location-based sponsored search advertising,George Trimponias; Ilaria Bartolini; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The proliferation of powerful mobile devices with built-in navigational capabilitiesand the adoption in most metropolitan areas of fast wireless communication protocols haverecently created unprecedented opportunities for location-based advertising. In this work; weprovide models and investigate the market for location-based sponsored search; whereadvertisers pay the search engine to be displayed in slots alongside the search engine'smain results. We distinguish between three cases:(1) advertisers only declare bids but notbudgets;(2) advertisers declare budgets but not bids; and (3) advertisers declare both bidsand budgets. We first cast these problems as game theoretical market problems; and wesubsequently attempt to identify the equilibrium strategies for the corresponding games.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,2
Asset Prices Credit Constraints; and Macroeconomic Fluctuations,Zheng Liu; Pengfei Wang; Tao Zha,Abstract. We construct and estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model withheterogenous agents and credit constraints. We argue that a financial multiplier can beeffective in transforming economic shocks into the observed fluctuations in aggregate outputonly if the model can generate large fluctuations in asset prices. Our estimation shows thatthe housing demand shock in our model not only accounts for most of the observedfluctuations in the land price but also contributes to 35− 45% of investment fluctuations atbusiness cycle frequencies. Such dynamic interactions between land prices and investmentmovements are the key to our finding of the empirically important amplification andpropagation operating through endogenous credit constraints.,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2009,2
Spatio-Temporal Data Warehouses,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,Encyclopedia of Database Systems,2009,2

Resonant Raman scattering with the E+ band in a dilute Ga As 1− x N x alloy (x= 0.1%),PH Tan; ZY Xu; XD Luo; WK Ge; Y Zhang; A Mascarenhas; HP Xin; CW Tu,Resonant Raman scattering has been applied to a dilute Ga As 1− x N x alloy with 0.1% N.The Raman lines of GaAs and GaN related modes; their combinations; and multiple orderreplicas of GaAs-like longitudinal-optical modes have been observed with a lower Ncomposition than those studied previously. All these Raman features are found to bestrongly enhanced with excitations in resonance with a broad photoluminescence band thatis associated with the so-called E+ transition.

Providing guaranteed deterministic performance service to multimedia applications on WDM optical networks,Maode Ma; Mounir Hamdi,A major challenge in design of high-speed networks is to provide guaranteed quality ofservice for multimedia applications. In this paper; we propose an admission control policy; atraffic regulator and a scheduling algorithm for the single-hop passive star coupled WDMoptical: networks. All of them are combined to ensure guaranteed deterministic performanceservice to multimedia applications. We set up an analytical model to evaluate thedeterministic bounded message delay in the specified network based on the max-plusalgebra. We conduct a trace-driven simulation with real MPEG traffics. We model MPEGtraffics with the parameters of the real MPEG traffics and use them in discrete eventsimulations. Both simulation results show that our systematic scheme and our analysis arefeasible to multimedia applications.,IEEE Global Communication Conference; San Francisco; USA,2000,2
An object-oriented database management system for computer-aided design of tall buildings,Jingkui Liang; Tse Yung Paul Chang; Chun Man Chan,Abstract An effective database and database management system is the key to the successof an integrated approach to software engineering applications in general; and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for structural applications in particular. Due to the inherent nature ofCAD data such as dynamic modeling; a wide range of data types; large data volume; etc.;the traditional database models; such as hierarchical; network and relational models; areunable to handle the aforementioned applications satisfactorily. An object-oriented datamodeling is known to be the most effective approach. However; many of the commercialobject-oriented databases are designed for information management; and they areinadequate for CAD application due to the different features of the object-hierarchy andvarying data management objectives during the design cycles.

Uncertain Graph Sparsification,Panos Parchas; Nikolaos Papailiou; Dimitris Papadias; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract: Uncertain graphs are prevalent in several applications including communicationssystems; biological databases and social networks. The ever increasing size of theunderlying data renders both graph storage and query processing extremely expensive.Sparsification has often been used to reduce the size of deterministic graphs by maintainingonly the important edges. However; adaptation of deterministic sparsification methods failsin the uncertain setting. To overcome this problem; we introduce the first sparsificationtechniques aimed explicitly at uncertain graphs. The proposed methods reduce the numberof edges and redistribute their probabilities in order to decrease the graph size; whilepreserving its underlying structure. The resulting graph can be used to efficiently andaccurately approximate any query and mining tasks on the original graph. An extensive …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.04308,2016,1
Seismic response analysis of a coupled vehicle-bridge system,Qing Zeng; Elias G Dimitrakopoulos; Themelina S Paraskeva,Abstract. Traditionally; the traffic and the seismic dynamics have been consideredindependently when analyzing the seismic response of bridges. Given the ever increasingtraffic volume though; vehicles are more likely to encounter an earthquake while crossing abridge. Hence; there is a growing need to examine the dynamic vehicle-bridge interaction(VBI) under the simultaneous action of seismic ground motions. This study presents anoriginal framework to analyze the seismic response of a coupled vehicle-bridge systemduring earthquake excitation. The examined dynamical system consists of the vehiclesubsystem and the bridge subsystem. The two subsystems are coupled through the contactforces between the vehicle wheels and the bridge. The bridge subsystem is simulated withthe finite element method; while the truck vehicles are modelled as rigid body assemblies …,COMPDYN 2015; 5th ECCOMAS Thematic Conference on Computational Methods in Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering,2015,1

Such constructs arecalled tables; instead of relations. A table is an incomplete database; and represents a set ofcomplete databases; each obtained by substituting all variables with constants. Differentoccurrences of the same variable (marked null) are substituted with the same constant. Thesubstitution is thus a function from the variables and constants; to the constants; such thatthe function is identity on the constants.

Game-Theoretic Solutions for Constrained Geo-Social Event Organization,Lefteris Ntaflos; George Trimponias; Dimitris Papadias,ABSTRACT In Geo-Social Event Organization (GSEO); each user of a geo-social network isassigned to an event; so that the distance and social costs are minimized. Specifically; thedistance cost is the total distance between every user and his assigned event. The socialcost is measured in terms of the pairs of friends in different events. Intuitively; users shouldbe assigned to events in their vicinity; which are also recommended to their friends.Moreover; the events may have constraints on the number of users that they canaccommodate. GSEO is an NP-Hard problem. In this paper; we utilize a game-theoreticframework; where each user constitutes a player that wishes to minimize his own social anddistance cost.

Existing schemes aim at maximizing the utility of the publisheddata; while previous experimental evaluations analyze the privacy/utility trade-off. In thispaper we provide the first experimental evaluation of differentially private methods that goesbeyond utility; emphasizing also on another important aspect; namely efficiency. Towardsthis end; we first observe that all existing schemes are comprised of a small set of commonblocks. We then optimize and choose the best implementation for each block; determine thecombinations of blocks that capture the entire literature; and propose novel blockcombinations. We qualitatively assess the quality of the schemes based on the skyline ofefficiency and utility; ie; based on whether a method is dominated on both aspects or not …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.03440,2015,*
Differentially Private Histograms for Range-Sum Queries: A Modular Approach,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias,ABSTRACT We focus on the problem of differentially private histogram publication; for range-sum query answering. Specifically; we derive a histogram from a given dataset; such that (i)it satisfies ϵ-differential privacy; and (ii) it achieves high utility for queries that request thesum of contiguous histogram bins. Existing schemes are distinguished into two categories:fast but oblivious to utility optimizations that exploit the data characteristics; and data-awarebut slow. We are the first to address this problem with emphasis on both efficiency and utility.Towards this goal; we formulate a principled approach; which defines a small set of simplemodules; based on which we can devise a variety of more complex schemes. We firstexpress the state-of-the-art methods in terms of these modules; which allows us to identifythe performance bottlenecks. Next; we design novel efficient and effective schemes …,CoRR,2015,*

Algorithms for local sensor synchronization,Lixing Wang; Yin Yang; Xin Miao; Dimitris Papadias; Yunhao Liu,In a wireless sensor network (WSN); each sensor monitors environmental parameters; andreports its readings to a base station; possibly through other nodes. A sensor works incycles; in each of which it stays active for a fixed duration; and then sleeps until the nextcycle. The frequency of such cycles determines the portion of time that a sensor is active;and is the dominant factor on its battery life. The majority of existing work assumes globallysynchronized WSN where all sensors have the same frequency. This leads to waste ofbattery power for applications that entail different accuracy of measurements; orenvironments where sensor readings have large variability. To overcome this problem; wepropose LS; a query processing framework for locally synchronized WSN.

Adaptive Index Structures,Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Traditional indexes aim at optimizing the node accesses during query processing;which; however; does not necessarily minimize the total cost due to the possibly largenumber of random accesses. In this paper; we propose a general framework for adaptiveindexes that improve overall query cost. The performance gain is achieved by allowingindex nodes to contain a variable number of disk pages. Update algorithms dynamically re-structure adaptive indexes depending on the data and query characteristics. Extensiveexperiments show that adaptive B-and R-trees significantly outperform their conventionalcounterparts; while incurring minimal update overhead.,Proceedings 2002 VLDB Conference: 28th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB),2002,*

On cooperatively distributed ciphering and hashing,Cunsheng Ding; Arto Salomaa,Abstract In this paper we first bridge some problems of formal language theory to those ofcryptography. In doing so; new problems in both fields are proposed. Motivated by the CDgrammar systems [1]; we then describe a general cooperatively distributed ciphering systemand hashing system. These CD ciphering and hashing systems could be much morepowerful than conventional ones if they are properly designed. Keywords: Formallanguages; grammar systems; ciphers; hashing; authentication. TUCS Research Group"Mathematical Structures of Computer Science" 1 Introduction At a first look cryptography andformal languages seem to be quite different. Yet they are related. Formal languagesoriginate from natural and programming languages; and ciphers have been built overhuman languages for thousands of years. The root of these two fields is natural language …,*,1996,*
NCGIA,Theodoridis Yannis; Dimitris Papadias; Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Despite the attention that direction relations; such as east; southeast etc.; haveattracted in several domains related to Spatial Databases and Geographic InformationSystems (GIS); little work has been done on their formalization and efficient processing. Inthis paper we define direction relations between two-dimensional objects in different levelsof qualitative resolution and we show how these relations can be efficiently retrieved inexisting DBMSs using B-; KDB-and R-tree-based data structures. Since query processinginvolving direction relations maps into range queries in twodimensional space; our workessentially studies optimization techniques for 2D ranges. We test the efficiency ofalternative indexing methods through extensive experimentation and we present analyticalmodels that estimate their performance. The analytical estimates are proved to be very …,*,1995,*

IEEE TRANS. ON MOBILE COMPUTING 1 Continuous Monitoring of Spatial Queries in Wireless Broadcast Environments,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract—Wireless data broadcast is a promising technique for information disseminationthat leverages the computational capabilities of the mobile devices; in order to enhance thescalability of the system. Under this environment; the data are continuously broadcast by theserver; interleaved with some indexing information for query processing. Clients may thentune in the broadcast channel and process their queries locally without contacting theserver. Previous work on spatial query processing for wireless broadcast systems has onlyconsidered snapshot queries over static data. In this paper we propose an air indexingframework that (i) outperforms the existing (ie; snapshot) techniques in terms of energyconsumption; while achieving low access latency; and (ii) constitutes the first methodsupporting efficient processing of continuous spatial queries over moving objects.

Efficient historical R-trees,Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The Historical R-tree is a spatio-temporal access method aimed at the retrieval ofwindow queries in the past. The concept behind the method is to keep an R-tree for eachtimestamp in history; but allow consecutive trees to share branches when the underlyingobjects do not change. New branches are only created to accommodate updates from theprevious timestamp. Although existing implementations of HR-trees process timestamp(window) queries very efficiently; they are hardly applicable in practice due to excessivespace requirements and poor interval query performance. This paper addresses theseproblems by proposing the HR+-tree; which occupies a small fraction of the space requiredfor the corresponding HR-tree (for typical conditions about 20%); while improving intervalquery performance several times. Our claims are supported by extensive experimental …,*,*,*
