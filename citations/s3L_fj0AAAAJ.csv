Synthesizing an integrated ontology,Domenico Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,The Semantic Web exploits semantic markups to provide Web pages with machine-readabledenitions. It thus relies on the a priori existence of ontologies that represent the domains associatedwith the given information sources. This approach relies on the selected reference ontologysaccuracy; but we nd that most ontologies in common use are generic and that the annotationphase (in which semantic annotations connect Web page parts to ontology items) causes a lossof semantics. By involving the sources themselves; our approach builds an ontology that moreprecisely represents the domain. Moreover; the GVV is annotated according to a lexicalontology; which provides an easily understandable meaning to content … In this article; weuse Web documents as a representative information source to describe the Momis methodologysgeneral application.

Keyword search over relational databases: a metadata approach,Sonia Bergamaschi; Elton Domnori; Francesco Guerra; Raquel Trillo Lado; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Keyword queries offer a convenient alternative to traditional SQL in queryingrelational databases with large; often unknown; schemas and instances. The challenge inanswering such queries is to discover their intended semantics; construct the SQL queriesthat describe them and used them to retrieve the respective tuples. Existing approachestypically rely on indices built a-priori on the database content. This seriously limits theirapplicability if a-priori access to the database content is not possible. Examples include theon-line databases accessed through web interface; or the sources in information integrationsystems that operate behind wrappers with specific query capabilities. Furthermore; existingliterature has not studied to its full extend the inter-dependencies across the ways thedifferent keywords are mapped into the database values and schema elements.

The MOMIS approach to information integration,Domenico Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract Introduction The web explosion; both at internet and intranet level; has transformedthe electronic information system from single isolated node to an entry points into aworldwide network of information exchange and business transactions. Business andcommerce has taken the opportunity of the new technologies to define the e-commerceactivity. An electronic marketplace represents a virtual place where buyers and sellers meetto exchange goods and services; by sharing information that is often obtained as hypertextcatalogs from different companies. Companies have equipped themselves with data storingsystems building up informative systems containing data which are related one another; butwhich are often redundant; heterogeneous and not always substantial. The problems thathave to be faced in this field are mainly due to both structural and application …,*,2001,98
An information integration framework for e-commerce,Hario Benetti; Domenico Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,One of the main challenges for e-commerce infrastructure designers is to retrieve data fromdifferent sources and create a unified view that overcomes contradictions and redundancies.Virtual catalogs; such as the Momis project; can help synthesize data and present it in aunified manner to the customer.,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2002,71
A data integration framework for e-commerce product classification,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract A marketplace is the place in which the demand and supply of buyers and vendorsparticipating in a business process may meet. Therefore; electronic marketplaces are virtualcommunities in which buyers may meet proposals of several suppliers and make the bestchoice. In the electronic commerce world; the comparison between different products isblocked due to the lack of standards (on the contrary; the proliferation of standards)describing and classifying them. Therefore; the need for B2B and B2C marketplaces is toreclassify products and goods according to different standardization models. This paperaims to face this problem by suggesting the use of a semi-automatic methodology;supported by a tool (SI-Designer); to define the mapping among different e-commerceproduct classification standards. This methodology was developed for the MOMIS system …,International Semantic Web Conference,2002,49
Keymantic: semantic keyword-based searching in data integration systems,Sonia Bergamaschi; Elton Domnori; Francesco Guerra; Mirko Orsini; Raquel Trillo Lado; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose the demonstration of Keymantic; a system for keyword-basedsearching in relational databases that does not require a-priori knowledge of instances heldin a database. It finds numerous applications in situations where traditional keyword-basedsearching techniques are inapplicable due to the unavailability of the database contents forthe construction of the required indexes.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,38
Guest editors' introduction: Information overload,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Barry Leiba,Information overload occurs when the information available exceeds the user's ability toprocess it. To manage information overload; a user is required to discriminate among useful;redundant; incorrect; and meaningless information. From a computer science perspective;this means we must provide users with a combination of techniques and tools for collecting;grouping; classifying; selecting; indexing; ranking; and filtering useful information. Thearticles in this special issue show four different facets of the information overload problem;by providing the readers with a big picture of the main research outcomes in this topic.,IEEE Internet Computing,2010,34

QUEST: a keyword search system for relational data based on semantic and machine learning techniques,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Matteo Interlandi; Raquel Trillo-Lado; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We showcase QUEST (QUEry generator for STructured sources); a search enginefor relational databases that combines semantic and machine learning techniques fortransforming keyword queries into meaningful SQL queries. The search engine relies on twoapproaches: the forward; providing mappings of keywords into database terms (names oftables and attributes; and domains of attributes); and the backward; computing the pathsjoining the data structures identified in the forward step. The results provided by the twoapproaches are combined within a probabilistic framework based on the Dempster-ShaferTheory. We demonstrate QUEST capabilities; and we show how; thanks to the flexibilityobtained by the probabilistic combination of different techniques; QUEST is able to computehigh quality results even with few training data and/or with hidden data sources such as …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,32
A semantic approach to ETL technologies,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Mirko Orsini; Claudio Sartori; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract Data warehouse architectures rely on extraction; transformation and loading (ETL)processes for the creation of an updated; consistent and materialized view of a set of datasources. In this paper; we support these processes by proposing a tool that:(1) allows thesemi-automatic definition of inter-attribute semantic mappings; by identifying the parts of thedata source schemas which are related to the data warehouse schema; thus supporting theextraction process; and (2) groups the attribute values semantically related thus defining atransformation function for populating with homogeneous values the data warehouse. Ourproposal couples and extends the functionalities of two previously developed systems: theMOMIS integration system and the RELEVANT data analysis system.

Extracting relevant attribute values for improved search,Sonia Bergamaschi; Claudio Sartori; Francesco Guerra; Mirko Orsini,A new kind of metadata offers a synthesized view of an attribute's values for a user to exploitwhen creating or refining a search query in data-integration systems. The extractiontechnique that obtains these values is automatic and independent of an attribute domain butparameterized with various metrics for similarity measures. The authors describe a fullyimplemented prototype and some experimental results to show the effectiveness of" relevantvalues" when searching a knowledge base.,IEEE Internet Computing,2007,31
A hidden markov model approach to keyword-based search over relational databases,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Silvia Rota; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We present a novel method for translating keyword queries over relationaldatabases into SQL queries with the same intended semantic meaning. In contrast to themajority of the existing keyword-based techniques; our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge of the data instance. It follows a probabilistic approach based on a HiddenMarkov Model for computing the top-K best mappings of the query keywords into thedatabase terms; ie; tables; attributes and values. The mappings are then used to generatethe SQL queries that are executed to produce the answer to the keyword query. The methodhas been implemented into a system called KEYRY (from KEYword to queRY).,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2011,26
An incremental method for the lexical annotation of domain ontologies,Sonia Bergamaschi; Paolo Bouquet; Daniel Giazomuzzi; Francesco Guerra; Laura Po; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract In this article; we present MELIS (Meaning Elicitation and Lexical IntegrationSystem); a method and a software tool for enabling an incremental process of automaticannotation of local schemas (eg relational database schemas; directory trees) with lexicalinformation. The distinguishing and original feature of MELIS is the incremental process: thehigher the number of schemas which are processed; the more background/domainknowledge is cumulated in the system (a portion of domain ontology is learned at everystep); the better the performance of the systems on annotating new schemas. MELIS hasbeen tested as a component of the MOMIS-Ontology Builder; a framework able to create adomain ontology representing a set of selected data sources; described with a standardW3C language wherein concepts and attributes are annotated according to the lexical …,International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS),2007,25

In this chapter we will present anoverview of the most relevant research activities and ideas in the field investigated in the last20 years. We will also introduce the MOMIS system; a framework to perform informationextraction and integration from both structured and semistructured data sources; that is oneof the most interesting results of our research activity. An open source version of the MOMISsystem was delivered by the academic startup DataRiver (www. datariver. it).,*,2011,23
A peer-to-peer information system for the semantic web,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract Data integration; in the context of the web; faces new problems; due in particular tothe heterogeneity of sources; to the fragmentation of the information and to the absence of aunique way to structure and view information. In such areas; the traditional paradigms; onwhich database foundations are based (ie client server architecture; few sources containinglarge information); have to be overcome by new architectures. The peer-to-peer (P2P)architecture seems to be the best way to fulfill these new kinds of data sources; offering analternative to traditional client/server architecture. In this paper we present the SEWASIEsystem that aims at providing access to heterogeneous web information sources. Anenhancement of the system architecture in the direction of P2P architecture; whereconnections among SEWASIE peers rely on exchange of XML metadata; is described.,International Workshop on Agents and P2P Computing,2003,22
Supporting information integration with autonomous agents,Sonia Bergamaschi; Giacomo Cabri; Francesco Guerra; Letizia Leonardi; Maurizio Vincini; Franco Zambonelli,Abstract The large amount of information that is spread over the Internet is an importantresource for all people but also introduces some issues that must be faced. The dynamismand the uncertainty of the Internet; along with the heterogeneity of the sources of informationare the two main challenges for the today's technologies. This paper proposes an approachbased on mobile agents integrated in an information integration infrastructure. Mobileagents can significantly improve the design and the development of Internet applicationsthanks to their characteristics of autonomy and adaptability to open and distributedenvironments; such as the Internet.

Querying a super-peer in a schema-based super-peer network,Domenico Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract We propose a novel approach for defining and querying a super-peer within aschema-based super-peer network organized into a two-level architecture: the low level;called the peer level (which contains a mediator node); the second one; called super-peerlevel (which integrates mediators peers with similar content). We focus on a single super-peer and propose a method to define and solve a query; fully implemented in the SEWASIEproject prototype. The problem we faced is relevant as a super-peer is a two-level dataintegrated system; then we are going beyond traditional setting in data integration. We havetwo different levels of Global as View mappings: the first mapping is at the super-peer leveland maps several Global Virtual Views (GVVs) of peers into the GVV of the super-peer; thesecond mapping is within a peer and maps the data sources into the GVV of the peer …,*,2007,21

MIKS: an agent framework supporting information access and integration,Domenico Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Gionata Gelati; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract Providing an integrated access to multiple heterogeneous sources is a challengingissue in global information systems for cooperation and interoperability. In the past;companies have equipped themselves with data storing systems building up informativesystems containing data that are related one another; but which are often redundant; nothomogeneous and not always semantically consistent. Moreover; to meet the requirementsof global; Internet-based information systems; it is important that the tools developed forsupporting these activities are semi-automatic and scalable as much as possible. To facethe issues related to scalability in the large-scale; in this paper we propose the exploitationof mobile agents in the information integration area; and; in particular; their integration in theMOMIS infrastructure.

Aggregated search of data and services,Matteo Palmonari; Antonio Sala; Andrea Maurino; Francesco Guerra; Gabriella Pasi; Giuseppe Frisoni,Abstract From a user perspective; data and services provide a complementary view of aninformation source: data provide detailed information about specific needs; while servicesexecute processes involving data and returning an informative result as well. For thisreason; users need to perform aggregated searches to identify not only relevant data; butalso services able to operate on them. At the current state of the art such aggregated searchcan be only manually performed by expert users; who first identify relevant data; and thenidentify existing relevant services. In this paper we propose a semantic approach to performaggregated search of data and services. In particular; we define a technique that; on thebasis of an ontological representation of both data and services related to a domain;supports the translation of a data query into a service discovery process.

Semantic search over the web,Roberto De Virgilio; Francesco Guerra; Yannis Velegrakis,The Web has become the world's largest database; with search being the main tool thatallows organizations and individuals to exploit its huge amount of information. Search on theWeb has been traditionally based on textual and structural similarities; ignoring to a largedegree the semantic dimension; ie; understanding the meaning of the query and of thedocument content. Combining search and semantics gives birth to the idea of semanticsearch. Traditional search engines have already advertised some semantic dimensions.Some of them; for instance; can enhance their generated result sets with documents that aresemantically related to the query terms even though they may not include these terms.Nevertheless; the exploitation of the semantic search has not yet reached its full potential.

The SEWASIE network of mediator agents for semantic search.,Domenico Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract: Integration of heterogeneous information in the context of Internet becomes a keyactivity to enable a more organized and semantically meaningful access to data sources. AsInternet can be viewed as a data-sharing network where sites are data sources; thechallenge is twofold. Firstly; sources present information according to their particular view ofthe matter; ie each of them assumes a specific ontology. Then; data sources are usuallyisolated; ie they do not share any topological information concerning the content or thestructure of other sources. The classical approach to solve these issues is provided bymediator systems which aim at creating a unified virtual view of the underlying data sourcesin order to hide the heterogeneity of data and give users a transparent access to theintegrated information.

SI-Designer: an Integration Framework for E-commerce,Ilario Benetti; D Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; M Vincini,Abstract Electronic commerce lets people purchase goods and exchange information onbusiness transactions on-line. Therefore one of the main challenges for the designers of thee-commerce infrastructures is the information sharing; retrieving data located in differentsources thus obtaining an integrated view to overcome any contradiction or redundancy.Virtual Catalogs synthesize this approach as they are conceived as instruments todynamically retrieve information from multiple catalogs and present product data in a unifiedmanner; without directly storing product data from catalogs.

In this paper; we present the List Viterbitraining algorithm; a version of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm based on theList Viterbi algorithm instead of the commonly used forward-backward algorithm. Wedeveloped the batch and online versions of the algorithm; and we also describe aninteresting application in the context of keyword search over databases; where we exploit aHMM for matching keywords into database terms. In our experiments we tested the onlineversion of the training algorithm in a semi-supervised setting that allows us to take intoaccount the feedbacks provided by the users.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,6

KEYRY: a keyword-based search engine over relational databases based on a hidden Markov model,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Silvia Rota; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose the demonstration of KEYRY; a tool for translating keyword queriesover structured data sources into queries in the native language of the data source. KEYRYdoes not assume any prior knowledge of the source contents. This allows it to be used insituations where traditional keyword search techniques over structured data that requiresuch a knowledge cannot be applied; ie; sources on the hidden web or those behindwrappers in integration systems. In KEYRY the search process is modeled as a HiddenMarkov Model and the List Viterbi algorithm is applied to computing the top-k queries thatbetter represent the intended meaning of a user keyword query. We demonstrate the tool'scapabilities; and we show how the tool is able to improve its behavior over time by exploitingimplicit user feedback provided through the selection among the top-k solutions …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2011,5
Instances navigation for querying integrated data from web-sites,Domenico Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Stefania Bruschi; Francesco Guerra; Mirko Orsini; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract Research on data integration has provided a set of rich and well understoodschema mediation languages and systems that provide a meta-data representation of themodeled real world; while; in general; they do not deal with data instances. Such meta-dataare necessary for querying classes result of an integration process: the end user typicallydoes not know the contents of such classes; he simply defines his queries on the basis of thenames of classes and attributes. In this paper we introduce an approach enriching thedescription of selected attributes specifying as meta-data a list of the “relevant values” forsuch attributes. Furthermore relevant values may be hierarchically collected in a taxonomy.In this way; the user may exploit new meta-data in the interactive process of creating/refininga query. The same meta-data are also exploited by the system in the query rewriting …,*,2007,5
Mapping and integration of dimensional attributes using clustering techniques,Francesco Guerra; Marius-Octavian Olaru; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract Following recent trends in Data Warehousing; companies realized that there is agreat potential in combining their information repositories to obtain a broader view of theeconomical market. Unfortunately; even though Data Warehouse (DW) integration has beendefined from a theoretical point of view; until now no complete; widely used methodologyhas been proposed to support the integration of the information coming from heterogeneousDWs. This paper deals with the automatic integration of dimensional attributes fromheterogeneous DWs. A method relying on topological properties that similar dimensionsmaintain is proposed for discovering mappings of dimensions; and a technique based onclustering algorithms is introduced for integrating the data associated to the dimensions.,International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies,2012,4

Supporting image search with tag clouds: a preliminary approach,Francesco Guerra; Giovanni Simonini; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract Algorithms and techniques for searching in collections of data address achallenging task; since they have to bridge the gap between the ways in which usersexpress their interests; through natural language expressions or keywords; and the ways inwhich data is represented and indexed. When the collections of data include images; thetask becomes harder; mainly for two reasons. From one side the user expresses his needsthrough one medium (text) and he will obtain results via another medium (some images).From the other side; it can be difficult for a user to understand the results retrieved; that iswhy a particular image is part of the result set. In this case; some techniques for analyzingthe query results and giving to the users some insight into the content retrieved are needed.In this paper; we propose to address this problem by coupling the image result set with a …,Advances in Multimedia,2015,3
Keyword search and evaluation over relational databases: an outlook to the future,Sonia Bergamaschi; Nicola Ferro; Francesco Guerra; Gianmaria Silvello,Abstract This position paper discusses the need for considering keyword search overrelational databases in the light of broader systems; where keyword search is just one of thecomponents and which are aimed at better supporting users in their search tasks. Thesemore complex systems call for appropriate evaluation methodologies which go beyond whatis typically done today; ie measuring performances of components mostly in isolation or notrelated to the actual user needs; and; instead; able to consider the system as a whole; itsconstituent components; and their inter-relations with the ultimate goal of supporting actualuser search tasks.,Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Ranking in Databases,2013,3
Understanding linked open data through keyword searching: the KEYRY approach,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Silvia Rota; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We introduce KEYRY; a tool for translating keyword queries over structured datasources into queries formulated in their native query language. Since it is not based onanalysis of the data source contents; KEYRY finds application in scenarios where sourceshold complex and huge schemas; apt to frequent changes; such as sources belonging to thelinked open data cloud. KEYRY is based on a probabilistic approach that provides the top-kresults that better approximate the intended meaning of the user query.,Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Linked Web Data Management,2011,3
A New Type of Metadata for Querying Data Integration Systems.,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Mirko Orsini; Claudio Sartori,Abstract. Research on data integration has provided languages and systems able toguarantee an integrated intensional representation of a given set of data sources. Asignificant limitation common to most proposals is that only intensional knowledge isconsidered; with little or no consideration for extensional knowledge. In this paper wepropose a technique to enrich the intension of an attribute with a new sort of metadata: the“relevant values”; extracted from the attribute values. Relevant values enrich schemata withdomain knowledge; moreover they can be exploited by a user in the interactive process ofcreating/refining a query. The technique; fully implemented in a prototype; is automatic;independent of the attribute domain and it is based on data mining clustering techniquesand emerging semantics from data values.

Toward a unified view of data and services,Matteo Palmonari; Francesco Guerra; Andrea Turati; Andrea Maurino; Domenico Beneventano; Emanuele Della Valle; A Sala; D Cerizza,We propose an approach for describing a unified view of dataand services in a peer-to-peerenvironment. The researchareas of data and services are usually represented with dif-ferentmodels and queried by different tools with differentrequirements. Our approach aims atproviding the user witha “complete” knowledge (in terms of data and services) ofa domain.Our proposal is not alternative to the techniquesdeveloped for representing and queryingintegrated data anddiscovering services; but works in conjunction with them byimproving theuser knowledge.

Synthesizing an integrated ontology with MOMIS,Roberta Benassi; Domenico Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract–The Mediator EnvirOnment for Multiple Information Sources (MOMIS) aims atconstructing synthesized; integrated descriptions of the information coming from multipleheterogeneous sources; in order to provide the user with a global virtual view of the sourcesindependent from their location and the level of heterogeneity of their data. Such a globalvirtual view is a conceptualization of the underlying domain and then may be thought of asan ontology describing the involved sources. In this article we explore the framework's mainelements and discuss how the output of the integration process can be exploited to create aconceptualization of the underlying domain,International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Decision Support (ICKEDS).

Discovering the topics of a data source: a statistical approach,Sonia Bergamaschi; Davide Ferrari; Francesco Guerra; Giovanni Simonini,Abstract. In this paper; we present a preliminary approach for automatically discovering thetopics of a structured data source with respect to a reference ontology. Our technique relieson a signature; ie; a weighted graph that summarizes the content of a source. Graph-basedapproaches have been already used in the literature for similar purposes. In theseproposals; the weights are typically assigned using traditional information-theoreticalquantities such as entropy and mutual information. Here; we propose a novel data-driventechnique based on composite likelihood to estimate the weights and other main features ofthe graphs; making the resulting approach less sensitive to overfitting. By means of acomparison of signatures; we can easily discover the topic of a target data source withrespect to a reference ontology. This task is provided by a matching algorithm that …,Proceedings of the Workshop on Surfacing the Deep and the Social Web Co-located with the 13th International Semantic Web Conference,2014,2

An agent framework for supporting the MIKS integration process.,Domenico Beneventano; Sonia Bergamaschi; Gionata Gelati; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract—Providing an integrated access to multiple hetero-geneous sources is achallenging issue in global information systems for cooperation and interoperability. In thepast; companies have equipped themselves with data storing systems building upinformative systems containing data that are related one another; but which are oftenredundant; not homogeneous and not always semantically consistent. Moreover; to meet therequirements of global; Internet-based information systems; it is important that the toolsdeveloped for supporting these activities are semi-automatic and scalable as much aspossible. To face the issues related to scalability in the large-scale; in this paper we proposethe exploitation of mobile agents in the information integration area; and; in particular; theroles they play in enhancing the feature of the MOMIS infrastructure.

Using big data to support automatic Word Sense Disambiguation,Giovanni Simonini; Francesco Guerra,Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) usually relies on data structures built upon the words tobe disambiguated. This is a time-consuming process that requires a huge computationaleffort. In this paper; we propose an approach to automatically build a generic senseinventory (called iSC) to be used as a reference for disambiguation. The sense inventory isbuilt extracting insight from Big Data exploiting a community detection algorithm. Sincegenerate taking into account large corpora of data; the iSC is independent of the domain ofapplication and of predefined target words.,High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS); 2014 International Conference on,2014,1

Understanding the Semantics of Keyword Queries on Relational Data Without Accessing the Instance,Sonia Bergamaschi; Elton Domnori; Francesco Guerra; Silvia Rota; Raquel Trillo Lado; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract The simplicity of keyword queries has made them particularly attractive to thetechnically unskilled user base; tending to become the de facto standard for querying on theweb. Unfortunatelly; alongside its simplicity; came also the loose semantics. Researchershave; for a long time; studied ways to understand the keyword query semantics and retrievethe most relevant data artifacts. For the web; these artifacts were documents; thus; anysemantics discovering effort was based mainly on statistics about the appearance of thekeywords in the documents. Recently; there has been an increasing interest in publishingstructural data on the web; allowing users to exploit valuable resources that have so farbeen kept private within companies and organizations. These sources support onlystructural queries. If they are to become available on the web and be queried; the queries …,*,2012,1
Searching for data and services,Francesco Guerra; Andrea Maurino; Matteo Palmonari; Gabriella Pasi; Antonio Sala,Abstract. The increasing availability of data and eServices on the Web allows users tosearch for relevant information and to perform operations through eServices. Currenttechnologies do not support users in the execution of such activities as a unique task; thususers have first to find interesting information; and then; as a separate activity; to find anduse eServices. In this paper we present a framework able to query an integrated view ofheterogeneous data and to search for eServices related to retrieved data.,Camogli (Genova); Italy June 25th; 2009 Co-located with SEBD,2009,1
SOAP-enabled web services for knowledge management,Ilario Benetti; Francesco Guerra; Maurizio Vincini; Sonia Bergamaschi,The widespread diffusion of the World Wide Web among medium/small companies yields ahuge amount of information to make business available online. Nevertheless theheterogeneity of that information; forces even trading partners involved in the same businessprocess to face daily interoperability issues. The challenge is the integration of distributedbusiness processes; which; in turn; means integration of heterogeneous data coming fromdistributed sources. This paper presents the new web services-based architecture of theMOMIS (Mediator envirOnment for Multiple Information Sources) framework that enhancesthe semantic integration features of MOMIS; leveraging new technologies such as XML webservices and the SOAP protocol.

Inthis paper we propose intelligent; tool-supported techniques for querying global informationsystems integrating both structured and semistructured data sources. The techniques havebeen developed in the environment of a data integration; wrapper/mediator based system;MOMIS; and try to achieve two main goals: optimized query reformulation wrt local sourcesand object fusion; ie grouping together information (from the same or different sources)about the same real-world entity. The developed techniques rely on the availability ofintegrationknowledge; ie local source schemata; a virtual mediated schema and its mappingdescriptions; that is semantic mappings wrt the underlying sources both at the intensional …,Sistemi Evoluti per Basi di Dati (SEBD 2001),2001,1

Exploiting Agents to Support Information Integration,G Cabri; F Guerra; M Vincini; S Bergamaschi; L Leonardi; F Zambonelli,Abstract. Information overloading introduced by the large amount of data that is spread overthe Internet must be faced in an appropriate way. The dynamism and the uncertainty of theInternet; along with the heterogeneity of the sources of information are the two mainchallenges for the today's technologies related to information management. In the area ofinformation integration; this paper proposes an approach based on mobile software agentsintegrated in the MOMIS (Mediator envirOnment for Multiple Information Sources)infrastructure; which enables semi-automatic information integration to deal with theintegration and query of multiple; heterogeneous information sources (relational; object;XML and semi-structured sources). The exploitation of mobile agents in MOMIS cansignificantly increase the flexibility of the system. In fact; their characteristics of autonomy …,*,*,*
