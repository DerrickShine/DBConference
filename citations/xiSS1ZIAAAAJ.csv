Scalable distance-based outlier detection over high-volume data streams,Lei Cao; Di Yang; Qingyang Wang; Yanwei Yu; Jiayuan Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner,The discovery of distance-based outliers from huge volumes of streaming data is critical formodern applications ranging from credit card fraud detection to moving object monitoring. Inthis work; we propose the first general framework to handle the three major classes ofdistance-based outliers in streaming environments; including the traditional distance-threshold based and the nearest-neighbor-based definitions. Our LEAP frameworkencompasses two general optimization principles applicable across all three outlier types.First; our “minimal probing” principle uses a lightweight probing operation to gather minimalyet sufficient evidence for outlier detection. This principle overturns the state-of-the-artmethodology that requires routinely conducting expensive complete neighborhood searchesto identify outliers. Second; our “lifespan-aware prioritization” principle leverages the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,35
Detecting moving object outliers in massive-scale trajectory streams,Yanwei Yu; Lei Cao; Elke A Rundensteiner; Qin Wang,Abstract The detection of abnormal moving objects over high-volume trajectory streams iscritical for real time applications ranging from military surveillance to transportationmanagement. Yet this problem remains largely unexplored. In this work; we first proposeclasses of novel trajectory outlier definitions that model the anomalous behavior of movingobjects for a large range of real time applications. Our theoretical analysis and empiricalstudy on the Beijing Taxi and GMTI (Ground Moving Target Indicator) datasets demonstrateits effectiveness in capturing abnormal moving objects. Furthermore we propose a generalstrategy for efficiently detecting the new outlier classes. It features three fundamentaloptimization principles designed to minimize the detection costs.

VSOutlier not only supports a rich variety of outlier typessupported by innovative and efficient outlier detection strategies; but also provides a rich setof interactive interfaces to explore outliers in real time. Using the stock transactions datasetfrom the US stock market and the moving objects dataset from MITRE; we demonstrate thatthe VSOutlier system enables analysts to more efficiently identify; understand; and respondto phenomena of interest in near real-time even when applied to high volume streams.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,17
Online outlier exploration over large datasets,Lei Cao; Mingrui Wei; Di Yang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Traditional outlier detection systems process each individual outlier detectionrequest instantiated with a particular parameter setting one at a time. This is not onlyprohibitively time-consuming for large datasets; but also tedious for analysts as they explorethe data to hone in on the appropriate parameter setting and desired results. In this work; wepresent the first online outlier exploration platform; called ONION; that enables analysts toeffectively explore anomalies even in large datasets. First; ONION features an innovativeinteractive anomaly exploration model that offers an" outlier-centric panorama" into bigdatasets along with rich classes of exploration operations.

Complex event analytics: Online aggregation of stream sequence patterns,Yingmei Qi; Lei Cao; Medhabi Ray; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technology of choice for high performanceanalytics in time-critical decision-making applications. Yet while effective technologies forcomplex pattern detection on continuous event streams have been developed; the problemof scalable online aggregation of such patterns has been overlooked. Instead; aggregationis typically applied as a post processing step after CEP pattern detection; leading to anextremely ineffective solution. In this paper; we demonstrate that CEP aggregation can bepushed into the sequence construction process. Based on this insight our A-Seq strategysuccessfully aggregates sequence pattern online without ever constructing sequencematches. This drives down the complexity of the CEP aggregation problem from polynomialto linear. We further extend our A-Seq strategy to support the shared processing of …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,9
High performance stream query processing with correlation-aware partitioning,Lei Cao; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract State-of-the-art optimizers produce one single optimal query plan for all streamdata; in spite of such a singleton plan typically being sub-optimal or even poor for highlycorrelated data. Recently a new stream processing paradigm; called multi-route approach;has emerged as a promising approach for tackling this problem. Multi-route first divides datastreams into several partitions and then creates a separate query plan for each combinationof partitions. Unfortunately current approaches suffer from severe shortcomings; in particular;the lack of an effective partitioning strategy and the prohibitive query optimization expense.In this work we propose the first practical multi-route optimizer named< u> c</u> orrelation-aware< u> m</u> ulti-< u> r</u> oute stream query optimizer (or CMR) that solves bothproblems. By exploiting both intra-and inter-stream correlations of streams; CMR …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,8
Sharing-aware outlier analytics over high-volume data streams,Lei Cao; Jiayuan Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Real-time analytics of anomalous phenomena on streaming data typically relies onprocessing a large variety of continuous outlier detection requests; each configured withdifferent parameter settings. The processing of such complex outlier analytics workloads isresource consuming due to the algorithmic complexity of the outlier mining process. In thiswork we propose a sharing-aware multi-query execution strategy for outlier detection ondata streams called SOP. A key insight of SOP is to transform the problem of handling a multi-query outlier analytics workload into a single-query skyline computation problem. We provethat the output of the skyline computation process corresponds to the minimal informationneeded for determining the outlier status of any point in the stream. Based on this newformulation; we design a customized skyline algorithm called K-SKY that leverages the …,SIGMOD 2016,2016,6
Distributed Local Outlier Detection in Big Data,Yizhou Yan; Lei Cao; Caitlin Kulhman; Elke Rundensteiner,Abstract In this work; we present the first distributed solution for the Local Outlier Factor(LOF) method--a popular outlier detection technique shown to be very effective for datasetswith skewed distributions. As datasets increase radically in size; highly scalable LOFalgorithms leveraging modern distributed infrastructures are required. This poses significantchallenges due to the complexity of the LOF definition; and a lack of access to the entiredataset at any individual compute machine. Our solution features a distributed LOF pipelineframework; called DLOF. Each stage of the LOF computation is conducted in a fullydistributed fashion by leveraging our invariant observation for intermediate valuemanagement. Furthermore; we propose a data assignment strategy which ensures that eachmachine is self-sufficient in all stages of the LOF pipeline; while minimizing the number of …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,2

Scalable Top-n Local Outlier Detection,Yizhou Yan; Lei Cao; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method that labels all points with their respective LOFscores to indicate their status is known to be very effective for identifying outliers in datasetswith a skewed distribution. Since outliers by definition are the absolute minority in a dataset;the concept of Top-N local outlier was proposed to discover the n points with the largest LOFscores. The detection of the Top-N local outliers is prohibitively expensive; since it requireshuge number of high complexity k-nearest neighbor (kNN) searches. In this work; wepresent the first scalable Top-N local outlier detection approach called TOLF. The keyinnovation of TOLF is a multi-granularity pruning strategy that quickly prunes most pointsfrom the set of potential outlier candidates without computing their exact LOF scores or evenwithout conducting any kNN search for them.

Pivot-based Distributed K-Nearest Neighbor Mining,Caitlin Kuhlman; Yizhou Yan; Lei Cao; Elke Rundensteiner,Abstract k-nearest neighbor (k NN) search is a fundamental data mining task critical to manydata analytics methods. Yet no effective techniques to date scale k NN search to largedatasets. In this work we present PkNN; an exact distributed method that by leveragingmodern distributed architectures for the first time scales k NN search to billion point datasets.The key to the PkNN strategy is a multi-round kNN search that exploits pivot-based datapartitioning at each stage. This includes an outlier-driven partition adjustment mechanismthat effectively minimizes data duplication and achieves a balanced workload across thecompute cluster. Aggressive data-driven bounds along with a tiered support assignmentstrategy ensure correctness while limiting computation costs.

Distributed Top-N local outlier detection in big data,Yizhou Yan; Lei Cao; Elke Rundensteiner,The concept of Top-N local outlier that focuses on the detection of the N points with thelargest Local Outlier Factor (LOF) score has been shown to be very effective for identifyingoutliers in big datasets. However; detecting Top-N local outliers is computationallyexpensive; since the computation of LOF scores for all data points requires a huge numberof high complexity k-nearest neighbor (kNN) searches. In this work; we thus present the firstdistributed solution to tackle this problem of Top-N local outlier detection (DTOLF). First;DTOLF features an innovative safe elimination strategy that efficiently identifies dually-safepoints; namely those that are guaranteed to (1) not be classified as Top-N outliers and (2)not be needed as neighbors of points residing on other machines. Therefore; it effectivelyminimizes both the processing and communication costs of the Top-N outlier detection …,IEEE Big Data 2017,2017,*
