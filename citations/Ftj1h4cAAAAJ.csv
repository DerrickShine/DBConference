Classification and novel class detection in concept-drifting data streams under time constraints,Mohammad Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani M Thuraisingham,Most existing data stream classification techniques ignore one important aspect of streamdata: arrival of a novel class. We address this issue and propose a data stream classificationtechnique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers;enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel classinstances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presenceof concept-drift; when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order todetermine whether an instance belongs to a novel class; the classification model sometimesneeds to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. Amaximum allowable wait time T c is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance.Furthermore; most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,243
Outlier Detection for Temporal Data: A Survey,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Charu Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,In the statistics community; outlier detection for time series data has been studied fordecades. Recently; with advances in hardware and software technology; there has been alarge body of work on temporal outlier detection from a computational perspective within thecomputer science community. In particular; advances in hardware technology have enabledthe availability of various forms of temporal data collection mechanisms; and advances insoftware technology have enabled a variety of data management mechanisms. This hasfueled the growth of different kinds of data sets such as data streams; spatio-temporal data;distributed streams; temporal networks; and time series data; generated by a multitude ofapplications. There arises a need for an organized and detailed study of the work done inthe area of outlier detection with respect to such temporal datasets. In this survey; we …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE),2014,233
Knowledge transfer via multiple model local structure mapping,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Jing Jiang; Jiawei Han,Abstract The effectiveness of knowledge transfer using classification algorithms depends onthe difference between the distribution that generates the training examples and the onefrom which test examples are to be drawn. The task can be especially difficult when thetraining examples are from one or several domains different from the test domain. In thispaper; we propose a locally weighted ensemble framework to combine multiple models fortransfer learning; where the weights are dynamically assigned according to a model'spredictive power on each test example. It can integrate the advantages of various learningalgorithms and the labeled information from multiple training domains into one unifiedclassification model; which can then be applied on a different domain. Importantly; differentfrom many previously proposed methods; none of the base learning method is required to …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,230
Multi-view clustering via joint nonnegative matrix factorization,Jialu Liu; Chi Wang; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many real-world datasets are comprised of different representations or views whichoften provide information complementary to each other. To integrate information frommultiple views in the unsupervised setting; multi-view clustering algorithms have beendeveloped to cluster multiple views simultaneously to derive a solution which uncovers thecommon latent structure shared by multiple views. In this paper; we propose a novel NMF-based multi-view clustering algorithm by searching for a factorization that gives compatibleclustering solutions across multiple views. The key idea is to formulate a joint matrixfactorization process with the constraint that pushes clustering solution of each view towardsa common consensus instead of fixing it directly. The main challenge is how to keepclustering solutions across different views meaningful and comparable. To tackle this …,*,2013,215
A general framework for mining concept-drifting data streams with skewed distributions,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Abstract In recent years; there have been some interesting studies on predictive modeling indata streams. However; most such studies assume relatively balanced and stable datastreams but cannot handle well rather skewed (eg; few positives but lots of negatives) andstochastic distributions; which are typical in many data stream applications. In this paper; wepropose a new approach to mine data streams by estimating reliable posterior probabilitiesusing an ensemble of models to match the distribution over under-samples of negatives andrepeated samples of positives. We formally show some interesting and important propertiesof the proposed framework; eg; reliability of estimated probabilities on skewed positive class;accuracy of estimated probabilities; efficiency and scalability. Experiments are performed onseveral synthetic as well as real-world datasets with skewed distributions; and they …,Proc 7th int conf on data mining; SIAM; Philadelphia; PA,2007,194
On community outliers and their efficient detection in information networks,Jing Gao; Feng Liang; Wei Fan; Chi Wang; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Linked or networked data are ubiquitous in many applications. Examples includeweb data or hypertext documents connected via hyperlinks; social networks or user profilesconnected via friend links; co-authorship and citation information; blog data; movie reviewsand so on. In these datasets (called" information networks"); closely related objects thatshare the same properties or interests form a community. For example; a community inblogsphere could be users mostly interested in cell phone reviews and news. Outlierdetection in information networks can reveal important anomalous and interesting behaviorsthat are not obvious if community information is ignored. An example could be a low-incomeperson being friends with many rich people even though his income is not anomalously lowwhen considered over the entire population.

On appropriate assumptions to mine data streams: Analysis and practice,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of studies in stream mining; which aimat building an accurate model for continuously arriving data. Somehow most existing workmakes the implicit assumption that the training data and the yet-to-come testing data arealways sampled from the" same distribution"; and yet this" same distribution" evolves overtime. We demonstrate that this may not be true; and one actually may never know either"how" or" when" the distribution changes. Thus; a model that fits well on the observeddistribution can have unsatisfactory accuracy on the incoming data. Practically; one can justassume the bare minimum that learning from observed data is better than both randomguessing and always predicting exactly the same class label. Importantly; we formally andexperimentally demonstrate the robustness of a model averaging and simple voting …,Data Mining; 2007. ICDM 2007. Seventh IEEE International Conference on,2007,168
Graph regularized transductive classification on heterogeneous information networks,Ming Ji; Yizhou Sun; Marina Danilevsky; Jiawei Han; Jing Gao,Abstract A heterogeneous information network is a network composed of multiple types ofobjects and links. Recently; it has been recognized that strongly-typed heterogeneousinformation networks are prevalent in the real world. Sometimes; label information isavailable for some objects. Learning from such labeled and unlabeled data via transductiveclassification can lead to good knowledge extraction of the hidden network structure.However; although classification on homogeneous networks has been studied for decades;classification on heterogeneous networks has not been explored until recently. In this paper;we consider the transductive classification problem on heterogeneous networked datawhich share a common topic. Only some objects in the given network are labeled; and weaim to predict labels for all types of the remaining objects.

Direct mining of discriminative and essential frequent patterns via model-based search tree,Wei Fan; Kun Zhang; Hong Cheng; Jing Gao; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Philip Yu; Olivier Verscheure,Abstract Frequent patterns provide solutions to datasets that do not have well-structuredfeature vectors. However; frequent pattern mining is non-trivial since the number of uniquepatterns is exponential but many are non-discriminative and correlated. Currently; frequentpattern mining is performed in two sequential steps: enumerating a set of frequent patterns;followed by feature selection. Although many methods have been proposed in the past fewyears on how to perform each separate step efficiently; there is still limited success ineventually finding highly compact and discriminative patterns. The culprit is due to theinherent nature of this widely adopted two-step approach. This paper discusses theseproblems and proposes a new and different method. It builds a decision tree that partitionsthe data onto different nodes. Then at each node; it directly discovers a discriminative …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,136
A practical approach to classify evolving data streams: Training with limited amount of labeled data,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Recent approaches in classifying evolving data streams are based on supervised learningalgorithms; which can be trained with labeled data only. Manual labeling of data is bothcostly and time consuming. Therefore; in a real streaming environment; where hugevolumes of data appear at a high speed; labeled data may be very scarce. Thus; only alimited amount of training data may be available for building the classification models;leading to poorly trained classifiers. We apply a novel technique to overcome this problemby building a classification model from a training set having both unlabeled and a smallamount of labeled instances. This model is built as micro-clusters using semisupervisedclustering technique and classification is performed with κ-nearest neighbor algorithm. Anensemble of these models is used to classify the unlabeled data. Empirical evaluation on …,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on,2008,131
Resolving Conflicts in Heterogeneous Data by Truth Discovery and Source Reliability Estimation,Qi Li; Yaliang Li; Jing Gao; Bo Zhao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Abstract In many applications; one can obtain descriptions about the same objects or eventsfrom a variety of sources. As a result; this will inevitably lead to data or information conflicts.One important problem is to identify the true information (ie; the truths) among conflictingsources of data. It is intuitive to trust reliable sources more when deriving the truths; but it isusually unknown which one is more reliable a priori. Moreover; each source possesses avariety of properties with different data types. An accurate estimation of source reliability hasto be made by modeling multiple properties in a unified model. Existing conflict resolutionwork either does not conduct source reliability estimation; or models multiple propertiesseparately. In this paper; we propose to resolve conflicts among multiple sources ofheterogeneous data types. We model the problem using an optimization framework …,Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD 2014),2014,128
itopicmodel: Information network-integrated topic modeling,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Jing Gao; Yintao Yu,Document networks; ie; networks associated with text information; are becomingincreasingly popular due to the ubiquity of Web documents; blogs; and various kinds ofonline data. In this paper; we propose a novel topic modeling framework for documentnetworks; which builds a unified generative topic model that is able to consider both text andstructure information for documents. A graphical model is proposed to describe thegenerative model. On the top layer of this graphical model; we define a novel multivariateMarkov Random Field for topic distribution random variables for each document; to modelthe dependency relationships among documents over the network structure. On the bottomlayer; we follow the traditional topic model to model the generation of text for eachdocument.

Multistep-ahead time series prediction,Haibin Cheng; Pang-Ning Tan; Jing Gao; Jerry Scripps,Abstract Multistep-ahead prediction is the task of predicting a sequence of values in a timeseries. A typical approach; known as multi-stage prediction; is to apply a predictive modelstep-by-step and use the predicted value of the current time step to determine its value in thenext time step. This paper examines two alternative approaches known as independentvalue prediction and parameter prediction. The first approach builds a separate model foreach prediction step using the values observed in the past. The second approach fits aparametric function to the time series and builds models to predict the parameters of thefunction. We perform a comparative study on the three approaches using multiple linearregression; recurrent neural networks; and a hybrid of hidden Markov model with multiplelinear regression. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are analyzed in …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2006,104
Addressing concept-evolution in concept-drifting data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Qing Chen; Latifur Khan; Charu Aggarwal; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,The problem of data stream classification is challenging because of many practical aspectsassociated with efficient processing and temporal behavior of the stream. Two such wellstudied aspects are infinite length and concept-drift. Since a data stream may be considereda continuous process; which is theoretically infinite in length; it is impractical to store and useall the historical data for training. Data streams also frequently experience concept-drift as aresult of changes in the underlying concepts. However; another important characteristic ofdata streams; namely; concept-evolution is rarely addressed in the literature. Concept-evolution occurs as a result of new classes evolving in the stream. This paper addressesconcept-evolution in addition to the existing challenges of infinite-length and concept-drift. Inthis paper; the concept-evolution phenomenon is studied; and the insights are used to …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,100
Graph-based consensus maximization among multiple supervised and unsupervised models,Jing Gao; Feng Liang; Wei Fan; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Little work has been done to directly combine the outputs of multiple supervisedand unsupervised models. However; it can increase the accuracy and applicability ofensemble methods. First; we can boost the diversity of classification ensemble byincorporating multiple clustering outputs; each of which provides grouping constraints for thejoint label predictions of a set of related objects. Secondly; ensemble of supervised modelsis limited in applications which have no access to raw data but to the meta-level modeloutputs. In this paper; we aim at calculating a consolidated classification solution for a set ofobjects by maximizing the consensus among both supervised predictions and unsupervisedgrouping constraints. We seek a global optimal label assignment for the target objects;which is different from the result of traditional majority voting and model combination …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2009,100
Classifying data streams with skewed class distributions and concept drifts,Jing Gao; Bolin Ding; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Classification is an important data analysis tool that uses a model built from historical data topredict class labels for new observations. More and more applications are featuring datastreams; rather than finite stored data sets; which are a challenge for traditional classificationalgorithms.

Integrating novel class detection with classification for concept-drifting data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract In a typical data stream classification task; it is assumed that the total number ofclasses are fixed. This assumption may not be valid in a real streaming environment; wherenew classes may evolve. Traditional data stream classification techniques are not capable ofrecognizing novel class instances until the appearance of the novel class is manuallyidentified; and labeled instances of that class are presented to the learning algorithm fortraining. The problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift; when theunderlying data distribution changes over time. We propose a novel and efficient techniquethat can automatically detect the emergence of a novel class in the presence of concept-driftby quantifying cohesion among unlabeled test instances; and separation of the testinstances from training instances. Our approach is non-parametric; meaning; it does not …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2009,87
A confidence-aware approach for truth discovery on long-tail data,Qi Li; Yaliang Li; Jing Gao; Lu Su; Bo Zhao; Murat Demirbas; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Abstract In many real world applications; the same item may be described by multiplesources. As a consequence; conflicts among these sources are inevitable; which leads to animportant task: how to identify which piece of information is trustworthy; ie; the truth discoverytask. Intuitively; if the piece of information is from a reliable source; then it is moretrustworthy; and the source that provides trustworthy information is more reliable. Based onthis principle; truth discovery approaches have been proposed to infer source reliabilitydegrees and the most trustworthy information (ie; the truth) simultaneously. However;existing approaches overlook the ubiquitous long-tail phenomenon in the tasks; ie; mostsources only provide a few claims and only a few sources make plenty of claims; whichcauses the source reliability estimation for small sources to be unreasonable.

Integrating community matching and outlier detection for mining evolutionary community outliers,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Temporal datasets; in which data evolves continuously; exist in a wide variety ofapplications; and identifying anomalous or outlying objects from temporal datasets is animportant and challenging task. Different from traditional outlier detection; which detectsobjects that have quite different behavior compared with the other objects; temporal outlierdetection tries to identify objects that have different evolutionary behavior compared withother objects. Usually objects form multiple communities; and most of the objects belongingto the same community follow similar patterns of evolution. However; there are some objectswhich evolve in a very different way relative to other community members; and we definesuch objects as evolutionary community outliers. This definition represents a novel type ofoutliers considering both temporal dimension and community patterns.

Converting output scores from outlier detection algorithms into probability estimates,Jing Gao; Pang-Ning Tan,Current outlier detection schemes typically output a numeric score representing the degreeto which a given observation is an outlier. We argue that converting the scores into well-calibrated probability estimates is more favorable for several reasons. First; the probabilityestimates allow us to select the appropriate threshold for declaring outliers using a Bayesianrisk model. Second; the probability estimates obtained from individual models can beaggregated to build an ensemble outlier detection framework. In this paper; we present twomethods for transforming outlier scores into probabilities. The first approach assumes thatthe posterior probabilities follow a logistic sigmoid function and learns the parameters of thefunction from the distribution of outlier scores. The second approach models the scoredistributions as a mixture of exponential and Gaussian probability functions and …,Data Mining; 2006. ICDM'06. Sixth International Conference on,2006,82
Classification and adaptive novel class detection of feature-evolving data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Qing Chen; Latifur Khan; Charu C Aggarwal; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han; Ashok Srivastava; Nikunj C Oza,Data stream classification poses many challenges to the data mining community. In thispaper; we address four such major challenges; namely; infinite length; concept-drift; concept-evolution; and feature-evolution. Since a data stream is theoretically infinite in length; it isimpractical to store and use all the historical data for training. Concept-drift is a commonphenomenon in data streams; which occurs as a result of changes in the underlyingconcepts. Concept-evolution occurs as a result of new classes evolving in the stream.Feature-evolution is a frequently occurring process in many streams; such as text streams; inwhich new features (ie; words or phrases) appear as the stream progresses. Most existingdata stream classification techniques address only the first two challenges; and ignore thelatter two.

Facing the reality of data stream classification: coping with scarcity of labeled data,Mohammad M Masud; Clay Woolam; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Kevin W Hamlen; Nikunj C Oza,Abstract Recent approaches for classifying data streams are mostly based on supervisedlearning algorithms; which can only be trained with labeled data. Manual labeling of data isboth costly and time consuming. Therefore; in a real streaming environment where largevolumes of data appear at a high speed; only a small fraction of the data can be labeled.Thus; only a limited number of instances will be available for training and updating theclassification models; leading to poorly trained classifiers. We apply a novel technique toovercome this problem by utilizing both unlabeled and labeled instances to train and updatethe classification model. Each classification model is built as a collection of micro-clustersusing semi-supervised clustering; and an ensemble of these models is used to classifyunlabeled data.

Classification and novel class detection of data streams in a dynamic feature space,Mohammad M Masud; Qing Chen; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Data stream classification poses many challenges; most of which are not addressedby the state-of-the-art. We present DXMiner; which addresses four major challenges to datastream classification; namely; infinite length; concept-drift; concept-evolution; and feature-evolution. Data streams are assumed to be infinite in length; which necessitates single-passincremental learning techniques. Concept-drift occurs in a data stream when the underlyingconcept changes over time. Most existing data stream classification techniques address onlythe infinite length and concept-drift problems.

Faitcrowd: Fine grained truth discovery for crowdsourced data aggregation,Fenglong Ma; Yaliang Li; Qi Li; Minghui Qiu; Jing Gao; Shi Zhi; Lu Su; Bo Zhao; Heng Ji; Jiawei Han,Abstract In crowdsourced data aggregation task; there exist conflicts in the answers providedby large numbers of sources on the same set of questions. The most important challenge forthis task is to estimate source reliability and select answers that are provided by high-qualitysources. Existing work solves this problem by simultaneously estimating sources' reliabilityand inferring questions' true answers (ie; the truths). However; these methods assume that asource has the same reliability degree on all the questions; but ignore the fact that sources'reliability may vary significantly among different topics.

Top-k interesting subgraph discovery in information networks,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Xifeng Yan; Hasan Cam; Jiawei Han,In the real world; various systems can be modeled using heterogeneous networks whichconsist of entities of different types. Many problems on such networks can be mapped to anunderlying critical problem of discovering top-K subgraphs of entities with rare andsurprising associations. Answering such subgraph queries efficiently involves two mainchallenges:(1) computing all matching subgraphs which satisfy the query and (2) rankingsuch results based on the rarity and the interestingness of the associations among entities inthe subgraphs. Previous work on the matching problem can be harnessed for a naïveranking-after-matching solution. However; for large graphs; subgraph queries may haveenormous number of matches; and so it is inefficient to compute all matches when only thetop-K matches are desired.

A multi-partition multi-chunk ensemble technique to classify concept-drifting data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract We propose a multi-partition; multi-chunk ensemble classifier based data miningtechnique to classify concept-drifting data streams. Existing ensemble techniques inclassifying concept-drifting data streams follow a single-partition; single-chunk approach; inwhich a single data chunk is used to train one classifier. In our approach; we train acollection of v classifiers from r consecutive data chunks using v-fold partitioning of the data;and build an ensemble of such classifiers. By introducing this multi-partition; multi-chunkensemble technique; we significantly reduce classification error compared to the single-partition; single-chunk ensemble approaches. We have theoretically justified the usefulnessof our algorithm; and empirically proved its effectiveness over other state-of-the-art streamclassification techniques on synthetic data and real botnet traffic.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2009,50
Detecting recurring and novel classes in concept-drifting data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Tahseen M Al-Khateeb; Latifur Khan; Charu Aggarwal; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Concept-evolution is one of the major challenges in data stream classification; which occurswhen a new class evolves in the stream. This problem remains unaddressed by most state-of-the-art techniques. A recurring class is a special case of concept-evolution. This specialcase takes place when a class appears in the stream; then disappears for a long time; andagain appears. Existing data stream classification techniques that address the concept-evolution problem; wrongly detect the recurring classes as novel class. This creates twomain problems. First; much resource is wasted in detecting a recurring class as novel class;because novel class detection is much more computationally-and memory-intensive; ascompared to simply recognizing an existing class. Second; when a novel class is identified;human experts are involved in collecting and labeling the instances of that class for future …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,46

Videomule: a consensus learning approach to multi-label classification from noisy user-generated videos,Chandrasekar Ramachandran; Rahul Malik; Xin Jin; Jing Gao; Klara Nahrstedt; Jiawei Han,Abstract With the growing proliferation of conversational media and devices for generatingmultimedia content; the Internet has seen an expansion in websites catering to user-generated media. Most of the user-generated content is multimodal in nature as it hasvideos; audio; text (in the form of tags); comments and so on.

An incremental data stream clustering algorithm based on dense units detection,Jing Gao; Jianzhong Li; Zhaogong Zhang; Pang-Ning Tan,Abstract The data stream model of computation is often used for analyzing huge volumes ofcontinuously arriving data. In this paper; we present a novel algorithm called DUCstream forclustering data streams. Our work is motivated by the needs to develop a single-passalgorithm that is capable of detecting evolving clusters; and yet requires little memory andcomputation time. To that end; we propose an incremental clustering method based ondense units detection. Evolving clusters are identified on the basis of the dense units; whichcontain relatively large number of points. For efficiency reasons; a bitwise dense unitrepresentation is introduced. Our experimental results demonstrate DUCstream's efficiencyand efficacy.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2005,45

This task; referred to as truthdiscovery; has recently attracted much attention. Existing work typically assumesindependence among entities. However; correlations among entities are commonlyobserved in many applications. Such correlation information is crucial in the truth discoverytask. When entities are not observed by enough reliable users; it is impossible to obtain trueinformation. In such cases; it is important to propagate trustworthy information fromcorrelated entities that have been observed by reliable users. We formulate the task of …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,2015,44
On the discovery of evolving truth,Yaliang Li; Qi Li; Jing Gao; Lu Su; Bo Zhao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the era of big data; information regarding the same objects can be collected fromincreasingly more sources. Unfortunately; there usually exist conflicts among the informationcoming from different sources. To tackle this challenge; truth discovery; ie; to integrate multi-source noisy information by estimating the reliability of each source; has emerged as a hottopic. In many real world applications; however; the information may come sequentially; andas a consequence; the truth of objects as well as the reliability of sources may bedynamically evolving. Existing truth discovery methods; unfortunately; cannot handle suchscenarios. To address this problem; we investigate the temporal relations among both objecttruths and source reliability; and propose an incremental truth discovery framework that candynamically update object truths and source weights upon the arrival of new data …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,43
A Deep Learning Approach to Link Prediction in Dynamic Networks,Xiaoyi Li; Nan Du; Hui Li; Kang Li; Jing Gao; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Time varying problems usually have complex underlying structures represented asdynamic networks where entities and relationships appear and disappear over time. Theproblem of efficiently performing dynamic link inference is extremely challenging due to thedynamic nature in massive evolving networks especially when there exist sparseconnectivities and nonlinear transitional patterns. In this paper; we propose a novel deeplearning framework; ie; Conditional Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ctRBM); whichpredicts links based on individual transition variance as well as influence introduced by localneighbors. The proposed model is robust to noise and have the exponential capability tocapture nonlinear variance. We tackle the computational challenges by developing anefficient algorithm for learning and inference of the proposed model.

Heterogeneous source consensus learning via decision propagation and negotiation,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Nowadays; enormous amounts of data are continuously generated not only inmassive scale; but also from different; sometimes conflicting; views. Therefore; it is importantto consolidate different concepts for intelligent decision making. For example; to predict theresearch areas of some people; the best results are usually achieved by combining andconsolidating predictions obtained from the publication network; co-authorship network andthe textual content of their publications. Multiple supervised and unsupervised hypothesescan be drawn from these information sources; and negotiating their differences andconsolidating decisions usually yields a much more accurate model due to the diversity andheterogeneity of these models. In this paper; we address the problem of" consensuslearning" among competing hypotheses; which either rely on outside knowledge …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,42
Classification and novel class detection in data streams with active mining,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract We present ActMiner; which addresses four major challenges to data streamclassification; namely; infinite length; concept-drift; concept-evolution; and limited labeleddata. Most of the existing data stream classification techniques address only the infinitelength and concept-drift problems. Our previous work; MineClass; addresses the concept-evolution problem in addition to addressing the infinite length and concept-drift problems.Concept-evolution occurs in the stream when novel classes arrive. However; most of theexisting data stream classification techniques; including MineClass; require that all theinstances in a data stream be labeled by human experts and become available for training.This assumption is impractical; since data labeling is both time consuming and costly.Therefore; it is impossible to label a majority of the data points in a high-speed data …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2010,41
Semi-supervised outlier detection,Jing Gao; Haibin Cheng; Pang-Ning Tan,Abstract Outlier detection has been extensively researched in the context of unsupervisedlearning. But the learning results are not always satisfactory; which can be significantlyimproved using supervision of some labeled points. In this paper; we are concerned withemploying supervision of limited amount of label information to detect outliers moreaccurately. The key of our approach is an objective function that punishes poor clusteringresults and deviation from known labels as well as restricts the number of outliers. Theoutliers can be found as a solution to the discrete optimization problem regarding theobjective function. By this way; this method can detect meaningful outliers that can not beidentified by existing unsupervised methods.,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2006,41
Crowdsourcing for Multiple-Choice Question Answering.,Bahadir Ismail Aydin; Yavuz Selim Yilmaz; Yaliang Li; Qi Li; Jing Gao; Murat Demirbas,Abstract We leverage crowd wisdom for multiple-choice question answering; and employlightweight machine learning techniques to improve the aggregation accuracy ofcrowdsourced answers to these questions. In order to develop more effective aggregationmethods and evaluate them empirically; we developed and deployed a crowdsourcedsystem for playing the “Who wants to be a millionaire?” quiz show. Analyzing our data(which consist of more than 200;000 answers); we find that by just going with the mostselected answer in the aggregation; we can answer over 90% of the questions correctly; butthe success rate of this technique plunges to 60% for the later/harder questions in the quizshow. To improve the success rates of these later/harder questions; we investigate novelweighted aggregation schemes for aggregating the answers obtained from the crowd. By …,AAAI,2014,38
Modeling probabilistic measurement correlations for problem determination in large-scale distributed systems,Jing Gao; Guofei Jiang; Haifeng Chen; Jiawei Han,With the growing complexity in computer systems; it has been a real challenge to detect anddiagnose problems in today's large-scale distributed systems. Usually; the correlationsbetween measurements collected across the distributed system contain rich informationabout the system behaviors; and thus a reasonable model to describe such correlations iscrucially important in detecting and locating system problems. In this paper; we propose atransition probability model based on markov properties to characterize pair-wisemeasurement correlations. The proposed method can discover both the spatial (acrosssystem measurements) and temporal (across observation time) correlations; and thus such amodel can successfully represent the system normal profiles. Problem determination andlocalization under this framework is fast and convenient. The framework is general …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2009.

Cloud-based malware detection for evolving data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Tahseen M Al-Khateeb; Kevin W Hamlen; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Data stream classification for intrusion detection poses at least three majorchallenges. First; these data streams are typically infinite-length; making traditionalmultipass learning algorithms inapplicable. Second; they exhibit significant concept-drift asattackers react and adapt to defenses. Third; for data streams that do not have any fixedfeature set; such as text streams; an additional feature extraction and selection task must beperformed. If the number of candidate features is too large; then traditional feature extractiontechniques fail. In order to address the first two challenges; this article proposes amultipartition; multichunk ensemble classifier in which a collection of v classifiers is trainedfrom r consecutive data chunks using v-fold partitioning of the data; yielding an ensemble ofsuch classifiers. This multipartition; multichunk ensemble technique significantly reduces …,ACM transactions on management information systems (TMIS),2011,35
Semi-supervised clustering with partial background information,Jing Gao; Pang-Ning Tan; Haibin Cheng,Abstract Incorporating background knowledge into unsupervised clustering algorithms hasbeen the subject of extensive research in recent years. Nevertheless; existing algorithmsimplicitly assume that the background information; typically specified in the form of labeledexamples or pairwise constraints; has the same feature space as the unlabeled data to beclustered. In this paper; we are concerned with a new problem of incorporating partialbackground knowledge into clustering; where the labeled examples have moderateoverlapping features with the unlabeled data. We formulate this as a constrainedoptimization problem; and propose two learning algorithms to solve the problem; based onhard and fuzzy clustering methods. An empirical study performed on a variety of real datasets shows that our proposed algorithms improve the quality of clustering results with …,*,2006,33
Modeling truth existence in truth discovery,Shi Zhi; Bo Zhao; Wenzhu Tong; Jing Gao; Dian Yu; Heng Ji; Jiawei Han,Abstract When integrating information from multiple sources; it is common to encounterconflicting answers to the same question. Truth discovery is to infer the most accurate andcomplete integrated answers from conflicting sources. In some cases; there exist questionsfor which the true answers are excluded from the candidate answers provided by allsources. Without any prior knowledge; these questions; named no-truth questions; aredifficult to be distinguished from the questions that have true answers; named has-truthquestions. In particular; these no-truth questions degrade the precision of the answerintegration system. We address such a challenge by introducing source quality; which ismade up of three fine-grained measures: silent rate; false spoken rate and true spoken rate.By incorporating these three measures; we propose a probabilistic graphical model …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,31
Predicting future popularity trend of events in microblogging platforms,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; ChengXiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract The fast information sharing on Twitter from millions of users all over the worldleads to almost real-time reporting of events. It is extremely important for business andadministrative decision makers to learn events' popularity as quickly as possible; as it canbuy extra precious time for them to make informed decisions. Therefore; we introduce theproblem of predicting future popularity trend of events on microblogging platforms.Traditionally; trend prediction has been performed by using time series analysis of pastpopularity to forecast the future popularity changes. As we can encode the rich Twitterdynamics using a rich variety of features from microblogging data; we explore regression;classification and hybrid approaches; using a large set of popularity; social and eventfeatures; to predict event popularity.

Generalized decision aggregation in distributed sensing systems,Lu Su; Qi Li; Shaohan Hu; Shiguang Wang; Jing Gao; Hengchang Liu; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han; Xue Liu; Yan Gao; Lance Kaplan,In this paper; we present GDA; a generalized decision aggregation framework thatintegrates information from distributed sensor nodes for decision making in a resourceefficient manner. Traditional approaches that target similar problems only take as input thediscrete label information from individual sensors that observe the same events. Differentfrom them; our proposed GDA framework is able to take advantage of the confidenceinformation of each sensor about its decision; and thus achieves higher decision accuracy.Targeting generalized problem domains; our framework can naturally handle the scenarioswhere different sensor nodes observe different sets of events whose numbers of possibleclasses may also be different. GDA also makes no assumption about the availability level ofground truth label information; while being able to take advantage of any if present.

Cloud-enabled privacy-preserving truth discovery in crowd sensing systems,Chenglin Miao; Wenjun Jiang; Lu Su; Yaliang Li; Suxin Guo; Zhan Qin; Houping Xiao; Jing Gao; Kui Ren,Abstract The recent proliferation of human-carried mobile devices has given rise to thecrowd sensing systems. However; the sensory data provided by individual participants areusually not reliable. To identify truthful values from the crowd sensing data; the topic of truthdiscovery; whose goal is to estimate user quality and infer truths through quality-aware dataaggregation; has drawn significant attention. Though able to improve aggregation accuracy;existing truth discovery approaches fail to take into consideration an important issue in theirdesign; ie; the protection of individual users' private information. In this paper; we propose anovel cloud-enabled privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPTD) framework for crowd sensingsystems; which can achieve the protection of not only users' sensory data but also theirreliability scores derived by the truth discovery approaches.

Community distribution outlier detection in heterogeneous information networks,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han,Abstract Heterogeneous networks are ubiquitous. For example; bibliographic data; socialdata; medical records; movie data and many more can be modeled as heterogeneousnetworks. Rich information associated with multi-typed nodes in heterogeneous networksmotivates us to propose a new definition of outliers; which is different from those defined forhomogeneous networks. In this paper; we propose the novel concept of CommunityDistribution Outliers (CDOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks; which are definedas objects whose community distribution does not follow any of the popular communitydistribution patterns. We extract such outliers using a type-aware joint analysis of multipletypes of objects. Given community membership matrices for all types of objects; we follow aniterative two-stage approach which performs pattern discovery and outlier detection in a …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2013,25
On Handling Negative Transfer and Imbalanced Distributions in Multiple Source Transfer Learning,Liang Ge; Jing Gao; Hung Q. Ngo; Kang Li; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Transfer learning has benefited many real-world applications where labeled dataare abundant in source domains but scarce in the target domain. As there are usuallymultiple relevant domains where knowledge can be transferred; multiple source transferlearning (MSTL) has recently attracted much attention. However; we are facing two majorchallenges when applying MSTL. First; without knowledge about the difference betweensource and target domains; negative transfer occurs when knowledge is transferred fromhighly irrelevant sources. Second; existence of imbalanced distributions in classes; whereexamples in one class dominate; can lead to improper judgement on the source domains'relevance to the target task. Since existing MSTL methods are usually designed to transferfrom relevant sources with balanced distributions; they will fail in applications where …,Statistical Analysis and Data Mining (SAM),2014,24
Using Social Media to Predict Traffic Flow under Special Event Conditions,Ming Ni; Qing He; Jing Gao,Social media is great resource of user-generated contents. Public attention; opinion 2 andhot topics can be captured in the social media; which provides the ability to 3 predict humanrelated events. Since social media can be retrieved in real time with 4 relatively smallbuilding and maintenance costs; traffic operation authorities probably 5 identify the socialmedia data as another type sensor for traffic demand. One of those 6 challenges is how toextract reliable traffic related features from big and noisy social 7 media data. The otherchallenge is how to locate a feasible traffic study that fits well 8 with social media data.

Multi-source deep learning for information trustworthiness estimation,Liang Ge; Jing Gao; Xiaoyi Li; Aidong Zhang,Abstract In recent years; information trustworthiness has become a serious issue when user-generated contents prevail in our information world. In this paper; we investigate theimportant problem of estimating information trustworthiness from the perspective ofcorrelating and comparing multiple data sources. To a certain extent; the consistency degreeis an indicator of information reliability--Information unanimously agreed by all the sources ismore likely to be reliable. Based on this principle; we develop an effective computationalapproach to identify consistent information from multiple data sources. Particularly; weanalyze vast amounts of information collected from multiple review platforms (multiplesources) in which people can rate and review the items they have purchased. The majorchallenge is that different platforms attract diverse sets of users; and thus information …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,22
Hierarchical aggregate classification with limited supervision for data reduction in wireless sensor networks,Lu Su; Jing Gao; Yong Yang; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,Abstract The main challenge of designing classification algorithms for sensor networks is thelack of labeled sensory data; due to the high cost of manual labeling in the harsh localeswhere a sensor network is normally deployed. Moreover; delivering all the sensory data tothe sink would cost enormous energy. Therefore; although some classification techniquescan deal with limited label information; they cannot be directly applied to sensor networkssince they are designed for centralized databases. To address these challenges; wepropose a hierarchical aggregate classification (HAC) protocol which can reduce theamount of data sent by each node while achieving accurate classification in the face ofinsufficient label information. In this protocol; each sensor node locally makes clusteranalysis and forwards only its decision to the parent node. The decisions are aggregated …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,2011,22
Peer to peer botnet detection for cyber-security: a data mining approach,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Botnet is a network of compromised hosts or bots; under the control of a humanattacker known as the botmaster [7; 8]. Botnets are used to perform malicious actions; suchas launching DDoS attacks; sending spam or phishing emails and so on. Thus; botnets haveemerged as a threat to internet community. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a relatively newarchitecture of botnets [4]. These botnets are distributed; and small. So; they are difficult tolocate and destroy. Most of the recent works in P2P botnet are in the analysis phase [4; 5; 6].On the contrary; our work is aimed at detecting P2P botnets using network traffic mining.Network traffic can be considered as an infinite data stream. So; our data mining approach isspecialized for mining stream data. There are two major problems related to stream dataclassification. First; it is impractical to store and use all the historical data for training …,Proceedings of the 4th annual workshop on Cyber security and information intelligence research: developing strategies to meet the cyber security and information intelligence challenges ahead,2008,22
On detecting association-based clique outliers in heterogeneous information networks,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Xifeng Yan; Hasan Cam; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the real world; various systems can be modeled using heterogeneous networkswhich consist of entities of different types. People like to discover groups (or cliques) ofentities linked to each other with rare and surprising associations from such networks. Wedefine such anomalous cliques as< u> A</u> ssociation-< u> B</u> ased< u> C</u> liqueOutliers (ABCOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks; and design effectiveapproaches to detect them. The need to find such outlier cliques from networks can beformulated as a conjunctive select query consisting of a set of (type; predicate) pairs.Answering such conjunctive queries efficiently involves two main challenges:(1) computingall matching cliques which satisfy the query and (2) ranking such results based on the rarityand the interestingness of the associations among entities in the cliques.

Mining concept-drifting data stream to detect peer to peer botnet traffic,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,ABSTRACT We propose a novel stream data classification technique to detect Peer to Peerbotnet. Botnet traffic can be considered as stream data having two important properties:infinite length and drifting concept. Thus; stream data classification technique is moreappealing to botnet detection than simple classification technique. However; no other botnetdetection approaches so far have applied stream data classification technique. We proposea multi-chunk; multi-level ensemble classifier based data mining technique to classifyconcept-drifting stream data. Previous ensemble techniques in classifying concept-driftingstream data use a single data chunk to train a classifier. In our approach; we train anensemble of v classifiers from r consecutive data chunks. K of these v-classifier ensemblesare used to build another level of ensemble. By introducing this multi-chunk; multi-level …,Univ. of Texas at Dallas Tech. Report# UTDCS-05-08 (http://www. utdallas. edu/mmm058000/reports/UTDCS-05-08. pdf),2008,19

Quality of information based data selection and transmission in wireless sensor networks,Lu Su; Shaohan Hu; Shen Li; Feng Liang; Jing Gao; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han,In this paper; we provide a quality of information (QoI) based data selection andtransmission service for classification missions in sensor networks. We first identify the twoaspects of QoI; data reliability and data redundancy; and then propose metrics to estimatethem. In particular; reliability implies the degree to which a sensor node contributes to theclassification mission; and can be estimated through exploring the agreement between thisnode and the majority of others. On the other hand; redundancy represents the informationoverlap among different sensor nodes; and can be measured via investigating the similarityof their clustering results. Based on the proposed QoI metrics; we formulate an optimizationproblem that aims at maximizing the reliability of sensory data while eliminating theirredundancies under the constraint of network resources.

They have been widely used to representvarious network systems; such as social networks; biological networks and etc. Knowledgediscovery on linked data is of great importance to many real applications. One of the majorchallenges of learning linked data is how to effectively and efficiently extract usefulinformation from both node attributes and links in linked data. Current studies on this topiceither use selected topological statistics to represent network structures; or linearly mapnode attributes and network structures to a shared latent feature space.

OMS-TL: A framework of online multiple source transfer learning,Liang Ge; Jing Gao; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Transfer learning has benefitted many real-world applications where labeled dataare abundant in source domains but scarce on the target domain. As there are usuallymultiple relevant domains where knowledge can be transferred; Multiple Source TransferLearning (MSTL) has recently attracted much attention. Most existing MSTL methods work inan offline fashion in that they have to store all the data on the target domain before learning.However; in some time-critical applications where the data arrive sequentially in largevolume; a fast and scalable online method that can transfer knowledge from multiple sourcedomains is much needed.

Estimating local information trustworthiness via multi-source joint matrix factorization,Liang Ge; Jing Gao; Xiao Yu; Wei Fan; Aidong Zhang,We investigate how to estimate information trustworthiness by considering multipleinformation sources jointly in a latent matrix space. We particularly focus on user review andrecommendation systems; as there are multiple platforms where people can rate items andservices that they have purchased; and many potential customers rely on these opinions tomake decisions. Information trustworthiness is a serious problem because ratings aregenerated freely by end-users so that many stammers take advantage of freedom of speechto promote their business or damage reputation of competitors. We propose to simply usecustomer ratings to estimate each individual source's reliability by exploring correlationsamong multiple sources.

In recent years; most of the researches have focused on detecting the functionalmodules from the static PPI networks. However; sometimes the structure of the PPI networkschanges in response to stimuli resulting in the changes of both the composition andfunctionality of these modules. These changes occur gradually and can be thought of as anevolution of the functional modules. In our opinions the evolutionary analysis of functionalmodules is a key to form important insights of the functional modules' underlying behaviors;particularly when targeting complex living systems.

Consensus extraction from heterogeneous detectors to improve performance over network traffic anomaly detection,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Deepak Turaga; Olivier Verscheure; Xiaoqiao Meng; Lu Su; Jiawei Han,Network operators are continuously confronted with malicious events; such as port scans;denial-of-service attacks; and spreading of worms. Due to the detrimental effects caused bythese anomalies; it is critical to detect them promptly and effectively. There have beennumerous softwares; algorithms; or rules developed to conduct anomaly detection overtraffic data. However; each of them only has limited descriptions of the anomalies; and thussuffers from high false positive/false negative rates. In contrast; the combination of multipleatomic detectors can provide a more powerful anomaly capturing capability when the basedetectors complement each other. In this paper; we propose to infer a discriminative modelby reaching consensus among multiple atomic anomaly detectors in an unsupervisedmanner when there are very few or even no known anomalous events for training.

Crowdsourcing high quality labels with a tight budget,Qi Li; Fenglong Ma; Jing Gao; Lu Su; Christopher J Quinn,Abstract In the past decade; commercial crowdsourcing platforms have revolutionized theways of classifying and annotating data; especially for large datasets. Obtaining labels for asingle instance can be inexpensive; but for large datasets; it is important to allocate budgetswisely. With limited budgets; requesters must trade-off between the quantity of labeledinstances and the quality of the final results. Existing budget allocation methods can achievegood quantity but cannot guarantee high quality of individual instances under a tight budget.However; in some scenarios; requesters may be willing to label fewer instances but ofhigher quality. Moreover; they may have different requirements on quality for different tasks.To address these challenges; we propose a flexible budget allocation framework calledRequallo.

Truth discovery and crowdsourcing aggregation: A unified perspective,Jing Gao; Qi Li; Bo Zhao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the era of Big Data; data entries; even describing the same objects or events; cancome from a variety of sources; where a data source can be a web page; a database or aperson. Consequently; conflicts among sources become inevitable. To resolve the conflictsand achieve high quality data; truth discovery and crowdsourcing aggregation have beenstudied intensively. However; although these two topics have a lot in common; they arestudied separately and are applied to different domains. To answer the need of a systematicintroduction and comparison of the two topics; we present an organized picture on truthdiscovery and crowdsourcing aggregation in this tutorial.

Forexample; they follow certain users to increase their “statistical popularity”; or retweet sometweets to amplify their “statistical impact”. The fabricated follower or retweet counts not onlymislead normal users to wrong information; but also seriously impair microblog-basedapplications; such as popular tweets selection and expert finding.

We assume that a set ofobjects can be described from various perspectives (multiple information sources). Theunderlying clustering structure of normal objects is usually shared by multiple sources.However; anomalous objects belong to different clusters when considering different aspects.For example; there exist movies that are expected to be liked by kids by genre; but are likedby grown-ups based on user viewing history. To identify such objects; we propose tocompute the distance between different eigen decomposition results of the same object withrespect to different sources as its anomalous score.

Two components are tightly incorporated into theproposed approach to address the intrinsic characteristics of concept-drifting; imbalancedstreaming data.

Towards Confidence in the Truth: A Bootstrapping based Truth Discovery Approach,Houping Xiao; Jing Gao; Qi Li; Fenglong Ma; Lu Su; Yunlong Feng; Aidong Zhang,Abstract The demand for automatic extraction of true information (ie; truths) from conflictingmulti-source data has soared recently. A variety of truth discovery methods have witnessedgreat successes via jointly estimating source reliability and truths. All existing truth discoverymethods focus on providing a point estimator for each object's truth; but in many real-worldapplications; confidence interval estimation of truths is more desirable; since confidenceinterval contains richer information. To address this challenge; in this paper; we propose anovel truth discovery method (ETCIBoot) to construct confidence interval estimates as wellas identify truths; where the bootstrapping techniques are nicely integrated into the truthdiscovery procedure. Due to the properties of bootstrapping; the estimators obtained byETCIBoot are more accurate and robust compared with the state-of-the-art truth discovery …,Proceedings of the 22th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2016),2016,10
Forecasting the Subway Passenger Flow under Event Occurrences with Social Media,Ming Ni; Qing He; Jing Gao,Subway passenger flow prediction is strategically important in metro transit systemmanagement. The prediction under event occurrences turns into a very challenging task. Inthis paper; we adopt a new kind of data source-social media-to tackle this challenge. Wedevelop a systematic approach to examine social media activities and sense eventoccurrences. Our initial analysis demonstrates that there exists a moderate positivecorrelation between passenger flow and the rates of social media posts. This findingmotivates us to develop a novel approach for improved flow forecast. We first develop ahashtag-based event detection algorithm. Furthermore; we propose a parametric andconvex optimization-based approach; called optimization and prediction with hybrid lossfunction (OPL); to fuse the linear regression and the results of seasonal autoregressive …,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS),2017,8
Conflicts to harmony: A framework for resolving conflicts in heterogeneous data by truth discovery,Yaliang Li; Qi Li; Jing Gao; Lu Su; Bo Zhao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,In many applications; one can obtain descriptions about the same objects or events from avariety of sources. As a result; this will inevitably lead to data or information conflicts. Oneimportant problem is to identify the true information (ie; the truths) among conflicting sourcesof data. It is intuitive to trust reliable sources more when deriving the truths; but it is usuallyunknown which one is more reliable a priori. Moreover; each source possesses a variety ofproperties with different data types. An accurate estimation of source reliability has to bemade by modeling multiple properties in a unified model. Existing conflict resolution workeither does not conduct source reliability estimation; or models multiple propertiesseparately. In this paper; we propose to resolve conflicts among multiple sources ofheterogeneous data types. We model the problem using an optimization framework …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,8
A multi-graph spectral framework for mining multi-source anomalies,Jing Gao; Nan Du; Wei Fan; Deepak Turaga; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Jiawei Han,Abstract Anomaly detection refers to the task of detecting objects whose characteristicsdeviate significantly from the majority of the data [5]. It is widely used in a variety of domains;such as intrusion detection; fraud detection; and health monitoring.

Unsupervised Discovery of Drug Side-Effects from Heterogeneous Data Sources,Fenglong Ma; Chuishi Meng; Houping Xiao; Qi Li; Jing Gao; Lu Su; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Drug side-effects become a worldwide public health concern; which are the fourthleading cause of death in the United States. Pharmaceutical industry has paid tremendouseffort to identify drug side-effects during the drug development. However; it is impossible andimpractical to identify all of them. Fortunately; drug side-effects can also be reported onheterogeneous platforms (ie; data sources); such as FDA Adverse Event Reporting Systemand various online communities. However; existing supervised and semi-supervisedapproaches are not practical as annotating labels are expensive in the medical field. In thispaper; we propose a novel and effective unsupervised model Sifter to automatically discoverdrug side-effects. Sifter enhances the estimation on drug side-effects by learning fromvarious online platforms and measuring platform-level and user-level quality …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD’17).

An Exploratory Study on the Correlation between Twitter Concentration and Traffic Surge,Zhenhua Zhang; Ming Ni; Qing He; Jing Gao; Jizhan Gou; Xiaoling Li,Social media receive increasing attention as a crowdsourced information resource in trafficoperations and management. Tweets; which are blogged and shared by great masses ofpeople; may be associated with some major social activities. In this study these tweets arecalled “Twitter concentrations.” The public activities behind Twitter concentrations potentiallypose more pressure on the traffic network and cause traffic surges within a specified timeand location. However; it is still unknown how closely the Twitter concentrations and trafficsurges are correlated. This study fuses a set of tweets and traffic data collected during 2014in Northern Virginia and investigates the correlation between Twitter concentrations andtraffic surges in July. The results show the promise and effectiveness of the proposedmethods and even provide insights into the causality of nonrecurrent traffic surges.,Transportation Research Board,2016,7
Robust crowd bias correction via dual knowledge transfer from multiple overlapping sources,Sihong Xie; Qingbo Hu; Jingyuan Zhang; Jing Gao; Wei Fan; S Yu Philip,One of the largest constituents of big data is the crowdsourced or user-generated data whichcontain a wide range of valuable information. However; they are inherently biased andpossibly spammed; making trustworthy information extraction an imperative task. As aspecial case; we study reviewer-posted ratings for products. The biased ratings can lead todisappointed customers due to overrated products; and reduced revenues of businessowners caused by undeserved negative ratings. To distill objective product qualitymeasurements; most existing methods try to infer unbiased ratings from the raw ratingsalone; and may not overcome the inherent bias to recover the underlying true ratings.Though improved bias corrections have been achieved with domain expert helps; theoverhead of expert efforts can be rather expensive in practice. We exploit the variety of …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,7
Temporal multi-view inconsistency detection for network traffic analysis,Houping Xiao; Jing Gao; Deepak S Turaga; Long H Vu; Alain Biem,Abstract In this paper; we investigate the problem of identifying inconsistent hosts in large-scale enterprise networks by mining multiple views of temporal data collected from thenetworks. The time-varying behavior of hosts is typically consistent across multiple views;and thus hosts that exhibit inconsistent behavior are possible anomalous points to be furtherinvestigated. To achieve this goal; we develop an effective approach that extracts commonpatterns hidden in multiple views and detects inconsistency by measuring the deviation fromthese common patterns. Specifically; we first apply various anomaly detectors on the rawdata and form a three-way tensor (host; time; detector) for each view. We then develop ajoint probabilistic tensor factorization method to derive the latent tensor subspace; whichcaptures common time-varying behavior across views. Based on the extracted tensor …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,7
Class-distribution regularized consensus maximization for alleviating overfitting in model combination,Sihong Xie; Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Deepak Turaga; Philip S Yu,Abstract In data mining applications such as crowdsourcing and privacy-preserving datamining; one may wish to obtain consolidated predictions out of multiple models withoutaccess to features of the data. Besides; multiple models usually carry complementarypredictive information; model combination can potentially provide more robust and accuratepredictions by correcting independent errors from individual models. Various methods havebeen proposed to combine predictions such that the final predictions are maximally agreedupon by multiple base models. Though this maximum consensus principle has been shownto be successful; simply maximizing consensus can lead to less discriminative predictionsand overfit the inevitable noise due to imperfect base models. We argue that properregularization for model combination approaches is needed to alleviate such overfitting …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,7
Learning; analyzing and predicting object roles on dynamic networks,Kang Li; Suxin Guo; Nan Du; Jing Gao; Aidong Zhang,Dynamic networks are structures with objects and links between the objects that vary in time.Temporal information in dynamic networks can be used to reveal many importantphenomena such as bursts of activities in social networks and human communicationpatterns in email networks. In this area; one very important problem is to understanddynamic patterns of object roles. For instance; will a user become a peripheral node in asocial network? Could a website become a hub on the Internet? Will a gene be highlyexpressed in gene-gene interaction networks in the later stage of a cancer?

A Truth Discovery Approach with Theoretical Guarantee,Houping Xiao; Jing Gao; Zhaoran Wang; Shiyu Wang; Lu Su; Han Liu,Abstract In the information age; people can easily collect information about the same set ofentities from multiple sources; among which conflicts are inevitable. This leads to animportant task; truth discovery; ie; to identify true facts (truths) via iteratively updating truthsand source reliability. However; the convergence to the truths is never discussed in existingwork; and thus there is no theoretical guarantee in the results of these truth discoveryapproaches. In contrast; in this paper we propose a truth discovery approach with theoreticalguarantee. We propose a randomized gaussian mixture model (RGMM) to represent multi-source data; where truths are model parameters. We incorporate source bias which capturesits reliability degree into RGMM formulation. The truth discovery task is then modeled asseeking the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the truths.

Tracking temporal community strength in dynamic networks,Nan Du; Xiaowei Jia; Jing Gao; Vishrawas Gopalakrishnan; Aidong Zhang,Abstract—Community formation analysis of dynamic networks has been a hot topic in datamining which has attracted much attention. Recently; there are many studies which focus ondiscovering communities successively from consecutive snapshots by considering both thecurrent and historical information. However; these methods cannot provide us with muchhistorical or successive information related to the detected communities. Different fromprevious studies which focus on community detection in dynamic networks; we define a newproblem of tracking the progression of the community strength-a novel measure that reflectsthe community robustness and coherence throughout the entire observation period. Toachieve this goal; we propose a novel framework which formulates the problem as anoptimization task.

One important task is to detect untrustworthyinformation because such information usually indicates critical; unusual; or suspiciousactivities. In this paper; we study the important problem of detecting untrustworthyinformation from a novel perspective of correlating and comparing multiple sources thatdescribe the same set of items. Different from existing work; we recognize the importance oftime dimension in modeling the commonalities among multiple sources.

Topic Discovery for Short Texts Using Word Embeddings,Guangxu Xun; Vishrawas Gopalakrishnan; Fenglong Ma; Yaliang Li; Jing Gao; Aidong Zhang,Discovering topics in short texts; such as news titles and tweets; has become an importanttask for many content analysis applications. However; due to the lack of rich contextinformation in short texts; the performance of conventional topic models on short texts isusually unsatisfying. In this paper; we propose a novel topic model for short text corpususing word embeddings. Continuous space word embeddings; which is proven effective atcapturing regularities in language; is incorporated into our model to provide additionalsemantics. Thus we model each short document as a Gaussian topic over word embeddingsin the vector space. In addition; considering that background words in a short text are usuallynot semantically related; we introduce a discrete background mode over word types tocomplement the continuous Gaussian topics. We evaluate our model on news titles from …,Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2016),2016,5

Gin: A clustering model for capturing dual heterogeneity in networked data,Jialu Liu; Chi Wang; Jing Gao; Quanquan Gu; Charu Aggarwal; Lance Kaplan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Networked data often consists of interconnected multi-typed nodes and links. Acommon assumption behind such heterogeneity is the shared clustering structure. However;existing network clustering approaches over-simplify the heterogeneity by either treatingnodes or links in a homogeneous fashion; resulting in massive loss of information. Inaddition; these studies are more or less restricted to specific network schemas orapplications; losing generality. In this paper; we introduce a flexible model to explain theprocess of forming heterogeneous links based on shared clustering information ofheterogeneous nodes. Specifically; we categorize the link generation process into binaryand weighted cases and model them respectively. We show these two cases can beseamlessly integrated into a unified model.

Wefirst define a metric to measure the strength of a community; called the normalized temporalcommunity strength. And then; we propose our analysis framework. The community mayevolve over time; either split to multiple communities or merge with others. We address theproblem of evolutionary clustering with requirement on temporal smoothness and propose arevised soft clustering method based on non-negative matrix factorization.

A multimodal framework for unsupervised feature fusion,Xiaoyi Li; Jing Gao; Hui Li; Le Yang; Rohini K Srihari,Abstract With the overwhelming amounts of visual contents on the Internet nowadays; it isvery important to generate meaningful and succinct descriptions of multimedia contentsincluding images and videos. Although human taggings and annotations can partially labelsome of the images or videos; it is impossible to exhaustively describe all the multimediadata due to its huge scale. Therefore; the key to this important task is to develop an effectivealgorithm that can automatically generate a description of an image or a frame. In this paper;we propose a multimodal feature fusion framework which can model any given image-description pair using semantically meaningful features. This framework is trained as acombination of multi-modal deep networks having two integral components: An ensemble ofimage descriptors and a recursive bigram encoder with fixed length output feature vector …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,5
Comprehensive Cross-Hierarchy Cluster Agreement Evaluation.,David M Johnson; Caiming Xiong; Jing Gao; Jason J Corso,Abstract Hierarchical clustering represents a family of widely used clustering approachesthat can organize objects into a hierarchy based on the similarity in objects' feature values.One significant obstacle facing hierarchical clustering research today is the lack of generaland robust evaluation methods. Existing works rely on a range of evaluation techniquesincluding both internal (no ground-truth is considered in evaluation) and external measures(results are compared to ground-truth semantic structure). The existing internal techniquesmay have strong hierarchical validity; but the available external measures were notdeveloped specifically for hierarchies. This lack of specificity prevents them from comparinghierarchy structures in a holistic; principled way. To address this problem; we propose theHierarchy Agreement Index; a novel hierarchy comparison algorithm that holistically …,AAAI (Late-Breaking Developments),2013,5
De-noise biological network from heterogeneous sources via link propagation,Nan Du; Jing Gao; Vishrawas Gopalakrishnan; Aidong Zhang,Lots of recent bioinformatics works have focused on the inference of various types ofbiological networks; such as gene coexpression networks; protein-protein interactionnetworks; signal transduction networks; etc. Unfortunately; these raw biological network dataoften contain much noise; especially the false positive predictions which in many caseshinder accurate reconstruction of biological networks. In addition; since the labeled data isscarce and expensive; we hope that the knowledge from other domains can help handle thislack of labeled data problem. In order to construct a more robust and reliable biologicalnetwork; we propose a novel link propagation based algorithm to de-noise false positivesfrom the target biological network through propagating information from few labeled samplesand a set of auxiliary domain networks.

Data Stream Mining: Challenges and Techniques,Latifur Khan; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han; Jing Gao; Mohammad M. Masud,Data streams are continuous flows of data. Examples of data streams include network traffic;sensor data; call center records and so on. Their sheer volume and speed pose a greatchallenge for the data mining community to mine them. Data streams demonstrate severalunique properties: infinite length; concept-drift; concept-evolution; and feature-evolution.Concept-drift occurs in data streams when the underlying concept of data changes overtime. Concept-evolution occurs when new classes evolve in streams. Feature-evolutionoccurs when feature set varies with time in data streams. Each of these properties adds achallenge to data stream mining.

Dipole: Diagnosis Prediction in Healthcare via Attention-based Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks,Fenglong Ma; Radha Chitta; Jing Zhou; Quanzeng You; Tong Sun; Jing Gao,Abstract Predicting the future health information of patients from the historical ElectronicHealth Records (EHR) is a core research task in the development of personalizedhealthcare. Patient EHR data consist of sequences of visits over time; where each visitcontains multiple medical codes; including diagnosis; medication; and procedure codes.The most important challenges for this task are to model the temporality and highdimensionality of sequential EHR data and to interpret the prediction results. Existing worksolves this problem by employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model EHR data andutilizing simple attention mechanism to interpret the results.

Collaboratively Improving Topic Discovery and Word Embeddings by Coordinating Global and Local Conte,Guangxu Xun; Yaliang Li; Jing Gao; Aidong Zhang,Abstract A text corpus typically contains two types of context information--global context andlocal context. Global context carries topical information which can be utilized by topic modelsto discover topic structures from the text corpus; while local context can train wordembeddings to capture semantic regularities reflected in the text corpus. This encourages usto exploit the useful information in both the global and the local context information. In thispaper; we propose a unified language model based on matrix factorization techniqueswhich 1) takes the complementary global and local context information into considerationsimultaneously; and 2) models topics and learns word embeddings collaboratively. Weempirically show that by incorporating both global and local context; this collaborative modelcan not only significantly improve the performance of topic discovery over the baseline …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2017),2017,2

Although there isno cure for diabetes; it can be managed. Especially; with advances in sensor technology;lots of data may lead to the improvement of diabetes management; if properly mined.However; there usually exists noise or errors in the observed behavioral data which poseschallenges in extracting meaningful knowledge. To overcome this challenge; we learn thelatent state which represents the patient's condition. Such states should be inferred from thebehavioral data but unknown a priori. In this paper; we propose a novel framework tocapture the trajectory of latent states for patients from behavioral data while exploiting theirdemographic differences and similarities to other patients.

Influence-Aware Truth Discovery,Hengtong Zhang; Qi Li; Fenglong Ma; Houping Xiao; Yaliang Li; Jing Gao; Lu Su,Abstract In the age of big data; information for the same entity can be obtained from differentsources; which is inevitably conflicting. Therefore; aggregation methods are needed toidentify the trustworthy information from such conflicting data. Truth discovery; whichimproves the aggregation results by estimating source trustworthiness and discoveringtruths simultaneously; has become an emerging field. Most truth discovery methods assumethat sources make their claims independently; which may not be true in practice. As a matterof fact; influences among sources are ubiquitous and the claims made by one source maybe influenced by others. Although there is some work that considers source correlation;those methods are designed to handle categorical claims; which is not general enough torepresent the complicated real world applications.

OnlineCM: Real-time Consensus Classification with Missing Values,Bowen Dong; Sihong Xie; Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Philip S Yu,Abstract Combining predictions from multiple sources or models has been shown to be auseful technique in data mining. For example; in network anomaly detection; multipledetectors' output have to be combined to obtain the diagnostic decisions. Unfortunately; asdata are generated at an increasingly high speed; existing prediction aggregation methodsare facing new challenges. First; the high velocity and hugh volume of the data renderexisting batch mode prediction aggregation algorithms infeasible. Second; due to theheterogeneity; predictions from multiple models or data sources might not be perfectlysynchronized; leading to abundant missing values in the prediction stream. We proposeOnlineCM; short for Online C onsensus M aximization; to address the above challenges.OnlineCM keeps only a minimal yet sufficient footprint for both consensus prediction and …,Proceedings of the 15th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2015);,2015,2
Multilabel consensus classification,Sihong Xie; Xiangnan Kong; Jing Gao; Wei Fan; S Yu Philip,In the era of big data; a large amount of noisy and incomplete data can be collected frommultiple sources for prediction tasks. Combining multiple models or data sources helps tocounteract the effects of low data quality and the bias of any single model or data source;and thus can improve the robustness and the performance of predictive models. Out ofprivacy; storage and bandwidth considerations; in certain circumstances one has to combinethe predictions from multiple models or data sources without accessing the raw data.Consensus-based prediction combination algorithms are effective for such situations.However; current research on prediction combination focuses on the single label setting;where an instance can have one and only one label. Nonetheless; data nowadays areusually multilabeled; such that more than one label have to be predicted at the same time …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2013,2
Exploring the power of heterogeneous information sources,Jing Gao,Abstract The big data challenge is one unique opportunity for both data mining anddatabase research and engineering. A vast ocean of data are collected from trillions ofconnected devices in real time on a daily basis; and useful knowledge is usually buried indata of multiple genres; from different sources; in different formats; and with different types ofrepresentation. Many interesting patterns cannot be extracted from a single data collection;but have to be discovered from the integrative analysis of all heterogeneous data sourcesavailable. Although many algorithms have been developed to analyze multiple informationsources; real applications continuously pose new challenges: Data can be gigantic; noisy;unreliable; dynamically evolving; highly imbalanced; and heterogeneous. Meanwhile; usersprovide limited feedback; have growing privacy concerns; and ask for actionable …,*,2011,2
A deep learning approach for detecting traffic accidents from social media data,Zhenhua Zhang; Qing He; Jing Gao; Ming Ni,Abstract This paper employs deep learning in detecting the traffic accident from social mediadata. First; we thoroughly investigate the 1-year over 3 million tweet contents in twometropolitan areas: Northern Virginia and New York City. Our results show that pairedtokens can capture the association rules inherent in the accident-related tweets and furtherincrease the accuracy of the traffic accident detection. Second; two deep learning methods:Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are investigated andimplemented on the extracted token. Results show that DBN can obtain an overall accuracyof 85% with about 44 individual token features and 17 paired token features. Theclassification results from DBN outperform those of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) andsupervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA).

Towards quality aware information integration in distributed sensing systems,Wenjun Jiang; Chenglin Miao; Lu Su; Qi Li; Shaohan Hu; Shiguang Wang; Jing Gao; Hengchang Liu; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han; Xue Liu; Yan Gao; Lance Kaplan,In this paper; we present GDA; a generalized decision aggregation framework thatintegrates information from distributed sensor nodes for decision making in a resourceefficient manner. Different from traditional approaches; our proposed GDA framework is ableto not only estimate the reliability of each sensor; but also take advantage of its confidenceinformation; and thus achieves higher decision accuracy. Targeting generalized problemdomains; our framework can naturally handle the scenarios where different sensor nodesobserve different sets of events whose numbers of possible classes may also be different.GDA also makes no assumption about the availability level of ground truth label information;while being able to take advantage of any if present. For these reasons; our approach canbe applied to a much broader spectrum of sensing scenarios. In this paper; we also …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2018,1
Personalized Disease Prediction Using a CNN-Based Similarity Learning Method,Qiuling Suo; Fenglong Ma; Ye Yuan; Mengdi Huai; Weida Zhong; Aidong Zhang; Jing Gao,Abstract—Predicting patients' risk of developing certain diseases is an important researchtopic in healthcare. Personalized predictive modeling; which focuses on building specificmodels for individual patients; has shown its advantages on utilizing heterogeneous healthdata compared to global models trained on the entire population. Personalized predictivemodels use information from similar patient cohorts; in order to capture the specificcharacteristics. Accurately identifying and ranking the similarity among patients based ontheir historical records is a key step in personalized modeling. The electric health records(EHRs); which are irregular sampled and have varied patient visit lengths; cannot be directlyused to measure patient similarity due to lack of an appropriate vector representation.

Detecting Malicious Behavior in Computer Networks via Cost-Sensitive and Connectivity Constrained Classification,Houping Xiao; Jing Gao; Long Vu; Deepak S Turaga,Abstract The detection of malicious behavior; that is; judging if a host/domain is malicious orbenign (ie; negative or positive labels); is complicated by the issue of imbalanced labeldistributions; as well as the limited amount of ground truth available to train supervisedmodels or build rules. To tackle these challenges; we propose a novel framework to learncost-sensitive models on both network hosts and external domains simultaneously; basedon a bipartite connectivity graph constructed between them. We also explicitly incorporatebehavioral features of the hosts computed from the network data as well as lexical andreputational features computed for the external domains into the proposed framework.Specifically; we model the predicted labels; measure the misclassification errors by theHamming distance between the predicted and true labels; incorporate different costs for …,*,2017,1

Multi-source Hierarchical Prediction Consolidation,Chenwei Zhang; Sihong Xie; Yaliang Li; Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Philip S. Yu,Abstract In big data applications such as healthcare data mining; due to privacy concerns; itis necessary to collect predictions from multiple information sources for the same instance;with raw features being discarded or withheld when aggregating multiple predictions.Besides; crowd-sourced labels need to be aggregated to estimate the ground truth of thedata. Due to the imperfection caused by predictive models or human crowdsourcingworkers; noisy and conflicting information is ubiquitous and inevitable. Although state-of-the-art aggregation methods have been proposed to handle label spaces with flat structures; asthe label space is becoming more and more complicated; aggregation under a labelhierarchical structure becomes necessary but has been largely ignored.

Effective Crowd Expertise Modeling via Cross Domain Sparsity and Uncertainty Reduction,Sihong Xie; Qingbo Hu; Weixiang Shao; Jingyuan Zhang; Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Philip S. Yu,Abstract Characterizations of crowd expertise is vital to online applications where the crowdplays a central role; such as StackExchange for question-answering and LinkedIn as aworkforce market. With accurately estimated worker expertise; new jobs can be assigned tothe right workers more effectively and efficiently. Most existing methods solely rely on thesparse worker-job interactions; leading to poorly estimated expertise that does notgeneralize well to a large amount of unseen jobs. Though transfer learning can utilizeexternal domains to mitigate the sparsity; the auxiliary domains can themselves suffer fromincomplete information; leading to inferior performance. There is a lack of principledframework to handle the sparse and incomplete data to achieve better expertise modeling.Based on multitask learning; we propose a framework that uses the knowledge learned …,Proceedings of the 16th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2016),2016,1
Finding global optimum for truth discovery: Entropy based geometric variance,Hu Ding; Jing Gao; Jinhui Xu,Abstract Truth Discovery is an important problem arising in data analytics related fields suchas data mining; database; and big data. It concerns about finding the most trustworthyinformation from a dataset acquired from a number of unreliable sources. Due to itsimportance; the problem has been extensively studied in recent years and a numbertechniques have already been proposed. However; all of them are of heuristic nature and donot have any quality guarantee. In this paper; we formulate the problem as a highdimensional geometric optimization problem; called Entropy based Geometric Variance.Relying on a number of novel geometric techniques (such as Log-Partition and ModifiedSimplex Lemma); we further discover new insights to this problem. We show; for the firsttime; that the truth discovery problem can be solved with guaranteed quality of solution …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2016,1
Multi-source information trustworthiness analysis,Houping Xiao; Jing Gao,Nowadays; a vast ocean of data from different sources is collected; and numerousapplications call for the extraction of actionable insights from multi-source data. Oneimportant task is to detect untrustworthy information because such information usuallyindicates critical; unusual; or suspicious activities. The limitation of existing approaches isthat they focus on one single source or ignore temporal information. To tackle the challengebrought by dynamic multi-source data; in this dissertation; we propose a multi-sourceinformation trustworthiness analysis framework. We represent the data as high-dimensionaltensors and then apply joint tensor factorization techniques to find the common subspaceacross multiple sources; based on which untrustworthy information is detected.

DRN: Bringing Greedy Layer-Wise Training into Time Dimension,Xiaoyi Li; Xiaowei Jia; Hui Li; Houping Xiao; Jing Gao; Aidong Zhang,Sequential data modeling has received growing interests due to its impact on real worldproblems. Sequential data is ubiquitous-financial transactions; advertise conversions anddisease evolution are examples of sequential data. A long-standing challenge in sequentialdata modeling is how to capture the strong hidden correlations among complex features inhigh volumes. The sparsity and skewness in the features extracted from sequential data alsoadd to the complexity of the problem. In this paper; we address these challenges from bothdiscriminative and generative perspectives; and propose novel stochastic learningalgorithms to model nonlinear variances from static time frames and their transitions.

Detecting Marionette Microblog Users for Improved Information Credibility,Xian Wu; Wei Fan; Jing Gao; Zi-Ming Feng; Yong Yu,Abstract In this paper; we propose to detect a special group of microblog users: the“marionette” users; who are created or employed by backstage “puppeteers”; either throughprograms or manually. Unlike normal users that access microblog for information sharing orsocial communication; the marionette users perform specific tasks to earn financial profits.For example; they follow certain users to increase their “statistical popularity”; or retweetsome tweets to amplify their “statistical impact”. The fabricated follower or retweet counts notonly mislead normal users to wrong information; but also seriously impair microblog-basedapplications; such as hot tweets selection and expert finding. In this paper; we study theimportant problem of detecting marionette users on microblog platforms.

Classifying Evolving Data Streams for Intrusion Detection,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han,Stream data classification is a challenging problem because of two important properties: itsinfinite length and evolving nature. Traditional learning algorithms that require severalpasses on the training data are not directly applicable to stream classification problembecause of the infinite length of the data stream. Data streams may evolve in several ways:the prior probability distribution p (c) of a class c may change; or the prior probability ofobserving an example p (x) may change; or both probabilities may change. In either case;the challenge is to build a classification model that is consistent with the current concept. Asa result; special techniques are required to classify evolving data streams. Network trafficcan be considered as a data stream having both abovementioned properties. Thus; networkintrusion detection can be considered as a stream classification problem; where each …,*,2009,1
Discovering Truths from Distributed Data,Yaqing Wang; Fenglong Ma; Lu Su; Jing Gao,Abstract—In the big data era; the information about the same object collected from multiplesources is inevitably conflicting. The task of identifying true information (ie; the truths) amongconflicting data is referred to as truth discovery; which incorporates the estimation of sourcereliability degrees into the aggregation of multi-source data. However; in many real-worldapplications; large-scale data are distributed across multiple servers. Traditional truthdiscovery approaches cannot handle this scenario due to the constraints of communicationoverhead and privacy concern. Another limitation of most existing work is that they ignorethe differences among objects; ie; they treat all the objects equally. This limitation would beexacerbated in distributed environments where significant differences exist among theobjects.

Long-Term Memory Networks for Question Answering,Fenglong Ma; Radha Chitta; Saurabh Kataria; Jing Zhou; Palghat Ramesh; Tong Sun; Jing Gao,Abstract: Question answering is an important and difficult task in the natural languageprocessing domain; because many basic natural language processing tasks can be cast intoa question answering task. Several deep neural network architectures have been developedrecently; which employ memory and inference components to memorize and reason overtext information; and generate answers to questions. However; a major drawback of manysuch models is that they are capable of only generating single-word answers. In addition;they require large amount of training data to generate accurate answers. In this paper; weintroduce the Long-Term Memory Network (LTMN); which incorporates both an externalmemory module and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to comprehend the inputdata and generate multi-word answers. The LTMN model can be trained end-to-end …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01961,2017,*
Robust Sparse Approximations for Stochastic Dynamical Systems,Christopher J Quinn; Ali Pinar; Jing Gao; Lu Su,Abstract Inferring the exact topology of the interactions in a large; stochastic dynamicalsystem from time-series data can often be prohibitive computationally and statisticallywithout strong side information. One alternative is to seek approximations of the systemtopology that nonetheless describe the data well. In recent works; algorithms were proposedto identify sparse approximations which are optimal in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence.Those algorithms relied on point estimates of statistics from the data. In this work; weinvestigate the more practical setting where point estimates are not reliable. We propose analgorithm to identify sparse; connected approximations that are robust to estimation error.,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2017,*
City-wide Traffic Volume Inference with Loop Detector Data and Taxi Trajectories,Chuishi Meng; Xiuwen Yi; Lu Su; Jing Gao; Yu Zheng,ABSTRACT The traffic volume on road segments is a vital property of the transportationefficiency. City-wide traffic volume information can benefit people with their everyday life;and help the government on better city planning. However; there are no existing methodsthat can monitor the traffic volume of every road; because they are either too expensive orinaccurate. Fortunately; nowadays we can collect a large amount of urban data whichprovides us the opportunity to tackle this problem. In this paper; we propose a novelframework to infer the city-wide traffic volume information with data collected by loopdetectors and taxi trajectories. Although these two data sets are incomplete; sparse and fromquite different domains; the proposed spatio-temporal semi-supervised learning model cantake the full advantages of both data and accurately infer the volume of each road.

Probabilistic Models for Fine-Grained Truth Discovery from Crowdsourced Data,Fenglong Ma; Jing Gao,In crowdsourced data aggregation task; there exist conflicts in the answers provided by largenumbers of sources on the same set of questions. The most important challenge for this taskis to estimate source reliability and select answers that are provided by high-quality sources.Existing work solves this problem by simultaneously estimating sources' reliability andinferring questions' true answers (ie; the truths). However; these methods assume that asource has the same reliability degree on all the questions; but ignore the fact that sources'reliability may vary significantly among different topics.

Significant edge detection in target network by exploring multiple auxiliary networks,Nan Du; Jing Gao; Liang Ge; Vishrawas Gopalakrishnan; Xiaowei Jia; Kang Li; Aidong Zhang,Despite the ability to model many real world settings as a network; one major challenge inanalyzing network data is that important and reliable links between objects are usuallyobscured by noisy information and hence not readily discernible. In this paper; we proposeto detect these important and reliable links-significant edges; from a target network by usingmultiple auxiliary networks and a limited amount of labelled information. In this process; wefirst abstract the community knowledge learnt across target and auxiliary networks to detectsignificant patterns. The mined community knowledge captures the key profile of networkrelationships and thus can be used to determine whether an existing edge indicates a trueor false relationship.

Functional Node Detection on Linked Data,Kang Li; Jing Gao; Suxin Guo; Nan Du; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Networks; which characterize object relationships; are ubiquitous in variousdomains. One very important problem is to detect the nodes of a specific function in thesenetworks. For example; is a user normal or anomalous in an email network? Does a proteinplay a key role in a protein-protein interaction network? In many applications; the informationwe have about the networks usually includes both node characteristics and networkstructures. Both types of information can contribute to the task of learning functional nodes;and we call the collection of node and link information as linked data. However; existingmethods only use a few subjectively selected topological features from network structures todetect functional nodes; thus fail to include highly discriminative and meaningful patternshidden in linked data.

An Empirical Study on Multistep-ahead Time Series Prediction,Haibin Cheng; Pang-Ning Tan; Jing Gao; Jerry Scripps,Abstract Multistep-ahead prediction is the task of predicting a sequence of continuousvalues in a time series. A typical approach is to apply a regression model stepby-step anduse the predicted value of the current time step to determine its value in the next time step.This approach is known as multi-stage prediction. In this paper; we investigate twoalternative approaches known as independent value prediction and parameter prediction.The first approach builds a separate model for each prediction step using only the valuesobserved in the past. The second approach fits a parametric function to the sequence of timeseries values and builds a separate model to predict each parameter of the fitted function.The estimated parameters are then used to reconstruct the shape of the predicted timeseries. We perform a comparative study among the three prediction approaches using …,Temporal data mining: algorithms; theory and applications (TDM 2005),*,*
