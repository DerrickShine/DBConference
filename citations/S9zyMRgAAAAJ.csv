Towards sensor database systems,Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke; Praveen Seshadri,Abstract Sensor networks are being widely deployed for measurement; detection andsurveillance applications. In these new applications; users issue long-running queries overa combination of stored data and sensor data. Most existing applications rely on acentralized system for collecting sensor data. These systems lack flexibility because data isextracted in a predefined way; also; they do not scale to a large number of devices becauselarge volumes of raw data are transferred regardless of the queries that are submitted. In ournew concept of sensor database system; queries dictate which data is extracted from thesensors. In this paper; we define the concept of sensor databases mixing stored datarepresented as relations and sensor data represented as time series. Each long-runningquery formulated over a sensor database defines a persistent view; which is maintained …,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2001,1079
Querying the physical world,Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke; Praveen Seshadri,In the next decade; millions of sensors and small-scale mobile devices will integrateprocessors; memory; and communication capabilities. Networks of devices will be widelydeployed for monitoring applications. In these new applications; users need to query verylarge collections of devices in an ad hoc manner. Most existing systems rely on a centralizedsystem for collecting device data. These systems lack flexibility because data is extracted ina predefined way. Also; they do not scale to a large number of devices because largevolumes of raw data are transferred. In our new concept of a device database system;distributed query execution techniques are applied to leverage the computing capabilities ofdevices; and to reduce communication. We define an abstraction that allows us to representa device network as a database and we describe how distributed query processing …,IEEE personal Communications,2000,650
Database tuning: principles; experiments; and troubleshooting techniques,Dennis Shasha; Philippe Bonnet,Tuning your database for optimal performance means more than following a few short stepsin a vendor-specific guide. For maximum improvement; you need a broad and deepknowledge of basic tuning principles; the ability to gather data in a systematic way; and theskill to make your system run faster. This is an art as well as a science; and DatabaseTuning: Principles; Experiments; and Troubleshooting Techniques will help you developportable skills that will allow you to tune a wide variety of database systems on a multitude ofhardware and operating systems. Further; these skills; combined with the scripts provided forvalidating results; are exactly what you need to evaluate competing database products andto choose the right one.

uFLIP: Understanding flash IO patterns,Luc Bouganim; Björn Jónsson; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract: Does the advent of flash devices constitute a radical change for secondarystorage? How should database systems adapt to this new form of secondary storage?Before we can answer these questions; we need to fully understand the performancecharacteristics of flash devices. More specifically; we want to establish what kind of IOsshould be favored (or avoided) when designing algorithms and architectures for flash-basedsystems. In this paper; we focus on flash IO patterns; that capture relevant distribution of IOsin time and space; and our goal is to quantify their performance. We define uFLIP; abenchmark for measuring the response time of flash IO patterns. We also present abenchmarking methodology which takes into account the particular characteristics of flashdevices. Finally; we present the results obtained by measuring eleven flash devices; and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1780,2009,210
Adaptive and decentralized operator placement for in-network query processing,Boris Jan Bonfils; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract In-network query processing is critical for reducing network traffic when accessingand manipulating sensor data. It requires placing a tree of query operators such as filtersand aggregations but also correlations onto sensor nodes in order to minimize the amount ofdata transmitted in the network. In this paper; we show that this problem is a variant of thetask assignment problem for which polynomial algorithms have been developed. Thesealgorithms are however centralized and cannot be used in a sensor network. We describean adaptive and decentralized algorithm that progressively refines the placement ofoperators by walking through neighbor nodes. Simulation results illustrate the potentialbenefits of our approach. They also show that our placement strategy can achieve nearoptimal placement onto various graph topologies despite the risks of local minima.,Telecommunication Systems,2004,210
Bluetooth and sensor networks: A reality check,Martin Leopold; Mads Bondo Dydensborg; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract The current generation of sensor nodes rely on commodity components. The choiceof the radio is particularly important as it impacts not only energy consumption but alsosoftware design (eg; network self-assembly; multihop routing and in-network processing).Bluetooth is one of the most popular commodity radios for wireless devices. As arepresentative of the frequency hopping spread spectrum radios; it is a natural alternative tobroadcast radios in the context of sensor networks. The question is whether Bluetooth canbe a viable alternative in practice. In this paper; we report our experience using Bluetooth forthe sensor network regime. We describe our tiny Bluetooth stack that allows TinyOSapplications to run on Bluetooth-based sensor nodes; we present a multihop networkassembly procedure that leverages Bluetooth's device discovery protocol; and we discuss …,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Embedded networked sensor systems,2003,160
Smart-tag based data dissemination,Allan Beaufour; Martin Leopold; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract Monitoring wide; hostile areas requires disseminating data between fixed;disconnected clusters of sensor nodes. It is not always possible to install long-range radiosin order to cover the whole area. We propose to leverage the movement of mobileindividuals; equipped with smart-tags; to disseminate data across disconnected static nodesspread across a wide area. Static nodes and mobile smart-tags exchange data when theyare in the vicinity of each other; smart-tags disseminate data as they move around. In thispaper; we propose an algorithm for update propagation and a model for smart-tag baseddata dissemination. We use simulation to study the characteristics of the model we propose.Finally; we present an implementation based on Bluetooth smart-tags.,Proceedings of the 1st ACM international workshop on Wireless sensor networks and applications,2002,151
GADT: A probability space ADT for representing and querying the physical world,Anton Faradjian; Johannes Gehrke; P Bonnett,Large sensor networks are being widely deployed for measurement; detection andmonitoring applications. Many of these applications involve database systems to store andprocess data from the physical world. This data has inherent measurement uncertainties thatare properly represented by continuous probability distribution functions (PDFs). Weintroduce a new object-relational abstract data type (ADT)-the Gaussian ADT (GADT)-thatmodels physical data as Gaussian PDFs; and we show that existing index structures can beused as fast access methods for GADT data. We also present a measurement-theoreticmodel of probabilistic data and evaluate GADT in its light.,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,103

The DISCOprototype currently focuses on three central research problems in the context of thesesystems. First; since the capabilities of each data source is different; transforming queriesinto subqueries on data source is difficult. We call this problem the weak data sourceproblem. Second; since each data source performs operations in a generally unique way;the cost for performing an operation may vary radically from one wrapper to another. We callthis problem the radical cost problem. Finally; existing systems behave rudely whenattempting to access an unavailable data source. We call this problem the ungraceful failureproblem. DISCO copes with these problems. For the weak data source problem; the …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1997,88
Linux block IO: introducing multi-queue SSD access on multi-core systems,Matias Bjørling; Jens Axboe; David Nellans; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract The IO performance of storage devices has accelerated from hundreds of IOPS fiveyears ago; to hundreds of thousands of IOPS today; and tens of millions of IOPS projected infive years. This sharp evolution is primarily due to the introduction of NAND-flash devicesand their data parallel design. In this work; we demonstrate that the block layer within theoperating system; originally designed to handle thousands of IOPS; has become abottleneck to overall storage system performance; specially on the high NUMA-factorprocessors systems that are becoming commonplace. We describe the design of a nextgeneration block layer that is capable of handling tens of millions of IOPS on a multi-coresystem equipped with a single storage device. Our experiments show that our design scalesgraciously with the number of cores; even on NUMA systems with multiple sockets.,Proceedings of the 6th international systems and storage conference,2013,78
Computational reproducibility: state-of-the-art; challenges; and database research opportunities,Juliana Freire; Philippe Bonnet; Dennis Shasha,Abstract Computational experiments have become an integral part of the scientific method;but reproducing; archiving; and querying them is still a challenge. The first barrier to a wideradoption is the fact that it is hard both for authors to derive a compendium that encapsulatesall the components needed to reproduce a result and for reviewers to verify the results. Inthis tutorial; we will present a series of guidelines and; through hands-on examples; reviewexisting tools to help authors create of reproducible results. We will also outline openproblems and new directions for database-related research having to do with queryingcomputational experiments.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2012,57
Partial answers for unavailable data sources,Philippe Bonnet; Anthony Tomasic,Abstract Many heterogeneous database system products and prototypes exist today; theywill soon be deployed in a wide variety of environments. Most existing systems suffer froman Achilles' heel: they ungracefully fail in presence of unavailable data sources. If some datasources are unavailable when accessed; these systems either silently ignore them orgenerate an error. This behavior is improper in environments where there is a non-negligible probability that data sources cannot be accessed (eg; Internet). In case some datasources cannot be accessed when processing a query; the complete answer to this querycannot be computed; some work can however be done with the data sources that areavailable. In this paper; we propose a novel approach where; in presence of unavailabledata sources; the answer to a query is a partial answer. A partial answer is a …,International Conference on Flexible Query answering systems,1998,53

An executable paper provides more informationfor computational experiments and results than the text; tables; and figures of standardpapers. Executable papers can bundle computational content that allow readers andreviewers to interact; validate; and explore experiments. By including such content; authorsfacilitate future discoveries by lowering the barrier to reproducing and extending results.

New doubts on the importance of the logographic stage,Liliane Sprenger-Charolles; Philippe Bonnet,The objective of this longitudinal study was to evaluate reading strategies used by Frenchchildren. A group of prereaders (N= 37) was followed from the beginning of kindergarten tothe end of the first grade. In kindergarten; they were non-readers. They were presented witha series of word to picture matching tasks twice in kindergarten and twice in first grade. Theaim of the observation was to evaluate the utilization of logographic strategies which arecharacterized by a large reliance on the global form of the word (its length; see study 1); bythe non-sequentiality of processing (study 2) and by the use of salient visual--and notphonological--cues (study 3). In these three studies we took into account correct responsesand justifications. Relations between metaphonological abilities; letter knowledge andprereading strategies were also assessed (studies 4 and 5).

Improving responsiveness for wide-area data access,Laurent Amsaleg; Philippe Bonnet; Michael J Franklin; Anthony Tomasic; Tolga Urhan,Abstract In a wide-area environment; the time required to obtain data from remote sourcescan vary unpredictably due to network congestion; link failure or other problems. Traditionaltechniques for query optimization and query execution do not cope well with suchunpredictability. The static nature of those techniques prevents them from adapting to remoteaccess delays that arise at runtime. In this paper we describe two separate; but relatedtechniques aimed at tackling this problem. The first technique; called Query Scrambling;hides relatively short; intermittent delays by dynamically adjusting query execution plans on-the-fly. The second technique addresses the longer-term unavailability of data sources byallowing the return of partial query answers when some of the data needed to fully answer aquery are missing. 1 Introduction The continued dramatic growth in global …,IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin,1997,41

So far personal servers have mainly been considered for accessing personalinformation. In this paper; we consider personal servers in the context of a digital key system.Digital keys are an interesting alternative to physical keys for mail or good deliverycompanies whose employees access tens of private buildings every day.

In this paper; we assess the SIGMOD repeatability process in termsof participation; review process and results. While the participation is stable in terms ofnumber of submissions; we find this year a sharp contrast between the high participationfrom Asian authors and the low participation from American authors. We also find that mostexperiments are distributed as Linux packages accompanied by instructions on how to setupand run the experiments.

Mote-based online anomaly detection using echo state networks,Marcus Chang; Andreas Terzis; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract Sensor networks deployed for scientific data acquisition must inspectmeasurements for faults and events of interest. Doing so is crucial to ensure the relevanceand correctness of the collected data. In this work we unify fault and event detection under ageneral anomaly detection framework. We use machine learning techniques to classifymeasurements that resemble a training set as normal and measurements that significantlydeviate from that set as anomalies. Furthermore; we aim at an anomaly detection frameworkthat can be implemented on motes; thereby allowing them to continue collecting scientifically-relevant data even in the absence of network connectivity. The general consensus thus farhas been that learning-based techniques are too resource intensive to be implemented onmote-class devices. In this paper; we challenge this belief.

LightNVM: The Linux Open-Channel SSD Subsystem.,Matias Bjørling; Javier González; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract As Solid-State Drives (SSDs) become commonplace in data-centers and storagearrays; there is a growing demand for predictable latency. Traditional SSDs; serving blockI/Os; fail to meet this demand. They offer a high-level of abstraction at the cost ofunpredictable performance and suboptimal resource utilization. We propose that SSDmanagement trade-offs should be handled through Open-Channel SSDs; a new class ofSSDs; that give hosts control over their internals.

Such ecological sensor networks; however; will only fulfill theirpotential if they meet the scientists requirements.

Manyresearchers have proposed to adapt database algorithms for existing flash devices; othershave tried to capture the performance characteristics of flash devices. However; today; weneither have a reference DBMS design nor a performance model for flash devices: databaseresearchers are running after flash memory technology. In this paper; we take the reverseapproach and we define how flash devices should support database management.

Inthis demonstration; we share the lessons we learnt developing the uFlip benchmark andconducting experiments with a wide range of flash devices. We illustrate the problems thatare actual obstacles to sound performance and energy measurements; and we show how tomitigate the effects of these problems.

EagleTree: exploring the design space of SSD-based algorithms,Niv Dayan; Martin Kjær Svendsen; Matias Bjørling; Philippe Bonnet; Luc Bouganim,Abstract Solid State Drives (SSDs) are a moving target for system designers: they are blackboxes; their internals are undocumented; and their performance characteristics vary acrossmodels. There is no appropriate analytical model and experimenting with commercial SSDsis cumbersome; as it requires a careful experimental methodology to ensure repeatability.Worse; performance results obtained on a given SSD cannot be generalized. Overall; it isimpossible to explore how a given algorithm; say a hash join or LSM-tree insertions;leverages the intrinsic parallelism of a modern SSD; or how a slight change in the internalsof an SSD would impact its overall performance.

First; the storage chips; which are the basic component of a SSD; have widelydifferent characteristics–eg; copy-onwrite; erase-before-write and page-addressability forflash chips vs. in-place update and byte-addressability for PCM chips. Second; SSDs are nolonger a bottleneck in terms of I/O latency forcing streamlined execution throughout the I/Ostack.

uflip: Understanding the energy consumption of flash devices,Matias Bjorling; Philippe Bonnet; Luc Bouganim; Björn Pór Jónsson,Understanding the energy consumption of flash devices is important for two reasons. First;energy is emerging as a key metric for data management systems. It is thus important tounderstand how we can reason about the energy consumption of flash devices beyond theirapproximate aggregate consumption (low power consumption in idle mode; average Wattconsumption from the data sheets). Second; when measured at a sufficiently fine granularity;the energy consumption of a given device might complement the performancecharacteristics derived from its response time profile. Indeed; background work which is notdirectly observable with a response time profile appears clearly when energy is used as ametric. In this paper; we discuss the results from the uFLIP benchmark applied to fourdifferent SSD devices using both response time and energy as metric.,IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin,2010,13

Parachute queries in the presence of unavailable data sources,Philippe Bonnet; Anthony Tomasic,Mediator systems are used today in a wide variety of unreliable environments. Whenprocessing a query; a mediator may try to access a data source which is unavailable. In thissituation; existing systems either silently ignore unavailable data sources or generate anerror. In either case; to obtain the complete answer; the query is reprocessed from scratch.This behavior is inefficient in environments with a non-negligible probability that a datasource is unavailable (eg; the Internet). In the case that some data sources are unavailable;the complete answer to a query cannot be obtained; however useful work can be done withthe available data sources. In this paper; we describe a novel approach to mediator queryprocessing where; in the presence of unavailable data sources; the answer to a query is a{\em partial answer}.

In this tutorial; we share two views on the development ofdata management systems for flash devices. The first view considers that flash devicesintroduce so much complexity that it is necessary to reconsider the strictly layered approachbetween storage system; operating system and data management system.

Getting priorities straight: improving Linux support for database I/O,Christoffer Hall; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract The Linux 2.6 kernel supports asynchronous I/O as a result of propositions from thedatabase industry. This is a positive evolution but is it a panacea? In the context of theBadger project; a collaboration between MySQL AB and University of Copenhagen; weevaluate how MySQL/InnoDB can best take advantage of Linux asynchronous I/O and howLinux can help MySQL/InnoDB best take advantage of the underlying I/O bandwidth. This isa crucial problem for the increasing number of MySQL servers deployed for very largedatabase applications. In this paper; we first show that the conservative I/O submissionpolicy used by InnoDB (as well as Oracle 9.2) leads to an under-utilization of the availableI/O bandwidth. We then show that introducing prioritized asynchronous I/O in Linux will allowMySQL/InnoDB and the other Linux databases to fully utilize the available I/O bandwith …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,11
Monitoring in a high-arctic environment: Some lessons from mana,Marcus Chang; Philippe Bonnet,Our Strategy We aimed to design a system that operates in a high-arctic environment at highresolution; low cost; and high utility. Sensors dominate lake-monitoring costs (optical sensorsthat measure chlorophyll concentration cost more than US$10;000). This restricts the potentialfor high spatial resolution—for example; using a robot to move an expensive sensor insteadof deploying multiple cheap sensors. So; we focus on high utility. We can't achieve high utilitywith current data loggers; which have two main shortcomings. First; they implement a best-effortapproach; storing raw measurements as they're received. So; scientists must search for anyoutliers; miss- ing values; or miscalibration.3 At that point; the best they can hope for is to interpolatethe valid data points to compensate for the unusable ones.

I/O Speculation for the Microsecond Era.,Michael Yung Chung Wei; Matias Bjørling; Philippe Bonnet; Steven Swanson,Abstract Microsecond latencies and access times will soon dominate most datacenter I/Oworkloads; thanks to improvements in both storage and networking technologies. Currenttechniques for dealing with I/O latency are targeted for either very fast (nanosecond) or slow(millisecond) devices. These techniques are suboptimal for microsecond devices-they eitherblock the processor for tens of microseconds or yield the processor only to be ready againmicroseconds later. Speculation is an alternative technique that resolves the issues ofyielding and blocking by enabling an application to continue running until the applicationproduces an externally visible side effect. State-of-the-art techniques for speculating on I/Orequests involve checkpointing; which can take up to a millisecond; squandering any of theperformance benefits microsecond scale devices have to offer.

Making CSB+-Tree Processor Conscious.,Michael L Samuel; Anders Uhl Pedersen; Philippe Bonnet,ABSTRACT Cache-conscious indexes; such as CSB+-tree; are sensitive to the underlyingprocessor architecture. In this paper; we focus on how to adapt the CSB+-tree so that itperforms well on a range of different processor architectures. Previous work has focused onthe impact of node size on the performance of the CSB+-tree. We argue that it is necessaryto consider a larger group of parameters in order to adapt CSB+-tree to processorarchitectures as different as Pentium and Itanium. We identify this group of parameters andstudy how it impacts the performance of CSB+-tree on Itanium 2. Finally; we propose asystematic method for adapting CSB+-tree to new platforms. This work is a first step towardsintegrating CSB+-tree in MySQL's heap storage manager.,DaMoN,2005,8
Leveraging non-uniform resources for parallel query processing,Tobias Mayr; Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke; Praveen Seshadri,Modular clusters are now composed of nonuniform nodes with different CPUs; disks ornetwork cards so that customers can adapt the cluster configuration to the changingtechnologies and to their changing needs. This challenges dataflow parallelism as theprimary load balancing technique of existing parallel database systems. We show in thispaper that dataflow parallelism alone is ill suited for modular clusters because running thesame operation on different subsets of the data can not fully utilize non-uniform hardwareresources. We propose and evaluate new load balancing techniques that blend pipelineparallelism with data parallelism. We consider relational operators as pipelines of fine-grained operations that can be located on different cluster nodes and executed in parallel ondifferent data subsets to best exploit non-uniform resources. We present an experimental …,Cluster Computing and the Grid; 2003. Proceedings. CCGrid 2003. 3rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on,2003,7
Never mind the standard here is the TinyOS 802.15. 4 stack,Jan Flora; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract 802.15. 4 has been designed to support wireless monitoring and controlapplications with tight energy budget and limited throughput needs. This sounds promising;but can this standard be efficiently implemented on 8-bit sensor motes with limited resourcesand computing capabilities? Ideally; it should be possible to trim off parts of the stack that arenot relevant for a given sensor profile in order to reduce memory footprint. More generally; itshould be possible to adapt the stack to the hardware limitations of a given platform. In orderto study these issues; we cannot use the implementations provided by radio manufacturers.These are fairly undocumented blackboxes without tuning capabilities. We are thusdeveloping an 802.15. 4 stack in TinyOS on a Motorola HCS08 microcontroller andFreescale MC13192 radio. In the process; we are experiencing the wide gap that exists …,University of Copenhagen; Technical Report,2006,6
Leveraging physical locality to integrate smart appliances in non-residential buildings with ultrasound and Bluetooth low energy,Jonathan Fürst; Kaifei Chen; Mohammed Aljarrah; Philippe Bonnet,Smart appliances and sensors have become widely available. We are deploying them in ourhomes to manage the level of comfort; energy consumption or security. While such smartappliances are becoming an integral part of modern home automation systems; theirintegration into non-residential buildings is problematic. Indeed; smart appliance vendorsrely on the assumption that the Local Area Network (LAN) guarantees locality and a singleunit of use/administration. This assumption is not met in non-residential buildings; where theLAN infrastructure might cover one or several buildings; and where several organizations orfunctional units are co-located. Worse; directly coupling smart appliances to the Internetopens up a range of security issues as device owners have very little control over the waytheir smart appliances interact with external services.

A practical hardware-assisted approach to customize trusted boot for mobile devices,Javier González; Michael Hölzl; Peter Riedl; Philippe Bonnet; René Mayrhofer,Abstract Current efforts to increase the security of the boot sequence for mobile devices fallinto two main categories:(i) secure boot: where each stage in the boot sequence isevaluated; aborting the boot process if a non expected component attempts to be loaded;and (ii) trusted boot: where a log is maintained with the components that have been loadedin the boot process for later audit. The first approach is often criticized for locking downdevices; thus reducing users' freedom to choose software. The second lacks themechanisms to enforce any form of run-time verification. In this paper; we present thearchitecture for a two-phase boot verification that addresses these shortcomings. In the firstphase; at boot-time the integrity of the bootloader and OS images are verified and logged; inthe second phase; at run-time applications can check the boot traces and verify that the …,International Conference on Information Security,2014,5

Service and experiment: Towards a perpetual sensor network testbed without backchannel,Aslak Johansen; Thomas Sorensen; Philippe Bonnet,The sensor network testbeds available today rely on a communication channel different fromthe mote radio-a backchannel-to facilitate mote reprogramming; health monitoring andperformance analysis. Such backchannels are either supported as wired communicationchannels (USB or Ethernet); or via an extra board coupled to the mote under test and thusintroduce significant constraint on the testbed setup and on the mote power budget. WithGreenlab; we wish to study the performance behavior of outdoor sensor networks whereenergy is harvested from the environment. We thus cannot rely on a backchannel. In thispaper; we present the design of the central mechanisms needed to support Greenlab andtheir implementation in TinyOS.

Lessons from the Hogthrob deployments,Marcus Chang; Cécile Cornou; Klaus S Madsen; Philippe Bonnet,Sensor Nodes. We decided to use BTnodes [Beutel] as a hardware platform. We usedBtnodes rev2; equipped with an ATMega128 micro-controller; 64 KiB of external RAM; andan Ericsson ROK 101 007 Bluetooth module. Our goal was to use the high-bandwidth radio3of the BTnodes to transmit large amounts of data. This opens up for a model where thesensor data is stored locally on the node as it is captured; and periodically transmitted inlarge chunks to the base station. We thus leverage the radioГs bandwidth in order to reduceits duty cycle. We developed an accelerometer board for the BTnode and designed a nodepackaging that could fit the sowГs neck. Sensor Data.

Demo abstract: Human-in-the-loop bms point matching and metadata labeling with babel,Jonathan Fürst; Kaifei Chen; Randy H Katz; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract The inconsistent metadata in Building Management Systems (BMS) hinders thedeployment of cyber-physical applications in non-residential buildings. In this demonstrationwe present Babel; a continuous; human-in-the-loop and crowdsourced approach to thecreation and maintenance of BMS metadata. Occupants provide physical and digital input inform of actuations (eg; the switching of a light) and readings (eg; the reading of the roomtemperature of a thermostat) to Babel. Babel then matches this input to digital points in theBMS based on value equality. We have implemented a prototype of our system in a non-residential building over the BACnet protocol. While our approach can not solve allmetadata problems; this demonstration illustrates that it is able to match many relevantpoints in a fast and precise manner.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM International Conference on Embedded Systems for Energy-Efficient Built Environments,2015,3

Query processing with heterogeneous resources,Tobias Mayr; Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke; Praveen Seshadri,In emerging systems; CPUs and memory are integrated into active disks; controllers; andnetwork interconnects. Query processing on these new multiprocessor systems mustconsider the heterogeneity of resources among the components. This leads to the moregeneral problem of how to deal with performance heterogeneity in parallel databasesystems. We study database query processing techniques that increase the leverage ofheterogeneous resources. We show that the traditional algorithms used in shared-nothingparallel databases fail to utilize non-uniform resources. Uniform resource usage across non-uniform components leads to resource bottlenecks. We describe a class of new executiontechniques that balance the usage of system resources using non-uniform intra-operatorparallelism.

What's Up with the Storage Hierarchy?,Philippe Bonnet,ABSTRACT Ten years ago; Jim Gray observed that flash was about to replace magneticdisks. He also predicted that the need for low latency would make main memory databasescommonplace. Most of his predictions have proven accurate. Today; who can makepredictions about the future of the storage hierarchy? Both main memory and storagesystems are undergoing profound transformations. First; their design goals are increasinglycomplex (reconfigurable infrastructure at low latency; high resource utilization and stableenergy footprint). Second; the status quo is not an option due to the shortcomings of existingsolutions (memory bandwidth gap; inefficiency of generic memory/storage controllers). Third;new technologies are emerging (hybrid memories; non-volatile memories still under non-disclosure agreements; near-data processing in memory and storage). The impact of …,CIDR,2017,2
GeckoFTL: Scalable Flash Translation Techniques For Very Large Flash Devices,Niv Dayan; Philippe Bonnet; Stratos Idreos,Abstract The volume of metadata needed by a flash translation layer (FTL) is proportional tothe storage capacity of a flash device. Ideally; this metadata should reside in the device'sintegrated RAM to enable fast access. However; as flash devices scale to terabytes; thenecessary volume of metadata is exceeding the available integrated RAM. Moreover;recovery time after power failure; which is proportional to the size of the metadata; isbecoming impractical. The simplest solution is to persist more metadata in flash. Theproblem is that updating metadata in flash increases the amount of internal IOs therebyharming performance and device lifetime. In this paper; we identify a key component of themetadata called the Page Validity Bitmap (PVB) as the bottleneck. PVB is used by thegarbage-collectors of state-of-the-art FTLs to keep track of which physical pages in the …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,2
Crowd-sourced BMS point matching and metadata maintenance with Babel,Jonathan Fürst; Kaifei Chen; Randy H Katz; Philippe Bonnet,Cyber-physical applications; deployed on top of Building Management Systems (BMS);promise energy saving and comfort improvement in non-residential buildings. Suchapplications are so far mainly deployed as research prototypes. The main roadblock towidespread adoption is the low quality of BMS metadata. There is indeed a mismatchbetween (i) the anecdotal nature of metadata for legacy BMS-they are usually initializedwhen the BMS is commissioned and later neglected-; and (ii) the imperious need forconsistent and up-to-date metadata for supporting building analytics or personalized controlsystems. Such applications access sensors and actuators through BMS metadata in form ofpoint labels. The naming of labels is however often inconsistent and incomplete.

Garbage collection techniques for flash-resident page-mapping FTLs,Niv Dayan; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract: Storage devices based on flash memory have replaced hard disk drives (HDDs)due to their superior performance; increasing density; and lower power consumption.Unfortunately; flash memory is subject to challenging idiosyncrasies like erase-before-writeand limited block lifetime. These constraints are handled by a flash translation layer (FTL);which performs out-of-place updates; wear-leveling and garbage-collection behind thescene; while offering the application a virtualization of the physical address space. A class ofrelevant FTLs employ a flash-resident page-associative mapping table from logical tophysical addresses; with a smaller RAM-resident cache for frequently mapped entries. In thispaper; we address the problem of performing garbage-collection under such FTLs. Weobserve two problems. Firstly; maintaining the metadata needed to perform garbage …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.01666,2015,2
Linux kernel abstractions for open-channel solid state drives,Matias Bjørling; Jesper Madsen; Javier González; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract The widespread adoption of SSDs is due to the combination of two factors:(i)superior performance; and (ii) identical block device interface. However; the combination ofthese two factors is becoming a problem as SSD performance keeps on improving;revealing performance bottlenecks throughout the I/O stack. To tackle this issue; anincreasingly popular solution for cloud providers is to consider open-channel SSDs; ie;custom firmware SSDs that expose the physical storage space directly to the host and itsoperating system. In this paper; we report on the design and implementation of an open-channel SSD management layer for Linux.

Tee-based trusted storage,Javier Gonzalez; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract: Today; it is safe to assume that any program or data can be compromised; if theyare not protected by hardware within a secure area. Systems based on crypto-processors(eg; a trusted platform module; a smart card or a hardware security module) rely on theproperties of tamper resistant hardware to establish a tight security parameter around areduced set of predefined functionalities. Such systems are very secure; but they imposestrong constraints on the functionalities; the connectivity or the resources available within thesecure area. They have not proven versatile enough to provide mainstream trusted storagefor personal data. We believe that this role can be taken over by systems equipped withTrusted Execution Environments (TEE); such as ARM's TrustZone. Indeed; even if TEEsprovide weaker security guarantees than crypto-processors; they already provide a …,*,2014,2
LightNVM: Lightning Fast Evaluation Platform for Non-Volatile Memories,Matias Bjørling; Jesper Madsen; Philippe Bonnet; Aviad Zuck; Zvonimir Bandic; Qingbo Wang,Abstract The IO performance of storage devices has increased by three orders of magnitudeover the last five years. This is due to the emergence of solid state drives (SSDs) that wire inparallel tens of non-volatile memory chips. How can software systems keep up with thisradical evolution? Commercial SSDs are black boxes; whose behavior and performanceprofile are largely undocumented. Today; the evaluation of SSD-based algorithms andsystems is thus; mostly; trace-driven on top of simple SSD models. Only few academicgroups or software companies have the resources to implement their own platform and leada principled exploration of the design space for SSD-based systems. In order to lower thebarrier for the evaluation of systems and software research on top of NVM-based SSDs; weintroduce LightNVM; a new SSD evaluation platform.

We address both the increased utilization and theneed to diversify the way they are produced by introducing an open source Python (www.python. org) library called EcoIS that creates image series from unaligned pictures ofspecially equipped plots. We use EcoIS to sample flowering phenology plots in a high arcticenvironment and create image series that later generate phenophase counts andautomatically estimate phenological dates of interest. Our results exhibit one day differencebetween EcoIS estimations of local indicators and the ones calculated with the establishedfield-based process.

New generations of motes are promising to deliver significantimprovements in terms of power consumption and price—in particular motes based onSystem-on-a-chip. The question is how do we compare mote performance? How to find outwhich mote is best suited for a given application?

Modelling and managing ssd write-amplification,Niv Dayan; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract: How stable is the performance of your flash-based Solid State Drives (SSDs)? Thisquestion is central for database designers and administrators; cloud service providers; andSSD constructors. The answer depends on write-amplification; ie; garbage collectionoverhead. More specifically; the answer depends on how write-amplification evolves in time.How then can one model and manage write-amplification; especially when applicationworkloads change? This is the focus of this paper. Managing write-amplification boils downto managing the surplus physical space; called over-provisioned space.

To counter such threats; and to remain trustworthy; personaldevices should enforce storage security. State-of-the-art storage security solutions rely onhardware protected encryption. They cannot be deployed; as such; on personal deviceseither because they require additional hardware (eg; NetApp's SafeNet); or because theyare constrained to specific hardware/software combinations (eg; McAfee's DeepSafe).

A distributed architecture for sharing ecological data sets with access and usage control guarantees,Philippe Bonnet; Javier Gonzalez; Joel Granados,Abstract In our information-age; the necessary scientific exploration is mainly driven bymining new insights from many diverse data sets. While there is a consensus that acollaborative data infrastructure is needed to allow researchers in different domains tocollaborate on the same data sets in order to get new insights; there are significant barriersto the realization of this vision. One of the key challenges is to allow scientists to share theirdata widely while retaining some form of control over who accesses this data (accesscontrol) and more importantly how it is used (usage control). Access and usage control isnecessary to enforce existing open data policies.

Schema tuning,Philippe Bonnet; Dennis Shasha,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers.

A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

uFLIP-OC: Understanding Flash I/O Patterns on Open-Channel Solid-State Drives,Ivan Luiz Picoli; Carla Villegas Pasco; Björn Þór Jónsson; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract Solid-State Drives (SSDs) have gained acceptance by providing the same blockdevice abstraction as magnetic hard drives; at the cost of suboptimal resource utilisation andunpredictable performance.

A Practical Model for Human-Smart Appliances Interaction,Jonathan Fürst; Andreas Fruergaard; Marco Høvinghof Johannesen; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract Buildings are increasingly equipped with smart appliances that allow a fine grainedadaption to personal comfort requirements. Such comfort adaption should be based on ahuman-feedback loop and not on a centralized comfort model. We argue that this feedback-loop should be achieved through local interaction with smart appliances. Two issues standout:(1) How to impose logical locality when interacting with a smart appliance?(2) How tomediate conflicts between several persons in a room; or between building-wide policies anduser preferences? We approach both problems by defining a general model for human-smart appliance interaction. We present a prototype implementation with an off-the-shelfsmart lighting and heating system in a shared office space. Our approach minimizes theneed for location metadata. It relies on a human-feedback loop (both sensor based and …,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Built Environments,2016,*

Annexe D.,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral; Yanli Guo; Lionel Le Folgoc; Shaoyi Yin,Abstract Mass-storage secure portable tokens are emerging and provide a realbreakthrough in the management of sensitive data. They can embed personal data and/ormetadata referencing documents stored encrypted in the Cloud and can manage themunder holder's control. Mass on-board storage requires efficient embedded databasetechniques. These techniques are however very challenging to design due to a combinationof conflicting NAND Flash constraints and scarce RAM constraint; disqualifying known stateof the art solutions. To tackle this challenge; we proposes a log-only based storageorganization and an appropriate indexing scheme; which (1) produce only sequential writescompatible with the Flash constraints and (2) consume a tiny amount of RAM; independentof the database size. We show the effectiveness of this approach through a …,Gestion de données personnelles respectueuse de la vie privée,2014,*
Playing Attack and Defense with Trusted Storage,Javier González; Philippe Bonnet; Luc Luc Bouganim-Luc,Abstract It is often convenient to assume in a data management platform that one or severalcomputing devices are trusted; specially when the goal is to provide privacy guarantees overpersonal data. But what does it take for a computing device to be trusted? More specifically;how can a personal device provide trusted storage? This is the question we tackle in thisdemonstration. We describe how secure devices; equipped with a trusted executionenvironment; differ from general purpose devices. We illustrate with our demonstrationscenario; that it is much more difficult to attack a storage service running on a secure device;than to attack the same service running on a general purpose device.,Itus Skriftserie,2014,*
Tuning Database Design for High Performance.,Philippe Bonnet; Dennis E Shasha,In fields ranging from arbitrage to sensor processing; speed of access to data can determinesuccess or failure. Database tuning is the activity of making a database system run faster.Like optimization activities in other areas of computer science and engineering; databasetuning must work within certain constraints. Just as compiler optimizers; for example; cannotdirectly change the underlying hardware but can change register allocations; databasetuners cannot change the underlying database management system software; but can makeuse of the options it offers. The database administrator in charge of tuning can; for example;modify the design of tables; select new indexes; rearrange transactions; tamper with theoperating system; or buy hardware. The goals are to increase throughput and reduceresponse time. In our personal experience; tuning efforts can have dramatic effects; eg …,*,2014,*
COSMGrid: Configurable; off-the-shelf micro grid,Jonathan Furst; Nik Gawinowski; Sebastian Buttrich; Philippe Bonnet,Access to modern energy services should be universally available by 2030. This is a goal ofthe United Nations. A promising approach to deliver on this commitment is based onmicrogrids that coordinate power generation; storage and usage in a local community.Microgrids constitute an attractive option in the presence of abundant renewable energysources; and in the absence of robust transnational power grid infrastructure. An importantproblem is then to design cheap; resilient and configurable microgrids that can beassembled from off-the-shelf components and managed by non specialists. In this paper; weintroduce COSMGrid; a microgrid platform based on commodity hardware and open source;open protocol software. The design of COSMGrid relies on a network of microcontrollers thatmonitor and control stand-alone power generation and storage nodes.

Towards a Perpetual Sensor Network Testbed without Backchannel,Aslak Johansen; Philippe Bonnet; Thomas Sørensen,Abstract: The sensor network testbeds available today rely on a communication channeldifferent from the mote radio-a backchannel-to facilitate mote reprogramming; healthmonitoring and performance analysis. Such backchannels are either supported as wiredcommunication channels (USB or Ethernet); or via an extra board coupled to the mote undertest and thus introduce significant constraint on the testbed setup and on the mote powerbudget. With Greenlab; we wish to study the performance behavior of outdoor sensornetworks where energy is harvested from the environment. We thus cannot rely on abackchannel. In this paper; we present the design of the central mechanisms needed tosupport Greenlab and their implementation in TinyOS.

Mote-Based Anomaly Detection,MARCUS CHANG; ANDREAS TERZIS; PHILIPPE BONNET,Sensor networks deployed for scientific data acquisition must inspect measurements forfaults and events of interest. Doing so is crucial to ensure the relevance and correctness ofthe collected data. In this work we unify fault and event detection under a general anomalydetection framework. We use machine learning techniques to classify measurements thatresemble a training set as normal and measurements that significantly deviate from that setas anomalies. Furthermore; we aim at an anomaly detection framework that can beimplemented on motes; thereby allowing them to continue collecting scientifically-relevantdata even in the absence of network connectivity. The general consensus thus far has beenthat learning-based techniques are too resource intensive to be implemented on mote-classdevices. In this paper; we challenge this belief.

For example; givensome census microdata containing attributes “Job” and “Town;” one can generate afrequency table displaying the count of respondents doing each job type in each town. If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,*

Application-Level Tuning,Philippe Bonnet; Dennis Shasha,1. Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,*

A distributed CMS based on LAMP,Mads Hvelplund,Abstract This thesis will discuss a compromise between the expensive professional webserver cluster; and the cheap single-server solution based on a shared LAMP(Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP) hosting environment. By using only the nonspecialisedcomponents available in every basic LAMP setup; it is possible to build a system thatprovides some of the benefits otherwise only available to high-end systems at a fraction oftheir cost. To achieve this; the system uses multiple; independently hosted servers; thatcooperate in a distributed network to form a single CMS driven web site. In the event of anerror; the individual nodes can function independently to a large extent. A prototype hasbeen developed to demonstrate the replication and synchronisation mechanisms; and whilethere is still much work to do; initial progress indicates that the project goal is feasible.,*,2006,*

Indeed; database applications willsoon be accessed by large number of clients ranging from Web applications to small-scalepersonal devices and they will in turn access large collections of data sources ranging fromWeb servers to mobile sensor devices. In such applications; a large amount of computingresources lie outside the database server: they should be utilized for performance andsecurity reasons. The objective of the Jaguar project was to define portable query executionplans that could be executed either on the server; or on a client or on a remote data source(a web site; an active disk or a sensor device). Java was chosen as a platform for theexecution of these portable execution plans. New techniques supporting the execution of …,*,2001,*

Oestrus Detection for Group Housed Sows: Lessons from A Sensor Network Based Experiment,Cécile Cornou; Teresia Heiskanen; Anders Ringgaard Kristensen; Klaus Skelbæk Madsen; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract Sensor networks are not yet tools that scientists can use to densely samplephenomena that were previously hard or impossible to observe in-situ. Even small-scalesensor networks need to be carefully designed; programmed and deployed to meetexperimental goals in terms of experiment duration or quality of the collected data. Only byconfronting the problems that do come up during actual deployments can we devise thetools; methods and abstractions that will make sensor networks an appropriate instrumentfor scientists. In this paper we report on the lessons we learnt building an oestrus detectionmodel for group housed sows based on sows' acceleration measurements. We describe thedesign of our experimental sensor network whose goal is to collect time series of sowacceleration data over a menstrual cycle; ie; circa 30 days. We then present two detection …,*,*,*

Session: 20-Enhancing Energy Conservation and Efficiency Poster Presentations,J Polastre; Philippe Bonnet,For the last twenty years; building energy management systems (BEMS) have beendeveloped to monitor and control energy usage in both residential and office buildings.These systems are able to achieve energy savings in the range from 5 to 40%[vorsatz07].Ten years ago; BEMS were a breed of automation control systems based on proprietaryhardware and firmware and on kilometers of wires. Today; BEMS are interfaced with the ITinfrastructure of the organization that manages a building. Tomorrow; with the vision ofBuildings 2.0 [budiardjo07]; the next major energy savings comes from BEMS evolution intoan integral part of the IT infrastructure; ie; a BEMS will be composed of programmablecommodities (sensors; cameras; meters; servers) seamlessly integrated with the existingnetworking infrastructure be it wired or wireless [nowaratzky07]; and the power grid …,*,*,*

Do Linux Asynchronous I/0 Really Matters?,Christoffer Hall; Bjarke Mortensen; Philippe Bonnet; Heikki Tuuri; Peter Zaitsev,Abstract The newly released Linux 2.6 kernel supports asynchronous I/O. This evolutioncorresponds to the wishes of established database vendors. The question is though: Whatkind of impact do asynchronous I/O actually have on database performance? This dependson the performance characteristics of the Linux I/O subsystem; but also on the way thedatabase server utilize it. In the context of the Badger project; a collaboration betweenMySQL AB and University of Copenhagen; we evaluated how MySQL/InnoDB can best takeadvantage of Linux asynchronous I/O. This paper documents our analysis and ourproposals. We present a simple tool that we use to extract the key performancecharacteristics of Linux asynchronous I/O. We show that MySQL/InnoDB does not utilize theirfull potential (neither does Oracle 9.2); and we propose modifications of the InnoDB …,*,*,*
