A conceptual view on trajectories,Stefano Spaccapietra; Christine Parent; Maria Luisa Damiani; Jose Antonio de Macedo; Fabio Porto; Christelle Vangenot,Abstract Analysis of trajectory data is the key to a growing number of applications aiming atglobal understanding and management of complex phenomena that involve moving objects(eg worldwide courier distribution; city traffic management; bird migration monitoring).Current DBMS support for such data is limited to the ability to store and query raw movement(ie the spatio-temporal position of an object). This paper explores how conceptual modelingcould provide applications with direct support of trajectories (ie movement data that isstructured into countable semantic units) as a first class concept. A specific concern is toallow enriching trajectories with semantic annotations allowing users to attach semantic datato specific parts of the trajectory. Building on a preliminary requirement analysis and anapplication example; the paper proposes two modeling approaches; one based on a …,Data & knowledge engineering,2008,552
GEO-RBAC: A spatially aware RBAC,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Paolo Perlasca,Abstract Securing access to data in location-based services and mobile applicationsrequires the definition of spatially aware access-control systems. Even if some approacheshave already been proposed either in the context of geographic database systems orcontext-aware applications; a comprehensive framework; general and flexible enough todeal with spatial aspects in real mobile applications; is still missing. In this paper; we makeone step toward this direction and present GEO-RBAC; an extension of the RBAC modelenhanced with spatial-and location-based information. In GEORBAC; spatial entities areused to model objects; user positions; and geographically bounded roles. Roles areactivated based on the position of the user.

Semantic trajectories modeling and analysis,Christine Parent; Stefano Spaccapietra; Chiara Renso; Gennady Andrienko; Natalia Andrienko; Vania Bogorny; Maria Luisa Damiani; Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Jose Macedo; Nikos Pelekis; Yannis Theodoridis; Zhixian Yan,Abstract Focus on movement data has increased as a consequence of the larger availabilityof such data due to current GPS; GSM; RFID; and sensors techniques. In parallel; interest inmovement has shifted from raw movement data analysis to more application-oriented waysof analyzing segments of movement suitable for the specific purposes of the application.This trend has promoted semantically rich trajectories; rather than raw movement; as thecore object of interest in mobility studies. This survey provides the definitions of the basicconcepts about mobility data; an analysis of the issues in mobility data management; and asurvey of the approaches and techniques for:(i) constructing trajectories from movementtracks;(ii) enriching trajectories with semantic information to enable the desiredinterpretations of movements; and (iii) using data mining to analyze semantic trajectories …,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),2013,284
The PROBE Framework for the Personalized Cloaking of Private Locations.,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Silvestri,Abstract. The widespread adoption of location-based services (LBS) raises increasingconcerns for the protection of personal location information. A common strategy; referred toas obfuscation (or cloaking); to protect location privacy is based on forwarding the LBSprovider a coarse user location instead of the actual user location. Conventionalapproaches; based on such technique; are however based only on geometric methods andtherefore are unable to assure privacy when the adversary is aware of the geographicalcontext; in particular of the semantic locations and the statistical distribution of positions inthe given space. This paper provides a comprehensive solution to this problem. We presenta novel privacy model and an architectural framework for the personalized cloaking ofsemantic locations. In our model; a cloaked location is an uncertainty region which …,Trans. Data Privacy,2010,119
Preventing velocity-based linkage attacks in location-aware applications,Gabriel Ghinita; Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Mobile devices with positioning capabilities allow users to participate in novel andexciting location-based applications. For instance; users may track the whereabouts of theiracquaintances in location-aware social networking applications; eg; GoogleLatitude.Furthermore; users can request information about landmarks in their proximity. Suchscenarios require users to report their coordinates to other parties; which may not be fullytrusted. Reporting precise locations may result in serious privacy violations; such asdisclosure of lifestyle details; sexual orientation; etc. A typical approach to preserve locationprivacy is to generate a cloaking region (CR) that encloses the user position. However; iflocations are continuously reported; an attacker can correlate CRs from multiple timestampsto accurately pinpoint the user position within a CR. In this work; we protect against …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,101
Fine-grained cloaking of sensitive positions in location-sharing applications,Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri; Elisa Bertino,Geosocial networking applications magnify the concern for location privacy because a user'sposition can be disclosed to diverse untrusted parties.

Spatial data warehouse modelling,Maria Luisa Damiani; Stefano Spaccapietra,Abstract This chapter is concerned with multidimensional data models for spatial datawarehouses. Over the last few years different approaches have been proposed in theliterature for modelling multidimensional data with geometric extent. Nevertheless; thedefinition of a comprehensive and formal data model is still a major research issue. Themain contributions of the chapter are twofold: First; it draws a picture of the research area;second it introduces a novel spatial multidimensional data model for spatial objects withgeometry (MuSD–multigranular spatial data warehouse). MuSD complies with currentstandards for spatial data modelling; augmented by data warehousing concepts such asspatial fact; spatial dimension and spatial measure.

An authorization model for geographical maps,Alberto Belussi; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Maria Luisa Damiani; Andrea Nucita,Abstract Access control is an important component of any database management system.Several access control models have been proposed for conventional databases. However;these models do not seem adequate for geographical databases; due to the peculiarities ofgeographical data. Previous work on access control models for geographical data mainlyconcerns raster maps (images). In this paper; we present a discretionary access controlmodel for geographical maps. We assume that each map is composed of a set of features.Each feature is represented in one or more maps by spatial objects; described by means ofdifferent spatial properties: geometric properties; describing the shape; extension andlocation of the objects; and topological properties; describing the topological relationshipsexisting among objects. The proposed access control model allows the security …,Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM international workshop on Geographic information systems,2004,44
Privacy-preserving sharing of sensitive semantic locations under road-network constraints,Emre Yigitoglu; Maria Luisa Damiani; Osman Abul; Claudio Silvestri,This paper presents a privacy-preserving framework for the protection of sensitive positionsin real time trajectories. We assume a scenario in which the sensitivity of user's positions isspace-varying; and so depends on the spatial context; while the user's movement isconfined to road networks and places. Typical users are the non-anonymous members of ageo-social network who agree to share their exact position whenever such position does notfall within a sensitive place; eg a hospital. Suspending location sharing while the user isinside a sensitive place is not an appropriate solution because the user's stopovers can beeasily inferred from the user's trace. In this paper we present an extension of the semanticlocation cloaking model [1] originally developed for the cloaking of non-correlated positionsin an unconstrained space. We investigate different algorithms for the generation of …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,41

An access control system for a web map management service,Elisa Bertino; Maria Luisa Damiani; Davide Momini,In this paper; we present an access control model for spatial data on Web. Such a model isbased on the following assumptions: first; spatial data consist of objects with sharpboundaries located in a geographical space; second; data are manipulated through theoperations provided by a Web map management service. The goal of the system is to controlthe way data are accessed by users having different profiles. We propose an extension ofclassical models based on authorization rules by assigning authorizations a geographicalscope. In such a way; the operations users may execute on spatial data may vary;depending on user identity and object position.,Research Issues on Data Engineering: Web Services for e-Commerce and e-Government Applications; 2004.

Prox-RBAC: a proximity-based spatially aware RBAC,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino,Abstract As mobile computing devices are becoming increasingly dominant in enterpriseand government organizations; the need for fine-grained access control in theseenvironments continues to grow. Specifically; advanced forms of access control can bedeployed to ensure authorized users can access sensitive resources only when in trustedlocations. One technique that has been proposed is to augment role-based access control(RBAC) with spatial constraints. In such a system; an authorized user must be in adesignated location in order to exercise the privileges associated with a role. In this work; weextend spatially aware RBAC systems by defining the notion of proximity-based RBAC. Inour approach; access control decisions are not based solely on the requesting user'slocation. Instead; we also consider the location of other users in the system.

A lava flow simulation model for the development of volcanic hazard maps for Mount Etna (Italy),Maria Luisa Damiani; Gianluca Groppelli; Gianluca Norini; Elisa Bertino; A Gigliuto; Andrea Nucita,Abstract Volcanic hazard assessment is of paramount importance for the safeguard of theresources exposed to volcanic hazards. In the paper we present ELFM; a lava flowsimulation model for the evaluation of the lava flow hazard on Mount Etna (Sicily; Italy); themost important active volcano in Europe. The major contributions of the paper are:(a) adetailed specification of the lava flow simulation model and the specification of an algorithmimplementing it;(b) the definition of a methodological framework for applying the model tothe specific volcano. For what concerns the former issue; we propose an extended version ofan existing stochastic model that has been applied so far only to the assessment of thevolcanic hazard on Lanzarote and Tenerife (Canary Islands).

Symbolic trajectories,Ralf Hartmut Güting; Fabio Valdés; Maria Luisa Damiani,Abstract Due to the proliferation of GPS-enabled devices in vehicles or with people; largeamounts of position data are recorded every day and the management of such mobility data;also called trajectories; is a very active research field. A lot of effort has gone intodiscovering “semantics” from the raw geometric trajectories by relating them to the spatialenvironment or finding patterns; for example; by data mining techniques. A question is howthe resulting “meaningful” trajectories can be represented or further queried. In this article;we propose a systematic study of annotated trajectory databases. We define a very simplegeneric model called symbolic trajectory to capture a wide range of meanings derived from ageometric trajectory. Essentially; a symbolic trajectory is just a time-dependent label;variants have sets of labels; places; or sets of places. They are modeled as abstract data …,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,2015,26
Location privacy models in mobile applications: conceptual view and research directions,Maria Luisa Damiani,Abstract Location privacy in mobile; location-aware applications is a prominent researchtopic spanning across different disciplines and with strong societal implications andexpectations. The tumultuous growth of the mobile applications market over the past fewyears has however hindered the development of a systematic organization and classificationof location privacy concepts. In this paper we focus on one of the key concepts; ie locationprivacy metric. We survey existing approaches to the measurement of location privacy andpropose a classification framework. The notion of location privacy metric; however; cannotbe fully understood without describing the context in which these metrics are used. To thatextent we elaborate on the notions of application model and privacy model. The ultimategoal is to contribute to the specification of a conceptual framework for location privacy.,Geoinformatica,2014,26
Towards movement-aware access control,Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri,Abstract The objective of spatially-aware access control models is to regulate the access toprotected objects based on position information. In that last years; increasing attention hasbeen paid to spatially-aware access control models for mobile and pervasive applications.Following the experience of design of the GEO-RBAC model; in this paper we want to look atthose models with a critical eye and point out open conceptual and architectural challenges.In this paper; we first discuss architectural issues related to the development of a multi-domain access control system based on GEO-RBAC. Then we present the guidelines of anovel and space-centric modeling framework which aims at overcoming the conceptuallimitations of the present model and similar solutions.,Proceedings of the SIGSPATIAL ACM GIS 2008 International Workshop on Security and Privacy in GIS and LBS,2008,26

Data security in location-aware applications: an approach based on RBAC,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Paolo Perlasca,Data security in a mobile context is a critical issue. Over the last few years a new category oflocation-based services; the Enterprise LBS (ELBS); has emerged focusing on the demandsof mobility in organisations. These applications pose challenging requirements; includingthe need of selective access to ELBS based on the position of mobile users and spatiallybounded organisational roles. To deal with these requirements a novel access controlsystem; named GEO-RBAC; has been developed. GEO-RBAC extends the NIST RBAC(Role-Based Access Control) standard with the notions of spatial role; role-dependentposition; role schema and role instance. Further; roles become enabled/disabled based onthe position of the user. In the paper we present GEO-RBAC; a full-fledged RBAC-basedmodel; consisting; like RBAC; of three distinct components: the Core GEO-RBAC; the …,International Journal of Information and Computer Security,2007,25
Protecting location privacy through semantics-aware obfuscation techniques,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Silvestri,The widespread adoption of location-based services (LBS) raises increasing concerns forthe protection of personal location information. To protect location privacy the usual strategyis to obfuscate the actual position of the user with a coarse location and then forward theobfuscated location to the LBS provider. Existing techniques for location obfuscation areonly based on geometric methods. We state that such techniques do not protect againstprivacy attacks rooted in the knowledge of the spatial context. We thus present a novelframework for the safeguard of sensitive locations comprehensive of a privacy model and analgorithm for the computation of obfuscated locations,IFIP International Conference on Trust Management,2008,24

Policy mapper: Administering location-based access-control policies,Rafae Bhatti; Maria Luisa Damiani; David W Bettis; Elisa Bertino,Simplifying the administration of location-based access-control policies requires amechanism that supports both intuitive and scalable spatial constraint specifications and aflexible enforcement architecture. Policy mapper is an administrative tool that helps defineaccess control at conceptual and logical levels to carry out constraint specification andenforcement. The tool also provides an interface definition language that couples the twolevels.

This directive states; among others; that “the provider of a publicly availableelectronic communication service must take appropriate technical and organizationalmeasures to safeguard the security of its services having regard to the state of the art;” andalso that “when location data relating to users can be processed; such data can only beprocessed when they are made anonymous or with the consent of the user.”,*,2008,18
Privacy enhancing techniques for the protection of mobility patterns in LBS: research issues and trends,Maria Luisa Damiani,Abstract LBS have become an integral part of users' experiences; delivering users targeted;relevant and highly convenient information. However; the significant advantages associatedwith LBS come at a price to users' privacy. While the location of a mobile device at any givenmoment may not be particularly sensitive; the historical trail of past locations; ie the users'trajectories; can reveal much about a user's behavior. Over the past few years there hasbeen a flourishing of research initiatives specifically addressing the development oftechniques for the safeguard of the position information in LBS (Position PETs). In this paperwe analyze pros and cons of major research streams. We also discuss some emergingtrends in LBS which are valuable for their implications on privacy and future research in thefield.

Approach to supporting continuity of usage in location-based access control,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Silvestri,In location-based access control systems; the location of subjects is a relevant parameter inaccess control decisions. Those systems however fail in controlling the location ofsubjectsalong the period of use of the objects and this can lead to security breaches. To ensure astronger protection of objects; a continuous control over the movement of subjectsis thusneeded. To address this requirement; we have developed GEO-RBAC_C a location-basedaccess control model supporting continuous usage control capabilities. In the paper; we firstpresent the basic concepts of the model and then discuss how the continuous control can beactually enforced.,Future Trends of Distributed Computing Systems; 2008.

A controlled access to spatial data on web,Elisa Bertino; M Damiani,SUMMARY The proliferation of Geographical Information services on the Web is creatingunprecedented opportunities for the shared use of geographical information and at the sametime an increasing need of controlled access to spatial data. In the paper we present anapproach to the definition of an access control system for spatial data on the Web. The goalis to provide a mechanism for controlling what spatial data can be accessed by whom; fordoing what and where. For that purpose; we propose an access control model based on aspatially extended notion of authorization rule. An architectural framework for enclosing sucha model into a Geographical Information service has been developed and applied to a casestudy.,Conference on Geographic Information Science (AGILE),2004,15
Spatial domains for the administration of location-based access control policies,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Silvestri,Abstract In the last few years there has been an increasing interest for a novel category ofaccess control models known as location-based or spatially-aware role-based accesscontrol (RBAC) models. Those models advance classical RBAC models in that they regulatethe access to sensitive resources based on the position of mobile users. An issue that hasnot yet been investigated is how to administer spatially-aware access control policies. In thispaper we introduce GEO-RBAC Admin; the administration model for the location-based GEO-RBAC model. We discuss the concepts underlying such administrative model and present alanguage for the specification of GEO-RBAC policies.,Journal of Network and Systems Management,2008,12

Extracting stay regions with uncertain boundaries from GPS trajectories: a case study in animal ecology,Maria Luisa Damiani; Hamza Issa; Francesca Cagnacci,Abstract In this paper we present a time-aware; density-based clustering technique for theidentification of stay regions in trajectories of low-sampling-rate GPS points; and itsapplication to the study of animal migrations. A stay region is defined as a portion of spacewhich generally does not designate a precise geographical entity and where an object issignificantly present for a period of time; in spite of relatively short periods of absence. Stayregions can delimit for example the residence of animals; ie the home-range. The proposedtechnique enables the extraction of stay regions represented by dense and temporallydisjoint sub-trajectories; through the specification of a small set of parameters related todensity and presence. While this work takes inspiration from the field of animal ecology; weargue that the approach can be of more general concern and used in perspective in …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,11
Introducing ‘presence’and ‘stationarity index’to study partial migration patterns: an application of a spatio-temporal clustering technique,Maria Luisa Damiani; Hamza Issa; Giuseppe Fotino; Marco Heurich; Francesca Cagnacci,Partial migration is a crucial mobility pattern in animal ecology. Unlike complete migrationsthat take place when all the individuals in a population migrate with a clear separation ofranges; partial migrations are migrations that often follow modalities and times that vary fromanimal to animal. As a result the distinction between migratory and nonmigratory behaviorbecomes less defined. In this paper; we present an interdisciplinary effort geared to evaluatewhether a recent time-aware; density-based clustering technique; called SeqScan; relyingon the novel concept of object's presence can be effectively applied to the study of partialmigrations. To that end; we propose an extended framework centered on SeqScan;comprising a noise model for the detection of fine-grained movement patterns; ie excursionsand inter-cluster transitions; and an internal time-aware validity index; for clustering …,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2016,10
Privacy challenges in third-party location services,Maria Luisa Damiani; Colette Cuijpers,The concern for location privacy in mobile applications is commonly motivated by a scenarioin which a mobile device communicates personal location data; ie the device holderlocation; to a third party eg LBS provider; in exchange for some information service. Weargue that this scenario offers a partial view of the actual risks for privacy; because in realitythe information How can be more complex. For example; more and more often location iscomputed by a third party; the location provider; eg Google Location Service. Locationproviders are in the position of collecting huge amounts of location data from the users ofdiverse applications (eg Facebook and Foursquare to cite a few). This raises novel privacyconcerns. In this paper; we discuss two issues related to the protection from locationproviders. The first focuses on the compliance of emerging location services standards …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,10
Third party geolocation services in LBS: privacy requirements and research issues.,Maria Luisa Damiani,Abstract. The advances in positioning technologies and the emergence of geolocationstandards opens up to the development of innovative location-based services (LBS); eg;web-based LBS. These services challenge existing privacy protection solutions. Forexample; the position information is provided by a third party; the location provider; and thisparty may be not fully trusted. In this paper; we analyze the web-based LBS model. Then weoutline the privacy-aware geolocation strategy which minimizes the interaction with theuntrusted location provider by caching the information that is useful to determine the positionin proximity of the private positions; eg; home; which have been already visited.

Handling user-defined private contexts for location privacy in LBS,Maria Luisa Damiani; Marco Galbiati,Abstract We present a privacy-preserving framework for the protection of location frompotentially untrustworthy location providers (LP); offering geolocation services to LBSsubscribers; across indoor and outdoor settings. This framework; called Placeprint; is builton the metaphor of private place [1]. A private place is a user-defined spatial context whichbelongs to the personal sphere of an individual; eg home. In Placeprint; users equipped withcommodity devices; can be geolocated in private places without revealing to the LP theirpresence. Moreover users can specify context-based privacy rules to forestall the disclosureof private places also to LBS providers. The ultimate goal is to provide users with thecapability of exercising flexible control over the disclosure of the position to both LP and LBSprovider.,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,9

Unlike geometric trajectories; symbolic trajectoriescapture the thematic dimension of movement. In this demonstration; we illustrate a practicalapproach to the querying of hybrid trajectories; combining the symbolic and geometricdimension in a multidimensional trajectory. The system runs on the Secondo moving objectdatabase. The multi-dimensional trajectories are obtained from the GeoLife dataset.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,6
Semantic trajectories and beyond,M Damiani; R Guting,Mobility data generally takes the form of geometric trajectories; reporting the history of theobjects' locations. Abstractly; geometric trajectories are time-varying functions ranging overspace; or; put differently; geometries whose position and possibly shape; changes in time.This view is at the heart of the moving object data model developed in early 2000 [1]; andimplemented in major moving object databases such as Secondo and Hermes [2]. Inmodern applications; however; there is increasing evidence that describing the movementexclusively in geometric terms is no longer sufficient. For example; an important feature ofthe movement is the context in which such a movement takes place; such as the weatherconditions during the travel; the places of interests being visited; the people in proximity andso forth. Moreover the movement can be described at different levels of abstraction …,IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2014,6
Semantics-aware obfuscation for location privacy,Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The increasing availability of personal location data pushed by the widespread useof location-sensing technologies raises concerns with respect to the safeguard of locationprivacy. To address such concerns location privacy-preserving techniques are beinginvestigated. An important area of application for such techniques is represented byLocation Based Services (LBS). Many privacy-preserving techniques designed for LBS arebased on the idea of forwarding to the LBS provider obfuscated locations; namely positioninformation at low spatial resolution; in place of actual userspositions. Obfuscationtechniques are generally based on the use of geometric methods. In this paper; we arguethat such methods can lead to the disclosure of sensitive location information and thus toprivacy leaks. We thus propose a novel method which takes into account the semantic …,Journal of Computing Science and Engineering,2008,6

Efficient access to temporally overlaying spatial and textual trajectories,Hamza Issa; Maria Luisa Damiani,In this paper we deal with the problem of querying heterogeneous trajectory data consistingof spatial and textual trajectories defined over continuous temporal domains. In contrast withspatial trajectories; which describe the continuous movement in space of an individual; thetextual trajectories of concern in this work describe the individual's step-wise changingbehavior; such as the transportation means used and the activities performed in a timeperiod. Accessing large datasets of temporally aligned spatial and textual trajectories canprovide valuable information on where certain behaviors take place.

Symbolic trajectories and application challenges,Maria Luisa Damiani; Hamza Issa; Ralf Hartmut Güting; Fabio Valdes,Abstract Describing the location history of moving objects exclusively in geometric terms isno longer sufficient; whereas more expressive data models capturing the complexity andheterogeneity of movement data are needed. Following this trend; the data model ofsymbolic trajectories has been recently proposed for the representation of content-richtrajectories in databases. The model provides a simple notation and a powerful and fullyoperational pattern-based query language for trajectory matching and rewriting. In thispaper; we overview the key features of the model and sketch two applications cases; theformer regarding the integration of heterogeneous mobility data (GPS and transportationmodes); the latter the representation of migration patterns in animal ecology. The goal is toshow the flexibility of the model and; at the same time; to prospect possible directions of …,SIGSPATIAL Special,2015,4
Trajectory collection and reconstruction,Gerasimos Marketos; M Damiani; Nikos Pelekis; Yannis Theodoridis; Zhixian Yan,The research area of trajectory databases has addressed the need for representingmovements of objects (ie; trajectories) in databases in order to perform ad-hoc querying andanalysis on them. During the last decade; there has been a lot of research ranging from datamodels and query languages to implementation aspects; such as efficient indexing; queryprocessing and optimization techniques. This chapter covers aspects related to datacollection and handling so as to feed trajectory databases with appropriate data. We willalso focus on the step trajectory reconstruction of the Geographic Privacy-aware KDDprocess (illustrated in Figure 2.1) emerged from the GeoPKDD project which proposed somesolid theoretical foundations at an appropriate level of abstraction to deal with traces andtrajectories of moving objects aiming at serving real world applications.

Privacy-aware geolocation interfaces for volunteered geography: a case study,Maria Luisa Damiani; Colette Cuijpers,Abstract The standard W3C Geolocation API can significantly facilitate geospatial datacollection as it provides a simple set of operations for requesting geolocation servicesacross indoor and outdoor spaces through the Web. Importantly; this API is privacy-aware inthat it provides a basic privacy mechanism for requesting the user's consent to locationacquisition. In this paper we address the question on whether this privacy mechanism issufficient to conduct a project for the collection of geospatial content; in compliance withprivacy laws. The question is of practical relevance as the use of geolocation standards inline with privacy regulations would make the development of volunteered geographyprojects easier. In this paper we present an interdisciplinary analysis spanning acrosstechnology and law; and driven by an application case. We show the limitations of this …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Crowdsourced and Volunteered Geographic Information,2012,3
Privacy issues in location-aware browsing,Maria Luisa Damiani; Pierluigi Perri,Abstract Advances in positioning services and their pervasiveness; eg; wi-fi based locationservices; pave the way to the development of innovative LBSs and architectures. In thispaper we focus on location-aware browsing; a framework which enables websites to acquirethe position of website users. In particular we discuss privacy issues related to the recentW3C proposal for a geolocation API standard. Such specification prescribes that users mustgive explicit consent to the disclosure of position information to websites. In this paper weargue that stronger and more flexible protection is needed: a) users should be provided withthe capability of disclosing coarse regions in place of point coordinates in order to limit thedisclosure of personal location data; b) location information should be protected not onlyagainst websites but also against location service providers. We discuss a possible …,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Security and Privacy in GIS and LBS,2010,3

Spatial trajectories segmentation: trends and challenges,Maria Luisa Damiani,Abstract Given a sequence S of temporally ordered observations; non necessarily of spatialnature; the segmentation task partitions S in a set of disjoint sub-sequences si;..; s n-thesegments-such that∪ i∈[1; n] si= S. Typically; segments represents sub-sequences that aresomehow homogeneous with respect to some criteria. Depending on the context and thenature of observations; segments can be given an approximated representation; for examplesegments can be assigned a descriptive label or one of the data points is chosen asrepresentative of the whole sub-sequence. The final result is a summarized representationof the sequence. This simple and intuitive mechanism has been extensively studied inliterature; for example; for the summarization of time series. Interestingly; the notion ofsegment is also at the basis of the most recent trajectory data models.

MigrO: a plug-in for the analysis of individual mobility behavior based on the stay region model,Maria Luisa Damiani; Hamza Issa; Giuseppe Fotino; Fatima Hachem; Nathan Ranc; Francesca Cagnacci,Abstract We present MigrO; a clustering environment for the extraction of individual mobilitypatterns from GPS trajectories; relying on the notion of stay region [1]. A stay region isan'attractive'area where the moving object resides for a period; possibly experiencingarbitrarily long periods of absence; before moving to a more attractive stay region. The corecomponent is the SeqScan algorithm for the extraction of temporally ordered sequences ofstay regions grounded on the notion of presence. An additional set of functionalities supporttrajectory pre-processing and clustering evaluation. MigrO is developed as plug-in for theopen-source QuantumGIS system thus can exploit the rich set of functionalities of the hostingsystem; offering a formidable platform for the analysis of the mobility behavior. In thisdemonstration; we present MigrO at work in two case studies; both from the domain of …,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,2
Third party positioning services: novel challenges for location privacy in LBS,M Damiani; Pierluigi Perri; C Yildizli,Abstract. A common assumption in the research community working on location privacy inlocationbased services (LBS) is that the location sources are trusted. In this paper wepresent a different perspective. We argue that; because of the deployment of wifi-based/hybrid positioning techniques and web-based LBSs; the user's location isincreasingly computed by third-party location providers which may be not fully trusted. Thischange of perspective challenges the effectiveness of current location privacy-preservingtechniques. To support this thesis we present an empirical investigation of the privacy issuesraised by web-based LBSs. Moreover; following a holistic approach; we present the problemfrom three different and complementary angles; ie; technical; user-based; and legal. Theoverall picture suggests a novel direction of research.,*,2011,2
Analyzing semantic locations cloaking techniques in a probabilistic grid-based map,Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The protection of semantic positions; for instance that an individual is inside ahospital; is a challenging privacy issue. For example; it can be shown that popular protectionmechanisms; like location cloaking; can be easily defeated when certain mobility patternsare known; eg; certain places are more or less popular than other places. To prevent thiskind of attack; novel semantic location cloaking heuristics are being investigated. Thesemethods are built on the knowledge of population distribution and sensitive locations. In thisdemonstration; we present SAWL (Semantics-aware Location cloaking); a tool supportingthe comparison of semantic location cloaking methods over real and synthetic spatialscenarios.,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,2

Segmentation techniques for the summarization of individual mobility data,Maria Luisa Damiani; Fatima Hachem,Abstract Segmentation techniques partition a sequence of data points into a series of disjointsubsequences—segments—based on some criteria. Depending on the context and thenature of data themselves; segments return an approximate representation. The final resultis a summarized representation of the sequence. This intuitive mechanism has beenextensively studied; for example; for the summarization of time series in order to preservethe 'shape'of the sequence while omitting irrelevant details. This survey focuses on the useof segmentation methods for extracting behavioral information from individual mobility data;in particular from spatial trajectories. Such information can then be given a compactrepresentation in the form of summarized trajectories; eg; semantic trajectories and symbolictrajectories.

Introduction to this special issue: semantic and symbolic trajectories,Maria Luisa Damiani; Chiara Renso,Abstract Nowadays; the digital traces of moving objects; such as people; animals; goods;increasingly contain richer information than the mere location history. Traces can report; forexample; the places visited by tourists during a touristic journey (eg; hotels; entertainmentspots); the activities performed during such a journey (eg; shopping; driving); the peopleencountered during the trip. This supplementary information is often referred to as semanticannotation (of trajectories). Semantic annotations can be directly acquired from sensors or;alternatively; be the result of some analytic process or be directly provided by users. Inrecent times; following a few pioneering research projects; especially in Europe and Asia;the processing of large amounts of semantics-enriched trajectories has become an exciting;cross-disciplinary research area; spanning spatial computing; data analytics and …,SIGSPATIAL Special,2015,1
Sawlnet: Sensitivity aware location cloaking on road-networks,Claudio Silvestri; Emre Yigitoglu; Maria Luisa Damiani; Osman Abul,Location based queries are increasingly common in mobile applications; and the associatedprivacy issues have become a hot research topic in the last years. Most of the currentapproaches; however; do not account for the location of potentially sensitive places and forconstraints on the movement of users; such as speed limits or network contraints. In thisdemo we present different deployment scenarios of a privacy-preserving framework for theprotection of sensitive positions in real time trajectories. We assume that the sensitivity ofusers' positions depends on the spatial context; while the users' movement is confined toroad networks and places. Further; the users are non-anonymous; as in the case of geo-social network members who agree to share their exact position whenever it does not fallwithin a sensitive place; eg a hospital. We will show that our proposal is suitable for …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,1

Geospatial data has many application areas including traffic management;homeland security; geo-marketing; and environmental crises management which motivatethe research in this area. However; growing geospatial information is yet to be matched bythe advances in secure geospatial information systems (GIS) and LBS. On the other hand;location information is very sensitive and also a strong quasi-identifier; which can becombined with other rich information sources to cause serious privacy leaks. Thereforeensuring security and privacy in GIS and LBS is of utmost importance which needs to be …,*,2010,1

Modelling Lava Flow to Assess Hazard on Mount Etna (Italy). From Geological Data to a Preliminary Hazard Map,E Bertino; ML Damiani; G Groppelli; G Norini; B Aldighieri; S Borgonovo; F Comoglio; G Pasquaré,Abstract In this paper we present a systematic approach to the development of the lava flowhazard map forthe Mount Etna; the most important active volcano in Europe. The basic ideais to determine the hazard zonesby simulating the lava flows originated from a number ofsample points localized in regions at high densityof vents; called eruption zones. The keychoice is the adoption of a probabilistic model for the simulation ofthe lava flow. In the paperwe outline the characteristics of the model; called ELFM; and how it has beenvalidated. Onthe other side; for the determination of the eruption zones; which likely contain the pointsoffuture lava flows emissions; we propose an approach based on data mining techniques.,*,2006,1
A modular framework for administering spatial constraints in context-aware rbac,Rafae Bhatti; Maria Damiani; David W Bettis; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Many context-aware access control models with support for spatial and location-basedcapabilities (or constraints) have recently been proposed [6; 8; 9]. Models with location-based access control are becoming increasingly necessary in pervasive computingapplications; and are adequately receiving considerable popularity in the research andindustrial community alike. However; the design of context-aware access control modelswith spatial constraints is still far from satisfactory in a very important respect; vis-à-visflexibility of policy administration. Many of the existing models have dealt with issues relatedto the introduction of spatial constraints in access control models without; however; takinginto account requirements for modularity of constraint specification and flexibility of policyadministration. In our opinion; flexible policy administration demands a clear separation …,*,2006,1
Discovering gatherings based on individual mobility patterns: challenges and direction,Fatima Hachem; Maria Luisa Damiani; Hamza Issa,Given a database of spatial trajectories reporting the movement of a set of objects in a timeframe; the problem is to discover the groups of objects that stay in close proximity within ageographical area for a significant time. To deal with the problem; techniques for thediscovery of collective patterns; eg the meeting pattern; have been proposed. Suchtechniques; however; impose stringent constraints on the object movement. In this paper weinvestigate a generalized; flexible approach that builds on the idea of expressing thecollective pattern as sum of individual behaviors. We present a technique called k-Gatheringfor the discovery of gatherings of at least k objects; which leverages a recent method for thediscovery of stop-and-move patterns. The experiments; conducted on both synthetic and realdata; show that the direction is promising and that the approach can be effective also on …,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2017 IEEE International Conference on,2017,*

Protecting Against Velocity-Based; Proximity-Based; and External Event Attacks in Location-Centric Social Networks,Gabriel Ghinita; Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Mobile devices with positioning capabilities allow users to participate in novel andexciting location-based applications. For instance; users may track the whereabouts of theiracquaintances in location-aware social networking applications (eg; Foursquare).Furthermore; users can request information about landmarks in their proximity. Suchscenarios require users to report their coordinates to other parties; which may not be fullytrusted. Reporting precise locations may result in serious privacy violations; such asdisclosure of lifestyle details; sexual orientation; and so forth. A typical approach to preservelocation privacy is to generate a cloaking region (CR) that encloses the user position.However; if locations are continuously reported; an attacker can correlate CRs from multipletimestamps to accurately pinpoint the user position within a CR.

Mathematical programming algorithms for spatial cloaking.,Alberto Ceselli; Maria Luisa Damiani; Giovanni Righini; Diego Valorsi,Abstract We consider a combinatorial optimization problem for spatial information cloaking.The problem requires to compute one or several disjoint arborescences on a graph from apredetermined root or subset of candidate roots; so that the number of vertices in thearborescences is minimized but a given threshold on the overall weight associated with thevertices in each arborescence is reached. For a single arborescence case; we solve theproblem to optimality by designing a branch-and-cut exact algorithm. Then we use the samealgorithm for the purpose of pricing out columns in an exact branch-and-price algorithm forthe multi-arborescence version. We also propose a branch-and-price-based heuristicalgorithm; where branching and pricing respectively act as diversification and intensificationmechanisms. The heuristic consistently finds optimal or near-optimal solutions within a …,CTW,2015,*
Guest editorial: location-centric privacy in mobile services,Maria Luisa Damiani; Gabriel Ghinita,Individual location of users is an enabling factor in a variety of mobile applications; such aslocation-based services (LBS) and participatory sensing.

Message from the PriSMO workshop organizers,M Damiani; Bradley Malin; Anna Monreale; Yucel Saygin; Manolis Terrovitis,Movement data constitutes valuable information. Data about user and object movement is avery rich source of information with social; economic and environmental value; and it isnowadays available in such a scale; that it is considered a characteristic case of big data.The information richness that makes movement data so valuable often poses a threat to theprivacy and security of users and companies; who are behind the digital location andtrajectory data. Movement data can reveal the exact location of a user in real time to thirdparties; which is a violation of user privacy by per se. But it is not only the user location that isrevealed by location traces; studying the movement patterns of a user can reveal sensitiveinformation as the location of her home; where she works; religious preferences and evenindicate health problems.

Access control and privacy in location-aware applications,Maria Luisa Damiani,Abstract The topic addressed in this thesis concerns the relationship between spatialknowledge and information protection in a mobile setting. The proliferation of mobile devicesin an increasingly connected world raises growing concern for information security andprivacy. For example; sensitive data recorded in corporate and networked informationsystems can be accessed from uncontrolled locations; downloaded on mobile terminals anddisclosed to unauthorized third parties. The protection of information against improper useand modification in a mobile context poses research questions which solicit the investigationof unconventional protection strategies. In such a perspective; this thesis investigates how toprovide strong control over information access based on knowledge of location andmovement of individuals. Indeed; the use of spatial information for secure access support …,*,2008,*

Lava Flow Invasion Hazard map of the Southern Rift (Mount Etna; Italy),G Groppelli; G Norini; B Aldighieri; E Bertino; F Comoglio; ML Damiani; C Silvestri,Abstract We present an integrated approach and a multidisciplinary methodology to compilevolcanic hazard map for lava flow invasion. In addition we display an application of theproposed methodology to a sector of Mount Etna; the Southern Rift; one of the most activeareas of the Volcano (Behncke & Neri; 2003). The basis and the starting point are a detailedgeological and structural survey and a high-resolution stratigraphy (at 1: 10;000 scale) thatallow us to recognize and to map about 30 lava flows along the Southern Rift. Thegeological data (lava flow emission point location; relative or historical age; length andoutcropping area) are organized in a geographic database. In addition GIS softwareanalyses (Groppelli & Norini; 2005); statistical tests and probabilistic lava flow model(Damiani et al.; 2006) are applied. Our methodology rests on five steps. 1) Detailed …,AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts,2007,*

A Modular Framework for Administering Spatial Constraints in Context-Aware RBAC,B Rafae; Maria Luisa Damiani; David W Bettis; B Elisa; G Arif,Many context-aware access control models with support for spatial and location-basedcapabilities (or constraints) have recently been proposed [6; 8; 9]. Models with location-based access control are becoming increasingly necessary in pervasive computingapplications; and are adequately receiving considerable popularity in the research andindustrial community alike. However; the design of context-aware access control modelswith spatial constraints is still far from satisfactory in a very important respect; vis-à-visflexibility of policy administration. Many of the existing models have dealt with issues relatedto the introduction of spatial constraints in access control models without; however; takinginto account requirements for modularity of constraint specification and flexibility of policyadministration. In our opinion; flexible policy administration demands a clear separation …,*,2006,*
A Geographical Information System for Volcanic Hazard Modelling,ML Damiani; G Groppelli; G Norini; E Bertino,Hazard maps are fundamental for the development of land and resource managementplans. In this paper we focus on volcanic hazards. In particular we discuss a possibleapproach to the construction of the lava flow hazard map for the Mount Etna; which is themost active volcano in Europe. The core of our proposal is a lava flow simulation system. Wepresent the main characteristics of the underlying simulation model and how it has beenvalidated. Next we introduce a novel and still in progress approach to the clustering of lavaflow emission points based on data mining techniques.,Urban Data Management Symposium,2006,*

GEO-RBAC: A Spatially Aware RBAC,Elisa Berţino; Barbara Catania; Maria LUiSa Damiani; Paolo PerlaSCa,Securing access to data in location-based services and mobile applications requires thedefinition of spatially awaro access control systems. Even if somo approachos have alrcadyboon proposccl cithor in the context of geographic database systems or context-awareapplications; a comprehensive framework; general and flexible enough to cope with spatialaspects in real mobile applications; is still missing. In this paper; we make one step towardsthis direction and we present GEO-RBAC; an extension of the IRBAC model to deal withspatial and location-based information. In GEORBAC; spatial entities are used to modelobjects; user positions; and geographically bounded roles. Holes are activated based on theposition of the user.

4.3 Working Group: Context-dependent Privacy in Mobile Systems,Florian Schaub; Maria Luisa Damiani; Bradley Malin,Mobile systems; and smartphones especially; are becoming ever more present in oursociety. A smartphone can gather a significant quantity information about its owner'smovements and behavior. Such mobility data can be communicated and shared with a widerange of parties (eg; mobile applications; location-based services; mobile operators; mobilephone vendors and providers of mobile application platforms). The accumulation of mobilitydata enables the mining of mobility patterns; with the goals of patterns at the level of anindividual and general trends. At the same time; there are concerns that the collection;storage; and processing of such data may violate the privacy of the individuals to whom thedata corresponds. Traditionally; privacy of such personal information has been achievedthrough definitional and methodological approaches. From a definitional perspective …,Mobility Data Mining and Privacy,*,*
