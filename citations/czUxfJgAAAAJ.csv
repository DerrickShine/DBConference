Children's geographies: Playing; living; learning,Sarah L Holloway; Gill Valentine,*,*,2000,1175
Children’s geographies and the new social studies of childhood,Sarah L Holloway; Gill Valentine,Children's Geographies presents an overview of a rapidly expanding area of research.Drawing on original research in Europe; North and South America; Africa and Asia; thisvolume provides an analysis of children's experiences of playing; living and learning. Thecase studies are diverse; ranging from an historical analysis of gender relations innineteenth-century North American playgrounds; through children's experiences of after-school care in contemporary Britain; to street cultures amongst homeless children inIndonesia at the end of the twentieth century. Threaded through this empirical diversity is acommon engagement with current debates about the nature of childhood.

Cyberkids: Children in the information age,Sarah L Holloway; Gill Valentine,As Tony Blair has said;" Technology has revolutionised the way we work and is now set totransform education. Children cannot be effective in tomorrow's world if they are trained inyesterday's skills." Cyberkids draws together research in the sociology of childhood andsocial studies of technology to explore children's experiences in the Information Age. Thebook addresses key policy debates about social inclusion and exclusion; children'sidentities and friendships in on-line and off-line worlds and their relationships with familiesand teachers. It counters contemporary moral panics about children's risk from dangerousstrangers on-line; about corruption and lost innocence from adult-centred material on theweb and about the addiction to life on the screen.

Spatiality and the new social studies of childhood,Sarah L Holloway; Gill Valentine,Abstract The past two decades have seen rapid changes in the ways in which sociologiststhink about children; and a growing cross-fertilisation of ideas between researchers in avariety of social science disciplines. This paper builds upon these developments byexploring what three inter-related ways of thinking about spatiality might contribute to thenew social studies of childhood. Specifically; we identify the importance of progressiveunderstandings of place in overcoming the split between global and local approaches tochildhood; we discuss the ways in which children's identities are constituted in and throughparticular spaces; and we examine the ways in which our understandings of childhood canshape the meaning of spaces and places. These ideas are illustrated by reference to ourcurrent research on children's use of the internet as well as a range of wider studies.,Sociology,2000,391
Cyberkids? Exploring children’s identities and social networks in on-line and off-line worlds,Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway,In the first rush of academic and popular commentaries on cyberspace; a stark oppositionhas been drawn between off-line and on-line worlds—the “real” and “virtual.” Suchunderstandings of the relationship between these spaces are now increasingly subject tocritique; yet relatively little is known about how people actually employ information andcommunication technologies (ICT) within the context of their everyday lives. In this article; bydrawing on research with children aged 11–16; we provide primary empirical materialdemonstrating how on-line spaces are used; encountered; and interpreted within the contextof young people's off-line everyday lives. In doing so we consider both how children's “real”worlds are incorporated into their “virtual” worlds and how their “virtual” worlds areincorporated into their “real” worlds. In other words; we demonstrate how the real and the …,Annals of the association of American Geographers,2002,328
Geographies of education and the significance of children; youth and families,Sarah L Holloway; Phil Hubbard; Heike Jöns; Helena Pimlott-Wilson,This paper engages with Hanson Thiem's (2009) critique of geographies of education.Accepting the premise that education warrants fuller attention by geographers; the papernonetheless argues that engaging with research on children; youth and families reshapesunderstanding of what has been; and might be; achieved. Foregrounding young people asthe subjects rather than objects of education demands that attention be paid to their currentand future life-worlds; in both inward and outward looking geographies of education. It alsorequires a broadening of our spatial lens; in terms of what 'count'as educational spaces; andthe places where we study these.,Progress in Human Geography,2010,177
Drunk and disorderly: alcohol; urban life and public space,Mark Jayne; Sarah L Holloway; Gill Valentine,This paper shows that; despite receiving significant attention; the relationship betweenalcohol; drunkenness and public space has been undertheorized. We show that wheredrinking has been considered it has generally been as a peripheral concern of political-economy accounts that have sought to conceptualize the development of the modern city; ormore recently the impact of global economic restructuring on urban life and public space.Moreover; such work has posited the relationship between drinking and the political;economic; social; cultural and spatial practices and processes bound up with; for example;social control in modern city or with contemporary gentrification; corporatization;fragmentation and regulation of the night-time economy; public space and revanchist urbanpolicy in very general terms.

Local childcare cultures: moral geographies of mothering and the social organisation of pre-school education,Sarah L Holloway,Child-rearing has not been a major focus of research in geography despite the fact that itsorganisation is both spatially and temporally variable. Geographical work on pre-schoolchildcare provision in the 1970s and 1980s tended to focus on the implementation andimplications of government policy; more recently there has been a growth of feminist work onchild-rearing which has employed a diversity of approaches. These studies have made avaluable contribution to our understanding of how mothers organise the care of theirchildren; often whilst undertaking paid employment; nevertheless they can not alwaysexplain how a wide range of mothers negotiate specific aspects of'maternal responsibility'.This article draws on an empirical investigation of pre-school childcare cultures in two areasof Sheffield; UK; in order to analyse the ways in which mothers' attitudes to their children's …,Gender; Place and Culture: A Journal of Feminist Geography,1998,174

Emotional; embodied and affective geographies of alcohol; drinking and drunkenness,Mark Jayne; Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway,Abstract This paper develops dialogue between geographers' engagement with emotion;embodiment and affect; and geographical research on alcohol; drinking and drunkenness.In doing so; we focus on the long-running 'moral panic'relating to alcohol-related violence;disorder and drunken behaviour in urban public space. We argue there has been anontological and epistemological impasse in 'alcohol studies' between approaches that haveconsidered the biological; physiological and psychological impacts of alcohol consumptionand those focused on social and cultural practices. While there has been an artificialseparation; and hence under-theorisation of the relationships between emotions;embodiment; affect and everyday uses of alcohol; we develop an argument that signals thepossibilities of a more nuanced and sophisticated approach.

Geographies of alcohol; drinking and drunkenness: a review of progress,Mark Jayne; Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway,This paper explores geographical contributions to the study of alcohol; drinking anddrunkenness. We argue that where alcohol studies have engaged with geographical issuesresearch has been dominated by a case study approach that has undertheorized therelationship between practices and processes relating to alcohol; drinking and drunkennessand the people and places being studied. We then go on to show the ways in which humangeographers are approaching alcohol; drinking and drunkenness via complexinterpenetrations of political; economic; social; cultural and spatial issues and unpackingconnections; similarities; differences and mobilities between supranational; national;regional and local spatial scales. We argue that such an approach represents aconceptually and empirically important contribution to alcohol studies research. The …,Progress in Human Geography,2008,131
On‐line Dangers?: Geographies of Parents’ Fears for Children's Safety in Cyberspace,Gill Valentine; Sarah Holloway,Abstract Children are considered particularly important in debates about the possibilitiesand dangers of information and communication technologies (ICT). Discourses on ICTcontain paradoxical representations of childhood. On the one hand; unlike most otherunderstandings of child/adult relations; these discourses assume children to be equally; ifnot more; technologically competent than adults. On the other hand; children's verycompetence at using ICT is alleged to be putting them “at risk” of abuse or corruption. Thispaper addresses these moral panics about children and ICT by exploring to what extent andwhy parents are concerned about their children's safety in on-line space. In doing so thepaper reflects on the extent to which anxieties about children in cyberspace replicateconcerns about public outdoor space and the way networked computers emerge as …,The Professional Geographer,2001,122
Institutionalising technologies: masculinities; femininities; and the heterosexual economy of the IT classroom,Sarah L Holloway; Gill Valentine; Nick Bingham,Geographers' renewed interest in institutions reflects traditional concerns with the wayinstitutions can shape geographies and a more recent interest in the ways geographies areimportant in shaping institutions. In this paper the authors build on this second strand of workand are specifically concerned with children's use of new information and communicationstechnologies in schools. The authors suggest that multilayered institutional cultures; whichare shaped by official school policy; teacher practice; and pupil culture; are exceedinglyimportant in shaping distinct cultures of computing in (and within) the case-study schools.The highly gendered character of these institutional cultures is reflected in the very differentattitudes of male and female pupils to computers and in the patterns of use which generallyfavour boys rather than girls. These are negotiated through competing masculinities and …,Environment and Planning A,2000,115

Focusing in particular on on-line interactions between children in 12 British and 12 New Zealand schools; the articleexplores their imaginative geographies of each other; and assesses the ways these visionsare endorsed or contested by the children to whom they refer. The article not only illustratesthe sources and importance of stereotypical understandings of landscape; people andpatterns of daily life in other nations; but also the ways these may be contested through on-line contact.,Childhood,2000,104
Drinking places: Young people and cultures of alcohol consumption in rural environments,Gill Valentine; Sarah Holloway; Charlotte Knell; Mark Jayne,Abstract This paper focuses on the contemporary British moral panic about young peopleand the consumption of alcohol in public space. Most of this public debate has focused onbinge drinking in urban areas as a social problem. Here; we consider instead the role ofalcohol in rural communities; and in particular alcohol consumption in domestic and informalspaces; as well as the formal drinking landscape of pubs and bars. Drawing on empiricalwork (including a survey; interviews and participant observation) in rural Cumbria; UK weexplore the specific socio-spatial nature of local attitudes to alcohol consumption and itsregulation. In doing so; we reflect on the nature of rural lifestyles; community spaces andintergenerational relations.

The digital generation?: Children; ICT and the everyday nature of social exclusion,Gill Valentine; Sarah Holloway; Nick Bingham,Abstract In this paper we explore the potentially inclusionary and exclusionary implicationsof Information Communication Technologies (ICT) for children through an examination ofICT policies and practices within UK schools. We begin by outlining the rhetoric of inclusionevident in UK government policy and by reflecting on how these discourses are mobilised inthree case-study schools. We go on to consider issues of social exclusion; demonstratingthat both material and social factors can prevent access to appropriate computer technology.In particular; we emphasise the importance of the way that children negotiate the meaningsand use of computers through their everyday practices within the classroom. The paperconcludes by arguing that only when we recognise that children's use of computers is aboutnot only the broad-scale distribution of resources but also children's everyday social …,Antipode,2002,88

Burning issues: Whiteness; rurality and the politics of difference,Sarah L Holloway,Abstract In the past decade geographers have critiqued the exclusivity of idyllicrepresentations of rurality and sought to explore the diverse experiences of Other socialgroups in the countryside. This paper builds upon that small but significant strand ofresearch which has highlighted the whiteness of representations of rurality and theconsequences of this for racialised minorities. These debates have been crucially importantin forwarding our understanding of racially-exclusive constructions of idyllic country living;however; it is important that academics neither assume that such ideas are forever fixed; northat they affect all minority ethnic groups in the same ways. This paper takes both thepotential power and frailty of these ideas seriously; as it examines how the concepts of race;racism and rurality are deployed by different commentators as they debate the place of …,Geoforum,2007,83
'It's only as stupid as you are': children's and adults' negotiation of ICT competence at home and at school,Sarah L Holloway; Gill Valentine,Contemporary discourses about children's use of information and communicationtechnologies (ICT)—which both celebrate children's command of a technology which is seento be our future; and raise fears that this technology is putting children's emotional well-being at risk—are problematic; resting as they do on essentialist ideas about children; andovert technological determinism. Drawing instead on work within the new social studies ofchildhood; and the sociology of science and technology; we identify a need for researchwhich examines how children and technology come together in diverse communities ofpractice. The communities of practice we study are the home-and school-based ICT usageof British school children in the late 1990s. Our research identifies the different ways inwhich children and adults negotiate children's technical and emotional competence in …,Social & Cultural Geography,2001,78
Changing children's geographies,Sarah L Holloway,This keynote explores the changing nature of children's geographies as an academicproject. It proceeds in four parts. Part 1 considers the shift away from research on children'sspatial cognition which envisaged the child in largely biological terms; and contemplatescontemporary efforts to rework the nature/culture dualism. Part 2 traces the incorporation ofnew social studies of childhood into geography; emphasising the importance of children'svoices; their positioning within axes of power; and the need for quantitative and qualitativemethods. Part 3 explores how feminist research led to interest in parents; educators andother actors/institutions which shape; and are shaped by; children's lives. Part 4 ponderswhat children's geographies might add to; and learn from; broader interdisciplinary debates;and the benefits and pitfalls of research impact. The conclusion argues that a well …,Children's Geographies,2014,74
Children’s interventions in the new public sphere,Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway; Nick Bingham,Information technology is one of the fasting growing sectors of the economy. Over 40 percent of US households now own a home personal computer (PC)(Vanderkay andBlumenthal) while the recent UK Government's IT for All survey (UK Government) found that34 per cent of UK respondents claimed to have a PC at home even if they did not use it.Families with children have the highest levels of ownership. Although the domestic PCmarket which started in the 1970s was initially the domain of hobbyists; in the early 1980sUS and UK government initiatives to put computers into schools inspired the computercompanies to target the consumer market (Murdock; Hartman and Gray 1992).

‘Sainsbury's is my local’: English alcohol policy; domestic drinking practices and the meaning of home,Sarah L Holloway; Mark Jayne; Gill Valentine,Abstract Drinking in England is an issue of public and policy concern. The Government hasfocused on the city centre in pursuing its twin policy aims of urban regeneration and publicorder and health. This paper challenges the silences in such debate by focusing on thedomestic drinking practices in two case-study locations. Drawing on insights from widergeographies of home; the empirical sections of the paper explore domestic drinking as awidespread; socially sanctioned practice; which is shaped through diverse social relations;and the home's connections to other time/spaces. The ideological power of home works toobscure the problems that domestic drinking can sometimes cause.,Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers,2008,72
A window on the wider world? Rural children's use of information and communication technologies,Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway,Abstract The possibilities which information and communication technologies (ICT) offerpeople (or groups) to overcome the friction of distance and the constraints of materialitymean that these technologies are seen to have particular relevance in rural areas whichhave been historically characterised in terms of their economic and social perpheriality. Inthis paper; we draw on empirical research with children and their teachers and parents; toexplore the opportunities which ICT are seen to offer young people living in rural areas. First;we examine the information that children access on-line and how young people make senseof this expanded terrain. Second we focus on communication; by considering children's useof email and chat rooms. Third; we explore how this information and these modes ofcommunication may be shaping young people's sense of place in the world. Our findings …,Journal of Rural Studies,2001,70
Fluid boundaries—British binge drinking and European civility: alcohol and the production and consumption of public space,Mark Jayne; Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway,Abstract During the past few years; debate surrounding depictions of a 'British disease'ofbinge drinking in contrast to civil European drinking cultures has been a central feature ofpopular and political debate in the UK. This paper investigates the ways in which thesedrinking categories have been constructed and identifies how they have become keyelements in the production and consumption of public space. Empirical findings arepresented from a city in the UK to show how these labels are being translated into policyagendas through the construction of models of citizenship and ways of behaviour andoperationalised through the designation and regulation of particular spaces via exclusionzones; quartering; planning and policing. The paper also highlights the ways in whichdiscourses relating to British binge-and European-drinking are being adopted and …,Space and Polity,2008,68

Where do you want to go tomorrow? Connecting children and the Internet,Nick Bingham; Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway,In the late 1990s; use of either of the words 'childhood'or 'internet'is enough to signify at astroke many of society's contemporary hopes and fears about what it means to be modern.By providing a critical review of the burgeoning (popular; policy; and academic) literaturethat is emerging as debates about 'childhood'and 'the Internet'take centre stage in theongoing struggle to define the future of our 'virtual geographies'; what we seek to do in thispaper is to unpack some of the assumptions that underpin both terms. Specifically; we arguethat there is now a dominant story in circulation concerning what has been called the rise ofa 'digital generation'; albeit one; as we show; that can be read in two diametrically opposedways. In the central part of the paper; by characterising the Internet as the latest in a long lineof 'frontier'technologies; we identify three senses (in terms of time; in terms of space; and …,Environment and Planning D: Society and Space,1999,58
Masculinities; femininities and the geographies of public and private drinking landscapes,Sarah L Holloway; Gill Valentine; Mark Jayne,Abstract Geographers have been slow to address issues about abstinence; drinking anddrunkenness; but the importance of alcohol on the social and political agenda hasunderpinned recent growth in this field. Explorations of the gendered geographies ofdrinking are one important strand in this emerging field; but there is currently a paucity ofresearch on women and gender (as opposed to men); and a dearth of research which looksbeyond a rather narrowly specified range of public drinking environments. This paperaddressed these short-comings through a quantitative and qualitative examination ofdifferent men's and women's alcohol consumption in private as well as diverse publicdrinking environments in 21st Century Britain. The paper emphasises the importance ofgendered moralities in shaping gender and intra-gender differences in drinking levels …,Geoforum,2009,56
Mother and worker? The negotiation of motherhood and paid employment in two urban neighborhoods,Sarah L Holloway,Geographers have shown considerable interest in the geographies of working mothers andchildcare; however; the question “Why do some mothers with young children work outsidethe home and others do not?” has received less attention. This paper provides an analysis ofhow; within two urban neighborhoods; some mothers come to care for their preschool-agedchildren full time and others employ a range of strategies that enable them to undertake full-or part-time employment. In doing so; the paper makes three principal contributions tocurrent knowledge in the field. First; it illustrates the importance of studying a diverse groupof mothers; including those not in paid work; second; it highlights the significance of place-rooted cultures in shaping mothers' employment and childcare choices; and finally; it showshow the spatial prescription in dominant childrearing ideologies is beginning to be …,Urban Geography,1999,56

Contemporary cultures of abstinence and the nighttime economy: Muslim attitudes towards alcohol and the implications for social cohesion,Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway; Mark Jayne,This paper draws on original empirical work with the British Pakistani community to exploreMuslim attitudes to alcohol and alcohol-related practices; before considering how thePakistani Muslim community's culture of abstention shapes its members' access to; and useof; public space in the nighttime economy. We foreground the active role played by alcohol;as a nonhuman actor; in shaping emergent social relations by exploring its agency ingenerating new exclusions with the mainstream nighttime economy. By using the lens of afaith-based culture of abstention in this way; this paper provides a new perspective ondebates about access to public space and social cohesion in the contemporary urbannighttime economy.,Environment and Planning A,2010,49
Parents' and children's fears about information and communication technologies and the transformation of culture and society1,Gill Valentine; Sarah Holloway,There is a long history of different groups being threatened by the advent of particular newtechnologies. Perhaps most famously; in the early nineteenth century a group of weaversfrom Yorkshire; known as Luddites; sabotaged machines that were being introduced as partof the large-scale mechanization brought about by the development of industrial capitalism.Their actions led to the introduction of a parliamentary bill that imposed the death penalty forthe crime of breaking machines. It was not the technology per se which the Luddites wereopposed to; but rather the changes its introduction wrought; the relocation of work fromhome to factory threatened the cultural stability of their craft-based communities and way oflife (Bryson and de Castell 1998).

Much of the nascent interest inaspiration concerns access to quality schooling and University education. In this paper bycontrast we highlight the importance of studying the ways aspirations are (re) producedwithin the school community. Our empirical focus is on low-income England under NewLabour. Here we pursue a two-fold approach: firstly examining how education professionalsdefine parental aspirations for primary-aged children as low; before secondly consideringtheir alternative understandings of appropriate aspirations and the practices through whichthey seek to promote these; both in school and through the use of Extended Services for …,Children's Geographies,2011,48

Drawing on social-constructionist and psychoanalytic accounts of difference; I explore both the specificity ofracialisation in different places; and the ways in which processes of racialisation canproduce highly spatialised understandings of difference. In so doing; I consider theimportance of nature–society relations in the othering of this minority group; and thecontested construction of their place in the rural idyll.,Environment and Planning D: Society and Space,2003,46

Enriching children; institutionalizing childhood? Geographies of play; extracurricular activities; and parenting in England,Sarah L Holloway; Helena Pimlott-Wilson,Geographical research on children; youth; and families has done much to highlight the waysin which children's lives have changed over the last twenty-five years. A key strand ofresearch concerns children's play and traces; in the Global North; a decline in children'sindependent access to; and mobility through; public space. This article shifts the terrain ofthat debate from an analysis of what has been lost to an exploration of what has replaced it.Specifically; it focuses on children's participation in enrichment activities; including bothindividual and collective extracurricular sporting; cultural; and leisure opportunities inEngland. The research reveals that middle-class children have much higher participationrates in enrichment activities than their working-class counterparts.

Educational mobility and the gendered geography of cultural capital: The case of international student flows between Central Asia and the UK,Sarah L Holloway; Sarah L O'Hara; Helena Pimlott-Wilson,International student mobility from East to West has grown rapidly as the middle classeshave sought to reproduce their advantage in the context of changing socioeconomiccircumstances. Existing research shows that middle-class students and their parents areincreasingly using overseas educational qualifications—an institutionalised form of culturalcapital—to ensure that they stand out in the competition for lucrative employment. This papermakes two unique contributions to these debates. Firstly; it broadens the spatial frame awayfrom East Asia to the emerging educational markets in post-Soviet Central Asia; andspecifically Kazakhstan. This shift allows examination of similarities in students' accrual ofcultural capital between regions; but also highlights spatial specificity in these flows.Secondly; it moves beyond narrowly class-based approaches to spotlight the importance …,Environment and Planning A,2012,43

Editorial introduction: Geographies of education and aspiration,Sarah L Holloway; Gavin Brown; Helena Pimlott-Wilson,Geographies of children; youth and families have grown from diverse roots–indevelopmental psychology; feminism and action research with children–into the vibrant fieldof research represented in the pages of this journal (Holloway and Pimlott-Wilson 2011).The development of the field in the past two decades has also been shaped through itsengagement with research in the new social studies of childhood; and a key legacy of thishas been the emphasis placed on diverse children's agency within geographical researchon/with children (Holloway and Valentine 2000; Ansell 2009). Children's geographies has;to a large extent; been a success in early twenty-first century geography; but Aitken's (2004)editorial in this journal reminds us of the need to be alert to dangers lurking under thesurface. The potential dangers facing the sub-discipline are disparate; but here we want …,Children's Geographies,2011,41
Generational patterns of alcohol consumption: Continuity and change,Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway; Mark Jayne,Abstract In most contemporary western societies there is growing concern about rising levelsof alcohol consumption; particularly by young people; even in countries; such as France;which have previously been assumed to have 'sensible'drinking cultures. Recent popularand policy debates about British drinking cultures have hinted at a shift in generationalattitudes towards alcohol; as well as patterns of consumption. Previous intergenerationalstudies of work and care have found that in particular historical periods differentnormativities develop; reflecting both social and economic conditions. In this paper; we drawon a research project about alcohol consumption conducted in an urban and rural area–including intergenerational interviews with case study families–to identify the differentnormativities in terms of attitudes towards and consumption of alcohol experienced by …,Health & Place,2010,40
The place of drink: Geographical contributions to alcohol studies,Mark Jayne; Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway,This paper considers how geographies of alcohol; drinking and drunkenness have beenconsidered within and beyond the discipline of geography. We argue that while there hasbeen a large amount of relevant; detailed and rich research considering'geographical'issues; alcohol studies has tended to under-theorize the role of space andplace. While geographers; on the other hand; have been relatively slow to engage with thealcohol; drinking and drunkenness; we show that geography have much to offer futureresearch agendas. Despite recent progress; however; a failing of geographers' engagementwith alcohol; drinking and drunkenness has been an inability to transcend disciplinaryboundaries. We conclude by arguing that geographical research into alcohol; drinking anddrunkenness must continue to pursue theoretical and empirical advances; but also offer …,*,2008,38
What use are units? Critical geographies of alcohol policy,Mark Jayne; Gill Valentine; Sarah L Holloway,Abstract: This paper interrogates the multiple spatialities bound up with the consumption ofunits as the dominant means of diagnosing “health-related” alcohol problems andmeasuring “drunkenness” in international alcohol policy and research. In order to questionthe power afforded to units; we work at the intersection of theoretical debates concerningbiopower and governmentality; emotional; embodied and affective geographies and actornetwork theory. Presenting empirical research from the UK we contribute to geographicalagendas that seek to consider the ontological and epistemological understandings ofalcohol; drinking and drunkenness. The paper concludes by calling for dialogue betweensocial; health and medical scientists in order to develop more pertinent ways ofunderstanding and representing the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption.,Antipode,2012,35

Geographies of justice: preschool-childcarc provision and the conceptualisation of social justice,Sarah L Holloway,During the 1990s geographers of diverse philosophical orientations have shown a renewedinterest in questions of justice. The author draws on empirical work on childcare provision inSheffield; England; in order to evaluate two different approaches to the geography of justiceand hence the theories of social justice which lie behind these; in particular she explores thedifferent geographies of childcare produced by the territorial-justice approach; which isbased on a liberal conception of social justice; and a study of childcare cultures; which owesmore to poststructuralist understandings of justice. The specific differences between theseapproaches in terms of their conceptualisation of what counts as childcare; who needs it;and how its delivery is structured raise broader questions about the understandings ofsociety and space; about the importance of moral geographies; and about the possible …,Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy,1998,28
Rural roots; rural routes: discourses of rural self and travelling other in debates about the future of Appleby New Fair; 1945–1969,SL Holloway,Abstract The notion that Gypsies; in an idealised form; have a place in the rural idyll hasbeen sufficiently influential within Geography that it currently features in our undergraduatetexts concerned with the meaning of place. The position of real Gypsy-Travellers in thecountryside is of course more complex; and this paper seeks to move the debate forward byexamining how the group; who are still marginalised in geographical research; wereportrayed by rural residents in the post-War period; and what these representations of atravelling other reveal about the nature of the rural self. The route in is through local printmedia reports about Appleby New Fair; a horse fair in Northern England which is one of thelargest Gypsy-Traveller gatherings in Europe and a major tourist attraction. Analysis of thissource highlights the contested position of Gypsy-Travellers in the country; and the lines …,Journal of Rural Studies,2004,27
“Any Advice is Welcome Isn't it?”: Neoliberal Parenting Education; Local Mothering Cultures; and Social Class,Sarah L Holloway; Helena Pimlott-Wilson,Geographers have shown considerable interest in neoliberal educational restructuring asstates across the Global North have sought to respond to the challenges of economicchange through the development of a skilled population. Existing research provides a wide-ranging analysis of the ways neoliberal states seek to shape individual citizens through theirown learning. Greater attention now needs to be paid to new and developing ways in whichthey seek to influence the context in which future citizen-workers are raised. This paperfocuses on parenting education which is growing across OECD countries. Social sciencecritiques suggest that parenting classes are part of a professionalisation of parenting whichhas sought to impose middle-class mores on working-class parents; at the same time asparenting has been unwarrantedly cast as a context-free skill.

Parental involvement in children's learning: Mothers' fourth shift; social class; and the growth of state intervention in family life,Sarah L Holloway; Helena Pimlott‐Wilson,Abstract Nation states across the global North are restructuring their education systems. Thisprocess has changed the relationship between school and home; with an increasing onusbeing placed on parents to involve themselves in their children's education. The articleexplores what mothers with different social class positions think about state attempts to enrolthem in the education of their primary-aged children (ages 4–11); and considers theirexperience of school curriculum events designed to encourage and guide their help forchildren's learning within the home. Mothers' support for this form of educationalrestructuring is widespread; but motivations for; and experiences of; involvement varysignificantly between higher-; middle-and low-income schools.

Love changes all: making some noise by ‘coming out’as mothers,Carol Ekinsmyth; Rebecca Elmhirst; Sarah Holloway; Helen Jarvis,The thing about motherhood is that it changes you forever in obvious and unexpected ways.As female academics who have all come to motherhood in our thirties; we have experiencedthis transformation against a background of committed feminist politics and thinking. In theprevious Women and Geography Study Group volume; Gregson and Rose (1997: 41)appeal to feminist geographers to produce 'multiple voiced histories to show that–like allgeographical traditions; feminist geography is heterogeneous; that it is 'situated messiness';contested and negotiated by particular bodies in particular places'.

'The Vision Thing' Schools and Information and Communication Technology,Gill Valentine; Sarah Holloway,In this paper we begin by outlining the Government's vision of ICT and education; arguingthat this is a deeply determinist vision which severs technology from the context of socialpractice. For example; it ignores the importance of the specificities of time and place; howICT is promoted and made sense of in different contexts; the intentions of different users;how it becomes attached to particular agendas and so on. Drawing on three case studies;we go on to examine what happens when schools and technology are brought together inpractice. In doing so we argue that; counter to the Government's vision; technology does notsimply impinge on society from outside or follow a predetermined course but rather that ICTemerges as a very different tool in different communities of practice as the place; schools;teachers; children; community and technology mutually enrol; constitute and order each …,Convergence,1999,12

Making an argument: writing up human geography projects,Sarah L Holloway; Gill Valentine,Geography students are generally required to undertake project work as part of their degree;for example in the form of a dissertation or as part of a local or international fi eld class.

A successful dissertation or fi eld-class report has a number of elements:it is set within an appropriate literature; it employs a suitable and justified methodology; andthe findings are clearly explained and related back to the wider literature (Hay; 1999). Soundempirical work is therefore an essential part of every fi eld-based project; but you should notmake the mistake of thinking that all you need to do to attract a good mark is clearly outlinethe results of your well-conducted independent research.

The chapter thenconsiders foundational characteristic of research that considers class; gender; age; ethnicityand so on with reference to spaces and places around the world.

Old habits and new media: Ethnography meets cyberspace studies,Rob Drew,As someone who grew up in the 1970s; I can recall the debut of telephones with push-buttondialing. My friends and I amused ourselves for hours with the new devices' three sparetones; playing “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and other simple tunes for each other. Within a shorttime; though; we became accustomed to the new phones and resumed using them ascommunication devices rather than musical instruments. The memory has always seemedemblematic to me of the process whereby new technologies; after being met with a certainfascinated experimentalism; soon tend to “slouch toward the ordinary”(Herring 2004).Academic observers of the Internet have watched it undergo enormous technical and socialtransformations in its short history; and in the process; the fledgling field of cyberspacestudies has experienced significant changes itself.

For example; studies undertaken by scholars in a variety of disciplinesincluding medical and health studies; psychology; sociology; politics; criminology;economics and cultural studies have considered issues relating to drugs and alcohol via'geographical'issues such as spatial scale; national; regional and local identities; distinctionsbetween public and private space; urbanity and rurality; boundaries and transgressions;visibility and invisibility; centrality and marginality and so on.

Questions of agency: capacity; subjectivity; spatiality and temporality,Sarah L Holloway; Louise Holt; Sarah Mills,Geographies of Children; Youth and Families is flourishing; but its founding conceptionsrequire critical reflection. This paper considers one key conceptual orthodoxy: the notion thatchildren are competent social actors. In a field founded upon liberal notions of agency; weidentify a conceptual elision between the benefits of studying agency and the beneficialnature of agency. Embracing post-structuralist feminist challenges; we propose a politically-progressive conceptual framework centred on embodied human agency which emergeswithin power. We contend this can be achieved though intensive/extensive analyses ofspace; and a focus on biosocial beings and becomings within dynamic notions of individual/intergenerational time.,*,2018,*

GaWC Research Bulletin 265,Gateways into GaWC; P Hubbard; S Holloway; H Jöns; L Mavroudi; P Noxolo; PJ Taylor; M Hoyler; K Pain; J Harrison,Abstract The notion of a hierarchy among cities has long been part of the theoretical toolkit ofurban sociologists; geographers; and economists. Reviewing the evolution of the urbanhierarchy concept; this paper empirically demonstrates a hypothesized transition in the USurban hierarchy during the twentieth century; from size-based to network-based. Threeurban types; following distinct trajectories during this shift; are explored: the primate city; theoffline metropolis; and the wired town. Data on the economic structure; population size; andairline passenger traffic of 64 US metropolitan areas from 1900–2000 are used to test thehypothesis of a hierarchical transition. Results suggest that a size-based hierarchydominated in the early twentieth century; but was replaced or augmented in the mid 1940swith a network-based hierarchy.

Cyberspace is one of 'the zones that scripts thefuture'(Haraway; 1997: 100).

This reply is crafted in response to the nakeddisillusionment I read in Lea's original correspondence. It is a personal answer to a personalletter.Lea's disappointment centered on the lack of “direct usefulness” of academic work; onthe failure of academics to influence politicians. These are; I suppose; the kind of issues withwhich we all struggle. Soon after gaining full-time employment as an academic I was electedas a local councillor. As I finished writing up my Ph.

Ethnography has been particularlyinstrumental in recent social geography and vice versa: the distinguished social geographerDavid Harvey is now housed in the anthropology department at the City University of NewYork Graduate Center.
