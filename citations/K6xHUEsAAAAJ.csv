A logical framework for querying and repairing inconsistent databases,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,In this paper; we address the problem of managing inconsistent databases; ie; databasesviolating integrity constraints. We propose a general logic framework for computing repairsand consistent answers over inconsistent databases. A repair for a possibly inconsistentdatabase is a minimal set of insert and delete operations which makes the databaseconsistent; whereas a consistent answer is a set of tuples derived from the database;satisfying all integrity constraints. In our framework; different types of rules defining generalintegrity constraints; repair constraints (ie; rules defining conditions on the insertion ordeletion of atoms); and prioritized constraints (ie; rules defining priorities among updatesand repairs) are considered. We propose a technique based on the rewriting of constraintsinto (prioritized) extended disjunctive rules with two different forms of negation (negation …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,179
A logic programming approach to the integration; repairing and querying of inconsistent databases,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract In this paper we present a logic programming based framework for the integration ofpossibly inconsistent databases. In particular we consider the problemof 'merging'databasesand; since the resulting 'merged'database may be inconsistent (with respect to theconstraints defined on the input databases or with respect to additional constraints); weaddress the problemof managing inconsistent databases. We propose a general logicframework for computing repairs and consistent answers over inconsistent databases. Thelogic framework and the techniques for computing repairs and consistent answers proposedhere are more general than previously proposed techniques. Indeed; our technique is soundand complete for universally quantified constraints whereas previous defined techniquesonly consider restricted cases.,International Conference on Logic Programming,2001,111

COMPLEX: an object-oriented logic programming system,Sergio Greco; Nicola Leone; Pasquale Rullo,The design and a prototypical implementation of COMPLEX; which is a logic-based systemextended with concepts from the object-oriented paradigm and is intended as a tool for thedevelopment of knowledge-based applications; are described. The system supports a logiclanguage; called Complex-Datalog (C-Datalog); enhanced by semantic constructs toprovide facility for data abstraction. Its implementation is based on a bottom-upcomputational model that guarantees a fully declarative style of programming. However; theuser is also given the possibility of running a query using a top-down model of computation.Efficiency of execution is the result of the integration of different novel technologies for thecompilation and the execution of queries.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1992,65
Semantic clustering of XML documents,Andrea Tagarelli; Sergio Greco,Abstract Dealing with structure and content semantics underlying semistructured documentsis challenging for any task of document management and knowledge discovery conceivedfor such data. In this work we address the novel problem of clustering semantically relatedXML documents according to their structure and content features. XML features aregenerated by enriching syntactic with semantic information based on a lexical knowledgebase. The backbone of the proposed framework for the semantic clustering of XMLdocuments is a data representation model that exploits the notion of tree tuple to identifysemantically cohesive substructures in XML documents and represent them as transactionaldata. This framework is equipped with two clustering algorithms based on differentparadigms; namely centroid-based partitional clustering and frequent-itemset-based …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2010,63
A time series representation model for accurate and fast similarity detection,Francesco Gullo; Giovanni Ponti; Andrea Tagarelli; Sergio Greco,Abstract Similarity search and detection is a central problem in time series data processingand management. Most approaches to this problem have been developed around the notionof dynamic time warping; whereas several dimensionality reduction techniques have beenproposed to improve the efficiency of similarity searches. Due to the continuous increasingof sources of time series data and the cruciality of real-world applications that use such data;we believe there is a challenging demand for supporting similarity detection in time series ina both accurate and fast way. Our proposal is to define a concise yet feature-richrepresentation of time series; on which the dynamic time warping can be applied for effectiveand efficient similarity detection of time series. We present the Derivative time seriesSegment Approximation (DSA) representation model; which originally features derivative …,Pattern Recognition,2009,60
Querying inconsistent databases,Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of answering queries consistently in thepresence of inconsistent data; ie data violating integrity constraints. We propose a techniquebased on the rewriting of integrity constraints into disjunctive rules with two di. erent forms ofnegation (negation as failure and classical negation). The disjunctive program can be usedi) to generate 'repairs' for the database and ii) to produce consistent answers; ie maximal setof atoms which do not violate the constraints. We show that our technique is sound;complete and more general than techniques previously proposed.,International Conference on Logic for Programming Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning,2000,58
Toward semantic XML clustering,Andrea Tagarelli; Sergio Greco,Abstract The increasing availability of heterogeneous XML informative sources has raised anumber of issues concerning how to represent and manage semistructured data. AlthoughXML sources can exhibit proper structures and contents; differently annotated XMLdocuments may in principle encode related semantics due to subjective definitions ofmarkup tags. Discovering knowledge to infer semantic organization of XML documents hasbecome a major challenge in XML data management. In this context; we address theproblem of clustering XML data according to structure as well as content features enrichedwith lexical ontology knowledge. We propose a framework for clustering semanticallycohesive XML structures based on a transactional representation model.

Binding propagation techniques for the optimization of bound disjunctive queries,Sergio Greco,This paper presents a technique for the optimization of bound queries on disjunctivedeductive databases. The optimization is based on the rewriting of the source program intoan equivalent program which can be evaluated more efficiently. The proposed optimizationreduces the amount of data needed to answer the query and; consequently; 1) reduces thecomplexity of computing a single model and; more importantly; 2) greatly reduces thenumber of models to be considered. Although; in this paper; we consider the application ofthe magic-set method; other rewriting techniques defined for special classes of queries canalso be applied. To show the relevance of our technique; we have implemented a prototypeof an optimizer. Several experiments have confirmed the value of the technique.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,46

This paper proposes a new approach to website personalizationbased on the exploitation of user browsing interests together with content and usagesimilarities among Web pages. The outcome is the delivery of page recommendations whichare strictly related to the navigational purposes of visitors and their actual location within thecyberspace of the website.

DATALOG queries with stratified negation and choice: from P to D P,Sergio Greco; Domenico Saccà; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract This paper introduces a unified solution to the problem of extending stratifiedDATALOG to express DB-complexity classes ranging from P to DP. The solution is based on(i) stratified negation as the core of a simple; declarative semantics for negation;(ii) the useof a “choice” construct to capture non-determinism of stable models (iii) the ability to bind aquery execution to the complexity class that includes the problem at hand; and (iv) a generalalgorithm that ensures efficient execution for the different complexity classes. We thus obtaina class of DATALOG programs that preserves computational tractability; while achievingcompleteness for a wide range of complexity classes.,International Conference on Database Theory,1995,41
Querying and repairing inconsistent XML data,Sergio Flesca; Filippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract The problem of repairing XML data which are inconsistent and incomplete withrespect to a set of integrity constraints and a DTD is addressed. The existence of repairs (ieminimal sets of update operations making data consistent) is investigated and shown to beundecidable in the general case. This pro-blem is shown to be still undecidable when dataare interpreted as “incomplete”(so that they could be repaired by performing insertoperations only). However; it becomes decidable when particular classes of constraints areconsidered. The existence of repairs is proved to be decidable and; in particular; NP-complete; if inconsistent data are interpreted as “dirty” data (so that repairs are data-cleaningoperations consisting in only deletions). The existence of general repairs (containing bothinsert and delete operations) for special classes of integrity constraints (functional …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2005,40
A distributed system for answering range queries on sensor network data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Filippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco; Elio Masciari; Giuseppe M Mazzeo; Domenico Sacca,A distributed system for approximate query answering on sensor network data is proposed;where a suitable compression technique is exploited to represent data and support queryanswering. Each node of the system stores either detailed or summarized sensor readings.Query answers are computed by identifying the set of nodes that contain (either compressedor not) data involved in the query; and eventually partitioning the query in a set of sub-queries to be evaluated at different nodes. Queries are partitioned according to a cost modelaiming at making the evaluation efficient and guaranteeing the desired degree of accuracyof query answers.,Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops; 2005.

Repairs and consistent answers for XML data with functional dependencies,Sergio Flesca; Filippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of XML data which may be inconsistent withrespect to a set of functional dependencies. We propose a technique for computing repairs(minimal sets of update operations making data consistent) and consistent answers. Morespecifically; our repairs are based on i) the replacing of values associated with attributes andelements; and ii) the introduction of a function stating if the node information is reliable.,International XML Database Symposium,2003,40
Chase termination: A constraints rewriting approach,Sergio Greco; Francesca Spezzano,Abstract Several database areas such as data exchange and integration share the problemof fixing database instance violations with respect to a set of constraints. The chasealgorithm solves such violations by inserting tuples and setting the value of nulls.Unfortunately; the chase algorithm may not terminate and the problem of deciding whetherthe chase process terminates is undecidable. Recently there has been an increasinginterest in the identification of sufficient structural properties of constraints which guaranteethat the chase algorithm terminates [8; 10; 14; 15]. In this paper we propose an originaltechnique which allows to improve current conditions detecting chase termination. Ourproposal consists in rewriting the original set of constraints Σ into an'equivalent'set Σ α andverifying the structural properties for chase termination on Σ α.

Active integrity constraints for database consistency maintenance,Luciano Caroprese; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,This paper introduces active integrity constraints (AICs); an extension of integrity constraintsfor consistent database maintenance. An active integrity constraint is a special constraintwhose body contains a conjunction of literals which must be false and whose head containsa disjunction of update actions representing actions (insertions and deletions of tuples) to beperformed if the constraint is not satisfied (that is its body is true). The AICs work in a domino-like manner as the satisfaction of one AIC may trigger the violation and therefore theactivation of another one. The paper also introduces founded repairs; which are minimalsets of update actions that make the database consistent; and are specified andldquosupportedrdquo by active integrity constraints. The paper presents: 1) a formaldeclarative semantics allowing the computation of founded repairs and 2) a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,33
Stratification criteria and rewriting techniques for checking chase termination,Sergio Greco; Francesca Spezzano; Irina Trubitsyna,ABSTRACT The Chase is a fixpoint algorithm enforcing satisfaction of data dependencies indatabases. Its execution involves the insertion of tuples with possible null values and thechanging of null values which can be made equal to constants or other null values. Sincethe chase fixpoint evaluation could be non-terminating; in recent years the problem know aschase termination has been investigated. It consists in the detection of sufficient conditions;derived from the structural analysis of dependencies; guaranteeing that the chase fixpointterminates independently from the database instance. Several criteria introducing sufficientconditions for chase termination have been recently proposed [9; 8; 13; 12]. The aim of thispaper is to present more general criteria and techniques for chase termination.

A hierarchical algorithm for clustering uncertain data via an information-theoretic approach,Francesco Gullo; Giovanni Ponti; Andrea Tagarelli; Sergio Greco,In recent years there has been a growing interest in clustering uncertain data. In contrast totraditional;" sharp" data representation models; uncertain data objects can be represented interms of an uncertainty region over which a probability density function (pdf) is defined. Inthis context; the focus has been mainly on partitional and density-based approaches;whereas hierarchical clustering schemes have drawn less attention. We propose a centroid-linkage-based agglomerative hierarchical algorithm for clustering uncertain objects; namedU-AHC. The cluster merging criterion is based on an information-theoretic measure tocompute the distance between cluster prototypes. These prototypes are represented asmixture densities that summarize the pdfs of all the uncertain objects in the clusters.Experiments have shown that our method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering …,Data Mining; 2008.

Web communities: models and algorithms,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract In the last few years; a lot of research has been devoted to developing newtechniques for improving the recall and the precision of current web search engines. Fewworks deal with the interesting problem of identifying the communities to which pagesbelong. Most of the previous approaches try to cluster data by means of spectral techniquesor by means of traditional hierarchical algorithms. The main problem with these techniquesis that they ignore the relevant fact that web communities are social networks with distinctivestatistical properties. In this paper we analyze web communities on the basis of the evolutionof an initial set of hubs and authoritative pages. The evolution law captures the behaviour ofpage authors with respect to the popularity of existing pages for the topics of interest.Assuming such a model; we have found interesting properties of web communities.

Integrating and managing conflicting data,Sergio Greco; Luigi Pontieri; Ester Zumpano,Abstract Data integration aims to provide a uniform integrated access to multipleheterogeneous information sources; designed independently and having strictly relatedcontents. The heterogeneity among sources may range from the hardware and softwareplatforms to the data model and the schema used to represent information. In this paper weconsider data inconsistencies and deal with the integration of possibly conflicting instancescoming from different sources and related to the same concept. In order to support the dataintegration process; we introduce some integration operators for combining data coming bydifferent sources; preserving the information provided by each source separately. Generally;a view obtained by integrating heterogeneous sources could contain instances which areinconsistent; wrt some integrity constraints defined on the integrated view schema …,International Andrei Ershov Memorial Conference on Perspectives of System Informatics,2001,27
Greedy by choice,Sergio Greco; Carlo Zaniolo; Sumit Ganguly,Abstract The greedy paradigm of algorithm design is a well known tool used for efficientlysolving many classical computational problems within the framework of procedurallanguages. However; it is very difficult to express these algorithms within the declarativeframework of logic-based languages. In this paper; we extend the framework of Datalog-likelanguages to provide simple and declarative formulations of such problems; withcomputational complexities comparable to those of procedural formulations. This isachieved through the use of constructs; such as least and choice; that have semanticsreducible to that of negative programs under stable model semantics. Therefore; we showthat the formulation of greedy algorithms using these constructs lead to a syntactic class ofprograms; called stage-stratified programs; that are easily recognized at compile time …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1992,27

Making the process of retrieving relevantdocuments easier is one of the most challenging activities in the design of modern sites andgoes beyond any particular domain. This paper proposes a new technique for Webnavigation based on current algorithms used in Recommendation Systems. Our approachidentifies really relevant documents adopting methodologies similar to those successfullyused in current search engines. The effectiveness and the validity of our technique havebeen shown by several experiments.,Ai Communications,2004,26

Preferred repairs for inconsistent databases,Sergio Greco; Cristina Sirangelo; Irina Trubitsyna; Ester Zumpano,The objective of this paper is to investigate the problems related to the extensionalintegration of information sources. In particular; we propose an approach for managinginconsistent databases; ie databases violating integrity constraints. The presence ofinconsistent data can be resolved by" repairing" the database; ie by providing acomputational mechanism that ensures obtaining consistent" scenarios" of the information orby consistently answering to queries posed on an inconsistent set of data. In this paper weconsider preferences among repairs and possible answers by introducing a partial orderamong them on the base of some preference criteria. More specifically; preferences areexpressed by considering polynomial functions applied to repairs and returning realnumbers. The goodness of a repair is measured by estimating how much it violates the …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2003. Proceedings. Seventh International,2003,23
Rewriting queries using views,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco,In this paper; we consider the problem of answering queries using materialized views in thepresence of negative goals. The solution is carried out by" inverting" views and deriving bothpositive and negative knowledge. In order to derive negative knowledge; we invertconjunctive views with negation into a set of (extended) views which may also have; inaddition to negation-as-failure; a different form of negation called classical (or strong)negation. We also consider the case of disjunctive views and present a technique whichpermits us to infer both positive and negative knowledge. Furthermore; we extend previoustechniques for inferring knowledge from views based on relations with functionaldependencies. Finally; we present a prototype of a system developed at the University ofCalabria.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2001,23

Extrema predicates in deductive databases,Sumit Ganguly; Sergio Greco; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract A novel approach is proposed for expressing and computing efficiently a large classof problems; including finding the shortest path in a graph; that were previously consideredimpervious to an efficient treatment in the declarative framework of logic-based languages.Our approach is based on the use of min and max predicates having a first-order semanticsdefined using rules with negation in their bodies. We show that; under certain monotonicityconditions;(1) there exists a total well-founded model for these programs expressed usingnegation;(2) this model can be computed efficiently using a procedure called greedy fixpoint;and (3) programs with min/max goals on recursively defined cost predicates can often berewritten into more efficient ones by pushing min and max predicates into recursion.

Incomplete data and data dependencies in relational databases,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Francesca Spezzano,Abstract The chase has long been used as a central tool to analyze dependencies and theireffect on queries. It has been applied to different relevant problems in database theory suchas query optimization; query containment and equivalence; dependency implication; anddatabase schema design. Recent years have seen a renewed interest in the chase as animportant tool in several database applications; such as data exchange and integration;query answering in incomplete data; and many others. It is well known that the chasealgorithm might be non-terminating and thus; in order for it to find practical applicability; it iscrucial to identify cases where its termination is guaranteed. Another important aspect toconsider when dealing with the chase is that it can introduce null values into the database;thereby leading to incomplete data. Thus; in several scenarios where the chase is used …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2012,21
A probabilistic approach for distillation and ranking of web pages,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract A great number of recent papers have investigated the possibility of introducingmore effective and efficient algorithms for search engines. In traditional search engines theresulting ranking is carried out using textual information only and; as showed by severalworks; they are not very useful for extracting relevant information. Present research; instead;takes a new approach; called Topic Distillation; whose main task is finding relevantdocuments using a different similarity criterion: retrieved documents are those related to thequery topic; but which do not necessarily contain the query string. Current algorithms fortopic distillation first compute a base set containing all the relevant pages and then; byapplying an iterative procedure; obtain the authoritative pages. In this paper; we present adifferent approach which computes the authoritative pages by analyzing the structure of …,World Wide Web,2001,21
Querying graph databases,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco,Abstract Graph data is an emerging model for representing a variety of database contextsranging from object-oriented databases to hypertext data. Also many of the recursive queriesthat arise in relational databases are; in practice; graph traversals. In this paper we present alanguage for searching graph-like databases. The language permits us to express paths in agraph by means of extended regular expressions. The proposed extension is based on theintroduction of constructs which permit us i) to de_ne a partial order on the paths used tosearch the graph and; consequently; on the answers of queries; and ii) to cut off;nondeterministically; tuples with low priority. We present an algebra for partially orderedrelations and an algorithm for the computation of path queries. Finally; we presentapplications to hypertext databases such as the Web.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,21
Diversity-based weighting schemes for clustering ensembles,Francesco Gullo; Andrea Tagarelli; Sergio Greco,Abstract Clustering ensembles has been recently recognized as an emerging approach toprovide more robust solutions to the data clustering problem. Current methods of clusteringensembles typically fall into instance-based; cluster-based; or hybrid approaches; however;most of such methods fail in discriminating among the various clusterings that participate tothe ensemble. In this paper; we address the problem of weighting clustering ensembles byproposing general weighting approaches based on different implementations of the notionof diversity. We introduce three weighting schemes for clustering ensembles; called SingleWeighting; Group Weighting and Dendrogram Weighting; which are independent of theparticular method of clustering ensembles and designed to take into account correlationsamong the individual clustering solutions in different ways. We show how these schemes …,*,2009,20
Declarative semantics of production rules for integrity maintenance,Luciano Caroprese; Sergio Greco; Cristina Sirangelo; Ester Zumpano,Abstract This paper presents a declarative semantics for the maintenance of integrityconstraints expressed by means of production rules. A production rule is a special form ofactive rule; called active integrity constraint; whose body contains an integrity constraint(conjunction of literals which must be false) and whose head contains a disjunction ofupdate atoms; ie actions to be performed if the corresponding constraint is not satisfied (ie istrue). The paper introduces i) a formal declarative semantics allowing the computation offounded repairs; that is repairs whose actions are specified and supported by active integrityconstraint; ii) an equivalent semantics obtained by rewriting production rules into disjunctivelogic rules; so that repairs can be derived from the answer sets of the logic program andfinally iii) a characterization of production rules allowing a methodology for integrity …,International Conference on Logic Programming,2006,20
Active integrity constraints,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract In this paper we deal with inconsistent databases and propose a logic frameworkthat allows specifying sets of actions which should be performed to make databasesconsistent (repairs). The motivation of this work stems from the observation that in repairinga database it is natural to express among a set of update operations; the (preferred) actionswhich should be performed to repair the database. We introduce (conditioned) activeintegrity constraints; a simple and powerful form of active rules with declarative semantics;well suited for computing database repairs and consistent answers. We first consider a"prescriptive" semantics where the allowed actions are those specified by the constraints.Under such a semantics the existence of repairs and consistent answers is not guaranteed.Thus; we also investigate the class of universally quantified constraints under a different …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGPLAN international conference on Principles and practice of declarative programming,2004,20
Feasibility conditions and preference criteria in querying and repairing inconsistent databases,Sergio Greco; Cristina Sirangelo; Irina Trubitsyna; Ester Zumpano,Abstract Recently there has been an increasing interest in integrity constraints associatedwith relational databases and in inconsistent databases; ie databases which do not satisfyintegrity constraints. In the presence of inconsistencies two main techniques have beenproposed: compute repairs; ie minimal set of insertion and deletion operations; calleddatabase repairs; and compute consistent answers; ie identify the sets of atoms which wecan assume true; false and undefined without modifying the database. In this paperfeasibility conditions and preference criteria are introduced which; associated with integrityconstraints; allow to restrict the number of repairs and to increase the power of queries overinconsistent databases. Moreover; it is studied the complexity of computing repairs and theexpressive power of relational queries over databases with integrity constraints; feasibility …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,18

Optimization of linear logic programs using counting methods,Sergio Greco; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract We present a general solution to the problem of optimized execution of logicprograms containing linear recursive rules. Our solution is based on extensions of theclassical counting method; which is known to be efficient but of limited applicability. In fact;the range of applicability of the counting method; and its variants proposed by previousresearchers; suffer from one or more of the following limitations: the method can be appliedonly when (1) the adorned program contains one recursive rule;(2) the 'left part'and the 'rightpart'of the recursive rule do not have any common variable and (3) the relation associatedwith the left part of the recursive rule is 'acyclic'. In this paper; a simple and unified frameworkis presented; where those limitations are removed; and the counting method thus becomeapplicable to all programs with linear rules. This framework also allows a simple …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1992,17
Weighted path queries on semistructured databases,Sergio Flesca; Filippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco,Abstract Path queries have been extensively used to query semistructured data; such as theWeb and XML documents. In this paper we introduce weighted path queries; an extension ofpath queries enabling several classes of optimization problems (such as the computation ofshortest paths) to be easily expressed. Weighted path queries are based on the notion ofweighted regular expression; ie; a regular expression whose symbols are associated to aweight. We characterize the problem of answering weighted path queries and provide analgorithm for computing their answer. We also show how weighted path queries can beeffectively embedded into query languages for XML data to express in a simple and compactform several meaningful research problems.,Information and Computation,2006,16

Such simplified types of set termsare much used in deductive database systems such as LDL. There are two main results:(a)the detailed complexity analysis of the problem by providing a formula for determining thenumber of matchers and (b) the invention of an optimal matching algorithm.

The pushdown method to optimize chain logic programs,Sergio Greco; Domenico Saccà; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract The critical problem of finding efficient implementations for recursive queries withbound arguments offers many open challenges of practical and theoretical import. Wepropose a novel approach that solves this problem for chain queries; ie; for queries wherebindings are propagated from arguments in the head to arguments in the tail of the rules; ina chain-like fashion. The method; called pushdown; is based on the fact that a chain querycan have associated a context-free language and a pushdown automaton recognizing thislanguage can be emulated by rewriting the query as a particular fectorized left-linearprogram. The proposed method generalizes and unifies previous techniques such as the'counting'and 'right-; left-; mixed-linear'methods. It also succeeds in reducing many non-linear programs to query-equivalent linear ones.,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,1995,16
On the termination of logic programs with function symbols,Sergio Greco; Francesca Spezzano; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract Recently there has been an increasing interest in the bottom-up evaluation of thesemantics of logic programs with complex terms. The main problem due to the presence offunctional symbols in the head of rules is that the corresponding ground program could beinfinite and that finiteness of models and termination of the evaluation procedure is notguaranteed. This paper introduces; by deeply analyzing program structure; new decidablecriteria; called safety and Gamma-acyclicity; for checking termination of logic programs withfunction symbols under bottom-up evaluation. These criteria guarantee that stable modelsare finite and computable; as it is possible to generate a finitely ground program equivalentto the source program. We compare new criteria with other decidable criteria known in theliterature and show that the Gamma-acyclicity criterion is the most general one.

Approximate probabilistic query answering over inconsistent databases,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro,Abstract The problem of managing and querying inconsistent databases has been deeplyinvestigated in the last few years. Most of the approaches proposed so far rely on the notionof repair (a minimal set of delete/insert operations making the database consistent) andconsistent query answer (the answer to a query is given by considering the set of'repaired'databases). Since the problem of consistent query answering is hard in the generalcase; most of the proposed techniques have an exponential complexity; although for specialclasses of constraints and queries the problem becomes polynomial. A second problem withmost of the proposed approaches is that repairs do not take into account update operations(they consider delete and insert operations only). This paper presents a general frameworkwhere constraints consist of functional dependencies and queries may be expressed by …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2008,15
NP Optimization Problems in Datalog.,Sergio Greco; Domenico Saccà,Abstract AfP optimization problems can be formulated as DATALOG" queries under totalstable model semantics using a max (or min) construct to select the model which maximizes(resp.; minimizes) the number of tuples in the answer relation. We prove that the sameexpressive power is achieved by a'disciplined'version of DATALOG"; called DATALOG""-'1;which uses stratified negation plus two additional types of'controlled'negation; that arehardwired into ad-hoc rules:(i) subset rule for performing a non-deterministic selection of asubset and (ii) shouldJje rule for enforcing constraints. The desired level of expressivenessfor a query can be incrementally achieved by a suitable usage of the above extensions—eg;if only subset rules are added to stratified negation then polynomial time execution as wellas the capability of expressing every polynomial-time query are guaranteed. Thus our …,ILPS,1997,15

The EIPeptiDi tool: enhancing peptide discovery in ICAT-based LC MS/MS experiments,Mario Cannataro; Giovanni Cuda; Marco Gaspari; Sergio Greco; Giuseppe Tradigo; Pierangelo Veltri,Isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) is a method for quantitative proteomics based ondifferential isotopic labeling; sample digestion and mass spectrometry (MS). The methodallows the identification and relative quantification of proteins present in two samples andconsists of the following phases. First; cysteine residues are either labeled using the ICATLight or ICAT Heavy reagent (having identical chemical properties but different masses).Then; after whole sample digestion; the labeled peptides are captured selectively using thebiotin tag contained in both ICAT reagents. Finally; the simplified peptide mixture is analyzedby nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Nevertheless;the ICAT LC-MS/MS method still suffers from insufficient sample-to-sample reproducibility onpeptide identification. In particular; the number and the type of peptides identified in …,BMC bioinformatics,2007,14
Optimization of bound disjunctive queries with constraints,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Irina Trubitsyna; Ester Zumpano,Abstract This paper presents a technique for the optimization of bound queries overdisjunctive deductive databases with constraints. The proposed approach is an extension ofthe well-known Magic-Set technique and is well-suited for being integrated in current bottom-up (stable) model inference engines. More specifically; it is based on the exploitation ofbinding propagation techniques which reduce the size of the data relevant to answer thequery and; consequently; reduces both the complexity of computing a single model and thenumber of models to be considered. The motivation of this work stems from the observationthat traditional binding propagation optimization techniques for bottom-up model generatorsystems; simulating the goal driven evaluation of top-down engines; are only suitable forpositive (disjunctive) queries; while hard problems are expressed using unstratified …,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,2005,14
Computing repairs for inconsistent databases,Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,The paper addresses the problem of managing inconsistencies derived from the integrationof multiple autonomous information sources. We propose a general framework forcomputing repairs and consistent answers over inconsistent databases; ie databases whichviolate integrity constraints. A repair for a database is a minimal set of insert and deleteoperations which makes the database consistent. In our framework different types of rulesdefining general integrity constraints; repair constraints (ie rules defining conditions on theinsertion or deletion of atoms) and prioritized constraints (ie rules defining priorities amongupdates and repairs) are considered. We propose a technique based on the rewriting ofconstraints into (prioritized) extended disjunctive rules with two different forms of negation(negation as failure and classical negation). The disjunctive program can be used for two …,Cooperative Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2001. CODAS 2001. The Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on,2001,14
Partially ordered regular languages for graph queries,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco,Abstract In this paper we present an extension of regular languages to support graphqueries. The proposed extension is based on the introduction of a partial order on the stringsof the languages. We extend regular expressions; regular grammars and finite stateautomata by introducing partial orders on strings; production rules and transitions;respectively. The relation among regular expressions; regular grammars and finite stateautomata is analyzed. We show how partially ordered languages can be used to define pathqueries to search graph databases and present results on their computational complexity.Finally; we present an application of partially ordered languages for searching the Web.,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,1999,14
``Possible is certain''is desirable and can be expressive,Sergio Greco; Domenico Saccà,Abstract The partial stable models of a logic program form a class of models that include the(unique) well-founded model; total stable models and other two interesting subclasses:maximal stable models and least undefined stable models. As stable models different fromthe well-founded are not unique; DATALOG queries do not in general correspond tofunctions. The question is: what are the expressive powers of the various types of stablemodels when they are restricted to the class of all functional queries? The paper shows thatthis power does not go in practice beyond the one of stratified queries; except for leastundefined stable models which; instead; capture the whole Boolean hierarchy BH. Finally; itis illustrated how the latter result can be used to design a``functional''language which; bymeans of a disciplined usage of negation; allows to achieve the desired level of …,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,1997,14
Combining inductive and deductive tools for data analysis,Sergio Greco; Elio Masciari; Luigi Pontieri,Abstract In this paper we propose the combined use of different methods to improve the dataanalysis process. This is obtained by combining inductive and deductive techniques. Wealso use different inductive techniques such as clustering algorithms; to derive data partition;and decision trees induction; characterizing classes in terms of logical rules. Inductivetechniques are used for generating hypotheses from data whereas deductive techniques areused to derive knowledge and to verify hypotheses. In order to guide users in the analysisprocess; we have developed a system which integrates deductive tools and data miningtools such as classification algorithms; features selection algorithms; visualization tools andtools to manipulate data sets easily. The system developed is currently used in a largeproject whose aim is the integration of information sources containing data concerning …,AI communications,2001,13
Bounded Programs: A New Decidable Class of Logic Programs with Function Symbols.,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract While function symbols are widely acknowledged as an important feature in logicprogramming; they make common inference tasks undecidable. To cope with this problem;recent research has focused on identifying classes of logic programs imposing restrictionson the use of function symbols; but guaranteeing decidability of common inference tasks.This has led to several criteria; called termination criteria; providing sufficient conditions for aprogram to have finitely many stable models; each of finite size. This paper introduces thenew class of bounded programs which guarantees the aforementioned property and strictlyincludes the classes of programs determined by current termination criteria. Different resultson the correctness; the expressiveness; and the complexity of the class of boundedprograms are presented.,IJCAI,2013,12
Polynomial time queries over inconsistent databases with functional dependencies and foreign keys,Cristian Molinaro; Sergio Greco,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of efficiently computing consistent answers toqueries over relational databases which may be inconsistent with respect to functionaldependencies and foreign key constraints. Since consistent query answers over inconsistentdatabases are obtained from repaired databases; we first present a repair strategy. Morespecifically; in this paper we consider particular sets of functional dependencies; calledcanonical; and a repair strategy whereby only tuple updates and insertions are allowed inorder to restore consistency: if foreign key constraints are violated; new tuples (possiblycontaining null values) are inserted into the database; whereas if functional dependencyviolations occur; tuple updates (possibly introducing unknown values; ie special symbolswhich can take values from a limited set of constants of the source database) are …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2010,12
atalog: A logic language for expressing search and optimization problems,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Irina Trubitsyna; Ester Zumpano,Abstract This paper presents a logic language for expressing search and optimizationproblems. Specifically; first a language obtained by extending (positive) DATALOG withintuitive and efficient constructs (namely; stratified negation; constraints; and exclusivedisjunction) is introduced. Next; a further restricted language only using a restricted form ofdisjunction to define (nondeterministically) subsets (or partitions) of relations is investigated.This language; called atalog; captures the power of DATALOG¬ in expressing search andoptimization problems. A system prototype implementing atalog is presented. The systemtranslates atalog queries into Optimization Programming Language (OPL) programs whichare executed by the ILOG OPL Development Studio.

Spatial tree logics to reason about semistructured data,Giovanni Conforti; Giorgio Ghelli; S Flesca; S Greco; D Saccà; E Zumpano,Abstract. The Ambient Logic is a modal logic proposed to describe the structural andcomputational properties of distributed and mobile computations. The static part of theAmbient Logic is; essentially; a spatial logic for unordered labeled trees; hence it turns out tobe a good foundation for expressing properties of tree-shaped data (ie semistructured dataand XML). The Tree Query Language (TQL) is a query language for semistructured databased on the Ambient Logic. TQL uses Ambient Logic formulas to express properties of datathat will be collected using a sort of pattern-matching mechanism. Reasoning aboutconstraints for semistructured Data and XML is an active branch of research and has severalapplications including query optimizations and data integration; it is crucial for validity; typeinference; and static type checking. Furthermore the interaction of schema and constraints …,language,2003,12
Optimization of Disjunctive Queries.,Sergio Greco,Abstract This paper presents a technique for the optimization of bound queries ondisjunctive deductive databases. The optimization is based on the rewriting of the sourceprogram into an equivalent program which can be evaluated more efficiently. The proposedoptimization reduces the size of the data relevant for the query and; consequently; greatlyreduces the number of models to be considered to answer the query. Several experimentshave confirmed the value of our technique.,ICLP,1999,12
Certain query answering in partially consistent databases,Sergio Greco; Fabian Pijcke; Jef Wijsen,Abstract A database is called uncertain if two or more tuples of the same relation are allowedto agree on their primary key. Intuitively; such tuples act as alternatives for each other. Arepair (or possible world) of such uncertain database is obtained by selecting a maximalnumber of tuples without ever selecting two tuples of the same relation that agree on theirprimary key. For a Boolean query q; the problem CERTAINTY (q) takes as input an uncertaindatabase db and asks whether q evaluates to true on every repair of db. In recent years; thecomplexity of CERTAINTY (q) has been studied under different restrictions on q. Thesecomplexity studies have assumed no restrictions on the uncertain databases that are input toCERTAINTY (q). In practice; however; it may be known that these input databases arepartially consistent; in the sense that they satisfy some dependencies (eg; functional …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,11
Logic programming with function symbols: Checking termination of bottom-up evaluation through program adornments,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in enhancing answer setsolvers by allowing function symbols. Since the introduction of function symbols makescommon inference tasks undecidable; research has focused on identifying classes ofprograms allowing only a restricted use of function symbols while ensuring decidability ofcommon inference tasks. Finitely-ground programs; introduced in Calimeri et al.(2008); areguaranteed to admit a finite number of stable models with each of them of finite size. Stablemodels of such programs can be computed and thus common inference tasks becomedecidable. Unfortunately; checking whether a program is finitely-ground is semi-decidable.This has led to several decidable criteria; called termination criteria; providing sufficientconditions for a program to be finitely-ground. This paper presents a new technique that …,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,2013,11
Word sense disambiguation for XML structure feature generation,Andrea Tagarelli; Mario Longo; Sergio Greco,Abstract A common limit of most existing methods that manage XML structure information isthat they do not handle the semantic meanings that might be associated to the markup tags.In this paper; we study how to map structure information available from XML elements intosemantically related concepts in order to support the generation of XML semantic features ofXML structural type. For this purpose; we define an unsupervised word sensedisambiguation method to select the most appropriate meaning for each elementcontextually to its respective XML path. The proposed approach exploits conceptualrelations provided by a lexical ontology such as WordNet and employs different notions ofsense relatedness. Experiments with data from various application domains are discussed;showing that our approach can be effectively used to generate structural semantic …,European Semantic Web Conference,2009,11
A stochastic approach for modeling and computing web communities,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,In the last few years; a lot of research has been devoted to developing new techniques forimproving the recall and precision of current Web search engines. Few works deal with theinteresting problem of identifying the communities to which pages belong. Most previousapproaches tried to cluster data by means of spectral techniques or traditional hierarchicalalgorithms. The main problem with these techniques is that they ignore the fact that Webcommunities are social networks with distinctive statistical properties. We analyze Webcommunities on the basis of the evolution of an initial set of hubs and authoritative pages.The evolution law captures the behaviour of page authors with respect to the popularity ofexisting pages for topics of interest. Assuming such a model; we have found interestingproperties of Web communities and have proposed a technique for computing relevant …,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2002. WISE 2002.

XGL: a graphical query language for XML,Sergio Flesca; E Furfaro; Sergio Greco,In this paper we present a graphical query language for XML. The language; based on asimple form of graph grammars; permits us to extract data and reorganize information in anew structure. As with most of the current query languages for XML; queries consist of twoparts: one extracting a sub-graph and one constructing the output graph. The semantics ofqueries is given in terms of graph grammars. The use of graph grammars makes it possibleto define; in a simple way; the structural properties of both the subgraph that has to beextracted and the graph that has to be constructed. By means of examples; we show theeffectiveness and simplicity of our approach.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2002. Proceedings. International,2002,11
Binding propagation in disjunctive databases,Sergio Greco,Abstract In this paper we present a technique for the propagation of bindings into disjunctivedeductive databases. The optimization is based on the rewriting of the source program into aprogram which is equivalent to the original one under the possible semantics. In particular;the rewriting technique generates a program which is disjunctive with nested rules in thehead; ie; elements in the head may also be (special) rules. The proposed optimizationreduces the size of the data relevant to answer the query and; consequently;(i) reduces thecomplexity of computing a single model and; more importantly;(ii) greatly,VLDB,1998,11
Optimal unification of bound simple set-terms,Sergio Greco,Abstract This paper is concerned with the problem of unification of bounded simple setterms; ie; terms of the form {e~;...; en}; where e; is a constant or a variable. Such simplifiedtypes of set terms are used in many application areas such as databases and logicprogramming. We present a precise formalization of the problem through the identification ofa hierarchy of subproblems and establish the exact output size of the problem and its specialcases by providing formulas for determining the number of unifiers. We present also the firsttwo phases on an optimal (five phases) unification algorithm.,Proceedings of the fifth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1996,11
Detecting decidable classes of finitely ground logic programs with function symbols,Marco Calautti; Sergio Greco; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract In this paper we propose a new technique for checking whether the bottom-upevaluation of logic programs with function symbols terminates. The technique is based onthe definition of mappings from arguments to strings of function symbols; representingpossible values which could be taken by arguments during the bottom-up evaluation. Suchmappings can be computed by transforming the original program into a unary logic programwhose termination is decidable. Starting from mappings we can identify mapping-restrictedarguments; a subset of limited arguments; that is; arguments which can take values fromfinite domains. The class of mapping-restricted programs; consisting of programs whosearguments are mapping-restricted; is terminating under the bottom-up computation as all itsarguments can take values from finite domains. We study the complexity of the presented …,Proceedings of the 15th Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming,2013,10
A three-valued semantics for querying and repairing inconsistent databases,Filippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro,Abstract The problem of managing and querying inconsistent databases has been deeplyinvestigated in the last few years. As the problem of consistent query answering is hard inthe general case; most of the techniques proposed so far have an exponential complexity.Polynomial techniques have been proposed only for restricted forms of constraints (such asfunctional dependencies) and queries. In this paper; a technique for computing“approximate” consistent answers in polynomial time is proposed; which works in thepresence of a wide class of constraints (namely; full constraints) and Datalog queries. Theproposed approach is based on a repairing strategy where update operations assigning anundefined truth value to the “reliability” of tuples are allowed; along with updates inserting ordeleting tuples. The result of a repair can be viewed as a three-valued database which …,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2007,10
Clustering transactional XML data with semantically-enriched content and structural features,Andrea Tagarelli; Sergio Greco,Abstract We address the problem of clustering XML data according to semantically-enrichedfeatures extracted by analyzing content and structural specifics in the data. Content featuresare selected from the textual contents of XML elements; while structure features areextracted from XML tag paths on the basis of ontological knowledge. Moreover; we conceivea transactional model for representing sets of semantically cohesive XML structures; andexploit such a model to effectively and efficiently cluster XML data. The resulting clusteringframework was successfully tested on some collections extracted from the DBLP XMLarchive.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2004,10
Non-invasive support for personalized navigation of Websites,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco; Andrea Tagarelli; Ester Zumpano,The growing availability of information on the Web has raised a challenging problem: can aWeb-based information system tailor itself to different user requirements with the ultimategoal of personalizing and improving the user's experience in accessing the contents of aWeb site? This work proposes a new strategy for Web site personalization based on theexploitation of both user browsing interests and content similarities among Web pages. Theoutcome is the delivery of page recommendations which are strictly related to visitors'navigational purposes and their actual location within the hyperspace of the Web site. Ourapproach has been effectively used for developing a non-invasive system which allows Webusers to navigate through potentially interesting pages without having a basic knowledge ofthe structure of a Web site.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2004.

Minimal founded semantics for disjunctive logic programming,Sergio Greco,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new semantics for disjunctive logic programming anddeductive databases. The semantics; called minimal founded; generalizes stable modelsemantics for normal (ie non disjunctive) programs but differs from disjunctive stable modelsemantics (the extension of stable model semantics for disjunctive programs). Comparedwith disjunctive stable model semantics; the minimal founded semantics seems to be; insome case; more intuitive; it gives meaning to programs which are meaningless understable model semantics and it is not harder to compute. We study the expressive power ofthe semantics and show that for general disjunctive datalog programs it has the same powerof disjunctive stable model semantics. We also present a variation of the minimal foundedsemantics; called strongly founded which on stratified programs coincide with the perfect …,International Conference on Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning,1999,10
Extending datalog with arrays,Sergio Greco; Luigi Palopoli; Eugenio Spadafora,Abstract In this paper the problem of extending the logic database language Datalog withprimitives to support array definitions and manipulations is addressed. The syntax and thesemantics of this language; called Datalog A; are given by showing that model theoreticproperties of ordinary Datalog extend to Datalog A.

Collaborative clustering of XML documents,Sergio Greco; Francesco Gullo; Giovanni Ponti; Andrea Tagarelli,Abstract Clustering XML documents is extensively used to organize large collections of XMLdocuments in groups that are coherent according to structure and/or content features. Thegrowing availability of distributed XML sources and the variety of high-demandenvironments raise the need for clustering approaches that can exploit distributedprocessing techniques. Nevertheless; existing methods for clustering XML documents aredesigned to work in a centralized way. In this paper; we address the problem of clusteringXML documents in a collaborative distributed framework. XML documents are firstdecomposed based on semantically cohesive subtrees; then modeled as transactional datathat embed both XML structure and content information. The proposed clustering frameworkemploys a centroid-based partitional clustering method that has been developed for a …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2011,9

The language; basedon a simple form of graph grammars; permits us to extract data and reorganize information ina new structure. As with most of the current query languages for XML; queries consist of twoparts: one extracting a subgraph and one constructing the output graph. The semantics ofqueries is given in terms of graph grammars. The use of graph grammars makes it possibleto define; in a simple way; the structural properties of both the subgraph that has to beextracted and the graph that has to be constructed.

Declarative semantics for active rules,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco,Abstract In this paper we analyze declarative deterministic and non-deterministic semanticsfor active rules. In particular; we consider several (partial) stable model semantics;previously defined for deductive rules; such as well-founded; max deterministic; unique totalstable model; total stable model and maximal stable model semantics. The semantics of anactive program [Ascr][Pscr] is given by first rewriting it into a deductive program [Lscr][Pscr];then computing a model M defining the declarative semantics of [Lscr][Pscr] and; finally;applying 'consistent'updates contained in M to the source database. The framework wepropose permits a natural integration of deductive and active rules and can also be appliedto queries with function symbols or to queries over infinite databases.,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,2001,9
Grammars and automata to optimize chain logic queries,Sergio Greco; Domenico Sacca; Carlo Zaniolo,The critical problem of finding efficient implementations for recursive queries with boundarguments offers many open challenges of practical and theoretical import. In particular;there is a need to find methods that are effective for the general case; such as non-linearprograms; as well as for specialized cases; such as left-recursive linear programs. In thispaper; we propose a novel approach that solves this problem for chain queries; ie; forqueries where bindings are propagated from arguments in the head to arguments in the tailof the rules; in a chain-like fashion. The method; called pushdown method; is based on thefact that a chain query can have associated a context-free language and a pushdownautomaton recognizing this language can be emulated by rewriting the query as a particularfactorized left-linear program. The proposed method generalizes and unifies previous …,International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science,1999,9

Combining Existential Rules with the Power of CP-Theories.,Tommaso Di Noia; Thomas Lukasiewicz; Maria Vanina Martinez; Gerardo I Simari; Oana Tifrea-Marciuska,Abstract The tastes of a user can be represented in a natural way by using qualitativepreferences. In this paper; we explore how ontological knowledge expressed via existentialrules can be combined with CP-theories to (i) represent qualitative preferences along withdomain knowledge; and (ii) perform preference-based answering of conjunctive queries(CQs). We call these combinations ontological CP-theories (OCP-theories). We defineskyline and k-rank answers to CQs based on the user's preferences encoded in an OCP-theory; and provide an algorithm for computing them. We also provide precise complexity(including data tractability) results for deciding consistency; dominance; and CQ skylinemembership for OCP-theories.,IJCAI,2015,8
NP Datalog: a logic language for NP search and optimization queries,Sergio Greco; Irina Trubitsyna; Ester Zumpano,This paper presents a logic language; called NP Datalog for NP search and optimizationproblems. The'search'language extends stratified Datalog with constraints and partition rulesdefining (nondeterministically) partition of relations. NP optimization problems are thenformulated by adding a max (or min) construct to select the solution (stable model) whichmaximizes (resp.; minimizes) the result of a polynomial function applied to the answerrelation. We show that NP Datalog queries can be easily evaluated by translating them intoILOG programs which are next solved by means of the ILOG OPL Studio suite. To prove theeffectiveness of our proposal; we have implemented a module; written in Sicstus Prolog;which takes in input a NP Datalog query and outputs an equivalent ILOG program.

Repairing inconsistent xml data with functional dependencies,Sergio Flesca; Fillippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract The World Wide Web is of strategic importance as a global repository forinformation and a means of communicating and sharing knowledge. Its explosive growthhas caused deep changes in all the aspects of human life; has been a driving force for thedevelopment of modern applications (eg; Web portals; digital libraries; wrapper generators;etc.); and has greatly simplified the access to existing sources of information; ranging fromtraditional DBMS to semi-structured Web repositories. The adoption by the WWW consortium(W3C) of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) as the new standard for information exchangeamong Web applications has led researchers to investigate classical problems in the newenvironment of repositories containing large amounts of data in XML format.,*,2005,8
Pushing extrema aggregates to optimize logic queries,Filippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco; Sumit Ganguly; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract In this paper; we explore the possibility of transforming queries with minimum andmaximum predicates into equivalent queries that can be computed more efficiently. Themain contribution of the paper is an algorithm for propagating min and max predicates whilepreserving query equivalence under certain monotonicity constraints. We show that thealgorithm is correct and that the transformed query is often safe when the original one is not.Although in this paper we use logic rules; the technique presented can be used to optimize(possibly recursive) queries expressed using SQL3.,Information Systems,2002,8
Extending stratified datalog to capture complexity classes ranging from ${\cal P} to {\cal QH} $,Sergio Greco; Domenico Sacca; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract. This paper presents a unified solution to the problem of extending stratifiedDATALOG to express database complexity classes ranging from \calPto\calQH;\calQH is thequery hierarchy containing the decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time by adeterministic Turing machine using a constant number of calls to an \calNP-oracle. Thesolution is based on (i) stratified negation as the core of a simple; declarative semantics fornegation;(ii) the use of a “choice” construct to capture the nondeterminism of stable modelsin a disciplined fashion;(iii) the ability to bind a query to the lowest complexity level thatincludes the problem at hand; and (iv) a general algorithm that adapts its behavior to thedesired level of complexity required by the query so that exponential time computation isonly required for hard problems.,Acta Informatica,2001,8
Checking chase termination: Cyclicity analysis and rewriting techniques,Sergio Greco; Francesca Spezzano; Irina Trubitsyna,The aim of this paper is to present more general criteria and techniques for chasetermination. We first present extensions of the well-known stratification criterion andintroduce a new criterion; called local stratification; which generalizes both super-weakacyclicity and stratification-based criteria (including the class of constraints which areinductively restricted). Next; the paper presents a rewriting algorithm transforming theoriginal set of constraints Σ into an “equivalent” set Σ α and verifying the structural propertiesfor chase termination on Σ α. The rewriting of constraints allows us to recognize largerclasses of constraints for which chase termination is guaranteed. In particular; we show thatif Σ satisfies chase termination conditions T; then the rewritten set Σ α satisfies T as well; butthe vice versa is not true; that is there are significant classes of constraints for which Σ α …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,7
Deterministic semantics for datalog⌝: complexity and expressive power,Sergio Greco; Domenico Saccà,Abstract Deterministic models are (partial) stable models which are not contradicted by anyother stable model; ie; M is a deterministic model if there is no stable model N such that M∪N is not an interpretation. For instance; the well-founded model; which coincides with theintersection of all partial stable models; is a deterministic model. As the well-founded modelis deterministic and unique for each program; well-founded model semantics has beenproposed as the canonical deterministic semantics for partial stable models. But the well-founded model is not the unique deterministic model; indeed the family of deterministic(partial stable) models is not in general a singleton and admits a minimum (the well-foundedmodel) and a maximum; the max-deterministic model. This model is another candidate for adeterministic semantics. The aim of this paper is to study the complexity and the …,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1997,7
Datalog with nested rules,Sergio Greco; Nicola Leone; Francesco Scarcello,Abstract This paper presents an extension of disjunctive datalog (Datalog∀) by nestedrules. Nested rules are (disjunctive) rules where elements of the head may be also rules.Nested rules increase the knowledge representation power of Datalog∀ both from atheoretical and from a practical viewpoint. A number of examples show that nested rulesallow to naturally model several real world situations that cannot be represented inDatalog∀. An in depth analysis of complexity and expressive power of the language showsthat nested rules do increase the expressiveness of Datalog∀ without implying any increasein its computational complexity.,International Workshop on Logic Programming and Knowledge Representation,1997,7
Complex-Prolog: A logic database language for handling complex objects,Sergio Greco; Pasquale Rullo,Abstract The logic language paradigm represents a natural extension of relationaldatabases. However; one of its limitations is the lack of suitable data abstractionmechanisms for modeling complex objects. This paper describes Complex-Prolog; a logicdatabase language that provides facilities for data abstraction; notably; the notions of objectidentity; class and inheritance. This language was designed as an attempt to integrateconcepts from logic programming and semantic data models. A formal definition of Complex-Prolog; interspersed with a number of examples; is given. The paper concludes with adescription of its implementation.,Information Systems,1989,7

On the semantics of logic programs with preferences,Sergio Greco; Irina Trubitsyna; Ester Zumpano,Abstract This work is a contribution to prioritized reasoning in logic programming in thepresence of preference relations involving atoms. The technique; providing a newinterpretation for prioritized logic programs; is inspired by the semantics of Prioritized LogicProgramming and enriched with the use of structural information of preference of Answer SetOptimization Programming. Specifically; the analysis of the logic program is carried outtogether with the analysis of preferences in order to determine the choice order and the setsof comparable models. The new semantics is compared with other approaches known in theliterature and complexity analysis is also performed; showing that; with respect to othersimilar approaches previously proposed; the complexity of computing preferred stablemodels does not increase.,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,2007,6
Effective and efficient similarity search in time series,Sergio Greco; Massimiliano Ruffolo; Andrea Tagarelli,Abstract We present DSA-Derivative time series Segment Approximation; a novelrepresentation model for time series designed for effective and efficient similarity search.DSA substantially exploits derivative estimation; segmentation and dimensionality reductionto meet at least the requirements of high sensitivity to main features (trends) of time seriesand robustness to outliers. Experiments show that DSA is drastically faster and still as goodor better than the prominent state-of-the-art similarity methods.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,6
Combining linear programming and clustering techniques for the classification of research centers,Andrea Tagarelli; Irina Trubitsyna; Sergio Greco,Abstract We propose a novel approach that combines data mining and linear programmingtechniques for classifying organizational units; such as research centers. We show how ourproposal of clustering organizational units based on both efficiency and input/outputparameters turns out to be effective in identifying groups of similar organizational units. Wealso propose the replacement of an expensive efficiency measurement; based on thesolution of linear programs; with a simple but more efficient formula to be exploited in theclustering process. Preliminary experimental results; obtained from an analysis of researchcenters in the agro‐food sector; show the effectiveness of our approach.,AI Communications,2004,6
Modeling and querying XML-data,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,The authors discuss data models and query languages for XML data. They propose a datamodel; called XDT; which takes care of the structural features of XML data. XDT representsXML data by means of labeled oriented graphs. With respect to other previously proposedmodels; XDT handles links definable in both XML and XLL. Queries are made through anSQL-like language which uses weighted path queries; ie path queries based on weightedregular languages and gives; as a result; a set of pairs (node/weight) where node isan'element'of an XML document and weight gives information about the relevance of thenode.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2000 International,2000,6
Complexity and Expressive Power of Deterministic Semantics for DATALOG¬,Sergio Greco; Domenico Saccà,Abstract Deterministic models are (partial) stable models which are not contradicted by anyother stable model; ie; M is a deterministic model if there is no stable model N such that M∪N is not an interpretation. For instanced the well-founded model; which coincides with theintersection of all partial stable models; is a deterministic model. As the well-founded modelis deterministic and unique for each program; well-founded model semantics has beenproposed as the canonical deterministic semantics for partial stable models. But the well-founded model is not the unique deterministic model; indeed the family of deterministic(partial stable) models is not; in general; a singleton and admits a minimum (the well-founded model) and a maximum; the max-deterministic model. The latter model is; anothercandidate for a deterministic semantics. The aim of this paper is to study the complexity …,Information and Computation,1999,6
Incremental computation of deterministic extensions for dynamic argumentation frameworks,Sergio Greco; Francesco Parisi,Abstract We address the problem of efficiently recomputing the extensions of abstractargumentation frameworks (AFs) which are updated by adding/deleting arguments orattacks. In particular; after identifying some properties that hold for updates of AFs underseveral well-known semantics; we focus on the two most popular 'deterministic'semantics(namely; grounded and ideal) and present two algorithms for their incremental computation;well-suited to dynamic applications where updates to an initial AF are frequently performedto take into account new available knowledge. We experimentally validated the proposedapproach.,European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence,2016,5
Efficient maintenance of all-pairs shortest distances,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Chiara Pulice,Abstract Computing shortest distances is a central task in many graph applications. Since itis impractical to recompute shortest distances from scratch every time the graph changes;many algorithms have been proposed to incrementally maintain shortest distances afteredge deletions or insertions. In this paper; we address the problem of maintaining all-pairsshortest distances in dynamic graphs and propose novel efficient incremental algorithms;working both in main memory and on disk. We prove their correctness and providecomplexity analyses. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that current main-memory algorithms become soon impractical; disk-based ones are needed for largergraphs; and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2016,5
Exploiting equality generating dependencies in checking chase termination,Marco Calautti; Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract The chase is a well-known algorithm with a wide range of applications in dataexchange; data cleaning; data integration; query optimization; and ontological reasoning.Since the chase evaluation might not terminate and it is undecidable whether it terminates;the problem of defining (decidable) sufficient conditions ensuring termination has received agreat deal of interest in recent years. In this regard; several termination criteria have beenproposed. One of the main weaknesses of current approaches is the limited analysis theyperform on equality generating dependencies (EGDs). In this paper; we propose sufficientconditions ensuring that a set of dependencies has at least one terminating chasesequence. We propose novel criteria which are able to perform a more accurate analysis ofEGDs. Specifically; we propose a new stratification criterion and an adornment algorithm …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,5
Checking termination of bottom-up evaluation of logic programs with function symbols,Marco Calautti; Sergio Greco; Francesca Spezzano; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract Recently; there has been an increasing interest in the bottom-up evaluation of thesemantics of logic programs with complex terms. The presence of function symbols in theprogram may render the ground instantiation infinite; and finiteness of models andtermination of the evaluation procedure; in the general case; are not guaranteed anymore.Since the program termination problem is undecidable in the general case; severaldecidable criteria (called program termination criteria) have been recently proposed.However; current conditions are not able to identify even simple programs; whose bottom-upexecution always terminates. The paper introduces new decidable criteria for checkingtermination of logic programs with function symbols under bottom-up evaluation; by deeplyanalyzing the program structure. First; we analyze the propagation of complex terms …,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,2015,5
Checking termination of logic programs with function symbols through linear constraints,Marco Calautti; Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract Enriching answer set programming with function symbols makes modeling easier;increases the expressive power; and allows us to deal with infinite domains. However; thiscomes at a cost: common inference tasks become undecidable. To cope with this issue;recent research has focused on finding trade-offs between expressivity and decidability byidentifying classes of logic programs that impose limitations on the use of function symbolsbut guarantee decidability of common inference tasks. Despite the significant body of work inthis area; current approaches do not include many simple practical programs whoseevaluation terminates. In this paper; we present the novel class of rule-bounded programs.While current techniques perform a limited analysis of how terms are propagated from anindividual argument to another; our technique is able to perform a more global analysis …,International Workshop on Rules and Rule Markup Languages for the Semantic Web,2014,5
Preferred generalized answers for inconsistent databases,Luciano Caroprese; Sergio Greco; Irina Trubitsyna; Ester Zumpano,Abstract The aim of this paper consists in investigating the problem of managing inconsistentdatabases; ie databases violating integrity constraints. A flurry of research on this topic hasshown that the presence of inconsistent data can be resolved by “repairing” the database; ieby providing a computational mechanism that ensures obtaining consistent “scenarios” ofthe information or by consistently answer to queries posed on an inconsistent set of data.This paper considers preferences among repairs and possible answers by introducing apartial order among them on the basis of some preference criteria. Moreover; the paper alsoextends the notion of preferred consistent answer by extracting from a set of preferredrepaired database; the maximal consistent overlapping portion of the information; ie theinformation supported by each preferred repaired database.,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2006,5
On the semantics and expressive power of Datalog-like languages for NP search and optimization problems,Ester Zumpano; Sergio Greco; Irina Trubitsyna; Pierangelo Veltri,Abstract It has been shown that NP (decision; search and optimization) problems can beexpressed by means of DATALOG (Datalog with unstratified negation) queries under stablemodel semantics. Anyhow; the use of unrestricted negation is often neither simple norintuitive and; besides; DATALOG does not allow to optimize queries and to discipline theexpressive power. This paper analyzes the power of Datalog-like languages in expressingNP search and optimization problems. In more detail; in this paper we study the expressivepower of several languages obtained by extending positive DATALOG with intuitive andefficient constructs; ie stratified negation; constraints and (exclusive) disjunction. Finally; weinvestigate a further restricted language; called NP Datalog; which uses disjunction only todefine (nondeterministically) partitions of relations and which; in addition; captures the …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2004,5
Minimal founded semantics for disjunctive logic programs and deductive databases,Filippo Furfaro; Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco,Abstract: In this paper; we propose a variant of stable model semantics for disjunctive logicprogramming and deductive databases. The semantics; called minimal founded;generalizes stable model semantics for normal (ie non disjunctive) programs but differs fromdisjunctive stable model semantics (the extension of stable model semantics for disjunctiveprograms). Compared with disjunctive stable model semantics; minimal founded semanticsseems to be more intuitive; it gives meaning to programs which are meaningless understable model semantics and is no harder to compute. More specifically; minimal foundedsemantics differs from stable model semantics only for disjunctive programs havingconstraint rules or rules working as constraints. We study the expressive power of thesemantics and show that for general disjunctive datalog programs it has the same power …,arXiv preprint cs/0312028,2003,5
Repairing and Querying Inconsistent Databases.,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,ABSTRACT The integration of knowledge from multiple sources is an important aspect inseveral areas such as data warehousing; database integration; automated reasoningsystems; active reactive databases and others. Thus a central topic in databases is theconstruction of integration systems; designed for retrieving and querying uniform data storedin multiple information sources. This chapter illustrates recent techniques for computingrepairs as well as consistent answers over inconsistent databases. Often databases maybeinconsistent with respect to a set of integrity constraints; that is; one or more integrityconstraints are not satisfied. Most of the techniques for computing repairs and queries overinconsistent databases work for restricted cases and only recently there have beenproposals to consider more general constraints. In this chapter we give an informal …,*,2003,5
Search and optimization problems in datalog,Sergio Greco; Domenico Saccà,Abstract This paper analyzes the ability of DATALOG languages to express search andoptimization problems. It is first shown that NP search problems can be formulated asunstratified DATALOG queries under non-deterministic stable model semantics so that eachstable model corresponds to a possible solution. NP optimization problems are thenformulated by adding a max (or min) construct to select the stable model (thus; the solution)which maximizes (resp.; minimizes) the result of a polynomial function applied to the answerrelation. In order to enable a simpler and more intuitive formulation for search andoptimization problems; it is introduced a DATALOG language in which the use of stablemodel semantics is disciplined to refrain from abstruse forms of unstratified negation. Thecore of our language is stratified negation extended with two constructs allowing …,*,2002,5
A hybrid technique for data mining on balance-sheet data,Giuseppe Dattilo; Sergio Greco; Elio Masciari; Luigi Pontieri,Abstract Recent rapid growth in the ability to generate and store data by more powerfulDatabase Management Systems and hardware architecture; leads to a question: how canwe take advantage of this large amount of information? Traditional methods for querying andreporting are inadequate because they can only manipulate data and the informationcontent derived is very low. Obtaining new relationships among data and new hypothesesabout them is the aim of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) which makes use ofData Mining techniques. These techniques have interesting applications for business datasuch as market basket analysis; financial resource planning; fraud detection and thescheduling of production processes. In this work we consider the application of Data Miningtechniques for the analysis of the balance-sheets of Italian companies.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2000,5
Non-determinism and weak constraints in datalog,Sergio Greco,Abstract This paper introduces a simple and powerful extension of stratified DATALOGwhich permits to express various DB-complexity classes. The new language; calledDATALOG¬ s; c; p; extends DATALOG with stratified negation; a non-deterministic construct;called choice; and a weak form of constraints; called preference rules; that is; constraints thatshould be respected but; if they cannot be eventually enforced; they only invalidate theportions of the program which they are concerned with. Although DATALOG with stratifiednegation is not able to express all polynomial time queries; 20) the introduction of the non-deterministic construct choice permits to express; exactly; the 'deterministic fragment'of theclass of DB-queries P; under the non-deterministic semantics; NP; under the possiblesemantics; and co NP; under the certain semantics.

The expressive power of unique total stable model semantics,Francesco Buccafurri; Sergio Greco; Domenico Saccà,Abstract This paper investigates the expressive power of DATALOG¬ queries under uniqueT-stable model semantics; ie; a query on a given database yields an answer if and only ifthere exists a unique T-stable model. Under this semantics DATALOG¬ queries are shownto express exactly all decision problems with unique solutions. Obviously; unique T-stablemodel semantics is the 'natural'semantics for queries with at most one T-stable model or withexactly one T-stable model for every database. The expressive powers of of these twoclasses of queries are investigated as well but it turns out that any practical language forsuch queries cannot get to an expressive power higher than DATALOG with stratifiednegation.,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,1997,5
Geomedica: managing and querying clinical data distributions on geographical database systems,Giuseppe Tradigo; Pierangelo Veltri; Sergio Greco,Abstract Geographical databases are a significant and mature tool; useful in manyapplication areas thanks to the spread of new positioning and mapping technologies.Geographical functionalities can be added to existing applications; from land managementto water and electricity control systems. The use of geographical information applicationsgreatly improves data interpretation; thus helping users in making better decisions. Furtherimprovements can be obtained by using more sophisticated tools (eg On Line AnalyticalProcessing and Data Mining techniques) to highlight interesting and previously unknownrelations on spatio-temporal data; which can help in a better understanding of data.

Prioritized active integrity constraints for database maintenance,Luciano Caroprese; Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro,Abstract The paper presents a logic framework wherein constraints and preferences areused for database maintenance and querying. Our proposal is based on the use of a specialtype of integrity constraints (called Prioritized Active Integrity Constraints (PAICs)); whosebody defines a constraint on data; whereas the head contains a set of partially orderedactions; which should be performed; if the body constraint is not satisfied; to make consistentthe database. Therefore; a preference relation among repairs is introduced on the base ofthe (partially ordered) actions specified in the head of PAICs. On the base of the preferencerelation a set of preferred repairs is identified and preferred answers are derived from thedatabase instances which have been made consistent by means of preferred repairs. Thepaper shows that databases with universal prioritized constraints admit (preferred) repairs …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,4
A probabilistic approach for discovering authoritative Web pages,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,The World Wide Web (WWW) is becoming the most important system for deliveringinformation. Search services on the WWW are becoming increasing popular among usersbecause of the huge amount of data available and consequently it is difficult to retrieve andfilter it. Several works have argued that traditional term-based search engines are not veryuseful since the resulting ranking depends on the precision of the user in expressing thequery. However; usually; users are unclear about the information they need and so they donot give much thought to query formulation. Moreover; if the query pertains to topics whichare abundant on the Web; search services become unusable because of the huge numberof pages obtained. For instance; at the time of this work; AltaVista returned more than18;000;000 pages in reply to the query asking for the documents related to the word" java …,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2001.

Controversy in Trust Networks,Paolo Zicari; Roberto Interdonato; Diego Perna; Andrea Tagarelli; Sergio Greco,Abstract Given the increasing volume and impact of online social interactions in variousaspects of life; inferring how a user should be trusted becomes a matter of crucialimportance; which can strongly bias any decision process. Existing trust inferencealgorithms are based on the propagation and aggregation of trust values. However; trustopinions are subjective and can be very different from one user to another. Consequently;inferred trust values can lose significance or even be unavailable if there is a strongdisagreement among the original values. In this work; we discuss the trust controversyproblem. We analyze to what extent existing trust inference algorithms are robust withrespect to controversial situations; and propose a novel trust controversy measure to supporttrust inference in controversial cases.

Datalog and logic databases,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro,Abstract The use of logic in databases started in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s Coddformalized databases in terms of the relational calculus and the relational algebra. A majorinfluence on the use of logic in databases was the development of the field of logicprogramming. Logic provides a convenient formalism for studying classical databaseproblems and has the important property of being declarative; that is; it allows one toexpress what she wants rather than how to get it. For a long time; relational calculus andalgebra were considered the relational database languages. However; there are simpleoperations; such as computing the transitive closure of a graph; which cannot be expressedwith these languages. Datalog is a declarative query language for relational databasesbased on the logic programming paradigm. One of the peculiarities that distinguishes …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2015,3

Probabilistic query answering over inconsistent databases,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro,Abstract This paper presents a framework for querying inconsistent databases in thepresence of functional dependencies. Most of the works dealing with the problem ofextracting reliable information from inconsistent databases are based on the notion of repair;a minimal set of tuple insertions and deletions which leads the database to a consistent state(called repaired database); and the notion of consistent query answer; a query answer thatcan be obtained from every repaired database. In this work; both the notion of repair andquery answer differ from the original ones. In the presence of functional dependencies; tupledeletions are the only operations that are performed in order to restore the consistency of aninconsistent database. However; deleting a tuple to remove an integrity violation potentiallyeliminates useful information in that tuple. In order to cope with this problem; we adopt a …,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2012,3

A graph grammars based framework for querying graph-like data,Sergio Flesca; Filippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco,Abstract The widespread use of graph-based models for representing data collections (egobject-oriented data; XML data; etc.) has stimulated the database research community toinvestigate the problem of defining declarative languages for querying graph-like databases.In this paper; a new framework for querying graph-like data based on graph grammars isproposed. The new paradigm allows us to verify structural properties of graphs and to extractsub-graphs. More specifically; a new form of query (namely graph query) is proposed;consisting in a particular graph grammar which defines a class of graphs to be matched onthe graph representing the database. Thus; differently from path queries; the answer of agraph query is not just a set of nodes; but a subgraph; extracted from the input graph; whichsatisfies the structural properties defined by the graph grammar.

On the rewriting and efficient computation of bound disjunctive datalog queries,Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract In this paper we present a technique for the optimization of bound queries overdisjunctive deductive databases with constraints. The proposed approach consists of twodistinct phases: i) the rewriting of queries for propagating bindings from the query goal intothe program; and ii) the use of specialized algorithms computing rewritten queries. Therewriting of queries is based on the exploitation of a binding propagation technique whichreduces the size of the data relevant to answer the query and; consequently; minimizes boththe complexity of computing a single model and the whole number of models to beconsidered. As for general queries the rewriting technique does not ensure soundness; wepresent two sound and complete algorithms computing rewritten queries under brave andcautious reasoning.

Query optimization of disjunctive databases with constraints through binding propagation,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Irina Trubtsyna; Ester Zumpano,Abstract In this paper we present a technique for the optimization of bound queries overdisjunctive deductive databases with constraints; ie rules defining properties which have tobe satisfied by all instances over database schema. The technique we propose; allows thebinding propagation into disjunctive queries with a set of constraints; thus; reducing the sizeof the data relevant to answer the query it; consequently; minimizes both the complexity ofcomputing a single model and the whole number of models to be considered. The maincontribution of this work consists in the extension of previous techniques by consideringDatalog programs with both disjunctive heads and constraints. In particular; by consideringweak constraints the technique is also suitable for dealing with optimization problems.Several experiments have confirmed the value of the technique.,International Conference on Logic for Programming Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning,2002,3
Rewriting queries using views,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco,Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of answering queries using materializedviews in the presence of negative goals. The solution is carried out by 'inverting'views andderiving both positive and negative knowledge. In order to derive negative knowledge weinvert conjunctive views with negation into a set of (extended) views which may also have; inaddition to negation-as-failure; a different form of negation called classical (or strong)negation. Finally; we analyze the problem of inferring knowledge from views based onrelations with functional dependencies.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1999,3

The expressive power of “possible-is-certain” semantics,Sergio Greco; Domenico Saccà,Abstract The partial stable models of a logic program form a class of models that include the(unique) well-founded model; total stable models and other two interesting subclasses:maximal stable models and least undefined stable models. As stable models different fromthe wellfounded are not unique; DATALOG¬ queries do not in general correspond tofunctions. The question is: what is the expressive powers of the various types of stablemodels when they are restricted to the class of all functional queries? The paper shows thatthis power does not go in practice beyond the one of stratified queries; except for leastundefined stable models which; instead; capture the whole boolean hierarchy B H. Finally; itis illustrated how the latter result can be used to design a” functional” language which; bymeans of a disciplined usage of negation; allows to achieve the desired level of …,Annual Asian Computing Science Conference,1996,3

Using linear constraints for logic program termination analysis,Marco Calautti; Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract It is widely acknowledged that function symbols are an important feature in answerset programming; as they make modelling easier; increase the expressive power; and allowus to deal with infinite domains. The main issue with their introduction is that the evaluationof a program might not terminate and checking whether it terminates or not is undecidable.To cope with this problem; several classes of logic programs have been proposed where theuse of function symbols is restricted but the program evaluation termination is guaranteed.Despite the significant body of work in this area; current approaches do not include manysimple practical programs whose evaluation terminates.

Logic Program Termination Analysis Using Atom Sizes.,Marco Calautti; Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Irina Trubitsyna; Universita della Calabria DIMES,Abstract Recent years have witnessed a great deal of interest in extending answer setprogramming with function symbols. Since the evaluation of a program with function symbolsmight not terminate and checking termination is undecidable; several classes of logicprograms have been proposed where the use of function symbols is limited but the programevaluation is guaranteed to terminate. In this paper; we propose a novel class of logicprograms whose evaluation always terminates. The proposed technique identifiesterminating programs that are not captured by any of the current approaches.

Besides considering the usualinformation on the textbased content of the documents; our approach exploits frequentassociations of the documents in the groups across the existing classifications; in order tocapture how documents tend to be grouped together orthogonally to the different views. Athird-order tensor for the document collection is built over both the space of terms and thespace of the discovered frequent documentassociations; and then it is decomposed to finallyestablish a unique encompassing clustering of documents.

Partially ordered regular languages for graph queries,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco,Abstract In this paper we present an extension of regular languages to support graphqueries. The proposed extension is based on the introduction of a partial order on the stringsof the languages. We extend regular expressions and regular grammars by introducingpartial orders on strings and production rules; respectively. The relations between regularexpressions and regular grammars are analyzed. We show how partially ordered languagescan be used to define path queries to search graph databases and present results on theircomputational complexity. Finally; we present an application of partially ordered languagesfor searching the Web.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2005,2

Graph grammars for querying graph-like data,Sergio Flesca; Filippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco,Abstract Recently research has deeply investigated the problem of querying semi-structureddata and data which can be represented by means of graphs (eg object-oriented data; XMLdata; etc.). Typically queries on graph-like data; called path queries; are expressed bymeans of regular expressions denoting paths in the graph. The result of a path query is theset of nodes reachable by means of a path expressed by a specified regular expression. Inthis paper we investigate the problem of extracting a subgraph satisfying a given propertyfrom a given graph representing some information. We propose a new form of queries;called graph queries; whose answers are (marked) graphs having a particular structure;extracted from the source graph. We show that a simple form of graph grammars can beprofitably used to define graph queries. The result of a graph query; using a grammar G …,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,2001,2
Combining different data mining techniques to improve data analysis,Sergio Greco; Elio Masciari; Luigi Pontieri,Abstract In this paper we propose the combined use of different methods to improve the dataanalysis process. This is obtained by combining inductive and deductive techniques.Inductive techniques are used for generating hypotheses from data whereas deductivetechniques are used to derive knowledge and to verify hypotheses. In order to guide users inthe the analysis process; we have developed a system which integrates deductive tools;data mining tools (such as classification algorithms and features selection algorithms);visualization tools and tools for the easy manipulation of data sets. The system developed iscurrently used in a large project whose aim is the integration of information sourcescontaining data concerning the socio-economic aspects of Calabria and the analysis of theintegrated data.

An information-theoretic approach to hierarchical clustering of uncertain data,Francesco Gullo; Giovanni Ponti; Andrea Tagarelli; Sergio Greco,Abstract Uncertain data clustering has become central in mining data whose observedrepresentation is naturally affected by imprecision; staling; or randomness that is implicitwhen storing this data from real-word sources. Most existing methods for uncertain dataclustering follow a partitional or a density-based clustering approach; whereas little researchhas been devoted to the hierarchical clustering paradigm. In this work; we push forwardresearch in hierarchical clustering of uncertain data by introducing a well-founded solutionto the problem via an information-theoretic approach; following the initial idea described inour earlier work [26]. We propose a prototype-based agglomerative hierarchical clusteringmethod; dubbed U-AHC; which employs a new uncertain linkage criterion for clustermerging. This criterion enables the comparison of (sets of) uncertain objects based on …,Information Sciences,2017,1
Incremental maximum flow computation on evolving networks,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Chiara Pulice; Ximena Quintana,Abstract The maximum flow problem is a classical optimization problem with a wide range ofapplications. Nowadays; it is successfully applied in social network analysis for link spamdetection; web communities identification; and others. In such applications; flow networksare used to model connections among web pages; online voting systems; web communities;P2P and other distributed systems. Thus; networks are highly dynamic; that is; subject tofrequent updates. While many efficient algorithms for the maximum flow problem have beenproposed over the years; they are designed to work with static networks; and thus they needto recompute a new solution from scratch every time an update occurs. Such approachesare impractical in scenarios like the aforementioned ones; where updates are frequent.,Proceedings of the Symposium on Applied Computing,2017,1

Incremental computation of grounded semantics for dynamic abstract argumentation frameworks,Sergio Greco; Francesco Parisi,Abstract Abstract argumentation has emerged as a central field in Artificial Intelligence.Although the underlying idea is very simple and intuitive; most of the semantics proposed sofar suffer from a high computational complexity. For this reason; in recent years; anincreasing amount of work has been done to define efficient algorithms. However; so far; theresearch has concentrated on the definition of algorithms for static frameworks; whereasargumentation frameworks (AFs) are highly dynamic in practice. Surprisingly; the definitionof evaluation algorithms taking into account such dynamic aspects has been mostlyneglected. In this paper; we address the problem of efficiently recomputing the extensions ofAFs which are updated by adding/deleting arguments or attacks. In particular; afteridentifying some properties that hold for updates of AFs under several well-known …,International Workshop on Conflict Resolution in Decision Making,2016,1
Rewriting-based check of chase termination,Marco Calautti; Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro; Irina Trubitsyna,The Chase is a fixpoint algorithm enforcing satisfaction of data dependencies (also calledconstraints) in databases. It has been proposed more than thirty years ago [2; 18] and hasseen a revival of interest in recent years in both database theory and practical applications.Indeed; the availability of data coming from different sources easily results in inconsistent orincomplete data (ie; data not satisfying data dependencies) and; therefore; techniques forfixing inconsistencies are crucial [1; 3; 5; 7; 8; 13; 17]. The chase algorithm is used; directlyor indirectly; on an everyday basis by people who design databases; and it is used incommercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design. Newapplications of the chase in meta-data management; ontological reasoning; data exchange;data cleaning; and query optimization have been proposed as well [6; 9].

Consistent query answering over inconsistent databases,Sergio Greco; Cristian Molinaro,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of managing inconsistent databases; that is;databases violating integrity constraints. Most of the works dealing with the problem ofextracting reliable information from inconsistent databases are based on the notion of repair;a “minimal” set of update operations which leads the database to a consistent state (calledrepaired database); and the notion of consistent query answer; a query answer that can beobtained from every repaired database. The problem of computing consistent query answersin the presence of different classes of constraints and under different repair strategies isanalyzed.,International Journal of Knowledge-based and Intelligent Engineering Systems,2011,1

In more details; the case of dynamicpreferences is investigated and a semantics interpreting each preference rule as a tool forrepresenting a choice over alternative options is proposed. The technique; providing a newinterpretation for prioritized logic programs; is inspired by the one proposed by Sakama andInoue in [19] and enriched with the use of structural information of preference rules asproposed by Brewka et al. in [6]. Specifically; the analysis of the logic program is carried outtogether with the analysis of preferences in order to determine the choice order and the setsof comparable models.

A Technique for Information System Integration.,Sergio Greco; Luigi Pontieri; Ester Zumpano,Abstract: Nowadays; a central topic in database science is the need of an integrated accessto large amounts of data provided by various information sources whose contents are strictlyrelated. Often information sources have been designed independently for autonomousapplications; so they may present several kinds of heterogeneity. Particularly hard tomanage is the semantic heterogeneity; which is due to schema and value inconsistencies. Inthis paper; we focus our attention mainly on the inconsistency which arises when conflictinginstances related to the same concept and possibly coming from different sources areintegrated. First; we introduce an operator; called Merge Operator; which allows us tocombine data coming from different sources; preserving the information contained in each ofthem. Then; we present a variant of this operator; the Extended Merge Operator; which …,ISTA,2001,1
Greedy Algorithms in Deductive Databases,Sergio Greco; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract In the design of algorithms; the greedy paradigm provides a powerful tool forsolving efficiently classical computational problems; within the framework of procedurallanguages. However; expressing these algorithms within the declarative framework of logic-based languages has proven a difficult research challenge. In this paper; we extend theframework of Datalog-like languages to obtain simple declarative formulations for suchproblems; and propose effective implementation techniques to ensure computationalcomplexities comparable to those of procedural formulations. These advances are achievedthrough the use of the choice construct; extended with preference annotations to effect theselection of alternative stable-models and nondeterministic fixpoints.

Simple set terms are of the form e 1;...; en; where ei is aconstant or a variable and are much used in deductive database systems such as LDL andCoral. In this paper we consider a restricted form of unification; called “weak unification”;which is mainly used in the field of deductive databases where the database may containboth constants and variables and the program is “safe”. The main results are:(a) the detailedcomplexity analysis of the weak unification problem by providing a formula for determiningthe number of weak unifiers; and (b) the invention of an optimal weak unification algorithm.,*,1996,1

Detecting Decidable Classes of Finitely Ground Logic Programs with Function Symbols,Marco Calautti; Sergio Greco; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract In this article; we propose a new technique for checking whether the bottom-upevaluation of logic programs with function symbols terminates. The technique is based onthe definition of mappings from arguments to strings of function symbols; representingpossible values which could be taken by arguments during the bottom-up evaluation.Starting from mappings; we identify mapping-restricted arguments; a subset of limitedarguments; namely arguments that take values from finite domains. Mapping-restrictedprograms; consisting of rules whose arguments are all mapping restricted; are terminatingunder the bottom-up computation; as all of its arguments take values from finite domains.

Controversy-Aware Hybrid Trust Inference in Online Social Networks,Paolo Zicari; Roberto Interdonato; Andrea Tagarelli; Sergio Greco,Social interactions assume a central role in everyday life of people strongly connectedthrough online social networks and web communities. Trust can be used as a filter to theincreasing flow of information; experiences and opinions exchanged among users. In theabsence of direct relations; trust inference algorithms can be exploited in order to estimatemissing trust values. However; controversial situations can easily arise from the subjectivityof trust opinions; when the lack of agreement leads to ambiguity and uncertainty in theinferred trust.

Stratification-based Criteria for Checking Chase Termination.,Sergio Greco; Francesca Spezzano; Irina Trubitsyna,Abstract. Several database areas such as data exchange and integration share the problemof fixing database instance violations with respect to a set of constraints. The chasealgorithm solves such violations by inserting tuples and setting the value of nulls.Unfortunately; the chase algorithm may not terminate and the problem of deciding whetherthe chase process terminates is undecidable. Recently there has been an increasinginterest in the identification of sufficient structural properties of constraints which guaranteethat the chase algorithm terminates. In this paper we present more general criteria for chasetermination.

Querying and Integrating P2P Deductive Databases,Luciano Caroprese; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Abstract Recently; there have been several proposals that consider the integration ofinformation and the computation of queries in an open-ended network of distributed peers(Bernstein; Giunchiglia; Kementsietsidis; Mylopulos; Serafini; & Zaihrayen; 2002; Calvanese;De Giacomo; Lenzerini; & Rosati; 2004; Franconi; Kuper; Lopatenko; & Zaihrayeu; 2003) aswell as the problem of schema mediation and query optimization in P2P (peerto-peer)environments (Gribble; Halevy; Ives; Rodrig; & Suciu; 2001; Halevy; Ives; Suciu; & Tatarinov;2003; Madhavan & Halevy; 2003; Tatarinov & Halevy; 2004).

Repairing and Querying Databases with Integrity Constraints,Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Data integration aims at providing a uniform integrated access to multiple heterogeneousinformation sources; which were designed independently for autonomous applications andwhose contents are strictly related. There are several ways to integrate databases orpossibly distributed information sources; but whatever integration architecture we choose;the heterogeneity of the sources to be integrated causes subtle problems. In particular; thedatabase obtained from the integration process may be inconsistent with respect to integrityconstraints; that is; one or more integrity constraints are not satisfied. The following exampleshows a case of inconsistency. Example 1. Consider the following database schemaconsisting of the single binary relation Teaches (Course; Professor) where the attributeCourse is a key for the relation.

Managing Inconsistent Databases Using Active Integrity Constraints.,Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Integrity constraints are a fundamental part of a database schema. They are generally usedto define constraints on data (functional dependencies; inclusion dependencies; exclusiondependencies; etc.); and their enforcement ensures a semantically correct state of adatabase. As the presence of data inconsistent with respect to integrity constraints is notunusual; its management plays a key role in all the areas in which duplicate or conflictinginformation is likely to occur; such as database integration; data warehousing; and federateddatabases (Bry; 1997; Lin; 1996; Subrahmanian; 1994). It is well known that the presence ofinconsistent data can be managed by “repairing” the database; that is; by providingconsistent databases; obtained by a minimal set of update operations on the inconsistentoriginal environment; or by consistently answering queries posed over the inconsistent …,*,2005,*
Aggregates and preferences in logic programming,Sergio Greco; Irina Trubitsyna; Ester Zumpano,Abstract The present work proposes a new semantics for logic program with preferencerules and studies logic programs enriched with both aggregates and preference rules. Theinterest of research literature in handling user preferences to express a partial order on rulesand literals is reflected by an extensive number of proposals. The association of aggregatesand preferences is; here; used to also express a partial order on global models; other thanon literals and rules; so that optimization problems can be expressed in a simple andelegant way. The use of aggregates makes logic languages more flexible and intuitive;without any additional computational complexity.,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2005,*

Functional queries in Datalog,Stefano Basta; Sergio Flesca; Sergio Greco,Abstract A 'functional'query is a query whose answer is always defined and unique ie it iseither true or false in all models. It has been shown that the expressive powers of the varioustypes of stable models; when restricted to the class of DATALOG¬ functional queries; do notin practice go beyond those of well-founded semantics; except for the least undefined stablemodels which; instead; capture the whole boolean hierarchy BH. In this paper we present a'functional'language which; by means of a disciplined use of negation; achieves the desiredlevel of expressiveness up to BH. Although the semantics of the new language is partial; allatoms in the source program are defined and possibly undefined atoms are introduced in arewriting phase to increase the expressive power.

Translating datalog-like optimization queries into ILOG programs,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Irina Trubitsyna; Ester Zumpano,Abstract This paper presents a logic language; called NP Datalog suitable for expressing NPsearch and optimization problems. The 'search'language extends stratified Datalog withconstraints and allows disjunction to define nondeterministically partitions of relations. It'swell known that NP search problems can be formulated as unstratified DATALOG queriesunder nondeterministic stable model semantics so that each stable model corresponds to apossible solution. NP optimization problems are then formulated by adding a max (or min)construct to select the stable model (thus; the solution) which maximizes (resp.; minimizes)the result of a polynomial function applied to the answer relation. The problem in usingDATALOG¬ to express search and optimization problems is that the unrestricted negation inprograms is often neither simple nor intuitive and; besides; it does not allow to discipline …,International Workshop on Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation,2002,*
STED: a system for topic enumeration and distillation,Gianluigi Greco; Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Search services on hyperlinked data are becoming popular among users because of thehuge amount of data available and the consequent difficulty of retrieving and filteringrelevant documents. Traditional term-based search engines are not very useful for thispurpose since the resulting ranking depends on the users's precision in expressing thequery. Current research; instead; takes a different approach; called topic distillation; whichconsists of finding documents related to the query topic; but these do not necessarily containthe query string. Current algorithms for topic distillation first compute a base set containingall the relevant pages and then apply an iterative procedure to obtain the authoritativepages. In this paper we present STED; a system for topic distillation and enumeration (ieidentification of different communities) of Web documents.

Consistent queries over databases with integrity constraints,Sergio Greco; Ester Zumpano,Integrity constraints represent an important source of information about the real world. Theyare usually used to define constraints on data (functional dependencies; inclusiondependencies; etc.). Nowadays integrity constraints have a wide applicability in severalcontexts such as semantic query optimization; cooperative query answering; databaseintegration and view update. Often databases may be inconsistent with respect to integrityconstraints; that is; one or more integrity constraints are not satisfied. This may happen; forinstance; when the database is obtained from the integration of different information sources.The integration of knowledge from multiple sources is an important aspect in several areassuch as data warehousing; database integration; automated reasoning systems and activereactive databases.

Themain contribution of the paper is an algorithm for propagating min and max predicates whilepreserving query equivalence under certain monotonicity constraints. We show that thealgorithm is correct and that the transformed query is often safe when the original one is not.Although in this paper we use logic rules; the technique presented can be used to optimize(possibly recursive) queries expressed by means of SQL3.,*,2001,*

The language is basedon a disciplined usage of negation; which allows to achieve the desired level ofexpressiveness up to BH. Although the semantics of the new language is partial; all atoms inthe source program are de ned and possibly unde ned atoms are introduced in a rewritingphase to increase the expressive power.

Simple set terms are of the form e 1;...; en; where ei is a constant or a variable and aremuch used in deductive database systems such as LDL and Coral. We consider a restrictedform of unification; called “weak unification”; which is mainly used in the field of deductivedatabases where the database may contain both constants and variables and the programis “safe”. The main result of the paper is the detailed complexity analysis of the weakunification problem by providing a formula for determining the number of weak unifiers.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1996,*

Optimization of Chain Queries,Sergio Greco,Abstract Simple chain logic programs contains exactly one single recursive rule and this ruleis a chain rule; ie; the goals are structured in such a way that a binding on the first argumentof the head predicate is propagated to the second argument. This structure gives theopportunity to exploit possibly bindings while answering queries. Indeed many methodshave been proposed in the literature to devise efficient execution of bound queries onparticular simple chain logic programs; eg; linear programs. In this paper we present ageneral method; called the cons-method; which is applicable to any simple chain logicprogram. The method is based on the analogies of chain programs with the context freelanguages that are recognized by a particular scheme of pushdown automaton; indeed; themethod implements this automaton as a factorized left-linear logic program.

Organizing Organizing XML Documents on a Peer–to–Peer Network by Collaborative by Collaborative Clustering,Francesco Gullo; Giovanni Ponti; Sergio Greco,ABSTRACT XML and peer–to–peer (P2P) technologies are nowadays increasingly beingcombined in many application scenarios. Indeed; while XML is the standard for representingand exchanging data; P2P networks offer innovative opportunities to users to share andlocate distributed data over the Internet. This synergistic coupling of XML and P2P networksbecomes particularly appealing in mining contexts; such as document clustering. ClusteringXML documents is extensively used to discover meaningful groups in large collections ofXML documents according to structure and/or content information. However; despite thegrowing availability of distributed XML sources and the variety of high-demandenvironments; existing methods for clustering XML documents work only in a centralizedway.
