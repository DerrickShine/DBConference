Putting Lipstick on Pig: Enabling Database-style Workflow Provenance,Yael Amsterdamer; Susan B Davidson; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Julia Stoyanovich; Val Tannen,Abstract Workflow provenance typically assumes that each module is a" black-box"; so thateach output depends on all inputs (coarse-grained dependencies). Furthermore; it does notmodel the internal state of a module; which can change between repeated executions. Inpractice; however; an output may depend on only a small subset of the inputs (fine-graineddependencies) as well as on the internal state of the module. We present a novelprovenance framework that marries database-style and workflow-style provenance; by usingPig Latin to expose the functionality of modules; thus capturing internal state and fine-grained dependencies. A critical ingredient in our solution is the use of a novel form ofprovenance graph that models module invocations and yields a compact representation offine-grained workflow provenance. It also enables a number of novel graph …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,115
Provenance for aggregate queries,Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Val Tannen,Abstract We study in this paper provenance information for queries with aggregation.Provenance information was studied in the context of various query languages that do notallow for aggregation; and recent work has suggested to capture provenance by annotatingthe different database tuples with elements of a commutative semiring and propagating theannotations through query evaluation. We show that aggregate queries pose novelchallenges rendering this approach inapplicable. Consequently; we propose a newapproach; where we annotate with provenance information not just tuples but also theindividual values within tuples; using provenance to describe the values computation. Werealize this approach in a concrete construction; first for" simple" queries where theaggregation operator is the last one applied; and then for arbitrary (positive) relational …,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,92
Crowd mining,Yael Amsterdamer; Yael Grossman; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Harnessing a crowd of Web users for data collection has recently become a wide-spread phenomenon. A key challenge is that the human knowledge forms an open worldand it is thus difficult to know what kind of information we should be looking for. Classicdatabases have addressed this problem by data mining techniques that identify interestingdata patterns. These techniques; however; are not suitable for the crowd. This is mainly dueto properties of the human memory; such as the tendency to remember simple trends andsummaries rather than exact details. Following these observations; we develop here for thefirst time the foundations of crowd mining. We first define the formal settings. Based on these;we design a framework of generic components; used for choosing the best questions to askthe crowd and mining significant patterns from the answers. We suggest general …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,75
On provenance minimization,Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Val Tannen,Abstract Provenance information has been proved to be very effective in capturing thecomputational process performed by queries; and has been used extensively as the input tomany advanced data management tools (eg; view maintenance; trust assessment; or queryanswering in probabilistic databases). We observe here that while different (set-) equivalentqueries may admit different provenance expressions when evaluated on the samedatabase; there is always some part of these expressions that is common to all. We refer tothis part as the core provenance. In addition to being informative; the core provenance isalso useful as a compact input to the aforementioned data management tools. We formallydefine the notion of core provenance. We study algorithms that; given a query; compute anequivalent (called p-minimal) query that for every input database; the provenance of …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,32

On the Limitations of Provenance for Queries with Difference.,Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Val Tannen,Abstract The annotation of the results of database transformations was shown to be veryeffective for various applications. Until recently; most works in this context focused onpositive query languages. The provenance semirings is a particular approach that wasproven effective for these languages; and it was shown that when propagating provenancewith semirings; the expected equivalence axioms of the corresponding query languages aresatisfied. There have been several attempts to extend the framework to account for relationalalgebra queries with difference. We show here that these suggestions fail to satisfy someexpected equivalence axioms (that in particular hold for queries on “standard” set and bagdatabases). Interestingly; we show that this is not a pitfall of these particular attempts; butrather every such attempt is bound to fail in satisfying these axioms; for some semirings …,TaPP,2011,31
OASSIS: query driven crowd mining,Yael Amsterdamer; Susan B Davidson; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Amit Somech,Abstract Crowd data sourcing is increasingly used to gather information from the crowd andto obtain recommendations. In this paper; we explore a novel approach that broadens crowddata sourcing by enabling users to pose general questions; to mine the crowd for potentiallyrelevant data; and to receive concise; relevant answers that represent frequent; significantdata patterns. Our approach is based on (1) a simple generic model that captures bothontological knowledge as well as the individual history or habits of crowd members fromwhich frequent patterns are mined;(2) a query language in which users can declarativelyspecify their information needs and the data patterns of interest;(3) an efficient queryevaluation algorithm; which enables mining semantically concise answers while minimizingthe number of questions posed to the crowd; and (4) an implementation of these ideas …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,26
On the Complexity of Mining Itemsets from the Crowd Using Taxonomies,Antoine Amarilli; Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo,Abstract: We study the problem of frequent itemset mining in domains where data is notrecorded in a conventional database but only exists in human knowledge. We provideexamples of such scenarios; and present a crowdsourcing model for them. The model usesthe crowd as an oracle to find out whether an itemset is frequent or not; and relies on aknown taxonomy of the item domain to guide the search for frequent itemsets. In the spirit ofdata mining with oracles; we analyze the complexity of this problem in terms of (i) crowdcomplexity; that measures the number of crowd questions required to identify the frequentitemsets; and (ii) computational complexity; that measures the computational effort requiredto choose the questions. We provide lower and upper complexity bounds in terms of the sizeand structure of the input taxonomy; as well as the size of a concise description of the …,ICDT,2014,22
Uncertainty in crowd data sourcing under structural constraints,Antoine Amarilli; Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo,Abstract Applications extracting data from crowdsourcing platforms must deal with theuncertainty of crowd answers in two different ways: first; by deriving estimates of the correctvalue from the answers; second; by choosing crowd questions whose answers are expectedto minimize this uncertainty relative to the overall data collection goal. Such problems arealready challenging when we assume that questions are unrelated and answers areindependent; but they are even more complicated when we assume that the unknownvalues follow hard structural constraints (such as monotonicity). In this vision paper; weexamine how to formally address this issue with an approach inspired by [2]. We describe ageneralized setting where we model constraints as linear inequalities; and use them toguide the choice of crowd questions and the processing of answers.

CrowdMiner: Mining association rules from the crowd,Yael Amsterdamer; Yael Grossman; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract This demo presents CrowdMiner; a system enabling the mining of interesting datapatterns from the crowd. While traditional data mining techniques have been usedextensively for finding patterns in classic databases; they are not always suitable for thecrowd; mainly because humans tend to remember only simple trends and summaries ratherthan exact details. To address this; CrowdMiner employs a novel crowd-mining algorithm;designed specifically for this context. The algorithm iteratively chooses appropriatequestions to ask the crowd; while aiming to maximize the knowledge gain at each step. Wedemonstrate CrowdMiner through a Well-Being portal; constructed interactively by miningthe crowd; and in particular the conference participants; for common health related practicesand trends.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,16
Foundations of Crowd Data Sourcing,Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo,Abstract Crowdsourcing techniques are very powerful when harnessed for the purpose ofcollecting and managing data. In order to provide sound scientific foundations forcrowdsourcing and support the development of efficient crowdsourcing processes; adequateformal models must be defined. In particular; the models must formalize uniquecharacteristics of crowd-based settings; such as the knowledge of the crowd and crowd-provided data; the interaction with crowd members; the inherent inaccuracies anddisagreements in crowd answers; and evaluation metrics that capture the cost and effort ofthe crowd. In this paper; we review the foundational challenges in modeling crowd-baseddata sourcing; for its two main tasks; namely; harvesting data and processing it with the helpof the crowd. For each of the two task types; we dive into the details of one foundational …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2014,10
Finding optimal probabilistic generators for XML collections,Serge Abiteboul; Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We study the problem of; given a corpus of XML documents and its schema; findingan optimal (generative) probabilistic model; where optimality here means maximizing thelikelihood of the particular corpus to be generated. Focusing first on the structure ofdocuments; we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best generative probabilisticmodel; in the absence of constraints. We further study the problem in the presence ofintegrity constraints; namely key; inclusion; and domain constraints. We study in this casetwo different kinds of generators. First; we consider a continuation-test generator thatperforms; while generating documents; tests of schema satisfiability; these tests prevent fromgenerating a document violating the constraints but; as we will see; they are computationallyexpensive. We also study a restart generator that may generate an invalid document and …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Database Theory,2012,9
NL2CM: A Natural Language Interface to Crowd Mining,Yael Amsterdamer; Anna Kukliansky; Tova Milo,Abstract The joint processing of general data; which can refer to objective data such asgeographical locations; with individual data; which is related to the habits and opinions ofindividuals; is required in many real-life scenarios. For this purpose; crowd mining platformscombine searching knowledge bases for general data; with mining the crowd for individual;unrecorded data. Existing such platforms require queries to be stated in a formal language.To bridge the gap between naïve users; who are not familiar with formal query languages;and crowd mining platforms; we develop NL2CM; a prototype system which translatesnatural language (NL) questions into well-formed crowd mining queries. The mix of generaland individual information needs raises unique challenges. In particular; the different typesof needs must be identified and translated into separate query parts. To account for these …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,8
A Natural Language Interface for Querying General and Individual Knowledge (Full Version),Yael Amsterdamer; Anna Kukliansky; Tova Milo,Abstract Many real-life scenarios require the joint analysis of general knowledge; whichincludes facts about the world; with individual knowledge; which relates to the opinions orhabits of individuals. Recently developed crowd mining platforms; which were designed forsuch tasks; are a major step towards the solution. However; these platforms require users tospecify their information needs in a formal; declarative language; which may be toocomplicated for naıve users. To make the joint analysis of general and individual knowledgeaccessible to the public; it is desirable to provide an interface that translates the userquestions; posed in natural language (NL); into the formal query languages that crowdmining platforms support. While the translation of NL questions to queries over conventionaldatabases has been studied in previous work; a setting with mixed individual and general …,*,*,8
Managing General and Individual Knowledge in Crowd Mining Applications.,Yael Amsterdamer; Susan B Davidson; Anna Kukliansky; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Amit Somech,ABSTRACT Crowd mining frameworks combine general knowledge; which can refer to anontology or information in a database; with individual knowledge obtained from the crowd;which captures habits and preferences. To account for such mixed knowledge; along withuser interaction and optimization issues; such frameworks must employ a complex processof reasoning; automatic crowd task generation and result analysis. In this paper; we describea generic architecture for crowd mining applications. This architecture allows us to examineand compare the components of existing crowdsourcing systems and point out extensionsrequired by crowd mining. It also highlights new research challenges and potential reuse ofexisting techniques/components. We exemplify this for the OASSIS project and for otherprominent crowdsourcing frameworks.,CIDR,2015,6
Top-k Querying of Unknown Values under Order Constraints,Antoine Amarilli; Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Many practical scenarios make it necessary to evaluate top-k queries over dataitems with partially unknown values. This paper considers a setting where the values aretaken from a numerical domain; and where some partial order constraints are given overknown and unknown values: under these constraints; we assume that all possible worldsare equally likely. Our work is the first to propose a principled scheme to derive the valuedistributions and expected values of unknown items in this setting; with the goal ofcomputing estimated top-k results by interpolating the unknown values from the known ones.We study the complexity of this general task; and show tight complexity bounds; proving thatthe problem is intractable; but can be tractably approximated. We then consider the case oftree-shaped partial orders; where we show a constructive PTIME solution. We also …,ICDT,2017,4
Toward semantic image similarity from crowdsourced clustering,Yanir Kleiman; George Goldberg; Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Cohen-Or,Abstract Determining the similarity between images is a fundamental step in manyapplications; such as image categorization; image labeling and image retrieval. Automaticmethods for similarity estimation often fall short when semantic context is required for thetask; raising the need for human judgment. Such judgments can be collected viacrowdsourcing techniques; based on tasks posed to web users. However; to allow theestimation of image similarities in reasonable time and cost; the generation of tasks to thecrowd must be done in a careful manner. We observe that distances within localneighborhoods provide valuable information that allows a quick and accurate construction ofthe global similarity metric. This key observation leads to a solution based on clusteringtasks; comparing relatively similar images. In each query; crowd members cluster a small …,The Visual Computer,2016,3

The answers that the system computes are concise and relevant; and representfrequent; significant data patterns. The system is based on (1) a generic model that capturesboth ontological knowledge; as well as the individual knowledge of crowd members fromwhich frequent patterns are mined;(2) a query language in which users can specify theirinformation needs and types of data patterns they seek; and (3) an efficient query evaluationalgorithm; for mining semantically concise answers while minimizing the number ofquestions posed to the crowd.

Auto-completion learning for XML,Serge Abiteboul; Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Editing an XML document manually is a complicated task. While many XML editorsexist in the market; we argue that some important functionalities are missing in all of them.Our goal is to makes the editing task simpler and faster. We present ALEX (Auto-completionLearning Editor for XML); an editor that assists the users by providing intelligent auto-completion suggestions. These suggestions are adapted to the user needs; simply byfeeding ALEX with a set of example XML documents to learn from. The suggestions are alsoguaranteed to be compliant with a given XML schema; possibly including integrityconstraints. To fulfill this challenging goal; we rely on novel; theoretical foundations by usand others; which are combined here in a system for the first time.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,3

The optimal crowd selection can greatly vary depending on properties of thecrowd and of the task. To this end; we present December; a declarative platform with novelcapabilities for flexible crowd selection. December supports the personalized selection ofcrowd members via a dedicated query language Member-QL. This language enablesspecifying and combining common crowd selection criteria such as properties of a crowdmember's profile and history; similarity between profiles in specific aspects and relevance ofthe member to a given task. This holistic; customizable approach differs from previous workthat has mostly focused on dedicated algorithms for crowd selection in specific settings …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,1
Optimal probabilistic generators for XML corpora,Serge Abiteboul; Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We study the problem of; given a corpus of XML documents and its schema; findingan optimal probabilistic model (optimality meaning maximizing the likelihood of the corpus tobe generated). We present an efficient algorithm for finding the best probabilistic model; inabsence of constraints. We further study the problem in presence of integrity constraints(key; inclusion; and domain constraints) and consider in this case two different kinds ofgenerators: a continuation-test generator that performs; while generating; some tests ofschema satisfiability; these tests allow avoiding the violation of constraints (but as we show;are costly to implement); and a restart generator that may generate an invalid document andthen restart and try again.,BDA (Bases de données avancées),2011,1
On the optimality of top-k algorithms for Interactive Web Applications.,Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,ABSTRACT In an interactive Web application; the application state changes according touser choices/actions. To assist users in their interaction with such applications; there is aneed to provide them with recommendations for the top-k (according to some ranking metric)interactions. These recommendations must be continually updated; as the user interacts withthe application; to be consistent with the actual choices she makes. Efficiency of computationis critical here to provide fast response time and a pleasant user experience. This paperestablishes formal foundations for measuring the optimality of top-k algorithms of theaforementioned type; ie how well they perform relative to other algorithms; with respect to allpossible input instances. We define several intuitive notions of optimality in this setting;analyze the fundamental difficulties in obtaining optimal algorithms; and identify …,WebDB,2011,1
PODIUM: Procuring Opinions from Diverse Users in a Multi-Dimensional World,Yael Amsterdamer; Oded Goldreich,Abstract The procurement of opinions is an important task in many contexts. When selectingmembers of a certain population to ask for their opinions; diversity inside the selected subsetis a central consideration. People with diverse profiles are assumed to provide a widerrange of opinions and thus to better represent the opinions of the entire population.However; in platforms with a large user base such as crowdsourcing applications and socialnetworks; defining and realizing notions of diversity are both nontrivial. The profiles of userstypically contain information that is high-dimensional and semantically rich. We presentPODIUM; a tool for opinion procurement that accounts for complex user profiles and enablescustomizable user selection. Beyond selecting a subset of users with diverse profiles;PODIUM produces explanation for the choice of each user and visual aids to compare the …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
