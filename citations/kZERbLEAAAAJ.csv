The dark Z′ portal: direct; indirect and collider searches,Alexandre Alves; Stefano Profumo; Farinaldo S Queiroz,A bstract We perform a detailed study of the dark Z′ portal using a generic parametrizationof the Z′-quarks couplings; both for light (8-15) GeV and heavy (100-1000) GeV dark matterscenarios. We present a comprehensive study of the collider phenomenology including jetclustering; hadronization; and detector artifacts; which allows us to derive accurate boundsfrom the search for new resonances in dijet events and from mono-jet events in the LHC 7TeV; LHC 8 TeV; and Tevatron 1.96 TeV data. We also compute the dark matter relicabundance; the relevant scattering cross sections and pair-annihilation spectrum; andcompare our results with the current PLANCK; Fermi-LAT and XENON100/LUX bounds.Lastly; we highlight the importance of complementary searches for dark matter; and outlinethe excluded versus still viable parameter space regions of the dark Z′ portal.,Journal of High Energy Physics,2014,131
The 750 GeV S-cion: Where else should we look for it?,Alexandre Alves; Alex G Dias; Kuver Sinha,Abstract The resonance S at∼ 750 GeV in the diphoton channel observed by ATLAS andCMS; if it holds up; is almost certainly the (S) cion of a larger dynasty in a UV completion thatmay very well be connected to the hierarchy problem. At this stage; however; an effectivefield theory framework provides a useful way to parametrize searches for this resonance inother channels. Assuming that the excess is due to a new scalar or pseudoscalar boson; westudy associated production of S (“S-strahlung”) at the LHC and propose searches in severalclean channels like γ γ ℓ ℓ; γ γ ℓ E̸ T and ℓ ℓ ℓ γ E̸ T to probe dimension-5 operatorscoupling S to Standard Model gauge bosons. We consider a range of widths for S; from 5GeV to 45 GeV; and find that the three channels probe complementary regions of parameterspace and the suppression scale Λ. The finding of most immediate relevance is that with …,Physics Letters B,2016,120
Dirac-fermionic dark matter in U (1) X models,Alexandre Alves; Asher Berlin; Stefano Profumo; Farinaldo S Queiroz,A bstract We study a number of U (1) X models featuring a Dirac fermion dark matter particle.We perform a comprehensive analysis which includes the study of corrections to the muonmagnetic moment; dilepton searches with LHC data; as well as direct and indirect darkmatter detection constraints. We consider four different coupling structures; namely U (1) B−L; U (1) d− u; U (1) universal; and U 1 10+ 5¯ U (1) _ 10+ 5; all motivated by compellingextensions to the standard model. We outline the viable and excluded regions of parameterspace using a large set of probes. Our key findings are that (i) the combination of directdetection and collider constraints rule out dark matter particle masses lighter than∼ 1 TeV;unless rather suppressed Z′-fermion couplings exist; and that (ii) for several of the modelsunder consideration; collider constraints rule out Z′ masses up to∼ 3 TeV. Lastly; we …,Journal of High Energy Physics,2015,96
Effective field theory approach to the Galactic Center gamma-ray excess,Alexandre Alves; Stefano Profumo; Farinaldo S Queiroz; William Shepherd,Abstract We explore the possibility of explaining a gamma-ray excess in the Galactic center;originally pointed out by Hooper; collaborators; and other groups; in an effective field theoryframework. We assume that dark matter annihilation is mediated by particles heavy enoughto be integrated out and that such particles couple to all quark families. We calculate theeffective coupling required to explain the annihilation signal in the Galactic center andcompare with bounds from direct detection; collider searches; and the requirement that thedark matter particles make up the appropriate fraction of the universal energy budget. Wefind that only a very small set of operators can explain the gamma-ray excess while beingconsistent with other constraints. Specifically; for scalar dark matter; the viable options areone scalar-type coupling to quarks and one interaction with gluons; while for fermionic …,Physical Review D,2014,96
It is a gluino,Alexandre Alves; Oscar Eboli; Tilman Plehn,Abstract For a long time it has been known that the like-sign dilepton signature can helpestablish the existence of a gluino at the LHC. To unambiguously claim that we see astrongly interacting Majorana fermion—which we could call a gluino—we need to prove thatit is indeed a fermion. We propose how to extract this information from a different gluino-decay cascade which is also used to measure its mass. Looking only at angular correlationswe distinguish a universal extra dimensional interpretation assuming a bosonic heavy gluonfrom supersymmetry with a fermionic gluino. Assuming a supersymmetric interpretation; weshow how the same angular correlations can be used to study the left-right nature of thesfermions appearing in the decay chain.,Physical Review D,2006,90
Dark matter complementarity and the Z′ portal,Alexandre Alves; Asher Berlin; Stefano Profumo; Farinaldo S Queiroz,Abstract Z′ gauge bosons arise in many particle physics models as mediators between thedark and visible sectors. We exploit dark matter (DM) complementarity and derive stringentand robust collider; direct and indirect constraints; as well as limits from the muon magneticmoment. We rule out almost the entire region of the parameter space that yields the rightdark matter thermal relic abundance; using a generic parametrization of the Z′-fermioncouplings normalized to the standard model Z-fermion couplings for dark matter masses inthe 8 GeV–5 TeV range. We conclude that mediators lighter than 2.1 TeV are excludedregardless of the DM mass; and that depending on the Z′-fermion coupling strength muchheavier masses are needed to reproduce the DM thermal relic abundance while avoidingexisting limits.,Physical Review D,2015,84
Probing 3-3-1 models in diphoton Higgs boson decay,A Alves; E Ramirez Barreto; AG Dias; CA de S Pires; FS Queiroz; PS Rodrigues da Silva,Abstract We investigate the Higgs boson production through gluon fusion and its decay intotwo photons at the LHC in the context of the minimal 3-3-1 model and its alternative versionwith exotic leptons. The diphoton Higgs decay channel presents an enhanced signal in thismodel compared to the standard model due to the presence of an extra singly chargedvector boson and a doubly charged one. Prospects for the Higgs boson detection at 7 TeVcenter-of-mass energy with up to 10 fb− 1 are presented. Our results suggest that a Higgsboson from these 3-3-1 models can potentially explain the small excess for m H≤ 145 GeVobserved at the LHC. Otherwise; if this excess reveals to be only a statistical fluctuation ofthe standard model backgrounds; severe constraints can be put on these models.,Physical Review D,2011,70
Explaining the Higgs decays at the LHC with an extended electroweak model,Alexandre Alves; E Ramirez Barreto; AG Dias; CA de S Pires; Farinaldo S Queiroz; PS Rodrigues da Silva,Abstract We show that the observed enhancement in the diphoton decays of the recentlydiscovered new boson at the LHC; which we assume to be a Higgs boson; can be naturallyexplained by a new doublet of charged vector bosons from extended electroweak modelswith SU (3) C⊗ SU (3) L⊗ U (1) X symmetry. These models are also rather economical inexplaining the measured signal strengths; within the current experimental errors; demandingfewer assumptions and less parameters tuning. Our results show a good agreementbetween the theoretical expected sensitivity to a 126–125 GeV Higgs boson; and theexperimental significance observed in the diphoton channel at the 8 TeV LHC. Effects of aninvisible decay channel for the Higgs boson are also taken into account; in order toanticipate a possible confirmation of deficits in the branching ratios into ZZ∗; WW∗ …,The European Physical Journal C,2013,52

Interpreting the CMS ℓ+ ℓ− j j+ missing transverse energy excess with a leptoquark model,Ben Allanach; Alexandre Alves; Farinaldo S Queiroz; Kuver Sinha; Alessandro Strumia,Abstract We present a model of leptoquarks (LQs) with a significant partial branching ratiointo an extra sector; taken to be a viable dark matter candidate; other than the canonicallepton and jets final state. For LQs with mass around 500 GeV; the model reproduces therecent excess claimed by the CMS Collaboration in the ℓ+ ℓ− jj ET final state: the event rate;the distribution in the dilepton invariant mass and the rapidity range are compatible with thedata. The model is compatible with other collider bounds including LQ searches; as well asbounds from meson mixing and decays. Prospects of discovery at run II of the LHC arediscussed.,Physical Review D,2015,39
Unravelling the sbottom spin at the CERN LHC,Alexandre Alves; Oscar Eboli,Abstract Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtedly supersymmetric requiresnot only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probing their spins andcouplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at the CERN Large HadronCollider using only angular correlations in the reaction pp→ bb*→ bb p̸ T; which allow usto distinguish a universal extra dimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottomquark from supersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channelprovides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom production rate andbranching ratio into b χ 1 0 are sufficiently large to have a clear signal above standard modelbackgrounds.,Physical Review D,2007,38
Is the new resonance spin 0 or 2? Taking a step forward in the Higgs boson discovery,Alexandre Alves,Abstract The observation of a new boson of mass∼ 125 GeV at the CERN LHC may finallyhave revealed the existence of a Higgs boson. Now we have the opportunity to scrutinize itsproperties; determining its quantum numbers and couplings to the standard model particles;in order to confirm or not its discovery. We show that by the end of the 8 TeV run; combiningthe entire data sets of ATLAS and CMS; it will be possible to discriminate between thefollowing discovery alternatives: a narrow scalar JP= 0+ or a tensor JP= 2+ particle withminimal couplings to photons; at a 5 σ statistical confidence level at least; using onlydiphoton events. Our results are based on the calculation of a center-edge asymmetrymeasure of the reconstructed sPlot scattering polar angle of the diphotons. The resultsbased on asymmetries are shown to be robust against systematic uncertainties on signal …,Physical Review D,2012,37
Charged Higgs boson pairs at the CERN LHC,Alexandre Alves; Tilman Plehn,Abstract We compute the cross section for pair production of charged Higgs bosons at theLHC and compare the three production mechanisms. The bottom-parton scattering processis computed to next-to-leading order (NLO); and the validity of the bottom-parton approach isestablished in detail. The light-flavor Drell-Yan cross section is evaluated at NLO as well.The gluon-fusion process through a one-loop amplitude is then compared with these tworesults. We show how a complete sample of events could look; in terms of total crosssections and distributions of the heavy final states.,Physical Review D,2005,33
Signals for new spin-1 resonances in electroweak gauge boson pair production at the LHC,Alexandre Alves; Oscar Jose Pinto Eboli; D Goncalves Netto; Maria C Gonzalez-Garcia; Jose K Mizukoshi,Abstract The mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) will be directlyscrutinized soon at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We analyze the LHC potential to lookfor new vector bosons associated with the EWSB sector; presenting a possible modelindependent approach to search for these new spin-1 resonances. We show that theanalyses of the processes pp→ ℓ+ ℓ′− E̸ T; ℓ±jj E̸ T; ℓ′±ℓ+ ℓ− E̸ T; ℓ±jj E̸ T; and ℓ+ℓ− jj (with ℓ; ℓ′= e or μ and j= jet) have a large reach at the LHC and can lead to thediscovery or exclusion of many EWSB scenarios such as Higgsless models.,Physical Review D,2009,32
Searching for Elko dark matter spinors at the CERN LHC,Alexandre Alves; Fernando de Campos; Marco Dias; J M. Hoff da Silva,The aim of this paper is to explore the possibility of discovering a fermionic field with massdimension one; the Elko field; in the Large Hadron Collider. Due to its mass dimension; anElko can only interact either with Standard Model spinors and gauge fields at one-loop orderor at tree level through a quartic interaction with the Higgs field. In this Higgs portal scenario;the Elko is a viable candidate to a dark matter constituent which has been shown to becompatible with relic abundance measurements from WMAP and direct dark mattersearches. We propose a search strategy for this dark matter candidate in the channel at theLHC. We show the LHC potential to discover the Elko considering a triple Higgs–Elkoscoupling as small as~ 0.5 after 1 ab-1 of integrated luminosity. Some phenomenologicalconsequences of this new particle and its collider signatures are also discussed.,International Journal of Modern Physics A,2015,23
Searches for dark matter at the LHC: a multivariate analysis in the mono-Z channel,Alexandre Alves; Kuver Sinha,Abstract We study dark matter (DM) production in the mono-Z channel at the 13 TeV LHCboth in an effective field theory framework and in simplified models with vector mediators;using a multivariate analysis. For DM-quark effective operators with scalar; vector; andtensor couplings and DM mass of 100 GeV; the 5 σ reach in the DM interaction scale Λ isaround 2; 1; and 3 TeV; respectively; for 3 ab− 1 and assuming a 5% systematic uncertaintyon the total background normalization. For simplified models with leptophobic vectormediators; the 5 σ reach for the mass of the mediator is 1.7 TeV also assuming a 5%systematics and 3 ab− 1 of integrated luminosity. The reach for the dark matter interactionscale obtained with the multivariate analysis using a likelihood function discriminant is atleast twice as high as that obtained from a simple cut and count analysis; once …,Physical Review D,2015,19
Multi-photon signatures at the Fermilab Tevatron,AG Akeroyd; A Alves; MA Diaz; O Éboli,Abstract Fermiophobic Higgs bosons (hf) exhibiting large branching ratios for decay to twophotons can arise in models with two or more scalar doublets and/or triplets. In such modelsthe conventional production mechanisms at hadron colliders; which rely on the hf VVcoupling (V= W; Z); may be rendered ineffective due to severe mixing angle suppression. Inthis scenario; double hf production may proceed via the complementary mechanism qq'→H±hf with subsequent decay H±→ hf W*; leading to events with up to four photons. Weperform a simulation of the detection prospects of hf in the multi-photon (> 3) channel at theFermilab Tevatron and show that a sizeable region of the (m H±; m hf) parameter space canbe probed during Run II.,The European Physical Journal C-Particles and Fields,2006,19
Robust CERN LHC Higgs boson search in weak boson fusion,Alexandre Alves; Oscar Eboli; Tilman Plehn; David Rainwater,Abstract We demonstrate that a CERN LHC Higgs boson search in weak boson fusionproduction with subsequent decay to weak boson pairs is robust against extensions of thestandard model or minimal supersymmetric standard model involving a large number ofHiggs doublets. We also show that the transverse mass distribution provides unambiguousdiscrimination of a continuum Higgs signal from the standard model.,Physical Review D,2004,19
Production of charged Higgs bosons in a 3-3-1 model at the CERN LHC,A Alves; E Ramirez Barreto; AG Dias,Abstract We perform a study of the charged Higgs production from an SU (3) C⊗ SU (3) L⊗U (1) X model with right-handed neutrinos; postulating a custodial symmetry which reducesthe number of free parameters in the scalar potential. We compute the cross sections forcharged scalars for typical and new production modes. One of the new SU (3) L neutralgauge bosons; Z′; affects some production cross sections distinguishing the model fromother standard model extensions like; for example; the minimal supersymmetric standardmodel and general two-Higgs doublets models. The interplay between the Higgs sector ofthe model and that Z′ gauge boson enhances substantially all the production rates of thelightest charged Higgs boson; H 1±; at hadron colliders compared to the MSSM. We foundthat a large portion of the parameters space can be probed at the LHC running at 14 TeV …,Physical Review D,2011,17
Deciphering the spin of new resonances in Higgsless models,Alexandre Alves; Oscar Jose Pinto Eboli; MC Gonzalez-Garcia; JK Mizukoshi,Abstract We study the potential of the CERN large hadron collider to probe the spin of newmassive vector boson resonances predicted by Higgsless models. We consider itsproduction via weak boson fusion which relies only on the coupling between the newresonances and the weak gauge bosons. We show that the large hadron collider will beable to unravel the spin of the particles associated with the partial restoration of unitarity invector boson scattering for integrated luminosities of 150–560 fb− 1; depending on the newstate mass and on the method used in the analyses.,Physical Review D,2009,17
Stop-lepton associated production at hadron colliders,Alexandre Alves; Oscar Eboli; Tilman Plehn,Abstract At hadron colliders; the search for R-parity violating supersymmetry can probescalar masses beyond what is covered by pair production processes. We evaluate the next-to-leading order SUSY-QCD corrections to the associated stop or sbottom production with alepton through R-parity violating interactions. We show that higher order corrections renderthe theoretical predictions more stable with respect to variations of the renormalization andfactorization scales and that the total cross section is enhanced by a factor up to 70% at theTevatron and 50% at the LHC. We investigate in detail how the heavy supersymmetric statesdecouple from the next-to-leading order process; which gives rise to a theory with anadditional scalar leptoquark. In this scenario the inclusion of higher order QCD correctionsincreases the Tevatron reach on leptoquark masses by up to 40 GeV and the LHC reach …,Physics Letters B,2003,17
Augury of darkness: the low-mass dark Z′ portal,Alexandre Alves; Giorgio Arcadi; Yann Mambrini; Stefano Profumo; Farinaldo S Queiroz,A bstract Dirac fermion dark matter models with heavy Z′ mediators are subject to stringentconstraints from spin-independent direct searches and from LHC bounds; cornering them tolive near the Z′ resonance. Such constraints can be relaxed; however; by turning off thevector coupling to Standard Model fermions; thus weakening direct detection bounds; or byresorting to light Z′ masses; below the Z pole; to escape heavy resonance searches at theLHC. In this work we investigate both cases; as well as the applicability of our findings toMajorana dark matter. We derive collider bounds for light Z′ gauge bosons using the CL Smethod; spin-dependent scattering limits; as well as the spin-independent scattering ratearising from the evolution of couplings between the energy scale of the mediator mass andthe nuclear energy scale; and indirect detection limits. We show that such scenarios are …,Journal of High Energy Physics,2017,15
Matter-parity as a residual gauge symmetry: Probing a theory of cosmological dark matter,Alexandre Alves; Giorgio Arcadi; PV Dong; Laura Duarte; Farinaldo S Queiroz; José WF Valle,Abstract We discuss a non-supersymmetric scenario which addresses the origin of thematter-parity symmetry; PM=(− 1) 3 (B− L)+ 2 s; leading to a viable Dirac fermion dark mattercandidate. Implications to electroweak precision; muon anomalous magnetic moment; flavorchanging interactions; lepton flavor violation; dark matter and collider physics are discussedin detail. We show that this non-supersymmetric model is capable of generating the matter-parity symmetry in agreement with existing data with gripping implications to particle physicsand cosmology.,Physics Letters B,2017,12

We explore the possibility of a triple coupling with the Higgsfield; generating also a contribution to the Elko mass term; and suggest some possibilities forfuture studies in this field.,International Journal of Modern Physics D,2014,12
Collider and dark matter searches in the inert doublet model from Peccei-Quinn symmetry,Alexandre Alves; Daniel A Camargo; Alex G Dias; Robinson Longas; Celso C Nishi; Farinaldo S Queiroz,A bstract Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions are arguably the mostcompelling dark matter candidates in the literature. Could they coexist as dark matterparticles? More importantly; can they be incorporated in a well motivated framework inagreement with experimental data? In this work; we show that this two component darkmatter can be realized in the Inert Doublet Model in an elegant and natural manner by virtueof the spontaneous breaking of a Peccei-Quinn U (1) PQ symmetry into a residual ℤ 2 Z _2symmetry. The WIMP stability is guaranteed by the ℤ 2 Z _2 symmetry and a new dark mattercomponent; the axion; arises. There are two interesting outcomes:(i) vector-like quarksneeded to implement the Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the model may act as a portal betweenthe dark sector and the SM fields with a supersymmetry-type phenomenology at colliders; …,Journal of High Energy Physics,2016,11
A model with chiral quarks of electric charges− 4/3 and 5/3,Alexandre Alves; E Ramirez Barreto; DA Camargo; AG Dias,A bstract We present a new model based on the SU (3)⨂ SU (2)⨂ U (1) symmetry; in whichthere is a new consistent set of chiral fermion fields that renders the model free fromanomalies. The new fermions do not share the usual family structure of the Standard Modeland some of them have exotic electric charges; as the quarks X and Y with electric charge5/3 and− 4/3; respectively. Interestingly; the model contains a new heavy neutral leptonwhich may be a dark matter candidate. Two Higgs doublets are present in our construction;so that two CP even scalars are present in the model particle spectrum. One of them issimilar to the Standard Model Higgs boson; while the other one couples mainly with the newexotic fermions. We performed a discovery analysis showing that the 8 TeV LHC can find theY quark from single and pair production with masses from 300 GeV up to~ 750 GeV. We …,Journal of High Energy Physics,2013,11
Maximum Entropy Principle and the Higgs boson mass,Alexandre Alves; Alex G Dias; Roberto da Silva,Abstract A successful connection between Higgs boson decays and the Maximum EntropyPrinciple is presented. Based on the information theory inference approach we determinethe Higgs boson mass as MH= 125.04±0.25 GeV; a value fully compatible to the LHCmeasurement. This is straightforwardly obtained by taking the Higgs boson branching ratiosas the target probability distributions of the inference; without any extra assumptions beyondthe Standard Model. Yet; the principle can be a powerful tool in the construction of anymodel affecting the Higgs sector. We give; as an example; the case where the Higgs bosonhas an extra invisible decay channel within a Higgs portal model.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,2015,10
Observing Higgs dark matter at the CERN LHC,Alexandre Alves,Abstract Triggering the electroweak symmetry breaking may not be the only key role playedby the Higgs boson in particle physics. In a recently proposed warped five-dimensional SO(5)⊗ U (1) gauge-Higgs unification model; the Higgs boson can also constitute the darkmatter that permeates the universe. The stability of the Higgs boson in this model isguaranteed in all orders of perturbation theory by the conservation of an H-parity quantumnumber that forbids triple couplings to all standard model (SM) particles. Such a uniquefeature of the model shows up as a delay in the restoration of the tree-level unitarity; which inturn enhances the production cross section as compared to the standard model analogue.Recent astrophysical data constrain the mass of such a Higgs dark matter particle to anarrow window of 70–90 GeV range. We show that the Large Hadron Collider can …,Physical Review D,2010,8
Jets plus same-sign dileptons signatures from fermionic leptoquarks at the LHC,Alexandre Alves; E Ramirez Barreto; AG Dias,Abstract Within the 3-3-1 model framework; we consider the production and decay offermionic leptoquarks into a striking experimental signature at the LHC: a narrow resonanceat the b jet plus same-sign dileptons channel. The data already accumulated by the LHCcollaborations may hide a large number of events associated to the production and decay ofsuch exotic quarks; allowing one to investigate large portions of the parameters space of themodel. The observation or not of such events would shed light on the construction of modelspresenting heavy exotic quarks.,Physical Review D,2012,6
Maximum Entropy Inferences on the Axion Mass in Models with Axion-Neutrino Interaction,Alexandre Alves; Alex Gomes Dias; Roberto da Silva,Abstract In this work; we use the maximum entropy principle (MEP) to infer the mass of anaxion which interacts to photons and neutrinos in an effective low energy theory. TheShannon entropy function to be maximized is defined in terms of the axion branching ratios.We show that MEP strongly constrains the axion mass taking into account the currentexperimental bounds on the neutrinos masses. Assuming that the axion is massive enoughto decay into all the three neutrinos and that MEP fixes all the free parameters of the model;the inferred axion mass is in the interval 0.1 eV< m A< 0.2 eV; which can be tested byforthcoming experiments such as IAXO. However; even in the case where MEP fixes just theaxion mass and no other parameter; we found that 0.1 eV< m A< 6.3 eV in the DFSZ modelwith right-handed neutrinos. Moreover; a light axion; allowed to decay to photons and the …,Brazilian Journal of Physics,2017,5
Stacking machine learning classifiers to identify Higgs bosons at the LHC,Alexandre Alves,Abstract Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been employed in the problem ofclassifying signal and background events with high accuracy in particle physics. In thispaper; we compare the performance of a widespread ML technique; namely; stackedgeneralization; against the results of two state-of-art algorithms:(1) a deep neural network(DNN) in the task of discovering a new neutral Higgs boson and (2) a scalable machinelearning system for tree boosting; in the Standard Model Higgs to tau leptons channel; bothat the 8 TeV LHC. In a cut-and-count analysis; stacking three algorithms performed around16% worse than DNN but demanding far less computation efforts; however; the samestacking outperforms boosted decision trees. Using the stacked classifiers in a multivariatestatistical analysis (MVA); on the other hand; significantly enhances the statistical …,Journal of Instrumentation,2017,5
Diphotons at the Z-pole in models of the 750 GeV resonance decaying to axion-like particles,Alexandre Alves; Alex G Dias; Kuver Sinha,A bstract Models in which the 750 GeV resonance (S) decays to two light axion-like particles(ALPs a); which in turn decay to collimated photons mimicking the observed signal; aremotivated by Hidden Valley scenarios and could also provide a mechanism by which a S→γγ signal persists while S→ Z γ; ZZ and WW remain subdued in the near future. We point outthat these Hidden Valley like models invoking S→ aa→ 4γ must also contend with Z→ a (→γγ) γ constraints coming from CDF and ATLAS. Within an effective field theory framework; wework out the constraints on the couplings of S to a and gauge bosons coming from photonicZ decays and ensuring that the ALPs decay inside the electromagnetic calorimeter; in tworegimes—where a decays primarily to photons; and where a also has hadronic branchings.The analysis is done for both when S has a large as well as a narrow width; and for …,Journal of High Energy Physics,2016,5
Heavy Higgs boson coupled to vectorlike quarks: Strong C P problem and search prospects at the 14 TeV LHC,Alexandre Alves; Daniel A Camargo; Alex G Dias,Abstract Motivated by a solution to the strong CP problem; we propose a model where a newheavy neutral C P-even Higgs boson couples to vectorlike quarks enhancing its productioncross section whose dominant decays are into weak bosons. The masses of the vectorlikequarks are generated through interactions with a singlet scalar field charged under a brokenglobal U (1) symmetry; providing a solution to the strong CP problem by means of the Peccei-Quinn mechanism. The diboson excess observed by the ATLAS Collaboration is discussedas the new heavy Higgs boson is a candidate to explain a possible signal in this channel.We also show that the 14 TeV LHC is capable of discovering this heavy Higgs with massesup to 1 TeV in the H→ ZZ→ ℓ+ ℓ− ℓ′+ ℓ′− search channel using boosted decision trees tobetter discriminate between signals and backgrounds and to tame systematic …,Physical Review D,2016,5
Can we discover double Higgs production at the LHC?,Alexandre Alves; Tathagata Ghosh; Kuver Sinha,Abstract We explore double Higgs production via gluon fusion in the bb γ γ channel at thehigh-luminosity LHC using machine learning tools. We first propose a Bayesian optimizationapproach to select cuts on kinematic variables; obtaining a 30%–50% increase in thesignificance compared to current results in the literature. We show that this improvementpersists once systematic uncertainties are taken into account. We next use boosted decisiontrees (BDT) to further discriminate signal and background events. Our analysis shows that ajoint optimization of kinematic cuts and BDT hyperparameters results in an appreciableimprovement in the significance. Finally; we perform a multivariate analysis of the outputscores of the BDT. We find that assuming a very low level of systematics; the techniquesproposed here will be able to confirm the production of a pair of standard model Higgs …,Physical Review D,2017,4
Stochastic model of self-driven two-species objects inspired by particular aspects of a pedestrian dynamics,Roberto da Silva; Agenor Hentz; Alexandre Alves,Abstract In this work we propose a model to describe the fluctuations of self-driven objects(species A) walking against a crowd of particles in the opposite direction (species B) in orderto simulate the spatial properties of the particle distribution from a stochastic point of view.Driven by concepts from pedestrian dynamics; in a particular regime known as stop-and-gowaves; we propose a particular single-biased random walk (SBRW). This setup is modeledboth via partial differential equations (PDE) and by using a probabilistic cellular automaton(PCA) method. The problem is non-interacting until the opposite particles visit the same cellof the target particles; which generates delays on the crossing time that depends on theconcentration of particles of opposite species per cell. We analyzed the fluctuations on theposition of particles and our results show a non-regular propagation characterized by …,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,2015,3
Spins in gluino decays,Alexandre Alves; Oscar Éboli; Tilman Plehn,To unambiguously claim that we see a gluino at the LHC we need to prove its fermionicnature. Looking only at angular correlations we can distinguish a universal extradimensional interpretation of a gluino cascade decay (assuming a bosonic heavy gluon)from supersymmetry. In addition to the known lepton‐hadron asymmetries we also use ofpurely hadronic correlations in the gluino‐sbottom decay chain.,AIP Conference Proceedings,2007,2
Constraining Elko Dark Matter at the LHC with Monophoton Events,Alexandre Alves; M Dias; F de Campos; L Duarte; JM da Silva,Abstract: A mass dimension one fermion; also known as Elko; constitutes a dark mattercandidate which might interact with photons at the tree level in a specific fashion. In thiswork; we investigate the constraints imposed by unitarity and LHC data on this type ofinteractions using the search for new physics in monophoton events. We found that Elkoswhich can explain the dark matter relic abundance mainly through electromagneticinteractions are excluded at the 95\% CL by the 8 TeV LHC data for masses up to 1 TeV.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.05180,2017,1

Inferences on the Higgs Boson and Axion Masses through a Maximum Entropy Principle,Alexandre Alves; Alex G Dias; Roberto da Silva,Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) is a method that can be used to infer thevalue of an unknown quantity in a set of probability functions. In this work we review twoapplications of MEP: one giving a precise inference of the Higgs boson mass value; and theother one allowing to infer the mass of the axion. In particular; for the axion we assume that ithas a decay channel into pairs of neutrinos; in addition to the decay into two photons. TheShannon entropy associated to an initial ensemble of axions decaying into photons andneutrinos is then built for maximization.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.00417,2017,*
Collider Detection of Dark Matter Electromagnetic Anapole Moments,Alexandre Alves; ACO Santos; Kuver Sinha,Abstract: Dark matter that interacts with the Standard Model by exchanging photons throughhigher multipole interactions occurs in a wide range of both strongly as well as weaklycoupled hidden sector models. We study the collider detection prospects of thesecandidates; with a focus on Majorana dark matter that couples through the anapole moment.The study is conducted at the effective field theory level with the mono-$ Z $ signatureincorporating varying levels of systematic uncertainties at the high-luminosity LHC. Theprojected collider reach on the anapole moment is then compared to the reach coming fromdirect detection experiments like LZ. Finally; the analysis is applied to a weakly coupledcompletion with leptophilic dark matter.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.11290,2017,*

On Dynamic Modelling of Compressed Air Engine With Connecting-Rod-Crank to Control Angular Position of Oscillating Rotation,Alexandre C Alves; Jose M Balthazar; Angelo M Tusset; Rodrigo T Rocha; Atila M Bueno,abstract In this work is examined the dynamic behavior and the controllability of acompressed air engine with a connecting-rod-crank. The pneumatic motor is composed by amonocylinder; a connecting-rod and a control crank to the oscillating rotation. For theobtainment the nonlinear mathematical model was considered the Lagrange's method andthe components of the physical system in the model are considered as rigid bodies withunilateral restriction. Numerical analysis of the application of the passive control position bya nonconservative pneumatic force with pilot valves in the cylinder showed that it was notpossible an exact control to the angular position desired for the output crank. To solve thisproblem; it is proposed an active control by the Linear Quadratic Regulator method (LQR); tothe control of the connecting-rod-crank mechanism.

Interpreting the CMS l+ l-jj missing ET Excess with a Leptoquark Model,Ben Allanach; Alexandre Alves; Farinaldo S Queiroz; Kuver Sinha; Alessandro Strumia,We present a model of leptoquarks (LQs) with a significant partial branching ratio into anextra sector; taken to be a viable dark matter candidate; other than the canonical lepton andjets final state. For LQs with mass around 500 GeV; the model reproduces the recent excessclaimed by the CMS collaboration in\ell^+\ell^-jj\met final state: the event rate; thedistribution in di-lepton invariant mass and the rapidity range are compatible with the data.The model is compatible with other collider bounds including LQ searches; as well asbounds from meson mixing and decays.

Stochastic model of self-driven two-species objects in the context of the pedestrian dynamics,Roberto da Silva; Agenor Hentz; Alexandre Alves,Abstract: In this work we propose a model to describe the statistical fluctuations of the self-driven objects (species A) walking against an opposite crowd (species B) in order tosimulate the regime characterized by stop-and-go waves in the context of pedestriandynamics. By using the concept of single-biased random walks (SBRW); this setup ismodeled both via partial differential equations and by Monte-Carlo simulations. The problemis non-interacting until the opposite particles visit the same cell of the considered particle. Inthis situation; delays on the residence time of the particles per cell depends on theconcentration of particles of opposite species. We analyzed the fluctuations on the positionof particles and our results show a non-regular diffusion characterized by long-tailed andasymmetric distributions which is better fitted by some chromatograph distributions found …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1408.2177,2014,*
Is There a Hidden Principle in the Higgs Boson Decay to Photons?,Alexandre Alves; E Ramirez Barreto; AG Dias,Abstract: It is remarkable that the measured Higgs boson mass is so close to the value whichmaximizes the Higgs decay rate to photons as predicted by the Standard Model. In this workwe explore the consequences to assume that an $\sim 125$ GeV Higgs boson mass is notaccidental; but fixed by some fundamental principle that enforces it to maximize its decayrate into photons. The principle is motivated by the evidence that only a very small volume ofthe parameters space of the Standard Model; which contains their measured values; couldlead to a maximal Higgs boson with that mass. If the principle actually holds; severalStandard Model features get fixed; as the number of fermion families; quark colors; and theCP nature of the new boson; for example. We also illustrate how such principle can placestrong bounds on new physics scenarios as a Higgs dark portal model and a Two Higgs …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5333,2013,*
CERN LHC,A Alves; E Ramirez Barreto; AG Dias,Abstract We perform a study of the charged Higgs production from an SU (3) C⊗ SU (3) L⊗U (1) X model with right-handed neutrinos; postulating a custodial symmetry which reducesthe number of free parameters in the scalar potential. We compute the cross sections forcharged scalars for typical and new production modes. One of the new SU (3) L neutralgauge bosons; Z′; affects some production cross sections distinguishing the model fromother Standard Model extensions like; for example; the Minimal Supersymmetric StandardModel and general two Higgs doublets models. The interplay between the Higgs sector ofthe model and that Z′ gauge boson enhances substantialy all the production rates of thelightest charged Higgs boson; H±1; at hadron colliders compared to the MSSM.

A new set of chiral fermions within the standard model gauge group,A Alves; Barreto Ramirez; A Gomes Dias,Full text: Interest in a sequential fouth generation has generated a number of theoretical andexperimental investigations over the years; but the number of light neutrinos at the Z poleand electroweak precision measurements ruled out a fourth generation. At present; theneutrino oscillations suggested the possibility of a mass scale beyond the standard modeland thus; models with a fourth generation containing a sufficiently massive neutrino becameacceptable. In addition; it was also pointed out that if the fourth generation masses are notdegenerate; then these constraints can be evaded. On the other hand; the existence ofleptons and quarks with exotic electrical charges has received attention from the theoreticalpoint of view; because these exotic particles can be include in constructions such as granunification theories and models with extra dimensions.

Suchparticle is predicted in certain sorts of theories beyond the standard model. In particular; thisexotic quark appears as component of the third-generation fermions spectrum at the minimal3-3-1 model. We explore the production of J3 at the LHC for the cm energy range 7 TeV and14 TeV and the proposed luminosity. By considering the photon; Z and Z s-channelcontributions at tree level we obtain the total cross section and the number of events for thisprocess.
