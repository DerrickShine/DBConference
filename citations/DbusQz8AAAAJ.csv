The Web Service Modeling Ontology,Jos De Bruijn; Dieter Fensel; Mick Kerrigan; Uwe Keller; Holger Lausen; James Scicluna,In the previous chapter we have identified several aspects of services that need to bedescribed in order to effectively find and use these services. This includes the functional andnonfunctional description of the service; as well as a description of the behavior and theinterface. We have also identified the need for common terminologies and suggested theuse of ontologies for their description; using a common vocabulary across descriptions is aprerequisite to be able to match descriptions of Web services and user requirements. TheWeb Service Modeling Ontology WSMO [57; 121] provides a conceptual model for thedescription of Web services. WSMO distinguishes between user goals; which aredescriptions of the desires of the requester; and Web service descriptions; which aredescriptions of the functionality and interface of the service offered by the provider …,Modeling Semantic Web Services: The Web Service Modeling Language,2008,337
Service rings-a semantic overlay for service discovery in ad hoc networks,Michael Klein; Birgitta Konig-Ries; Philipp Obreiter,Mobile devices are able to spontaneously form highly dynamic ad hoc networks allowing forcommunication even when no infrastructure exists. Ideally; these networks enable theparticipating devices to share resources and services; thus overcoming the often severelimitations of the individual devices' capabilities. In order to make this possible; powerfulsemantic service trading is needed. In this paper; we propose a semantic overlay ofhierarchical service rings to achieve this goal. In contrast to existing approaches this methodis adapted to the specific characteristics of ad hoc networks.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2003.

Lanes-a lightweight overlay for service discovery in mobile ad hoc networks,Michael Klein; Birgitta Konig-Ries; Philipp Obreiter,Abstract The ability to discover services offered in a mobile ad hoc network is the majorprerequisite for effective usability of these networks. Unfortunately; existing approaches toservice trading are not well suited for these highly dynamic topologies since they either relyon centralized servers or on resource-consuming query flooding. Application layer overlaysseem to be a more promising approach. However; existing solutions like the Content-Addressable Network (CAN) are especially designed for internet based peerto-peernetworks yielding structural conditions that are far too complex for ad hoc networks.Therefore; in this paper; we propose a more lightweight overlay structure: lanes. We presentalgorithms to correct and optimize its structure in case of topology changes and show how itenables the trading of services specified by arbitrary descriptions.,3rd Workshop on Applications and Services in Wireless Networks (ASWN2003).

DIANE: an integrated approach to automated service discovery; matchmaking and composition,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries; Mirco Stern; Michael Klein,Abstract Automated matching of semantic service descriptions is the key to automatic servicediscovery and binding. But when trying to find a match for a certain request it may oftenhappen; that the request cannot be serviced by a single offer but could be handled bycombining existing offers. In this case automatic service composition is needed. Althoughautomatic composition is an active field of research it is mainly viewed as a planningproblem and treated separatedly from service discovery. In this paper we argue that anintegrated approach to the problem is better than seperating these issues as is usually done.We propose an approach that integrates service composition into service discovery andmatchmaking to match service requests that ask for multiple connected effects; discussgeneral issues involved in describing and matching such services and present an …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,100
What is needed for semantic service descriptions? A proposal for suitable language constructs,Michael Klein; Birgitta Konig-Ries; Michael Mussig,The big promise of service-oriented computing is the ability to form agile networks. Agilenetworks are networks of loosely coupled participants that cooperate by dynamicallydiscovering and invoking each other's services at run-time. The major prerequisite for thispromise to be fulfilled is an appropriate semantic service description. In this paper; weidentify requirements towards such a service description language and show that neither ofthe two main current approaches; OWL-S and WSMO; is able to fully meet theserequirements. We then proceed to suggest additional language constructs and a prototypicallanguage; the DIANE Service Description (DSD); which implements these constructs. Weexplain how service offers and requests can be described and matched using DSD.,International Journal of Web and Grid Services,2005,99

Additionally;responses to land use can differ greatly among different organisms; therefore; overall effectsof land-use on total local biodiversity are hardly known. To test for effects of LUI (quantifiedas the combined intensity of fertilization; grazing; and mowing) and interannual variation inLUI (SD in LUI across time); we introduce a unique measure of whole-ecosystembiodiversity; multidiversity. This synthesizes individual diversity measures across up to 49taxonomic groups of plants; animals; fungi; and bacteria from 150 grasslands.

A classification of issues and approaches in automatic service composition,Ulrich Küster; Mirco Stern; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract. Resulting from the constantly increasing usage of service oriented computing; theproblem of automatic composition of services is rapidly gaining attention. Many solutionshave been proposed; yet too little attention has been paid to thoroughly analyzing thedifferent needs that require the ability of (automatic) service composition. This papertherefore aims at identifying the different cases in which service composition is needed andat classifying existing approaches accordingly. Three distinguishable types of servicecomposition applications are described along with their basic problems and variousapproaches addressing the identified classes are presented.,Intl Workshop WESC,2005,70
Coupled signature and specification matching for automatic service binding,Michael Klein; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Matching of semantic service descriptions is the key to automatic service discoveryand binding. Existing approaches split the matchmaking process in two step: signature andspecification matching. However; this leads to the problem that offers are not found althoughthey are functionally suitable if their signature is not fitting the requested one. Therefore; inthis paper; we propose a matching algorithm that does not use a separated and explicitsignature matching step; but derives the necessary messages from the comparison of pre-and postconditions. As a result; the algorithm not only finds all functionally suitable serviceseven if their signatures do not match; but also is able to derive the messages needed for anautomatic invocation.,*,2004,61
An integration method for the specification of rule-oriented mediators,Holger Wache; Th Scholz; Helge Stieghahn; Brigitta Konig-Ries,Mediator specification and terminology development are two labor-intensive tasks that areserious obstacles to the widespread use of mediator-based systems. In this paper; wepropose a three-step approach to acquire mediator specifications and to gradually build adomain terminology at the same time. The approach also allows the support of softwareassistants; which help a user to acquire and verify the semantics of information sources. Wehave implemented a first prototype. The integration approach (without the assistants) iscurrently being evaluated by some users. Furthermore; we have started the development ofa second prototype which will include the couple of assistants mentioned in this article.,Database Applications in Non-Traditional Environments; 1999.(DANTE'99) Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on,1999,61
Stimulating cooperative behavior of autonomous devices: An analysis of requirements and existing approaches,Philipp Obreiter; Birgitta König-Ries; Michael Klein,Abstract In the context of mobile and wireless devices; an information system is no longer acentralized component storing all the relevant data nor is it a decentralized componentgoverned by a common authority. Rather; the information spread across huge numbers ofautonomous mobile and wireless devices owned by independent organizations andindividuals can be regarded as a highly dynamic; virtual information system. For this visionto become reality; the autonomous devices involved need to be motivated to cooperate. Thiscooperation needs to occur not only on the application layer; but; depending on the networkarchitecture; also on the lower layers from the link layer on upwards. In this report; weinvestigate on which protocol layers cooperation is needed and what constitutesuncooperative behavior. We then identify necessary properties of incentive schemes that …,*,2003,58

The single most important component of this goal is appropriatematchmaking. This paper presents a service-description language and its associatedmatchmaking algorithms. Together they precisely capture requester preferences throughfuzzy sets; express and use instance information for matchmaking; and deal efficiently withmultiple effects. The approach described here has been extensively evaluated both inexperiments and in the 2006 Semantic Web Services Challenge.,International Journal of Electronic Commerce,2007,54
Multi-layer clusters in ad-hoc networks—an approach to service discovery,Michael Klein; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract One of the core functionalities needed in ad-hoc peer-to-peer networks is servicediscovery. However; none of the existing solutions for service discovery work well in thesedynamic; decentralized environments. Therefore; in this paper; we propose a new approachto service discovery which is based on the dynamic organization of the services intomultilayer clusters. These clusters are formed based on both physical and semanticproximity.,International Conference on Research in Networking,2002,53
Open social student modeling: visualizing student models with parallel introspectiveviews,I-Han Hsiao; Fedor Bakalov; Peter Brusilovsky; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract This paper explores a social extension of open student modeling that we call opensocial student modeling. We present a specific implementation of this approach that usesparallel IntrospectiveViews to visualize models representing student progress with QuizJETparameterized self-assessment questions for Java programming. The interface allowsvisualizing not only the student's own model; but also displaying parallel views on themodels of their peers and the cumulative model of the entire class or group. The system wasevaluated in a semester-long classroom study. While the use of the system was non-mandatory; the parallel IntrospectiveViews interface caused an increase in all of the usageparameters in comparison to a regular portal-based access; which allowed the student toachieve a higher success rate in answering the questions.

Evaluation of semantic service discovery—a survey and directions for future research,Ulrich Küster; Holger Lausen; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract In recent years a huge amount of effort; and money has been invested in the area ofsemantic service discovery and presented approaches have become more sophisticatedand mature. Nevertheless surprisingly little effort is being put into the evaluation of theseapproaches. We argue that the lack of established and theoretically well-foundedmethodologies and test beds for comparative evaluation of semantic service discovery is amajor blocker of the advancement of the field. To lay the ground for a comprehensivetreatment of this problem we discuss the applicability of well-known evaluationmethodologies from information retrieval and provide an exhaustive survey of the currentevaluation approaches.,*,2008,48

Combining query and preference-an approach to fully automatize dynamic service binding,Michael Klein; Birgitta Konig-Ries,Web services will only have advantages over existing technologies if the service binding canbe performed dynamically. However; existing service description languages do not containenough information for a computer agent to do the selection automatically during runtime onbehalf of the user. This results from the fact that in most approaches the offer descriptionlanguage doubles as a re-guest language; which prevents the requestor from a preciseformulation of requests and preferences. Therefore; in this paper; we emphasize the needfor a distinguished service request language that allows to capture all of the requestor'spreferences. We present a concrete technique to represent such preference-containingrequests; which is based on fuzzy object sets.,Web Services; 2004. Proceedings. IEEE International Conference on,2004,29
Evaluating semantic web service matchmaking effectiveness based on graded relevance,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract. Semantic web services (SWS) promise to take service oriented computing to a newlevel by allowing to semi-automate timeconsuming programming tasks. At the core of SWSare solutions to the problem of SWS matchmaking; ie; the problem of comparing semanticgoal descriptions with semantic offer descriptions to determine services able to fulfill a givenrequest. Approaches to this problem have so far been evaluated based on binary relevancedespite the fact that virtually all SWS matchmakers support more fine-grained levels ofmatch. In this paper; a solution to this discrepancy is presented. A graded relevance scalefor SWS matchmaking is proposed as are measures to evaluate SWS matchmakers basedon such graded relevance scales. The feasibility of the approach is shown by means of apreliminary evaluation of two hybrid OWL-S matchmakers based on the proposed …,Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Service Matchmaking and Resource Retrieval in the Semantic Web-Volume 416,2008,28
IntrospectiveViews: an interface for scrutinizing semantic user models,Fedor Bakalov; Birgitta König-Ries; Andreas Nauerz; Martin Welsch,Abstract User models are a key component for user-adaptive systems. They representinformation about users such as interests; expertise; goals; traits; etc. This information isused to achieve various adaptation effects; eg; recommending relevant documents orproducts. To ensure acceptance by users; these models need to be scrutable; ie; users mustbe able to view and alter them to understand and if necessary correct the assumptions thesystem makes about the user. However; in most existing systems; this goal is not met. In thispaper; we introduce IntrospectiveViews; an interface that enables the user to view and edither user model. Furthermore; we present the results of a formative evaluation that show theimportance users give in general to different aspects of scrutable user models and alsosubstantiate our claim that IntrospectiveViews is an appropriate realization of an interface …,International Conference on User Modeling; Adaptation; and Personalization,2010,27
Dynamic Binding for BPEL Processes–A Lightweight Approach to Integrate Semantics into Web Services,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract The area of service oriented computing stretches between two extremes: On theone hand industry has pushed a whole stack of WS-* standards and tools to support theintegration of distributed services into business applications. These standards are used inproduction environments and are applied successfully; eg in the area of enterpriseapplication integration. However; the expensive and labor intensive task of putting togetherservices and maintaining and administering the composed applications has to be donemanually. In contrast; academia is busily working on numerous efforts leveraging ontologybased semantics and various AI planning techniques to automate these tasks. Yet; up tonow the developed technologies have rarely if ever been applied in industry. In our opinion;this has two main reasons: there is high cost involved in creating the necessary …,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2006,27

A Process and a Tool for Creating Service Descriptions based on DAML-S,Michael Klein; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract In distributed environments; collaboration is often achieved with the help ofservices. To enable automatic service trading; semantically expressive; automaticallycomparable; flexible; and editable service descriptions are needed. Our analysis shows thatonly ontology-based service descriptions like DAML-S offer the necessary expressivenessand flexibility. Unfortunately; up to now; DAML-S offers just a generic framework and lackssupport for creating and editing appropriate service descriptions for specific classes ofservices. Therefore; in this paper; we present an approach to improving the usability ofDAML-S. The two main building blocks of our approach are a process and a tool. Theprocess guides through the steps necessary to create adequate service descriptions byintroducing a layered ontology of services.

Strategies for semantic caching,Luo Li; Birgitta König-Ries; Niki Pissinou; Kia Makki,Abstract One major problem with the use of mediator-based architectures is long queryresponse times. An approach to shortening response times is to cache data at the mediatorsite. Recently; there has been growing interest in semantic query caching which maygenerally outperform the page and tuple caching approaches. In this paper; we present twosemantic-region caching strategies with different storage granularities for mediatorsaccessing relational databases. In contrast to most existing approaches; we do not onlycache the projection result of queries but also the condition attributes; resulting in a highercache hit rate. Additionally; we introduce the Profit-based Replacement algorithm with AgingCounter (PRAG); which incorporates the semantic notion of locality into the system.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2001,23

An approach to controlling user models and personalization effects in recommender systems,Fedor Bakalov; Marie-Jean Meurs; Birgitta König-Ries; Bahar Sateli; René Witte; Greg Butler; Adrian Tsang,Abstract Personalization nowadays is a commodity in a broad spectrum of computersystems. Examples range from online shops recommending products identified based onthe user's previous purchases to web search engines sorting search hits based on the userbrowsing history. The aim of such adaptive behavior is to help users to find relevant contenteasier and faster. However; there are a number of negative aspects of this behavior.Adaptive systems have been criticized for violating the usability principles of directmanipulation systems; namely controllability; predictability; transparency; andunobtrusiveness.

A Hybrid Approach to Identifying User Interests in Web Portals.,Fedor Bakalov; Birgitta König-Ries; Andreas Nauerz; Martin Welsch,Abstract: Web portals pioneered as one of the earliest adopters of personalizationtechniques to help users dealing with the problem of information overload. Nowadays theyare extensively used as a single-point of access to the vast amount of resources availableon the Web and in enterprise intranets. A number of researchers have been investigating thepossibilities to enable portals to deliver the content in a highly-personalized manner in orderto provide users with a quick and efficient access to the subset of resources relevant to theirinformation needs. However; in order to achieve such a personalization effect; the portalneeds accurate and up-to-date information about users; especially the information abouttheir interests.

Supporting dynamics in service descriptions-the key to automatic service usage,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract In realistic settings; service descriptions will never be precise reflections of theservices really offered. An online seller of notebooks; for instance; will most certainly notdescribe each and every notebook offered in his service description. This imprecisioncauses poor quality in discovery results. A matcher will be able to find potentially matchingservices but can give no guarantees that the concrete service needed will really beprovided. To alleviate this problem; a contract agreement phase between service providerand requester following the discovery has been suggested in the literature. In this paper; wepresent an approach to the automation of this contracting. At the heart of our solution is thepossibility to extend service descriptions with dynamically changing information and toprovide several means tailored to the abilities of the service provider to obtain this …,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2007,17

Integrating preferences into service requests to automate service usage,Michael Klein; Birgitta König-Ries,Today; web services are often used as a technology to integrate functionality of differententities. However; one important potential of service oriented computing is not exploited: theability to form agile networks. Here; service requestors and service providers are not fixedlytied together; rather; bindings to inefficient or unavailable service providers are transparentlyreplaced by bindings to more appropriate providers at runtime. In such an architecture; therobustness and efficiency would be increased dramatically. The main reason why thesenetworks are not a reality today is that current technologies do not allow for automaticservice selection and invocation; rather; they require human interaction to decide on anappropriate service provider. Obviously; this approach is not feasible in a system whereservice selection needs to be carried out repeatedly at run time. The most challenging …,First AKT Workshop on Semantic Web Services,2004,17

Stepwise refinable service descriptions: Adapting DAML-S to staged service trading,Michael Klein; Birgitta König-Ries; Philipp Obreiter,Abstract In order for service-oriented architectures to become successful; powerfulmechanisms are needed that allow service requestors to find service offerers that are able toprovide the services they need. Typically; this service trading needs to be executed inseveral stages as the offer descriptions are not complete in most cases and differentparameters have to be supplemented by the service requestor and offerer alternately.Unfortunately; existing service description languages (like DAML-S) treat service discoveryas a one shot activity rather than as a process and accordingly do not support this stepwiserefinement. Therefore; in this paper; we introduce the concept of partially instantiated servicedescriptions containing different types of variables which are instantiated successively;thereby mirroring the progress in a trading process. Moreover; we present possibilities …,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2003,17

Second; wewish to supply the user with a relatively simple model of the information provided in thesystem so that he can formulate queries without being aware of the existing informationsources or service providers and their locations. The system then uses its knowledge aboutavailable information sources to generate appropriate query execution plans.,International Workshop on Cooperative Information Agents,1997,17

A service distribution protocol for mobile ad hoc networks,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Achieving high service availability is a key requirement when deploying service-based applications over ad hoc networks. Without high availability; reliable serviceexecution cannot be achieved. Ad hoc network characteristics like ever-changing topologyand limited resources are the main challenges that need to be overcome in order to achievehigh availability. In this work we introduce our service distribution protocol that aims toincrease the availability of the services over ad hoc networks based on two mechanisms: aservice replication and a service hibernation mechanism. These mechanisms are usingmeasurements of both clients' and providers' interests in a specified service to obtain a goodservice distribution over participant nodes. A detailed simulation of our approach was donewhich shows promising results.,Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Pervasive services,2008,14
Process-oriented semantic knowledge management in product lifecycle management,Artur Felic; Birgitta König-Ries; Michael Klein,Abstract Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) focuses on management of product data andprocesses across their lifecycle stages. One of the key features of PLM is the management ofknowledge collected during product development. Reduced time to market; a bettercollaboration and savings are expected benefits of PLM amongst others. Theimplementation of a PLM System inside a company can be a hurdle because of the heavychange of the company structure during introduction. Most PLM solutions are based on oneintegrated product model that stores product data and shares these data with allcontributors. However; the access of product data by different expert domains can bechallenging when domain expert knowledge is necessary to understand it. This leads to acommunication overhead that increases cost; product development time and thus time to …,Procedia CIRP,2014,13
Service-orientation in mobile computing-an overview,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta Konig-Ries,In this paper; we argue why service-orientation is the appropriate computing paradigm touse in mobile and wireless environments. We explain how the limitations of mobile devicescan be overcome by functionality sharing via service-orientation. We identify some key areasthat need to be addressed in order for this vision to become a reality. We survey existingapproaches in these areas and discuss what is still missing.,Mobile Data Management; 2006. MDM 2006. 7th International Conference on,2006,13
Activity-based user modeling in wireless networks,Birgitta König-Ries; Michael Klein; Tobias Breyer,Abstract Wireless network research still lacks methods to evaluate the performance that canbe expected from application layer protocols. User behavior is the predominant factoraffecting network performance on this layer. It has two aspects: user mobility and usernetwork usage. These aspects are not orthogonal; but highly correlated: a user's mobilitypattern will influence her usage of the network. Existing approaches; however; reduce themodeling of user behavior to analytical mobility models and network traffic models; therebyseparating these intertwined parameters. This paper demonstrates how the use of anintegrated view based on the users' real-world activity can explain network-relevantparameters both with respect to mobility and to network usage and thereby allows a morenatural modeling of user behavior. The evaluation within a campus scenario shows that …,Mobile Networks and Applications,2006,13
Activity-based user modeling in service-oriented ad-hoc-networks,Tobias Breyer; Michael Klein; Philipp Obreiter; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Wireless network research still lacks methods to integratively evaluate theperformance that can be expected from application layer protocols. The user behavior ispredominantly affecting network performance and shows itself in two parts: its mobility andits network usage. However; it is often reduced to analytical mobility models and networktraffic models separating otherwise intertwined parameters. This paper demonstrates thatthe use of an integrated view based on the users' real-world activity can explain network-relevant parameters both with respect to mobility and to network usage and thereby allows amore natural and realistic modeling of user behavior. The benefits are presented with thehelp of our graph-based mobility model and its accompanying network usage model.,*,2004,13
Natural language processing for semantic assistance in web portals,Fedor Bakalov; Bahar Sateli; René Witte; Marie-Jean Meurs; Birgitta König-Ries,Web portals are a major class of web-based content management systems. They canprovide users with a single point of access to a multitude of content sources andapplications. However; further analysis of content brokered through a portal is not supportedby current portal systems; leaving it to their users to deal with information overload. Wepresent the first work examining the integration of natural language processing into webportals to provide users with semantic assistance in analyzing and interpreting content. Thisintegration is based on the portal standard JSR286 and open source NLP frameworks. Twoapplication scenarios; news analysis and biocuration; highlight the feasibility and usefulnessof our approach.,Semantic Computing (ICSC); 2012 IEEE Sixth International Conference on,2012,12

Relevance judgments for web services retrieval-a methodology and test collection for sws discovery evaluation,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries,Semantic web services (SWS) promise to take service oriented computing to a new level byallowing to automatically locate and use functionality exposed as web services. At the coreof SWS are solutions to the problem of SWS discovery; ie; the problem of comparingsemantic goal descriptions with semantic offer descriptions to determine services relevant toa given request. A plethora of different approaches to this problem have been proposed; buttheir comparative evaluation is challenging. While the evaluation setups from the informationretrieval (IR) community provided a natural starting point to SWS discovery evaluation; theapplicability of their assumptions have not been sufficiently discussed so far. This paperdiscusses the differences between traditional IR and SWS discovery and the resultingfundamental problems. It proposes a methodology and experimental setup for SWS …,Web Services; 2009.

Mobile users in heterogeneous environments with middleware platform,Niki Pissinou; Kia Makki; Birgitta Konig-Ries,Abstract Mobile computing is becoming more and more pervasive; liberating users from theconfines of wired networks. At the same time; transparent access to heterogeneous;distributed information sources has become a reality in wired computing. Obviously; this kindof access is highly desirable for mobile users; too. However; current architectures fortransparent information access do not take the specific needs of mobile users into account;while existing architectures for mobile computing do not support transparent access well.

Semantic enrichment of social media resources for adaptation,Oliver Schimratzki; Fedor Bakalov; Adrian Knoth; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract. With more and more dynamic content available on the web; we need systems thataggregate and filter information from different sources to provide us with only the informationwe are really interested in. In this paper; we present one such system; the CompleXys portal;aimed at users interested in complexity or subtopics thereof. It accesses a large variety ofdifferent information sources; among them calendars; news sites and blogs; semanticallyannotates and categorizes the retrieved content and displays only relevant content to theuser.,Proceedings of International Workshop on Adaptation in Social and Semantic Web (SAS-WEB 2010); Big Island of Hawaii,2010,11
Personalized recommendation of related content based on automatic metadata extraction,Andreas Nauerz; Fedor Bakalov; Birgitta König-Ries; Martin Welsch,Abstract In order to efficiently use information; users often need access to additionalbackground information. This additional information might be stored at various places; suchas news websites; company directories; geographic information systems; etc. Oftentimes; inorder to access these different pieces of information; the user has to launch new browserwindows and direct them to appropriate resources. In our today's Web 2.0; the problem ofaccessing background information becomes even more prominent: Due to the large numberof different users contributing; Web 2.0 sites grow quickly and; most often; in a moreuncoordinated way regarding; eg; structure and vocabulary used; than centrally controlledsites. In such an environment; finding relevant information can become a tedious task.

On the empirical evaluation of semantic web service approaches: Towards common SWS test collections,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries,Semantic web services have received a significant amount of attention in the last years andmany frameworks; algorithms and tools leveraging them have been proposed. Neverthelesssurprisingly little effort has been put into the evaluation of the approaches so far. The mainblocker of thorough evaluations is the lack of large and diverse test collections of semanticweb services. In this paper we analyze requirements on such collections and shortcomingsof the state of the art in this respect. Our contribution to overcoming those shortcomings isOPOSSum; a portal to support the community to build the necessary standard semantic webservice test collections in a collaborative way.,Semantic Computing; 2008 IEEE International Conference on,2008,11
Engineering incentive schemes for ad hoc networks,Philipp Obreiter; Birgitta König-Ries; Georgios Papadopoulos,Abstract In ad hoc networks; devices have to cooperate in order to compensate for theabsence of infrastructure. Yet; autonomous devices tend to abstain from cooperation in orderto save their own resources. Incentive schemes have been proposed as a means offostering cooperation under these circumstances. In order to work effectively; incentiveschemes need to be carefully tailored to the characteristics of the cooperation protocol theyshould support. This is a complex and demanding task. However; up to now; engineers aregiven virtually no help in designing an incentive scheme. Even worse; there exists nosystematic investigation into which characteristics should be taken into account and whatthey imply. Therefore; in this paper; we propose a systematic approach for the engineeringof incentive schemes.

On the evaluation of semantic web service frameworks,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries; Charles Petrie; Matthias Klusch,Abstract In recent years; a huge amount of research effort and funding has been devoted tothe area of Semantic Web services (SWS). This has resulted in the proposal of numerouscompeting approaches to facilitate the automation of mediation; choreography; anddiscovery for Web services using semantic annotations. However; despite a wealth oftheoretical work; too little effort has been spent toward the comparative experimentalevaluation of the competing approaches so far. Progress in scientific development andindustrial adoption is thereby hindered. An established evaluation methodology andstandard benchmarks that allow the comparative evaluation of different frameworks are thusneeded for the further advancement of the field. To this end; a criteria model for SWSevaluation is presented; and the existing approaches toward SWS evaluation are …,International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS),2008,10
Automatic construction of a semantic knowledge base from CEUR workshop proceedings,Bahar Sateli; René Witte,Abstract We present an automatic workflow that performs text segmentation and entityextraction from scientific literature to primarily address Task 2 of the Semantic PublishingChallenge 2015. The goal of Task 2 is to extract various information from full-text papers torepresent the context in which a document is written; such as the affiliation of its authors andthe corresponding funding bodies. Our proposed solution is composed of two subsystems:(i)A text mining pipeline; developed based on the GATE framework; which extracts structuraland semantic entities; such as authors' information and references; and produces semantic(typed) annotations; and (ii) a flexible exporting module; the LODeXporter; which translatesthe document annotations into RDF triples according to custom mapping rules.

A conceptual model for data management in the field of ecology,Javad Chamanara; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Conceptual models play an important role in identifying the domain under studyand establishing an interoperability framework between different scientific groups and toolsworking on the same or neighboring domains. The importance comes from the fact that theconceptual models describe the target domain in a technology agnostic manner; usingdomain terminology; considerations; and rules. In this paper we introduce a highly flexibledata and metadata structure for biodiversity (and related fields) information management.The model incorporates important concepts needed to develop a proper domain model formanaging biodiversity data; eg; data; data structure; metadata; metadata structure; andsemantic descriptions of model elements.

A web 3.0 approach for improving tagging systems,Alexander Kreiser; A Naurex; Fedor Bakalov,ABSTRACT In Web 2.0 systems tagging has become one of the most popular techniques toallow users (and entire user communities) to categorize content autonomously. But; currenttagging systems have their flipsides; though: synonyms and polysems lead to littered tagspaces making it difficult for users to find relevant content. Users suffer from retrievingcontent actually not being of interest or; vice versa; from not retrieving content that actuallywould be of interest when exploring the tag space. Moreover; in current tagging systems norelations between tags are modeled. Thus; recommending related tags (or content) is notpossible. In this paper we present an approach allowing users; ie the community; tocollaboratively model relations between tags. We provide UI components allowing to modelthese relations which are then stored in a SKOS-based ontology which can be leveraged …,Proceedings of the International Workshop on Web,2009,9
Ontology-based multidimensional personalization modeling for the automatic generation of mashups in next-generation portals,Fedor Bakalov; Birgitta König-Ries; Andreas Nauerz; Martin Welsch,Recently; the combination of portal and mashup technology has gained some attention.Portals were originally designed as single points of access to the information andapplications distributed across the enterprise. However; due to the increasing number ofresources available through portals; they have gained a new challenging goal: To provideusers with the information tailored to their individual needs and geared to the situation theyare working in. Mashups; the tools that dynamically integrate independent applications;seem to be a good technique to achieve this goal. What is needed; however; are means toautomatically create personalized mashups that optimally fit a user's information needs in agiven situation. In this paper; we describe our approach to this automatic mashupgeneration. At the core of our approach are different ontology-based models that describe …,Ontologies in Interactive Systems; 2008.

Mobile agents for locating documents in ad hoc networks,Khaled Nagi; Iman Elghandour; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract The wide availability of mobile devices equipped with wireless communicationcapabilities results in highly dynamic communities of mobile users. An interestingapplication in such an environment is decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing. Locating filesin a highly dynamic network while minimizing the consumption of scarce resources ischallenging. Since the availability of files changes significantly over time; an asynchronousapproach to searching is promising. In this paper; we show why existing file sharing systemscannot be used here and introduce our approach based on mobile agents.,International Workshop on Agents and P2P Computing,2003,9

A comparison on MANETs’ service replication schemes: Interest versus topology prediction,Mohamed Hamdy; Abdelouahid Derhab; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are characterized by high dynamics in particularwith respect to the formation of network partitions. The presence of unconnected partitionsmakes the deployed services inaccessible to some network participants. Service replicationis employed as an approach to overcome this problem and to ensure higher serviceavailability. Several protocols and algorithms for service replication in MANETs have beenproposed. Most of these approaches apply topological analysis (like partitioning prediction)schemes to produce the required replication decisions. One approach; SDP; the ServiceDistribution Protocol; bases its decisions on analyzing interest in the service; an applicationlayer concept. In this paper; we compare the performance of approaches based on thesetwo criteria. First; we analyze protocols based on topology prediction and choose two …,*,2010,8

An Extended Analysis of an Interest-based Service Distribution Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks.,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract: In principle; service orientation is a suitable paradigm to allow for effective resourcesharing in wireless ad hoc networks. However; special attention needs to be paid to ensurea high service availability since this is the basis for reliable service execution. Unfortunately;typical characteristics of ad hoc networks like everchanging topology and limited resourceshave a dramatic negative effect on service availability. Therefore; special measures areneeded to cope with this problem. In general; replication for services as well as datarepresents an efficient solution when the availability of some resource needs to be ensured.In this paper; we extend the service replication and distribution protocol presented in ourprior work which is based on the interest of clients and providers of a specified service bytaking into account not just one but all partitions of the network.

A New View on Normativeness in Distributed Reputation Systems,Philipp Obreiter; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Autonomous entities in artificial societies are only willing to cooperate with entitiesthey trust. Reputation systems keep track of the entities' behavior and; thus; are a widelyused means to support trust formation. In a P2P network; the reputation system needs to bedistributed to the individual entities. In previous work; we have shown that some of thelimitations of distributed reputation systems can be overcome by making use of hardevidence. In this paper; we take this idea one step further by deriving beliefs of others'trustworthiness from one's own experiences and the available hard evidence. For thispurpose; we justify why a self-interested autonomous entity may choose to behaveaccording to the norms of the system designer. As a consequence; the proposed beliefmodel does not only incorporate behavioral beliefs but also beliefs regarding the …,International Workshop on Agents and P2P Computing,2005,8

This lack of experimentation is a critical blocker to the further development ofthe field as well as the industrial adoption of the developed technologies. According torecent studies [2]; the main problem in evaluating SWS technology is the lack of sufficienttest data; ie collections of semantically annotated web services. The creation of suchcollections requires community effort; if they are to be sufficiently large and diverse to allowfor meaningful evaluation.

A conversational approach to semantic web service selection,Friederike Klan; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Service consumers typically have no clear goal in mind when looking for servicefunctionality and are not able to formulate their service needs in a formal or semi-formallanguage. We approach those issues by proposing a mechanism that implements semanticservice selection as an incremental and interactive process alternating phases ofintermediate service recommendation and requirements refinement by critiquing thepresented alternatives. It thus facilitates the incremental construction of service requirementsand their specification at an informal level.

Service Availability; Success Ratio; Prevalence; Replica Allocation Correctness; Replication Degree; and Effects of Different Replication/hibernation Behavior Effects...,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract The service distribution protocol for mobile networks is an interest-based servicereplication protocol based on two complementary mechanisms namely replication andhibernation. It allows for the selforganized propagation of service copies (replicas) in an adhoc network and thus serves to overcome the challenging characteristics of ad hoc networksin particular the frequent occurrence of network partitioning. It increases the serviceaccessibility over time based on the interest of a set of clients with regard to that service. In[1; 2] it was shown that the protocol indeed reaches high service availability in all networkpartitions. In this report; we investigate a global view of the protocol performance withrespect to the related important parameters. Since the protocol utilizes periodically theservice popularity (interest) during its replication/hibernation processes; we introduce and …,*,2008,6

Semantic user profiles: learning scholars’ competences by analyzing their publications,Bahar Sateli; Felicitas Löffler; Birgitta König-Ries; René Witte,Abstract Semantic publishing generally targets the enhancement of scientific artifacts; suchas articles and datasets; with semantic metadata. However; smarter scholarly applicationsalso require a better model of their users; in order to understand their interests; tasks; andcompetences. These are generally captured in so-called user profiles. We investigate anumber of existing linked open data (LOD) vocabularies and propose a description ofscientists' competences in LOD format. To avoid the cold start problem; we suggest toautomatically populate these profiles based on the publications (co-) authored by users;which we hypothesize reflect their research competences.

Using semantics in portal development,Torsten Dettborn; Birgitta König-Ries; Martin Welsch,Portals are more and more becoming environments for complex applications. The new Javaportlet standard; JSR 2863; ie; offers mechanisms for creating portlets as re-usablecomponents which can interact via eventing mechanisms. Thus; they can be assembled intocomposite applications. In the future; it is envisioned that this assembly shall be done notonly by programmers but by business users [1]. This will allow for tailored-madeapplications. However; finding and correctly combining portlets is a complex task; inparticular; when portlets developed by different individuals or providers need to beintegrated and when the number of available portlets is high. Non-programmers will needsupport to perform this task. Formal; machine-understandable descriptions of portlets couldhelp to discover appropriate portlets and to automatically check the designed data flow …,Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Semantic Web Enabled Software Engineering,2008,5
Service discovery using DIANE service descriptions-a solution to the SWS-Challenge discovery scenarios,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract. In this paper we present how DIANE service descriptions are used to solve all butone goal of the SWS-Challenge1 service discovery scenarios (status from the call for thefourth SWS-Challenge workshop in Innsbruck; June 2007). We build on our papers for theprevious SWS-Challenge workshops [1–3] and focus on how the new goals for the originaldiscovery scenario related to temporal reasoning as well as the goals for the completely newsecond discovery scenario have been addressed. We also introduce the enhancementsmade to the DIANE framework in order to be able to cope with these goals.,Fourth Workshop of the Semantic Web Service Challenge-Challenge on Automating Web Services Mediation; Choreography and Discovery; Innsbruck; Austria,2007,5

On building an infrastructure for mobile and wireless systems,Birgitta Konig-Ries; Kia Makki; Sam Makki; Charles Perkins; Niki Pissinou; Peter Reiher; Peter Scheuermann; Jari Veijalainen; Ouri Wolfson,Over the last few years; there have been at least two dramatic changes in the way computersare used. The first has its origin in the fact that computers have become more and moreconnected to each other. The second was triggered by the increasing miniaturization andaffordability of hardware components and power supplies; together with the development ofwireless communication paths. These two trends combined have allowed the developmentof powerful; yet comparatively low-priced; portable computers. In spite of these changes;little attention has been given to reaching a common consensus and to the development of astrong infrastructure in this area.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2002,5
A middleware-based architecture to support transparent data access by mobile users in heterogeneous environments,Niki Pissinou; Kia Makki; Birgitta Konig-Ries,Mobile computing is becoming more and more pervasive; liberating users from the confinesof wired networks. At the same time; transparent access to heterogeneous; distributedinformation sources has become a reality in wired computing. Obviously; this kind of accessis highly desirable for mobile users; too. However; current architectures for transparentinformation access do not take the specific needs of mobile users into account; whileexisting architectures for mobile computing do not support transparent access well. For thefuture growth of the usage of mobile computing; it is of utmost importance that; instead ofindividually-developed; isolated extensions to the existing architectures; the researchcommunity agrees on a strong; standardized middleware platform extending both existingmobile architectures and existing information access architectures to ensure mobile …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 2000.

A user-centered methodology for the evaluation of (semantic) web service discovery and selection,Friederike Klan; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Recently; a new breed of user-centric solutions to Web Service discovery andselection that applies Semantic Web Service technology in B2C settings such as e-Commerce has evolved. They significantly differ from traditional Web Service frameworksand have to cope with new challenges such as assisting consumers in specifying servicerequirements and providing effective decision support for service selection. Existingevaluation efforts within the scope of Semantic Web Services do not account for these user-specific requirements and hence are not appropriate for assessing the quality of solutionsthat are dedicated to end-users; ie service consumers. In this paper; we address this issueby proposing a user-centered methodology for the evaluation of Semantic Web Serviceretrieval and demonstrating its feasibility.,Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Web Intelligence; Mining and Semantics (WIMS14),2014,4

The system visualizes not onlythe user's own model; but also the peers' models. It allows sorting the peers' models using anumber of criteria; including the overall progress and the progress on a specific topic. Also;in this paper we present results of a classroom study confirming our hypothesis that byshowing a student the peers' models and ranking them by progress it is possible to increasethe student's motivation to compete and progress in e-learning systems.,Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC); 2011 IEEE Symposium on,2011,4
Semantic representation of process and service compliance–a case study in emergency planning,Aygul Gabdulkhakova; Birgitta König-Ries; Norris Syed Abdullah,Abstract Emergency events like natural disasters and large scale accidents pose a numberof challenges to handle. The requirement to coordinate a wide range of organizations andactivities; public and private; to provide efficient help for the victims can often be complicatedby the need to comply with requisite policies and procedures. Current process and servicemodels that represent domains such as emergency planning do not provide sufficientartefacts with respect to compliance requirements. In this paper; we argue that techniquesfor compliance management in business processes can be applied to the emergencydomain. We provide a high level model for the representation of compliance requirementswithin business processes and services. Hence; we demonstrate the application of themodel in the emergency planning domain. Finally; we present an analysis derived from …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2011,4
An evolutionary algorithm for automatic composition of information-gathering web services in mashups,Thomas Fischer; Fedor Bakalov; Birgitta König-Ries; Andreas Nauerz; Martin Welsch,The idea behind mashups is to provide a mechanism that allows for more or lessspontaneous combination of existing web applications. Users shall thus be enabled tocombine data and services according to their needs. However; existing mashup frameworksrequire some programming knowledge; hence are not suitable for non-expert users. In thispaper; we present a system that builds on existing Semantic Web research to achieve anautomatic; ad-hoc generation of mashups thus eliminating the need for programmerinvolvement. At the core of our approach; there is an evolutionary algorithm thatautomatically composes different information web services based on semantic servicedescriptions. The information that has been retrieved from the invoked web services isautomatically transformed into a semantic representation and presented as a mashup to …,Web Services; 2009. ECOWS'09.

Comparison: handling preferences with DIANE and miAamics,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries; Tiziana Margaria; Bernhard Steffen,In this chapter we compare the DIANE and miAamics solutions to service discovery along aspecific feature supported by those solutions: preferences. Although quite different in theirtheoretical and technical background; both techniques have in fact the ability to express userpreferences; that are used internally to rank the evaluation results. These preferences areused here to incorporate functional aspects as defined by the SWS Challenge tasks; but theycan also be used to express non-functional properties like quality aspects. Here we take acloser look at how preferences are realized in the two different approaches and we brieflycompare their profiles.,*,2009,4
A personalized approach to experience-aware service ranking and selection,Friederike Klan; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Existing approaches to service ranking and selection evaluate the suitability ofavailable services for a given request based on the advertisement created by the serviceprovider. They will compare how well the advertisement matches the service request andwill choose the service with the best matching advertisement. Unfortunately; at this point intime; it is uncertain whether the service that will actually be performed will match the requestas well as the advertisement promised. In this paper; we present an approach that reducesthe degree of this uncertainty by taking previous experiences with the service provider(which reflect the performance of the actual service not the advertisement) into account.Contrary to many other approaches our solution accounts for the subjective nature of rating-based experiences by considering the preferences of the experience creators.

Sogos-a distributed meta level architecture for the self-organizing grid of services,Clemens Beckstein; Peter Dittrich; Ch Erfurth; Dietmar Fey; B Konig-Ries; Martin Mundhenk; Harald Sack,Handling highly dynamic scenarios as they arise in emergency situations requires lots ofsemantic information about the situation and an extremely flexible; selforganizing ITinfrastructure that provides services that can be used to manage the situation. We show thata distributed meta level architecture is particularly suited for the implementation of such aself-organizing grid of services. This architecture (SOGOS) distinguishes between an objectlevel and a meta level. The middleware processes of the grid are running on the object level.The meta level defines an explicitly and declaratively represented dynamic meta model thatprovides the semantics for the object level processes. Additionally; this level runs processesthat plan; supervise and control mobile agents on the object level. The levels are linkedtogether by reflection processes that ensure that relevant changes on the object level are …,Mobile Data Management; 2006. MDM 2006. 7th International Conference on,2006,4
Asynchronous Service Discovery in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks.,Khaled Nagi; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract: The wide availability of mobile devices equipped with wireless communicationdevices paves the way for building highly dynamic communities of ad-hoc networks. For anasynchronous service discovery in this environment; we suggest the use of mobile agents.Here; we concentrate on file sharing and exchanging services. We adopt a newasynchronous approach for discovering and locating these files; since the availability of filesin this particular domain will change significantly over time when nodes constantly join andleave the network. In this paper; we present a typical application scenario; highlight the maincomponents of the system architecture and discuss the technical challenges facing us whiletrying to port main infrastructural features of traditional database management systems toour mobile light-weight software agents.,Database Mechanisms for Mobile Applications,2003,4
Creating; filling; and using a repository of reusable learning objects for database courses,Michael Klein; Khaldoun Ateyeh; Birgitta König-Ries; Jutta Mülle,When you take a look at courses on database management systems taught by differentinstructors at different types of universities for different target audiences; you will notice thatthere are quite a number of topics that are part of nearly every (or at least a large number of)courses. These topics include; to name but a few; database design methods; querylanguages; transaction management and so on. The production of highquality learningmaterials is a time consuming and expensive process. Nevertheless; it is done over andover again for these topics-more or less anew for each new course. Reuse of materialhappens sometimes by its author; but even that is rather scarce. Why is it that material is notreused more often? One reason of course are copyright restrictions; however; more oftenthan not; authors are more than willing to allow others to reuse their material.

An approach to the semi-automatic generation of mediator specifications,Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Mediator architectures have become popular for systems that aim at providingtransparent access to heterogeneous information sources. Similar to a view on a database;a mediator answers queries posed against the common domain schema by executing oneor more queries against its underlying information sources and mapping the results backinto the common schema. The mapping is usually specified declaratively by a set of rules;where the rule heads define queries against a common domain schema and the rule bodiesdefine their implementations in terms of queries against one or more source schemas. In thispaper a mechanism is presented that supports finding these mappings; a task that requires afair amount of knowledge about the underlying schemas and that involves a lot of effort; thusbecoming a major obstacle to scalability.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,4
Towards reproducibility of microscopy experiments,Sheeba Samuel; Frank Taubert; Daniel Walther; Birgitta König-Ries; H Martin Bücker,Abstract The rapid evolution of various technologies in different scientific disciplines has ledto the generation of large volumes of high dimensional data. Studies have shown that mostof the published work is not reproducible due to the non-availability of the datasets; code;algorithm; workflow; software; and technologies used for the underlying experiments. Thelack of sufficient documentation and the deficit of data sharing among particular researchcommunities have made it extremely difficult to reproduce scientific experiments. In thisarticle; we propose a methodology enhancing the reproducibility of scientific experiments inthe domain of microscopy techniques. Though our approach addresses the specificrequirements of an interdisciplinary team of scientists from experimental biology to store;manage; and reproduce the workflow of their research experiments; it can also be …,D-Lib Magazine,2017,3
SciQL: a query language for unified scientific data processing and management,Javad Chamanara; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Science is more and more data-driven. This means; that a significant part of ascientist's work is dedicated to accessing; visualizing; integrating and analyzing data from apossibly wide range of heterogeneous sources. In this paper we propose SciQL; a querylanguage that supports scientists in this task and allows them to focus on their main purpose;ie; on doing research. SciQL sits between scientists or data processing tools on the onehand and different data sources on the other hand in order to decouple users from technicalaspects of accessing data. It allows users to express their data management; refinement;transformation; processing procedures and visualizations in SciQL regardless of the syntaxand capabilities of the underlying physical data source sources. This way scientists andclient tools deal with only one language to interact with different data sources; eg; text …,Proceedings of the 5th Ph. D. workshop on Information and knowledge,2012,3

Evaluating semantic web service technologies: criteria; approaches and challenges,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries; Matthias Klusch,ABSTRACT In recent years; a huge amount of research effort and funding has been devotedto the area of semantic web services (SWS). This has resulted in the proposal of numerouscompeting approaches to facilitate the automation of discovery; composition and mediationfor web services using semantic annotations. However; despite of a wealth of theoreticalwork; too little effort has been spent towards the comparative experimental evaluation of thecompeting approaches so far. Progress in scientific development and industrial adoption isthereby hindered. An established evaluation methodology and standard benchmarks thatallow the comparative evaluation of different frameworks are thus needed for the furtheradvancement of the field. To this end; a criteria model for SWS evaluation is presented andthe existing approaches towards SWS evaluation are comprehensively analyzed.

New service selection strategies for the service distribution protocol for manets,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta König-Ries,ABSTRACT To deal with the partitioning behavior of ad-hoc mobile networks; an interest-based service replication protocol; called the Service Distribution Protocol (SDP) has beenintroduced. SDP is based on the service popularity concept; which is a non-partitioning-aware replication approach; to enhance service availability. It also has the advantage ofbeing networkarchitecture independent as it avoids being involved in expensive topologicalanalysis. In SDP; the most popular services in terms of the clients' requests will be replicatedmore and the others will be hibernated. After a while; and using the mobility of the networkparticipants; the interesting popular services prevail the network in what is known as servicedistribution. In this paper; we investigate two possibilities to further enhance SDP byintroducing two new service selection strategies.

The Service Distribution Protocol for MANETs-Criteria and Performance Analysis,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Sharing network resources in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) enable theprovisioning of the main required network functionalities. Service orientation is a promisingcandidate for allowing mobile nodes to share their functionalities as services. Unfortunately;typical characteristics of MANETs like their ever-changing topology and limited resourceshave a dramatic negative effect on service availability and accessibility. The ServiceDistribution Protocol (SDP)[1] for MANETs introduces a service replication/hibernationapproach to increase the service availability in MANETs. Based on the service popularity atany given time; the protocol provides a MANETs' architecture independent mechanismwhich ensures higher service availability and accessibility. In this paper; SDP is presentedand applied in a restrictive environment with more constraints than those of [1; 2]. By …,International Conference on E-Business and Telecommunications,2008,3

User Support for Formulating Complex Service Requests,NI Yussupova; B König-Ries; DV Popov; IA Vaynerman,The potential to dynamically bind services at run time is one of the big advantages of serviceoriented computing. However; dynamic service binding requires rather sophisticated servicerequests. These requests need to be precise enough to allow for automatic invocation of theservice without user intervention; while at the same time flexible enough to allow finding allpossible candidate services. Obviously; it is not trivial to formulate such requests. In thispaper; we examine how the user could be supported in this complex task.,Proc. of the 6th Int.

Such problemsare characterized by a combination of different data sources each of which owns at least oneof the typical characteristics of big data (volume; variety; velocity; or veracity). For theseproblems; we envision a solution that covers different aspects of integrating data sourcesand algorithms for their analysis on one of the following three layers: At the data layer; thereare various data archives of heterogeneous; unstructured; and uncertain data. At thefunctional layer; the data are analyzed for each archive individually. At the meta-layer;multiple functional archives are combined for complex analysis.,Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Data Management Technologies and Applications,2014,2
Personalized semantic assistance for the curation of biochemical literature,Fedor Bakalov; Marie-Jean Meurs; Birgitta König-Ries; Bahar Sateli; René Witte; Greg Butler; Adrian Tsang,The number of scientific publications available in multiple repositories is huge and rapidlygrowing. Accessing this information is of critical importance to conducting research anddesigning experiments. However; retrieving data of particular interest for a specific researchfield in such a large volume of publications is often like looking for a needle in a haystack.We present a web platform that supports researchers in navigating and curating biochemicalliterature.

Adaptive portals: Context adaptive navigation through large information spaces,Andreas Nauerz; Martin Welsch; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Today; Portals provide users with a central point of access to companywideinformation. Initially they focused on presenting the most valuable and widely usedinformation to users for efficient information access. But the amount of information accessiblequickly grew and finding the right information can hence become a tedious task. We willdemonstrate a solution for adapting the Portal's structure; especially its navigation and pagestructures. We allow for advanced adaptations that each user can perform manually as wellas for automated adaptations based on user-and context models reflecting users' interestsand preferences.

The Interactive Cooperation Tournament,Philipp Obreiter; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Distributed reputation systems are a self-organizing means of supporting trustingdecisions. In general; the robustness of distributed reputation systems to misbehavior isevaluated by the means of computer based simulation. However; the fundamental issuearises of how to anticipate kinds of successful misbehavior. Existing work in this fieldapproaches this issue in an ad-hoc manner. Therefore; in this paper; we propose amethodology that is based on interactive simulation with human subjects. The requirementsfor such interaction are discussed. We show how they are met by the Interactive CooperationTournament; a simulation environment for identifying promising counter-strategies to thedistributed reputation system EviDirs which is showcased in our demo.,International Conference on Trust Management,2006,2

Personalizing the Usage of Complex Services,NI Yussupova; B Konig-Ries; DV Popov; IA Vaynerman,Granting access to functionality via services is a rather big part of the modern informationtechnologies market. At the same time; the growing functionality of services makes their usemore and more complex for the end user. This is especially pronounced when using mobiledevices; such as a handheld computers (PDA) or smartphones with limited I/O-capabilities.In this paper we investigate how users can be supported in such environments bypersonalization of service interaction. We also discuss various aspects of how user prioritiescan be formalised and integrated into the service request. Such an approach allows for thereduction of the laboriousness of service usage by enabling its automation.,In Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Computer Science and Information Technologies (CSIT2005); Ufa; Russland,2005,2

Starting from there; we first tried toidentify reasons why this is the case. Our approach to doing so was to first collect anddiscuss sample scenarios for mobile applications and their characteristics. We then sharedour experiences in developing applications for some of these scenarios. We quickly realizedthat the term “mobile applications” covers an area that is too broad to come up with anycommon characteristics for all the different application domains and scenarios. Therefore;we decided to concentrate on applications supporting mobile users (in contrast to; egapplications where exclusively or primarily the code is mobile or applications with no humanuser). From there; we tried to identify design dimensions that need to be regarded when …,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2005,2

A New Metric To Evaluate Ontology Modularization.,Alsayed Algergawy; Samira Babalou; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract. As ontologies are the backbone of the Semantic Web; they attract much attentionfrom researchers and engineers in many domains. This results in an increasing number ofontologies and semantic web applications. The number and complexity of such ontologiesmakes it hard for developers of ontologies and tools to decide which ontologies to use andreuse. To simplify the problem; a modularization algorithm can be used to partitionontologies into sets of modules. In order to evaluate the quality of modularization; wepropose a new evaluation metric that quantifies the goodness of ontology modularization. Inparticular; we investigate the ontology module homogeneity; which assesses modulecohesion; and the ontology module heterogeneity; which appraises module coupling. Theexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric is effective.,SumPre@ ESWC,2016,1
Towards a Generic Resource Booking Management System,Michael Owonibi; Eleonora Petzold; Birgitta Koenig-Ries,Abstract Resource booking (the act of reserving of resources in advance) is an importantcomponent of planning-related activities. Typically; this is managed by a BookingManagement System (BMS) which aims at controlling the access of people to resources at aspecified future time. However; an issue common to BMSs is that they are typically modelledand developed to tightly fit the requirements of some specific contexts (use cases). This canlead to lack of reusability of existing BMSs. To address this issue; we propose a set of basicand generic components of BMSs; as well as how these components can be flexiblymodelled to satisfy different booking contexts. Such components include resources;bookings; booking constraints; booking workflows; time. We believe that the consideration ofthese components by developers can lead to implementation of reusable BMSs for …,International Conference on Enterprise Resource Planning Systems,2015,1
rBEFdata: documenting data exchange and analysis for a collaborative data management platform,Claas‐Thido Pfaff; Birgitta König‐Ries; Anne C Lang; Sophia Ratcliffe; Christian Wirth; Xingxing Man; Karin Nadrowski,Abstract We are witnessing a growing gap separating primary research data from deriveddata products presented as knowledge in publications. Although journals today more oftenrequire the underlying data products used to derive the results as a prerequisite for apublication; the important link to the primary data is lost. However; documenting thepostprocessing steps of data linking; the primary data with derived data products has thepotential to increase the accuracy and the reproducibility of scientific findings significantly.Here; we introduce the rBEFdata R package as companion to the collaborative datamanagement platform BEFdata. The R package provides programmatic access to features ofthe platform. It allows to search for data and integrates the search with external thesauri toimprove the data discovery.

Towards Visualization Recommendation-A Semi-Automated Domain-Specific Learning Approach.,Pawandeep Kaur; Michael Owonibi; Birgitta Koenig-Ries,ABSTRACT Information visualization is important in science as it helps scientists inexploring; analysing; and presenting both the obvious and less obvious features of theirdatasets. However; scientists are not typically visualization experts. It is therefore difficult andtime-consuming for them to choose the optimal visualization to convey the desired message.To provide a solution for this problem of visualization selection; we propose a semi-automated; context aware visualization recommendation model. In the model; informationwill be extracted from data and metadata; the latter providing relevant context. Thisinformation will be annotated with suitable domain specific operations (like rankabundance); which will be mapped to the relevant visualizations. We also propose aninteractive learning workflow for visualization recommendation that will enrich the model …,GvD,2015,1
A Quality Management Workflow Proposal for a Biodiversity Data Repository,Michael Owonibi; Birgitta Koenig-Ries,Abstract The importance of quality-assured data in scientific analysis necessitates theinclusion of data quality management (DQM) functionality in research data repositories inaddition to their primary role of data storage; sharing and integration. Typically; the DQMworkflow in data repositories is fixed and semi-automated for datasets whose structure andsemantics is known a-priori; however; for other types of datasets; DQM is either manual orminimal. In comparison; classical DQM methodology (especially in data warehousingresearch) has established standard; typically manually undertaken; DQM procedures fordifferent types of data. Therefore; our proposal aims at customizing and semi-automating theclassical DQM procedures for bio-diversity data repositories. As opposed to reviewingscientific contents of the data; we focus on technical data quality. Our proposed workflow …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2014,1
Partitioning-based ontology matching approaches: a comparative analysis.,Alsayed Algergawy; Friederike Klan; Birgitta König-Ries,Generic Framework. Ontology matching is the process that takes two or more ontologies toidentify semantically corresponding entities across them. As the numbers of developedontologies as well as the number of entities in each ontology are increasing; traditionalapproaches to ontology matching fail or are not able to scale. Therefore; there is a growingneed for new matching algorithms. A common approach to deal with the large-scalematching problem is the partitioning-based technique [5]. To make these techniquescomparable; we propose a generic framework containing the following phases (shown inFig. 1):,OM,2014,1
An interest-based load balancing mechanism for the service distribution protocol in Manets,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract The Service Distribution Protocol (SDP) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) is aservice replication protocol which aims to increase the service availability despite thechallenging nature of MANETs. SDP is an interest-based protocol which can achieve anefficient service replication process and produce a close to optimal service distribution overthe network based on a variant service popularity. In this work; the assumptions made by theoriginal authors of SDP in order to elaborate their protocol; are being discussed anddeprecated from the perspective of utilizing the resources of servers. Moreover; the need toadd new features for SDP to enable it to operate under more realistic assumptions-inparticular limited server resources-are mentioned and analyzed. A new interest-basedmechanism to manage the load of the SDP servers (providers) is introduced. Finally …,Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing and Multimedia,2010,1
Enabling trust-aware semantic web service selection a flexible and personalized approach,Friederike Klan; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract In today's online markets; consumers need support in finding providers that offer theproducts or services they need and that are trustworthy. While Semantic Web Services(SWS) research addresses the first problem (discovering functionally suitable serviceproviders); it neglects the second. Hence; several attempts have been made to complementservice retrieval techniques based on semantic matchmaking with trust-establishingtechniques that leverage collaborative consumer feedback. However; the diversity and multi-faceted nature of SWS impose special requirements on the underlying feedbackmechanism; in particular wrt their flexibility and expressiveness. Existing approaches onlypartially meet those requirements. In this paper; we will therefore propose a trust-establishing mechanism for Semantic Web Services that allows to assess a service …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services,2010,1
Supporting Consumers in Providing Meaningful Multi-Criteria Judgments.,Friederike Klan; Birgitta König-Ries,ABSTRACT The huge amount of products and services that are available online; makes itdifficult for consumers to identify offers which are of interest to them. Semantic retrievaltechniques for Web Services address this issue; but make the unrealistic assumption thatoffer descriptions describe a service's capabilities correctly and that service requests reflecta consumer's actual requirements. As a consequence; they might produce inaccurateresults. Alternative retrieval techniques such as collaborative filtering (CF) mitigate thoseproblems; but perform not well in situations where consumer feedback is scarce. As asolution; we propose to combine both techniques. However; we argue that the multi-facetednature Web Services imposes special requirements on the underlying feedback mechanism;that are only partially met by existing CF solutions.

A web service based approach for integrating statistics tools into an information system for experiment data.,Dennis Heimann; Jens Nieschulze; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract: Data management in the life sciences has evolved from simple storage of data tocomplex information systems providing additional functionalities like analysis andvisualization capabilities; demanding the integration of statistical tools. In many cases theused statistical tools are hard-coded within the system. That leads to expensive integration;substitution; or extension of tools because all changes have to be done in program code.Other systems use generic solutions for tool integration but adapting them to another systemis mostly rather extensive work. This paper shows a way to provide statistical functionalityover a statistics web service; which can be easily integrated in any information system andset up using XML configuration files. The statistical functionality is extendable simply byadding the description of a new application to a configuration file. The service architecture …,GI Jahrestagung,2009,1

Service Discovery with SWE-ET and DIANE-An In-depth Comparison By Means of a Common Scenario,Ulrich Küster; Andrea Turati; Birgitta König-Ries; Dario Cerizza; Emanuele Della Valle; Federico M Facca,Semantic service discovery and matchmaking has received increased attention within thelast years. Various approaches have been proposed but agreed upon criteria how toobjectively evaluate and compare these approaches are widely lacking. In this paper wepresent an in-depth comparison of two solutions to the discovery problems defined by theSWS-Challenge. By means of this common and independently developed scenario we candevelop a much better understanding for the applied technologies in general; but also andin particular for the trade-offs involved in the different approaches.,*,2009,1
Using context information to evaluate cooperativeness,Friederike Klan; Mathias Röhl; Birgitta König-Ries; Adelinde M Uhrmacher,Abstract In contrast to traditional enterprise service-oriented systems; serviceannouncement; storage; and lookup in MANETs is imposed on the network participantsitself. Consequently; cooperation among network participants is crucial to allow for aproperly working system. In this context; protocolbased reputation methods have beenproposed. Though very successful in many cases; those techniques cannot effectively dealwith all observable types of misbehavior. In this paper; we propose a general reputationscheme for evaluating cooperativeness according to a higher-level protocol in MANETs. Itcomplements protocol-based reputation mechanisms by monitoring techniques; to evaluatecooperativeness of the network participants based on currently and formerly (messagecontext) overheard messages.

Recommending background information and related content in web 2.0 portals,Andreas Nauerz; Birgitta König-Ries; Martin Welsch,Abstract Modern Web 2.0 Portals have become highly collaborative participation platforms.Users do not only retrieve information; they even contribute content. Due to the large numberof different users contributing; Web 2.0 sites grow quickly and; most often; in a moreuncoordinated way than centrally controlled sites. Finding relevant information can hencebecome a tedious task. We will demonstrate a solution allowing for the in-place; in-contextrecommendation of background information with respect to a certain term or topic and for therecommendation of related content being available in the system. Our solution is based onthe extraction of enriched units of information which we either gain automatically viaunstructured data analysis or by analyzing user-applied annotations. Our main conceptshave been embedded and evaluated within IBM's WebSphere Portal.,International Conference on Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems,2008,1
Adaptive Portals: Adapting and Recommending Content and Expertise.,Andreas Nauerz; Fedor Bakalov; Birgitta König-Ries; Martin Welsch,Abstract Today; Portals provide users with a central point of access to companywideinformation. Initially they focused on presenting the most valuable and widely usedinformation to users providing them with quick and efficient information access. But theamount of information accessible quickly grew and finding the right information becamemore and more complex and time consuming. In this paper; we illustrate options for adaptingand recommending content based on user-and context models that reflect users' interestsand preferences and on annotations of resources provided by users. We additionallyleverage the entire communitys' interests; preferences and collective intelligence to performgroup-based adaptation.

Robust and fair trading in volatile environments: overcoming technical problems and uncooperativeness,Katharina Hahn; J Böse; Birgitta König-Ries; Philipp Obreiter,Abstract The exchange of electronic information; goods or functionality is an attractiveapplication for mobile ad-hoc networks. However; users will only take part in such systems; ifthe probability of a successful exchange is high enough. Exchanges may fail either becauseof communication failures or due to unfair behavior. Both obstacles need to be overcome toachieve a viable system. Existing approaches tend to address one or the other of theproblems; ignoring the second one. In contrast; we present an integrated approach andargue that this is more powerful than two isolated solutions. Replicated transaction logs areused to overcome disconnection periods and an evidence-based distributed reputationsystem is used to encourage fair behavior. The concepts are implemented as middle-warecomponents and thoroughly evaluated. The evaluation shows that the system is viable in …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2007,1

An Integration Method for the Specification of Rule–Oriented Mediators,H Wache Th Scholz H Stieghahn; B Konig–Ries,Abstract Mediators configured by rules allow access to heterogeneous information sources.However; the acquisition (and maintenance) of the rules is left to the user. In this paper; wepresent an integration method to support the specification of mediators. During this methodthe semantic descriptions of each source; ie their application ontologies; are acquired. Athree–step approach is proposed: First; the concepts used in different sources are annotatedwith labels describing their semantics. A global terminology provides the primitive terms of adomain which are combined with operators known from description logics in order to buildcomplex labels. Second; concepts from different information sources are compared if andhow they semantically correspond. In the third step; based on the semantic correspondencedetermined in the second step; mediator rules can be generated. Furthermore; the …,University of Bremen; Germany,1999,1
An Ontology-based Scientific Data Integration Workflow,Samira Babalou; Alsayed Algergawy; Birgitta König-Ries,ABSTRACT Scientific data is being generated; collected and archived in different formats inhigh volumes by research groups; organizations and agencies worldwide. This large volumeand high complexity of scientific data have contributed to problems such as heterogeneity inthe syntax; structure; and seman-tics of data. Therefore; there is a growing need to proposeand develop scientific data management approaches having the capability to cope withthese challenges. To this end; in this paper; we introduce a high level architecturesupporting a semantic-based data integration workflow; which basically depends on thereuse of ontologies. In particular; we aim to follow the ontology-based data access (OBDA)scheme allowing queries across different data sources through an on-tology to which thedata sources are mapped.

Impact of Heterogeneous Mobility Models on the Service Distribution Protocol for MANETs,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Replication advocated as a means to ensure service availability ininfrastructureless networks. Numerous approaches to service replication have beenproposed in the literature differing mostly in the criteria employed to determine when toreplicate and which node to put a new service replica on. Virtually all of these approacheshave been solely evaluated using simulations mostly based on rather simplistic mobilitymodels; eg; the random waypoint model. For one such approach; namely the servicedistribution protocol SDP; we investigate in this paper; how big the influence of these modelsis on the simulation results; in particular; whether it achieves comparable performanceresults with more realistic mobility models. We have chosen a variation of AGM proposed byBittner et. al as the basis for the experiments.

Why the mapping process in ontology integration deserves attention,Samira Babalou; Alsayed Algergawy; Birger Lantow; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract In an age where science is often interdisciplinary; it is frequently necessary tocombine scientific data from different (sub-) disciplines and thus from different sources.Ontologies can play an important role in this integration process. However; existingontologies will either cover just a part of the domain of interest or competing ontologiesmodeling the domain from different viewpoints exist. Therefore; before being able toleverage the power of ontologies; they themselves need to be integrated. The core ofontology integration is a mapping operation to identify corresponding concepts. This is achallenging task. To this end; we present a high-level integration workflow as a clearguideline for the whole process of ontology integration. We then analyze the mapping sub-workflow in more detail. We identify open issues in this integration step and discuss the …,Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services,2017,*

Essential Annotation Schema for Ecology (EASE)—A framework supporting the efficient data annotation and faceted navigation in ecology,Claas-Thido Pfaff; David Eichenberg; Mario Liebergesell; Birgitta König-Ries; Christian Wirth,Ecology has become a data intensive science over the last decades which often relies onthe reuse of data in cross-experimental analyses. However; finding data which qualifies forthe reuse in a specific context can be challenging. It requires good quality metadata andannotations as well as efficient search strategies. To date; full text search (often on themetadata only) is the most widely used search strategy although it is known to be inaccurate.Faceted navigation is providing a filter mechanism which is based on fine granularmetadata; categorizing search objects along numeric and categorical parameters relevantfor their discovery. Selecting from these parameters during a full text search creates asystem of filters which allows to refine and improve the results towards more relevance.

A Particle Swarm-Based Approach for Semantic Similarity Computation,Samira Babalou; Alsayed Algergawy; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract Semantic similarity plays a vital role within a myriad of shared data applications;such as data and information integration. A first step towards building such applications is todetermine concepts; which are semantically similar to each other. One way to compute thissimilarity of two concepts is to assess their word similarity by exploiting different knowledgesources; eg; ontologies; thesauri; domain corpora; etc. Over the last few years; severalapproaches to similarity assessment based on quantifying information content of conceptshave been proposed and have shown encouraging performance. For all these approaches;the Least Common Subsumer (LCS) of two concepts plays an important role in determiningtheir similarity.

Conceptual Model for a Generic Resource Booking Management System,Michael Owonibi; Eleonora Petzold; Birgitta Koenig-Ries,Booking; which is the act of reserving resources in advance; is an important component ofthe operations of organizations of all sizes; from enterprise-level businesses; to service-based small businesses. Several applications; known as Booking Management Systems(BMS); have been developed for managing this booking process. However; a common issuewith most of these BMS's is that they are typically developed to serve a particular use case orcontext; and this usually limits their reusability.

Towards recommending visualizations for biodiversity data,Pawandeep Kaur; Jitendra Gaikwad; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract To address the critical challenges of biodiversity conservation and study its impacton the ecosystem; over the last decade; scientists have been producing a large amount ofhighly heterogeneous and distributed data. For managing; processing; and visualizing thisdata; requires informatics skills. While many biologists lack these skills; informaticians arelimited in their understanding of biological domain requirements and the context of the data.The focus of our research study is to assist scientists with the suggestion of possiblevisualizations for exploring and understanding their data. To be useful; such suggestionsneed to be based on the visualization knowledge of domain experts. We intend to gathersuch knowledge and use in the development of a visualization recommendation frameworkserving the biodiversity research community.

Dynamic Strategies for Query Constructing and Rank Merging from Multiple Search Engines,Kobkaew Opasjumruskit; Birgitta König-Ries; Jesús Expósito,Abstract Heterogeneous search engines differ in the algorithms they use and the domainsthey cover; thus there is no single search engine that performs best in every circumstance. Inorder to obtain optimal search results; it often makes sense to use more than one searchengine. However; appropriately merging results from different engines is challenging; iecombining results in such a way that they reflect the ranking of results the user wouldchoose. In this paper; we propose an effective way to achieve this for web services searchwhich can be extended to cloud services and be applied to big data. In contrast to “classical”search processed by conventional text-based search engines; a more elaborated searchrequest is needed here. In addition to the result merging; we therefore present a method tocreate a structured request for this specific task.

Why Biodiversity Science needs Semantics,Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract—Biodiversity science investigates biological diversity on all levels and scales.There is strong evidence that biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates and that thiswill have dire consequences for humankind. Consequently; there is a strong need forscience to support political decision making in this area. Thus key questions of biodiversityscience are: What is out there? Why is it there? Does it matter (to us)? How can we save it?In this talk; we argue that computer science in general and semantics in particular areessential to answering these questions and that biodiversity science needs moreinvolvement by computer scientists. We will take a look at a number of projects onbiodiversity and will investigate the role of computer science in them and how semantics canhelp.,4th Canadian Semantic Web Symposium (CSWS 2013),2013,*

To capture it; the requestingbehavior of clients needs to be modeled. In this work; we introduce and discuss: theimportance of the service popularity; a generalized requesting model that can capture therequesting behavior of clients; a service popularity measure called “Gross Interest;” and aGross Interest quantification method. Two extremely different sets of specifications for theproposed generalized requesting model which produce two different Gross Interestscenarios (rich and poor scenarios) are introduced and quantified.

Typically; one aim of MANETs is to allowfor the sharing of functionality and information among the participant nodes. A paradigm thatallows for functionality sharing is service orientation where functionality provided by onenode is offered as a service to other nodes. The presence of unconnected partitions makesthe deployed services inaccessible to some network participants. Service replication isemployed as an approach to overcome this problem and to ensure higher serviceavailability and accessibility although the partitioning behavior. In the literature; severalprotocols and algorithms for service replication in MANETs have been proposed. This reportidentifies different criteria suitable to compare these approaches.

Often advanced similarity measurement techniques are used to removesemantic duplicates or solve other semantic conflicts. It proofs impossible; however; toautomatically get rid of all semantic problems. An often-used rule of thumb states that about90% of the development effort is devoted to semi-automatically resolving the remaining 10%hard cases. In an attempt to significantly decrease human effort at data integration time; wehave proposed an approach that strives for a'good enough'initial integration which storesany remaining semantic uncertainty and conflicts in a probabilistic XML database.

Link Clouds and User-/Community-Driven Dynamic Interlinking of Resources,Andreas Nauerz; Martin Welsch; Fedor Bakalov; Birgitta König-Ries,During the last years we have observed a shift in the way how content is added to web-based systems. Earlier; dedicated authors were responsible for adding content; today entirecommunities contribute. As a consequence these systems grow quickly and uncoordinated.New ways had to be found to organize and structure content. Tagging has become one ofthe most popular techniques to allow users (and entire user communities) to perform thisstructuring autonomously. But; not only because current tagging systems have their flipsides(eg synonyms and polysems lead to littered tag spaces making it difficult for users to findrelevant content); we argue that tagging is sometimes an abstraction layer not necessarilyneeded. In many scenarios users just want to interlink content fragments (re-sources) witheach other.

Starting from there; we first tried toidentify reasons why this is the case. Our approach to doing so was to first collect anddiscuss sample scenarios for mobile applications and their characteristics. We then sharedour experiences in developing applications for some of these scenarios. We quickly realizedthat the term “mobile applications” covers an area that is too broad to come up with anycommon characteristics for all the different application domains and scenarios. Therefore;we decided to concentrate on applications supporting mobile users (in contrast to; egapplications where exclusively or primarily the code is mobile or applications with no humanuser).

Concept for the Dagstuhl Seminar „Computer Science meets Ecology”,Benjamin Adams; Birgitta König-Ries,In his pioneering work; Jim Gray identified the 4th scientific paradigm; arguing that modernscience needs computer supported research. Recent developments in many scientificdisciplines prove him right: Huge amounts of heterogeneous; unstructured and multisourcedata can now be collected routinely; sometimes in a fully automatic manner. Due to thedevelopment of computer hardware and sensors even new data modalities are readilyavailable. The main difference to the general “big data” hype is that in science collectingdata always has the intention to gain insights into processes and mechanisms; or in generalto gain knowledge from data; typically motivated by some hypothesis. So far; the mainchallenge is to manage the explosive growth in size; complexity; and rates of dataaccumulation. On the one hand; it is easy to collect Tera-Bytes of data per minute. On the …,*,*,*
Big (and Small) Data in Science and Humanities,Anika Groß; Birgitta König-Ries; Peter Reimann; Bernhard Seeger,The importance of data has dramatically increased in almost all scientiĄc disciplines overthe last decade; eg; in meteorology; genomics; complex physics simulations; biological andenvironmental research; and recently also in humanities. This development is due to greatadvances in data acquisition and data accessibility; such as improvements in remotesensing; powerful mobile devices; popularity of social networks and the ability to handleunstructured data (including texts). On the one hand; the availability of such data massesleads to a rethinking in scientiĄc disciplines on how to extract useful information and on howto foster research. On the other hand; researchers feel lost in the data masses becauseappropriate data management; integration; analysis and visualization tools have not beenavailable so far.

Integrated Semantic Search on Structured and Unstructured Data in the ADOnIS System,Friederike Klan; Erik Faessler; Alsayed Algergawy; Birgitta König-Ries; Udo Hahn,Abstract. We introduce ADOnIS; an information system which coherently integrates twoimportant; yet mostly disparate data sources; namely structured; tabular data; andunstructured data in terms of publications. The integration is achieved by providing theunderlying background knowledge of the domains involved in terms of adequately tailoredontologies. Once the two basic data sources are semantically linked; entirely novelopportunities for cross-source information retrieval arise which we will highlight in this paper.,*,*,*

Mobile Services and Ontologies,Birgitta König-Ries; Dumitru Roman; Austria Jari Veijalainen,AbStrAct It is a fair question to ask whether or not services; ontologies; and mobility allthrown together in one issue will make a strange and somewhat arbitrary mix of themes. Aswe will demonstrate in this article; this is most definitely not the case. In the contrary; it is ourbelief that only the combination of ontologies and services will provide an appropriateplatform to support mobile applications. In the next few sections; we will elaborate on thiscombination. In our discussion; we also summarize contributions that constitute this specialissue.,*,*,*

Wolf Zimmermann Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg; Germany Claus Pahl Dublin City University; Ireland,Birgitta König-Ries,The success encountered by the Web has shown that tightly coupled software systems areonly good for niche markets; whereas loosely coupled software systems can be moreflexible; more adaptive and often more appropriate in practice. Loose coupling makes iteasier for a given system to interact with other systems; possibly legacy systems that sharevery little with it. Web services are at the crossroads of distributed computing and looselycoupled systems. When applications adopt service-oriented architectures; they can evolveduring their lifespan more easily and adapt better to changing or unpredictableenvironments. When properly implemented; services can be discovered and invokeddynamically using non-proprietary mechanisms; while each service can still be implementedin a black-box manner.

SDP Primary Implementation in Microsoft® VisualC++®,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta König-Ries,Please refer to [1] to have more details about the basic concepts and ideas of the ServiceDistribution Protocol (SDP). It was required to build a simulation tool that enable thefounders of SDP to estimate their early proposals about service replication in MANETs.Avoiding the complications of building a set of network layers; components; andarchitectures was highly required. Since; one of the most important SDP advantages isbeing an architecture independent protocol; it assumes that-for example-the presence of anyspecified network architectures or components are not a big deal. So; at the beginning of theresearch effort of estimating the feasibility of SDP; two SDP simulation tools have beenintroduced. These tools have been built in Microsoft® VisualC++®.,*,*,*

Achieving Multiple Effects–An Approach to Service Composition,Ulrich Küster; Birgitta König-Ries,Service-oriented computing aims at enabling automatic trading and invocation of servicesvia the matching of offers and requests. Requests should be expressible independent ofobtainable services. For instance; it should be possible to specify” We need 100;000countersunk; zinc plated; 5x40 mm screws in our factory in Karlsruhe by July 8th”. Oneservice offerer might achieve both effects (the owning of screws and their change oflocation); it is equally possible that we need to invoke two services. However; the effects areconnected: We are not looking for an arbitrary transportation service but for one that is ableto transport the screws from the manufacturer to our factory. Thus; the choice of a deliveryservice depends on the choice of manufacturer. Therefore; we need to find a decompositionof the desired effects into subsets so that for each subset; a suitable service provider can …,*,*,*
Towards a Query Language for Unified Scientific Data Processing and Management,Javad Chamanara; Birgitta König-Ries,Motivation. Today's data processing tools cope only insufficiently with the current andgrowing requirements of various disciplines of science [6]. Scientists and their observation;processing; and analysis tools produce a huge amount of data; in various formats. Produceddata are schema-less; semi or fully structured persisting in different repositories. With theparadigm shift from computational science to data driven discovery [10]; the need forfullfledged data lifecycle management utilities has emerged [6; 10; 15]. But what should a full-fledged data lifecycle management tool look like? In this abstract; we attempt to answer thisquestion. We identify requirements and features of a universal data lifecycle managementtool and contrast them with what existing tools like Google Refine [1]; LINQ [9]; Matlab [3]; R[13]; VisualDB [14]; WQL [12]; HTSQL [2]; UnQL [5]; Jaql [7]; Kepler [11]; VisTrails [17] …,*,*,*

Leader Election Modes of the Service Distribution Protocol for Ad Hoc Networks,Mohamed Hamdy; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract: Ad hoc networks are characterized by high dynamics in particular with respect tothe formation of network partitions. This behavior makes it difficult to (s) elect a suitableleader for a given network partition at any given time. However; such leaders orrepresentatives are needed by many protocols for ad hoc networks. In this paper; we willillustrate the leader election process and its influence on protocol performance using theexample of the service distribution protocol. Effects of different modes of leader (s) electionon the replica placement (allocation) process are investigated as well as the general serviceavailability and success ratio of the protocol.,Gesellschaft für Informatik (GI) publishes this series in order to make available to a broad public recent findings in informatics (ie computer science and informa-tion systems); to document conferences that are organized in co-operation with GI and to publish the annual GI Award dissertation.,*,*
DIANEmu; a Java based generic simulation environment for distributed protocols [online].,Michael Klein,*,*,*,*
Position Paper for the First AKT Workshop on Semantic Web Services,Birgitta König-Ries; Michael Klein,The goal of the DIANE project1 is it to enable automatic resource sharing in dynamicenvironments; more precisely in ad hoc networks. The work is based on the paradigm ofservice oriented computing. One major prerequisite to allow for automatic resource sharingin such a system is the ability to automatically discover and bind services. This in turnrequires semantic service descriptions and appropriate methods to match service offers andrequests. Since existing service description languages; in particular OWL-S; did not provideall that is necessary for automation; we have developed our own description language; theDIANE Service Description (DSD). In our opinion; this language prototypically realizes allthe functionality that is needed from a semantic service description. A major enhancement ofDSD over OWL-S is the explicit distinction between service offers and requests. While in …,*,*,*

The Buddy System,Stefan Fähnrich; Philipp Obreiter; Birgitta König-Ries,Abstract: In ad hoc networks; there are no incentives to cooperate. There is neither a rewardfor cooperation nor a punishment for non-cooperation. A distributed reputation system couldsolve this problem; by giving means of managing trust towards other entities and discoveringvicious entities. The existing distributed reputation systems are based on plausibilityconsiderations and; thus; have several limitations. Therefore; in this paper; we aim atovercoming these limitations by proposing the Buddy System as a distributed reputationsystem that is based on social structure. For this purpose; we choose an appropriate socialstructure for the Buddy System and discuss the ensuing issues for its maintenance.
