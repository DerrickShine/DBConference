Global patterns in leaf 13C discrimination and implications for studies of past and future climate,Aaron F Diefendorf; Kevin E Mueller; Scott L Wing; Paul L Koch; Katherine H Freeman,Abstract Fractionation of carbon isotopes by plants during CO 2 uptake and fixation (Δ leaf)varies with environmental conditions; but quantitative patterns of Δ leaf acrossenvironmental gradients at the global scale are lacking. This impedes interpretation ofvariability in ancient terrestrial organic matter; which encodes climatic and ecologicalsignals. To address this problem; we converted 3;310 published leaf δ 13 C values intomean Δ leaf values for 334 woody plant species at 105 locations (yielding 570 species-sitecombinations) representing a wide range of environmental conditions. Our analyses reveala strong positive correlation between Δ leaf and mean annual precipitation (MAP; R 2=0.55); mirroring global trends in gross primary production and indicating stomatal constraintson leaf gas-exchange; mediated by water supply; are the dominant control of Δ leaf at …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2010,380
Impacts of biodiversity loss escalate through time as redundancy fades,Peter B Reich; David Tilman; Forest Isbell; Kevin Mueller; Sarah E Hobbie; Dan FB Flynn; Nico Eisenhauer,Plant diversity generally promotes biomass production; but how the shape of the responsecurve changes with time remains unclear. This is a critical knowledge gap because theshape of this relationship indicates the extent to which loss of the first few species willinfluence biomass production. Using two long-term (≥ 13 years) biodiversity experiments;we show that the effects of diversity on biomass productivity increased and became lesssaturating over time. Our analyses suggest that effects of diversity-dependent ecosystemfeedbacks and interspecific complementarity accumulate over time; causing high-diversityspecies combinations that appeared functionally redundant during early years to becomemore functionally unique through time. Consequently; simplification of diverse ecosystemswill likely have greater negative impacts on ecosystem functioning than has been …,Science,2012,372
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers: Causes for concern and knowledge gaps regarding environmental distribution; fate and toxicity,Anne P Vonderheide; Kevin E Mueller; Juris Meija; Gwendolyn L Welsh,Abstract This manuscript critically considers several areas of study of the polybrominateddiphenyl ether compounds. Specifically; a brief review of PBDE toxicity is followed by an indepth discussion of PBDE occurrence in abiotic and biotic environmental matrices.Temporal and geographic trends are examined in conjunction with risk assessment factors.Rather than summarize or tabulate the growing body of literature on PBDEs in theenvironment; the overall goal of this review paper is to highlight broad patterns that maycontribute to a more holistic understanding of PBDE behavior in the environment; as well asto identify critical areas of research that warrant further attention.,Science of the Total Environment,2008,195
Fate of pentabrominated diphenyl ethers in soil: abiotic sorption; plant uptake; and the impact of interspecific plant interactions,Kevin E Mueller; Sabrina R Mueller-Spitz; Heather F Henry; Anne P Vonderheide; Rajiv S Soman; Brian K Kinkle; Jodi R Shann,Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are potentially harmful and persistentenvironmental pollutants. Despite evidence that soils are a major sink for PBDEs; little isknown regarding their behavior in this medium. An environmentally relevant level of acommercial penta-BDE mixture (75 μg kg-1) was added to topsoil; and the extractability ofthree congeners (BDE-47;-99; and-100) was monitored over 10 weeks in planted andunplanted treatments. The extractability of each congener decreased rapidly in theexperimental soil due largely to abiotic sorption to soil particles; which was demonstrated bylow PBDE recovery from sterilized and dry soils. Monoculture plantings of zucchini andradish did not affect the recovery of PBDEs from soil. However; PBDE recovery from mixedspecies plantings was nearly 8 times higher than that of unplanted and monoculture …,Environmental science & technology,2006,121
Root depth distribution and the diversity-productivity relationship in a long-term grassland experiment,Kevin E Mueller; David Tilman; Dario A Fornara; Sarah E Hobbie,Abstract The relationship between plant diversity and productivity in grasslands coulddepend; partly; on how diversity affects vertical distributions of root biomass in soil; yet; noprior study has evaluated the links among diversity; root depth distributions; and productivityin a long-term experiment. We used data from a 12-year experiment to ask how plantspecies richness and composition influenced both observed and expected root depthdistributions of plant communities. Expected root depth distributions were based on theabundance of species in each community and two traits of species that were measured inmonocultures: root depth distributions and root-to-shoot ratios. The observed proportion ofdeep-root biomass increased more than expected with species richness and was positivelycorrelated with aboveground productivity. Indeed; the proportion of deep-root biomass …,Ecology,2013,95
PAH dissipation in spiked soil: Impacts of bioavailability; microbial activity; and trees,Kevin E Mueller; Jodi R Shann,Abstract While trees have demonstrated potential in phytoremediation of several organiccontaminants; little is known regarding their ability to impact the common soil contaminantPAHs. Several species of native North American trees were planted in soil artificiallycontaminated with three PAHs. Plant biomass; PAH dissipation; and microbial mineralizationwere monitored over the course of one year and environmental conditions were allowed tofollow typical seasonal patterns. PAH dissipation and mineralization were not affected byplanting. Extensive and rapid loss of PAHs was observed and attributed to highbioavailability and microbial activity in all treatments. The rate of this loss may have maskedany significant planting effects. Anthracene was found to be more recalcitrant than pyrene orphenanthrene.

Tree species effects on coupled cycles of carbon; nitrogen; and acidity in mineral soils at a common garden experiment,Kevin E Mueller; David M Eissenstat; Sarah E Hobbie; Jacek Oleksyn; Andrzej M Jagodzinski; Peter B Reich; Oliver A Chadwick; Jon Chorover,Abstract Forest biogeochemical cycles are shaped by effects of dominant tree species onsoils; but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We investigated effects oftemperate tree species on interactions among carbon (C); nitrogen (N); and acidity inmineral soils from an experiment with replicated monocultures of 14 tree species. To identifyhow trees affected these soil properties; we evaluated correlations among species-levelcharacteristics (eg nutrient concentrations in leaf litter; wood; and roots); stand-levelproperties (eg nutrient fluxes through leaf litterfall; nutrient pools in stemwood); andcomponents of soil C; N; and cation cycles. Total extractable acidity (acidity tot) wascorrelated positively with mineral soil C stocks (R 2= 0.72; P< 0.001); such that a nearly two-fold increase in acidity tot was associated with a more than two-fold increase of organic C …,Biogeochemistry,2012,85
Integrating plant litter quality; soil organic matter stabilization; and the carbon saturation concept,Michael J Castellano; Kevin E Mueller; Daniel C Olk; John E Sawyer; Johan Six,Abstract Labile;'high-quality'; plant litters are hypothesized to promote soil organic matter(SOM) stabilization in mineral soil fractions that are physicochemically protected from rapidmineralization. However; the effect of litter quality on SOM stabilization is inconsistent. High-quality litters; characterized by high N concentrations; low C/N ratios; and low phenol/ligninconcentrations; are not consistently stabilized in SOM with greater efficiency than 'low-quality'litters characterized by low N concentrations; high C/N ratios; and high phenol/ligninconcentrations. Here; we attempt to resolve these inconsistent results by developing a newconceptual model that links litter quality to the soil C saturation concept. Our model builds onthe Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization framework (Cotrufo et al.; 2013) by suggestingthe effect of litter quality on SOM stabilization is modulated by the extent of soil C …,Global change biology,2015,70
Rapid breakdown of brominated flame retardants by soil microorganisms,Anne P Vonderheide; Sabrina R Mueller-Spitz; Juris Meija; Gwendolyn L Welsh; Kevin E Mueller; Brian K Kinkle; Jodi R Shann; Joseph A Caruso,Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been extensively and successfully used asfire retardants in a multitude of products. However; due to their aromatic components andtoxicological properties; they are assumed to be persistent environmental pollutants and apopularly-used commercial mixture; DE-71; has been removed from American andEuropean marketplaces. However; our current work shows mixed bacterial cultures; derivedor extracted from soils experimentally contaminated with DE-71; were capable of utilizingthese as a sole carbon source. Most notably; almost complete loss of parent compoundstakes place within a few minutes. Determining pathways was hindered by both the speed ofthe microbial degradation and the low water solubility of the congeners; complicatingdetection.

Evolutionary patterns and biogeochemical significance of angiosperm root traits,LH Comas; KE Mueller; LL Taylor; PE Midford; HS Callahan; DJ Beerling,Abstract On the basis of a synthesis of recent progress in belowground ecology; we advanceand discuss a hypothesis that relates root trait evolution to the increased dominance ofangiosperms into dry upland habitats and the decline of atmospheric CO2 concentration thatbegan in the Cretaceous. Our hypothesis is built from examining patterns of fine rootadaptations during the Cretaceous; when angiosperms dramatically diversified inassociation with arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal root-fungal symbionts. We then explore thepotential effects of root adaptations and mycorrhizas on the geochemical carbon cycle. Onthe basis of phylogenetic analyses of root traits among extant plant species; we suggest thatangiosperm taxa; which diversified since the early Cretaceous; evolved thinner roots withgreater root length per unit of biomass invested (ie; specific root length [SRL]) than earlier …,International Journal of Plant Sciences,2012,41
Effects of plant diversity; N fertilization; and elevated carbon dioxide on grassland soil N cycling in a long‐term experiment,Kevin E Mueller; Sarah E Hobbie; David Tilman; Peter B Reich,Abstract The effects of global environmental changes on soil nitrogen (N) pools and fluxeshave consequences for ecosystem functions such as plant productivity and N retention. In a13-year grassland experiment; we evaluated how elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2); N fertilization; and plant species richness alter soil N cycling. We focused on soilinorganic N pools; including ammonium and nitrate; and two N fluxes; net N mineralizationand net nitrification. In contrast with existing hypotheses; such as progressive N limitation;and with observations from other; often shorter; studies; elevated CO 2 had relatively staticand small; or insignificant; effects on soil inorganic N pools and fluxes. Nitrogen fertilizationhad inconsistent effects on soil N transformations; but increased soil nitrate and ammoniumconcentrations.

Effects of litter traits; soil biota; and soil chemistry on soil carbon stocks at a common garden with 14 tree species,Kevin E Mueller; Sarah E Hobbie; Jon Chorover; Peter B Reich; Nico Eisenhauer; Michael J Castellano; Oliver A Chadwick; Tomasz Dobies; Cynthia M Hale; Andrzej M Jagodziński; Izabela Kałucka; Barbara Kieliszewska-Rokicka; Jerzy Modrzyński; Anna Rożen; Maciej Skorupski; Łukasz Sobczyk; Małgorzata Stasińska; Lidia K Trocha; January Weiner; Anna Wierzbicka; Jacek Oleksyn,Abstract Tree species interact with soil biota to impact soil organic carbon (C) pools; but it isunclear how this interaction is shaped by various ecological factors. We used multipleregression to describe how~ 100 variables were related to soil organic C pools in a commongarden experiment with 14 temperate tree species. Potential predictor variables included:(i)the abundance; chemical composition; and decomposition rates of leaf litter and fineroots;(ii) species richness and abundance of bacteria; fungi; and invertebrate animals in soil;and (iii) measures of soil acidity and texture. The amount of organic C in the organic horizonand upper 20 cm of mineral soil (ie the combined C pool) was strongly negatively correlatedwith earthworm abundance and strongly positively correlated with the abundance ofaluminum; iron; and protons in mineral soils.

Impacts of warming and elevated CO2 on a semi‐arid grassland are non‐additive; shift with precipitation; and reverse over time,KE Mueller; DM Blumenthal; Elise Pendall; Yolima Carrillo; FA Dijkstra; DG Williams; RF Follett; JA Morgan,Abstract It is unclear how elevated CO 2 (eCO 2) and the corresponding shifts intemperature and precipitation will interact to impact ecosystems over time. During a 7-yearexperiment in a semi-arid grassland; the response of plant biomass to eCO 2 and warmingwas largely regulated by interannual precipitation; while the response of plant communitycomposition was more sensitive to experiment duration. The combined effects of eCO 2 andwarming on aboveground plant biomass were less positive in 'wet'growing seasons; but totalplant biomass was consistently stimulated by~ 25% due to unique; supra-additive responsesof roots. Independent of precipitation; the combined effects of eCO 2 and warming on C 3graminoids became increasingly positive and supra-additive over time; reversing an initialshift toward C 4 grasses.

Do evergreen and deciduous trees have different effects on net N mineralization in soil?,Kevin E Mueller; Sarah E Hobbie; Jacek Oleksyn; Peter B Reich; David M Eissenstat,Abstract Evergreen and deciduous plants are widely expected to have different impacts onsoil nitrogen (N) availability because of differences in leaf litter chemistry and ensuing effectson net N mineralization (N min). We evaluated this hypothesis by compiling published dataon net N min rates beneath co-occurring stands of evergreen and deciduous trees. Thecompiled data included 35 sets of co-occurring stands in temperate and boreal forests.Evergreen and deciduous stands did not have consistently divergent effects on net N minrates; net N min beneath deciduous trees was higher when comparing natural stands (19contrasts); but equivalent to evergreens in plantations (16 contrasts). We also compared netN min rates beneath pairs of co-occurring genera. Most pairs of genera did not differconsistently; ie; tree species from one genus had higher net N min at some sites and …,Ecology,2012,28
Differentiating temperate tree species and their organs using lipid biomarkers in leaves; roots and soil,Kevin E Mueller; Pratigya J Polissar; Jacek Oleksyn; Katherine H Freeman,Abstract Although fatty acids and alcohols in plant polyesters can be useful indicators oforganic matter provenance in soils and sediments; interpretation is limited by uncertaintyin:(i) the distribution of lipids among plant species and their organs (eg leaves and roots)and (ii) the extent to which plant lipid composition is recorded in soils and sediments. In thisstudy; we compare lipids in leaves; roots and soils from 11 temperate tree species. Basehydrolysis was used to release ester-bound lipids and solvent extraction was then used torecover both hydrolysable and “free” lipids. Leaf and root lipid composition variedsubstantially among the tree species and we highlight differences among evergreenconifers; deciduous broadleaved angiosperms and a deciduous conifer (Larix decidua).Some of the variation appears to be linked to the morphology and lifespan of leaves and …,Organic Geochemistry,2012,21
Light; earthworms; and soil resources as predictors of diversity of 10 soil invertebrate groups across monocultures of 14 tree species,Kevin E Mueller; Nico Eisenhauer; Peter B Reich; Sarah E Hobbie; Oliver A Chadwick; Jon Chorover; Tomasz Dobies; Cynthia M Hale; Andrzej M Jagodziński; Izabela Kałucka; Marek Kasprowicz; Barbara Kieliszewska-Rokicka; Jerzy Modrzyński; Anna Rożen; Maciej Skorupski; Łukasz Sobczyk; Małgorzata Stasińska; Lidia K Trocha; January Weiner; Anna Wierzbicka; Jacek Oleksyn,Abstract Management of biodiversity and ecosystem services requires a betterunderstanding of the factors that influence soil biodiversity. We characterized the species (orgenera) richness of 10 taxonomic groups of invertebrate soil animals in replicatedmonocultures of 14 temperate tree species. The focal invertebrate groups ranged frommicrofauna to macrofauna: Lumbricidae; Nematoda; Oribatida; Gamasida; Opilionida;Araneida; Collembola; Formicidae; Carabidae; and Staphylinidae. Measurement ofinvertebrate richness and ancillary variables occurred∼ 34 years after the monocultureswere planted. The richness within each taxonomic group was largely independent ofrichness of other groups; therefore a broad understanding of soil invertebrate diversityrequires analyses that are integrated across many taxa.

Effects of tree root-derived substrates and inorganic nutrients on pyrene mineralization in rhizosphere and bulk soil,Kevin E Mueller; Jodi R Shann,Abstract This study investigated the effects of organic and inorganic nutrients on themicrobial degradation of the common soil contaminant pyrene. The material used in thisinvestigation was collected from potted trees that had been growing for over a year in a soilartificially contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Soil was removed from thenonroot (bulk) and root (rhizosphere) zones of these pots and used in mineralization studiesthat tracked microbial degradation of 14 C-pyrene. The factors influencing degradation inthese zones were then tested by amendment with essential inorganic nutrients or with root-derived materials. As expected; pyrene mineralization was greater in soil removed from therhizosphere than in bulk soil. The rate of mineralization in rhizosphere soil was inhibited byinorganic nutrient amendment; whereas nutrients stimulated mineralization in the bulk …,Journal of environmental quality,2007,19
Paleogene plants fractionated carbon isotopes similar to modern plants,Aaron F Diefendorf; Katherine H Freeman; Scott L Wing; Ellen D Currano; Kevin E Mueller,Abstract The carbon isotope composition (δ 13 C δ 13 C) of terrestrial plant biomarkers; suchas leaf waxes and terpenoids; provides insights into past carbon cycling. The δ 13 C δ 13 Cvalues of modern plant biomarkers are known to be sensitive to climate and vegetation type;both of which influence fractionation during lipid biosynthesis by altering plant carbon supplyand its biochemical allocation. It is not known if fractionation observed in living plants can beused to interpret fossil lipids because plant biochemical characteristics may have evolvedduring the Cenozoic in response to changes in global climate and atmospheric CO 2. Thegoal of this study was to determine if fractionation during photosynthesis (Δ leaf Δ leaf) in thePaleogene was consistent with expectations based on living plants. To study plantfractionation during the Paleogene; we collected samples from eight stratigraphic beds in …,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,2015,18
Grazing intensity differentially regulates ANPP response to precipitation in North American semiarid grasslands,J Gonzalo N Irisarri; Justin D Derner; Lauren Mc Geoch Porensky; David J Augustine; Justin L Reeves; Kevin E Mueller,Abstract Grazing intensity elicits changes in the composition of plant functional groups inboth shortgrass steppe (SGS) and northern mixed-grass prairie (NMP) in North America.How these grazing intensity-induced changes control aboveground net primary production(ANPP) responses to precipitation remains a central open question; especially in light ofpredicted climate changes. Here; we evaluated effects of four levels (none; light; moderate;and heavy) of long-term (> 30 yr) grazing intensity in SGS and NMP on:(1) ANPP;(2)precipitation-use efficiency (PUE; ANPP: precipitation); and (3) precipitation marginalresponse (PMR; slope of a linear regression model between ANPP and precipitation).

Clarifying the influence of water availability and plant types on carbon isotope discrimination by C3 plants,Katherine H Freeman; Kevin E Mueller; Aaron F Diefendorf; Scott L Wing; Paul L Koch,We are pleased that the results of Kohn (1) so strongly support our findings published earlierin PNAS (2). Both studies (1; 2) analyzed published measurements of the carbon isotopecomposition of plants and quantified relationships between isotopic fractionation andenvironmental factors at large spatial scales. These relationships will be useful wheninterpreting archives of plant-derived carbon; such as fossils; soil organic matter; and plantbiomarkers. Kohn (1) emphasized differences between the two papers; particularly thecoefficients and proportion of variance explained in regression models; but the majorfindings were the same: water availability [estimated by mean annual precipitation (MAP)]explains most of the observed variability in δ13C values for modern C3 plant leaves.

Thresholds and gradients in a semi-arid grassland: long-term grazing treatments induce slow; continuous; and reversible vegetation change,Lauren Porensky; Kevin Mueller; David Augustine; Justin Derner,Summary 1. Temporal changes in semi-arid ecosystems can include transitions betweenalternative stable states; involving thresholds and multiple domains of attraction; but canalso include relatively continuous; symmetric and reversible shifts within a single stablestate. Conceptual state-and-transition models (STMs) describe both types of ecosystemdynamics by including state transitions (plant community changes difficult-to-reverse withoutsubstantial input or effort) and phase shifts (easily reversible community changes) asconsequences of management practices and environmental variability. Grazingmanagement is purported to be the primary driver of state transitions in current STMs forNorth American grasslands; but there is limited empirical evidence from these grasslandsshowing that grazing can cause difficult-to-reverse transitions between alternate stable …,Journal of Applied Ecology,2016,11
What controls the concentration of various aliphatic lipids in soil?,Kevin E Mueller; David M Eissenstat; Carsten W Müller; Jacek Oleksyn; Peter B Reich; Katherine H Freeman,Abstract The composition of lipids in soil offers clues to the origin and stabilization of soilorganic matter; but the descriptive nature of prior research makes quantitative interpretationsproblematic. We statistically evaluated potential predictors of the concentrations of aliphaticlipids in mineral soils beneath plantations of 11 tree species. Lipids were recovered fromleaves; roots; and soils from each plantation using base hydrolysis and solvent extraction.Nearly 70% of the variation in individual soil lipid concentrations was explained by lipidconcentrations in tree leaves and roots. Less variation in soil lipid concentrations wasattributed to lipid properties such as functional group composition; chain length; and whethera lipid was most abundant in leaves or roots. Surprisingly; although the chemical andbiological compositions of soils were highly variable for plantations of different tree …,Soil Biology and Biochemistry,2013,11

However; the mechanisms underlying these differences in stabilityand chemical composition are only partly understood. To provide new insights into thestabilization of different chemical compound classes in physically-separated SOM fractions;we assessed shifts in the biomolecular composition of bulk soils and individual particle sizefractions that were incubated in the laboratory for 345 days. After the incubation; also theincubated bulk soil was fractionated. The chemical composition of organic matter in bulksoils and fractions was characterized by 13 C-CPMAS nuclear magnetic resonancespectroscopy and sequential chemical extraction followed by GC/MS measurements …,Biogeochemistry,2017,9
Accessibility of polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners in aging soil,Gwendolyn L Welsh; Kevin E Mueller; Rajiv S Soman; Anne P Vonderheide; Jodi R Shann,Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are considered to be persistent environmentalpollutants. Although soil is considered the most likely sink for these contaminants; little isknown about the potential adsorption and aging of these compounds to the soil matrix. Aprevious study performed in our lab suggested that abiotic sorption of PBDEs to soilconstituents was the most important determinant of PBDE accessibility. Building on thiswork; the present paper examined the availability of congeners of a commercial PBDEmixture (DE-71) in soils that varied in organic matter content; clay content; and pH. Bothsterile and non-sterile soils were amended with DE-71 and then monitored over eight weeksof aging. Recovery of all congeners from soil by acetone extraction dropped significantlyover time.

Elevated CO2 and warming shift the functional composition of soil nematode communities in a semiarid grassland,Kevin E Mueller; Dana M Blumenthal; Yolima Carrillo; Simone Cesarz; Marcel Ciobanu; Jes Hines; Susann Pabst; Elise Pendall; Cecilia Milano de Tomasel; Diana H Wall; Nico Eisenhauer,Abstract Climate change can alter soil communities and functions; but the consequences areuncertain for most ecosystems. We assessed the impacts of climate change on soilnematodes in a semiarid grassland using a 7-year; factorial manipulation of temperatureand [CO 2]. Elevated CO 2 and warming decreased the abundance of plant-feedingnematodes and nematodes with intermediate to high values on the colonizer-persister scale(cp3-5); including predators and omnivores. Thus; under futuristic climate conditions;nematode communities were even more dominated by r-strategists (cp1-2) that feed onbacteria and fungi. These results indicate that climate change could alter soil functioning insemiarid grasslands. For example; the lower abundance of plant-feeding nematodes couldfacilitate positive effects of elevated CO 2 and warming on plant productivity. The effects …,Soil Biology and Biochemistry,2016,2
Performance of base hydrolysis methods in extracting bound lipids from plant material; soils; and sediments,Gerrit Angst; Tomáš Cajthaml; Šárka Angst; Kevin E Mueller; Ingrid Kögel-Knabner; Sebastian Beggel; Stefanie Kriegs; Carsten W Mueller,Abstract Base hydrolysis methods are widely used to extract bound lipid biomarkers such ascutin and suberin from plant material; soils; and sediments. However; non-uniformtreatments among studies hamper their comparability; and information on differencesbetween commonly used saponification methods does not exist. The aim of the presentstudy was to compare frequently used base hydrolysis methods and evaluate theirperformance in extracting bound lipids from common European forest and agricultural plantspecies (Fagus sylvatica L. and Zea mays L.); and corresponding soils and sediments.

Soil‐mediated effects of global change on plant communities depend on plant growth form,Jes Hines; Susann Pabst; Kevin E Mueller; Dana M Blumenthal; Simone Cesarz; Nico Eisenhauer,Abstract Understanding why species respond to climate change is critical for forecastinginvasions; diversity; and productivity of communities. Although researchers often predictspecies' distributions and productivity based on direct physiological responses toenvironments; theory suggests that striking shifts in community composition could arise ifglobal change alters indirect feedbacks mediated by resources; mutualists; or antagonists.To test whether global change influences plant communities via soil-mediated feedbacks;we grew model communities in soils collected from a seven-year field manipulation of CO 2;warming; and invasion. We evaluated mechanisms underlying variation in the modelcommunities by comparing species' growth in equivalent soil histories with; and without;experimentally reduced soil biota (via sterilization) and nutrient limitation (via fertilization) …,Ecosphere,2017,*

The Influence of Trees on Soil Biogeochemistry,Kevin E. Mueller,Abstract: The state of terrestrial ecosystems depends on an array of biotic and abioticreactions dominated by relatively few chemical elements. Many of these biogeochemicalreactions occur in soils and are influenced by plants. Yet; there is considerable uncertaintyregarding how plants shape soil biogeochemistry. The aim of my dissertation research wasto improve knowledge of plant-soil interactions by studying the impacts of temperate treespecies; and the characteristics that make them unique (ie plant traits); on soilbiogeochemistry. My dissertation research addresses multiple aspects of soilbiogeochemistry; but from a similar starting point: evaluation of leaf-centric hypotheses andconceptual models. One such hypothesis is that evergreen and deciduous species uniquelyimpact soil nutrient availability. I tested this hypothesis using a meta-analysis that …,*,2011,*

Investigations Into the Use of Trees for Phytoremediation of PAH Contaminated Soils,Kevin E. Mueller,Abstract The effects of trees on microbial degradation of PAHs are largely unknown. Anexperimental soil was spiked with 3 model PAHs (phenanthrene; anthracene; and pyrene)and planted with six tree species. PAH dissipation and mineralization in planted andunplanted soils was monitored for up to 15 months. Initial; year long studies revealed thatplanting effects were negligible and that rapid PAH dissipation was due to high microbialactivity and bioavailability. Further experimentation showed that microbial communitiesrespond differently to two seasonally variable sources of root-derived carbon (root exudationand root mortality/decay). Also; soil nutrient amendments reduced pyrene mineralization inroot zone soils. While the 'rhizosphere effect'was supported by one-time mineralizationstudies; long term PAH dissipation did not vary according to proximity to roots. Seasonal …,*,2005,*
