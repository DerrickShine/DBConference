Using a distributed quadtree index in peer-to-peer networks,Egemen Tanin; Aaron Harwood; Hanan Samet,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become a powerful means for online dataexchange. Currently; users are primarily utilizing these networks to perform exact-matchqueries and retrieve complete files. However; future more data intensive applications; suchas P2P auction networks; P2P job-search networks; P2P multiplayer games; will require thecapability to respond to more complex queries such as range queries involving numerousdata types including those that have a spatial component. In this paper; a distributedquadtree index that adapts the MX-CIF quadtree is described that enables more powerfulaccesses to data in P2P networks. This index has been implemented for various prototypeP2P applications and results of experiments are presented. Our index is easy to use;scalable; and exhibits good load-balancing properties. Similar indices can be constructed …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2007,190
The v*-diagram: a query-dependent approach to moving knn queries,Sarana Nutanong; Rui Zhang; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik,Abstract The moving k nearest neighbor (MkNN) query finds the k nearest neighbors of amoving query point continuously. The high potential of reducing the query processing costas well as the large spectrum of associated applications have attracted considerableattention to this query type from the database community. This paper presents anincremental safe-region-based technique for answering MkNN queries; called the V*-Diagram. In general; a safe region is a set of points where the query point can move withoutchanging the query answer. Traditional safe-region approaches compute a safe regionbased on the data objects but independent of the query location. Our approach exploits thecurrent knowledge of the query point and the search space in addition to the data objects. Asa result; the V*-Diagram has much smaller IO and computation costs than existing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,126
A distributed quadtree index for peer-to-peer settings,Egemen Tanin; Aaron Harwood; Hanan Samet,We describe a distributed quadtree index for enabling more powerful access on complexdata over P2P networks. It is based on the Chord method. Methods such as Chord havebeen gaining usage in P2P settings to facilitate exact-match queries. The Chord methodmaps both the data keys and peer addresses. Our work can be applied to higherdimensions; to various data types; ie; other than spatial data; and to different types ofquadtrees. Finally; we can use other key-based methods than the Chord method as ourbase P2P routing protocol and index scale well. The index also benefits from the underlyingfault-tolerant hashing-based methods by achieving a nice load distribution among manypeers. We can seamlessly execute a single query on multiple branches of the index hostedby a dynamic set of peers.,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,80
Use of the SAND spatial browser for digital government applications,Hanan Samet; Houman Alborzi; František Brabec; Claudio Esperança; Gísli R Hjaltason; Frank Morgan; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Numerous federal agencies produce official statistics made accessible to ordinarycitizens for searching and data retrieval. This is frequently done via the Internet through aWeb browser interface. If this data is presented in textual format; it can often be searchedand retrieved by such attributes as topic; responsible agency; keywords; or press release.However; if the data is of spatial nature; for example; in the form of a map; then using text-based queries is often too cumbersome for the intended audience. We describe the use ofthe SAND Spatial Browser to provide more power to users of these databases by enablingthem to define and explore the specific spatial region of interest graphically. The SANDSpatial Browser allows users to form either purely spatial or mixed spatial/nonspatial queriesintuitively; which can present information to users that might have been missed if only a …,Communications of the ACM,2003,76
Enabling massively multi-player online gaming applications on a p2p architecture,Scott Douglas; Egemen Tanin; Aaron Harwood; Shanika Karunasekera,Abstract—Recent advances in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies have enabled the use ofP2P architectures for developing complex applications such as; Massively Multi-PlayerOnline Games (MMOG). In this paper we address a challenging research problem related toP2P MMOGs; efficient entity maintenance and interaction. We have identified two opposingsoftware engineering approaches to address this problem. The first approach assumes thatthe entire virtual world and the game logic are implemented using database techniques; eg;with a distributed index over all the peers and the game semantics built into dataquery/update functions. The second approach is to separate the entities into completelyindependent processes; using agentoriented programming techniques.

Incremental evaluation of visible nearest neighbor queries,Sarana Nutanong; Egemen Tanin; Rui Zhang,In many applications involving spatial objects; we are only interested in objects that aredirectly visible from query points. In this paper; we formulate the visible k nearest neighbor(VkNN) query and present incremental algorithms as a solution; with two variants differing inhow to prune objects during the search process. One variant applies visibility pruning to onlyobjects; whereas the other variant applies visibility pruning to index nodes as well. Ourexperimental results show that the latter outperforms the former. We further propose theaggregate VkNN query that finds the visible k nearest objects to a set of query points basedon an aggregate distance function. We also propose two approaches to processing theaggregate VkNN query. One accesses the database via multiple VkNN queries; whereas theother issues an aggregate k nearest neighbor query to retrieve objects from the database …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,57
Gesture recognition using RFID technology,Parvin Asadzadeh; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract We propose a gesture recognition technique based on RFID: cheap and unintrusivepassive RFID tags can be easily attached to or interweaved into user clothes; which are thenread by RFID antennas. These readings can be used to recognize hand gestures; whichenable interaction with applications in an RFID-enabled environment. For instance; it allowspeople to interact with large displays in public collaboration spaces without the need to carrya dedicated device. We propose the use of multiple hypothesis tracking and the use ofsubtag count information to track the motion patterns of passive RFID tags. To the best of ourknowledge; this work is the first on motion pattern tracking using passive RFID tags. Despitethe reading uncertainties inherent in passive RFID technology; our experiments show thatthe proposed gesture recognition technique has an accuracy of up to 93%.,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,2012,53
Visible nearest neighbor queries,Sarana Nutanong; Egemen Tanin; Rui Zhang,Abstract We introduce the visible k nearest neighbor (VkNN) query; which finds the k nearestobjects that are visible to a query point. We also propose an algorithm to efficiently processthe VkNN query. We compute the visible neighbors incrementally as we enlarge the searchspace. Our algorithm dramatically reduces the search cost compared to existing methodsthat require the computation of the visibility of all objects in advance. With extensiveexperiments; we show that our algorithm to process the VkNN query outperform the existingalgorithms significantly.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,51
Hashing spatial content over peer-to-peer networks,Dr Aaron Harwood; Dr Egemen Tanin,The Internet has become the common medium for contentdistribution. Searching contentusing keywords is well-known. Butthere are many shortcomings to it. Users cannot searchwithin thecontent and on many of the attributes of the content; ie; other thanits name. Contentis also becoming increasingly decentralized. Newmechanisms allowing access to complexdistributed content isneeded. We introduce a hashing-based method for accessingcomplexcontent over large dynamic networks such as peer-to-peer networks; which usesdistributed hash tables in a novel way. In particular; weare interested in spatial content thatis becoming popular indatabases. Our method is scalable; addressing the needs oftodaysnetworks.,*,2003,51
Analysis and evaluation of v*-knn: an efficient algorithm for moving knn queries,Sarana Nutanong; Rui Zhang; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik,Abstract The moving k nearest neighbor (M k NN) query continuously finds the k nearestneighbors of a moving query point. M k NN queries can be efficiently processed through theuse of safe regions. In general; a safe region is a region within which the query point canmove without changing the query answer. This paper presents an incremental safe-region-based technique for answering M k NN queries; called the V*-Diagram; as well as analysisand evaluation of its associated algorithm; V*-k NN. Traditional safe-region approachescompute a safe region based on the data objects but independent of the query location. Ourapproach exploits the knowledge of the query location and the boundary of the searchspace in addition to the data objects. As a result; V*-k NN has much smaller I/O andcomputation costs than existing methods. We further provide cost models to estimate the …,The VLDB Journal,2010,49
Spatial interpolation in wireless sensor networks: localized algorithms for variogram modeling and Kriging,Muhammad Umer; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are rapidly emerging as the prominenttechnology for monitoring physical phenomena. However; large scale WSNs are known tosuffer from coverage holes; ie; large regions of deployment area where no sensing coveragecan be provided. Such holes are the result of hardware failures; extensive costs forredeployment or the hostility of deployment areas. Coverage holes can adversely affect theaccurate representation of natural phenomena that are monitored by a WSN. In this work; wepropose to exploit the spatial correlation of physical phenomena to make monitoringsystems more resilient to coverage holes. We show that a phenomenon can be interpolatedinside a coverage hole with a high level of accuracy from the available nodal data given amodel of its spatial correlation. However; due to energy limitations of sensor nodes it is …,Geoinformatica,2010,45

A serverless 3D world,Egemen Tanin; Aaron Harwood; Hanan Samet; Sarana Nutanong; Minh Tri Truong,Abstract Online multi-participant virtual-world systems have attracted significant interest fromthe Internet community but are hindered by their inability to efficiently support interactivity fora large number of participants. Current solutions divide a large virtual-world into a fewmutually exclusive zones; with each zone controlled by a different server; and/or limit thenumber of participants per server or per virtual-world. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems areknown to provide excellent scalability in a networked environment (one peer is introduced tothe system by each participant); however current P2P applications can only provide filesharing and other forms of relatively simple data communications. In this paper; we presenta generic 3D virtual-world application that runs on a P2P network with no centraladministration or server.

Privacy-aware traffic monitoring,Hairuo Xie; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Traffic-monitoring systems (TMSs) are vital for safety and traffic optimization. However; thesesystems may compromise the privacy of drivers once they track the position of each driverwith a high degree of temporal precision. In this paper; we argue that aggregated data canprotect location privacy while providing accurate information for traffic monitoring. Weidentify a range of aggregate query types. Our proposed privacy-aware monitoring system(PAMS) works as an aggregate query processor that protects the location privacy of driversas it anonymizes the IDs of cars. Our experiments show that PAMS answers queries withhigh accuracy and efficiency.,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2010,39
An efficient nearest neighbor algorithm for P2P settings,Egemen Tanin; Deepa Nayar; Hanan Samet,Abstract New Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications like P2P job-employee seeker networks andP2P virtual cities; for application domains such as collaborative urban planning and formingvirtual communities; are about to emerge. An important component in these applications isspatial data; ie; data with locational components. Many requests initiated on spatial datainvolve finding the spatial objects that are nearest to a query location. In this paper; wepropose an efficient algorithm that finds the spatial objects that are nearest to a given querylocation on a P2P network in the order of their minimum distance to the query point. Theproposed algorithm makes use of a distributed spatial index that does not rely on the use ofa central server. The algorithm is designed to be more efficient by utilizing the parallel natureof the P2P network.

Privacy-aware collection of aggregate spatial data,Hairuo Xie; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Privacy concerns can be a major barrier to collecting aggregate data from thepublic. Recent research proposes negative surveys that collect negative data; which iscomplementary to the true data. This opens a new direction for privacy-aware datacollection. However; the existing approach cannot avoid certain errors when applied tomany spatial data collection tasks. The errors can make the data unusable in many realscenarios. We propose Gaussian negative surveys. We modulate data collection based onGaussian distribution. The collected data can be used to compute accurate spatialdistribution of participants and can be used to accurately answer range aggregate queries.Our approach avoids the errors that can occur with the existing approach. Our experimentsshow that we achieve an excellent balance between privacy and accuracy.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2011,34
Kriging for localized spatial interpolation in sensor networks,Muhammad Umer; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract The presence of coverage holes can adversely affect the accurate representation ofnatural phenomena being monitored by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Current WSNresearch aims at solving the coverage holes problem by deploying new nodes to maximizethe coverage. In this work; we take a fundamentally different approach and argue that it isnot always possible to maintain exhaustive coverage in large scale WSNs and hencecoverage strategies based solely on the deployment of new nodes may fail. We suggestspatial interpolation as an alternative to node deployment and present Distributed Kriging(DISK); a localized method to interpolate a spatial phenomenon inside a coverage holeusing available nodal data. We test the accuracy and cost of our scheme with extensivesimulations and show that it is significantly more efficient than global interpolations.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,31
Broadening access to large online databases by generalizing query previews,Egemen Tanin; Catherine Plaisant; Ben Shneiderman,ABSTRACT Companies; government agencies; and other types of organizations are makingtheir large databases available to the world over the Internet. Current database front-endsdo not give users information about the distribution of data. This leads many users to wastetime and network resources posing queries that have either zero-hit or mega-hit result sets.Query previews form a novel visual approach for browsing large databases. Query previewssupply data distribution information about the database that is being searched and givecontinuous feedback about the size of the result set for the query as it is being formed. Onthe other hand; query previews use only a few pre-selected attributes of the database. Thedistribution information is displayed only on these attributes. Unfortunately; many databasesare formed of numerous relations and attributes. This paper introduces a generalization of …,*,2003,31
A motion-aware approach to continuous retrieval of 3d objects,Mohammed Eunus Ali; Rui Zhang; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik,With recent advances in mobile computing technologies; mobile devices can now render 3Dobjects realistically. Many users of these devices such as tourists; mixed-reality gamers; andrescue officers; need real-time retrieval of 3D objects over a wireless network. Due tobandwidth and latency restrictions in mobile settings; efficient continuous retrieval of 3Dobjects remains a challenge. In this paper; we describe a motion-aware approach to thisproblem. We first introduce multi-resolution ion storage and retrieval methods for 3D data;which restrict access to only the necessary content based on the client's motion pattern. Wethen propose a motion-aware buffer management technique as well as an efficient indexusing multi-resolution representations of objects.

Efficient data collection and selective queries in sensor networks,Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin; Muhammad Umer,Abstract Efficient data collection in wireless sensor networks (SNs) plays a key role in powerconservation. It has spurred a number of research projects focusing on effective algorithmsthat reduce power consumption with effective in-network aggregation techniques. Up to now;most approaches are based on the assumption that data collection involves all nodes of anetwork. There is a large number of queries that in fact select only a subset of the nodes in aSN. Thus; we concentrate on selective queries; ie; queries that request data from a subset ofa SN. The task of optimal data collection in such queries is an instance of the NP-hardminimal Steiner tree problem. We argue that selective queries are an important class ofqueries that can benefit from algorithms that are tailored for partial node participation of aSN.

Incremental rank updates for moving query points,Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract The query for retrieving the rank of all neighbors of a moving object at any giventime; a continuous rank query; is an important case of continuous nearest neighbor (CNN)queries. An application for ranking queries is given by an ambulance driver who needs tokeep track of the closest hospitals at all times. We present a set of incremental algorithmsthat facilitate efficient rank updates for some or all neighbors of a moving query point. Theproposed algorithms allow us not only to maintain the exact rank of all n neighbors at anygiven time but also to track the rank of a subset of all neighbors. We show that updates forthese continuous rank queries can be performed in linear time for arbitrary polygonal curvesin two dimensions and in logarithmic time for movements along a fixed direction. Instead ofusing Voronoi diagrams; our algorithms are based on small subsets of all bisectors …,International Conference on Geographic Information Science,2006,26

One peer is introduced to the system by each participant. Howevercurrent P2P applications can only provide file sharing and other forms of relatively simpledata communications; and; in this paper; we demonstrate how this limitation can be bridgedby indexing and querying a 3D virtual-world on a dynamic distributed network. We presentan algorithm for 3D range queries as well as an algorithm for nearest neighbor queries. Wealso show how to build such a complex application from the ground level of a P2P routingalgorithm.,Geoinformatica,2006,26

Facilitating data exploration with query previews: a study of user performance and preference,Egemen Tanin; Amnon Lotem; Ihab Haddadin; Ben Shneiderman; Catherine Plaisant; Laura Slaughter,Networked and local data exploration systems that use command languages; menus; orform fill-in interfaces rarely give users an indication of the distribution of data. This oftenleads users to waste time; posing queries that have zero-hit or mega-hit results. Querypreviews are a novel visual approach for browsing databases. Query previews supply userswith data distribution information for selected attributes of the database; and give continuousfeedback about the size of the result set as the query is being formed. Subsequentrefinements might be necessary to narrow the search. As there is a risk that query previewsare an additional step; leading to a more complex and slow search process; a within-subjects empirical study was ran with 12 subjects who used interfaces with and withoutquery previews and with minimized network delays.

Continuous detour queries in spatial networks,Sarana Nutanong; Egemen Tanin; Jie Shao; Rui Zhang; Ramamohanarao Kotagiri,We study the problem of finding the shortest route between two locations that includes astopover of a given type. An example scenario of this problem is given as follows:“On theway to Bob's place; Alice searches for a nearby take-away Italian restaurant to buy a pizza.”Assuming that Alice is interested in minimizing the total trip distance; this scenario can bemodeled as a query where the current Alice's location (start) and Bob's place (destination)function as query points. Based on these two query points; we find the minimum detourobject (MDO); ie; a stopover that minimizes the sum of the distances: 1) from the start to thestopover; and 2) from the stopover to the destination. In a realistic location-based applicationenvironment; a user can be indecisive about committing to a particular detour option. Theuser may wish to browse multiple (k) MDOs before making a decision.

However; interactive work with such large volumesof online spatial data is a challenging task. We propose two efficient approaches to remoteaccess to large spatial data. First; we introduce a client-server architecture where the work isdistributed between the server and the individual clients for spatial query evaluation; datavisualization; and data management. We enable the minimization of the requirements forsystem resources on the client side while maximizing system responsiveness as well as thenumber of connections one server can handle concurrently.

Optimizing query processing using selectivity-awareness in Wireless Sensor Networks,Muhammad Umer; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Monitoring queries are fundamental for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) thatcollect data for physical phenomena. In this work we address three key characteristics ofmonitoring queries. First; a monitoring query can be selective; ie; it requests readings onlyfrom parts of a WSN. Second; a monitoring query can be continuous; ie; it draws sensorreadings for long periods of time. Finally; since physical phenomena are spatially correlated;a monitoring query selects spatially co-located nodes. In our earlier work; we proposed thePocket Driven Trajectories (PDT) algorithm; a selectivity-aware data collection techniquethat tailors data collection paths for a monitoring query based on the spatial layout ofselected nodes. In this work; we extend the basic PDT algorithm with an adaptive behavior.We show that the enhanced PDT algorithm is ideal for real world WSNs due to its two …,Computers; Environment and Urban Systems,2009,20
Autonomous navigation of mobile agents using RFID-enabled space partitions,Muhammad Atif Mehmood; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Existing techniques for autonomous indoor navigation are often environment-specific and thus limited in terms of their applicability. In this paper; we take a fundamentallydifferent approach to indoor navigation and propose an active environment basednavigation system. We argue that for a versatile navigation system the environment itselfshould provide spatial information. In our proposed approach; navigation is based on theconcept of space partitions where the location of an agent is approximated by the closestpartition. We show that Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is a viable optionfor generating space partitions. We present a cost effective deployment strategy for passiveRFID tags to construct a complete partitioning of the environment. A sparse deployment oftags leads to coarse partitioning; which in turn allows an agent to only approximate its …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,20

We present anew technique; Distributed Euler Histograms (DEHs); to store and query aggregated movingobject data. Aggregate queries occur in a variety of applications ranging from wildlifemonitoring to traffic management. We show that DEHs are significantly more efficient; interms of communication and data storage costs; than techniques based on moving objectidentifiers and more accurate than techniques based on simple histograms.,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,19
Efficient computation of trips with friends and families,Tanzima Hashem; Sukarna Barua; Mohammed Eunus Ali; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract A group of friends located at their working places may want to plan a trip to visit ashopping center; have dinner at a restaurant; watch a movie at a theater; and then finallyreturn to their homes with the minimum total trip distance. For a group of spatially dispersedusers a group trip planning (GTP) query returns points of interests (POIs) of different typessuch as a shopping center; a restaurant and a movie theater that minimize the aggregate tripdistance for the group. The aggregate trip distance could be the sum or maximum of the tripdistances of all users in the group; where the users travel from their source locations via thejointly visited POIs to their individual destinations.

Probabilistic voronoi diagrams for probabilistic moving nearest neighbor queries,Mohammed Eunus Ali; Egemen Tanin; Rui Zhang; Ramamohanarao Kotagiri,Abstract A large spectrum of applications such as location based services andenvironmental monitoring demand efficient query processing on uncertain databases. In thispaper; we propose the probabilistic Voronoi diagram (PVD) for processing moving nearestneighbor queries on uncertain data; namely the probabilistic moving nearest neighbor(PMNN) queries. A PMNN query finds the most probable nearest neighbor of a movingquery point continuously. To process PMNN queries efficiently; we provide two techniques: apre-computation approach and an incremental approach. In the pre-computation approach;we develop an algorithm to efficiently evaluate PMNN queries based on the pre-computedPVD for the entire data set. In the incremental approach; we propose an incrementalprobabilistic safe region based technique that does not require to pre-compute the whole …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2012,16

In theabsence of cooperative objects and devices attached to these objects; target trackingalgorithms have to be used for monitoring. In this paper; we present that many of theapplications of moving object monitoring systems could be addressed with low-frequencysnapshot-based queries. With the realization of this query type; we show that existing targettracking algorithms may not be the least expensive solutions. We introduce an approach thatuses two alternating strategies. We maintain a cheap low-quality knowledge of movingobjects' location between snapshots and trigger expensive sensor readings only when asnapshot period has elapsed. With extensive experiments we show that our approach issignificantly more energy efficient than established methods. It is also more effective than …,Mobile Data Management; 2008.

These applications have drawn significant benefits; specifically scalability and lowcost; from the P2P paradigm. However; the current approach for designing P2P applicationsintroduce issues that prevent the development of high quality complex P2P applications.These issues; namely tight coupling to P2P protocols; limited logic sharing between peersand complicated recovery processes; motivate us to introduce a service-orientedarchitecture for P2P applications. We have developed a middleware called CAESAR tosupport the development of service-oriented P2P applications applying the principles ofabstraction; dynamic binding; loose coupling and information hiding.

We introduce a new direction to protect user privacy that evaluates LBSs withcrowdsourced data and computation and eliminates the role of a location-based serviceprovider. We focus on the group nearest neighbor (GNN) query that allows a group to meetat their nearest point of interest such as a restaurant that minimizes the total or maximumdistance of the group.

Indexing distributed complex data for complex queries,Egemen Tanin; Aaron Harwood; Hanan Samet,Abstract Peer-to-peer networks are becoming a common form of online data exchange.Querying data; mostly files; using keywords on peer-to-peer networks is well-known. Butusers cannot perform many types of queries on complex data and on many of the attributesof the data on such networks other than mostly exact-match queries. We introduce adistributed hashing-based index for enabling more powerful accesses on complex data overpeer-to-peer networks that we expect to be commonly deployed for digital governmentapplications. Preliminary experiments show that our index scales well and we believe that itcan be extended to obtain similar indices for many other data types for performing variouscomplex queries; such as range queries.,Proceedings of the 2004 annual national conference on Digital government research,2004,11
SMARTS: Scalable Microscopic Adaptive Road Traffic Simulator,Kotagiri Ramamohanarao; Hairuo Xie; Lars Kulik; Shanika Karunasekera; Egemen Tanin; Rui Zhang; Eman Bin Khunayn,Abstract Microscopic traffic simulators are important tools for studying transportation systemsas they describe the evolution of traffic to the highest level of detail. A major challenge tomicroscopic simulators is the slow simulation speed due to the complexity of traffic models.We have developed the Scalable Microscopic Adaptive Road Traffic Simulator (SMARTS); adistributed microscopic traffic simulator that can utilize multiple independent processes inparallel. SMARTS can perform fast large-scale simulations. For example; when simulating 1million vehicles in an area the size of Melbourne; the system runs 1.14 times faster than realtime with 30 computing nodes and 0.2 s simulation timestep. SMARTS supports variousdriver models and traffic rules; such as the car-following model and lane-changing model;which can be driver dependent. It can simulate multiple vehicle types; including bus and …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2017,9
Managing sensor traffic data and forecasting unusual behaviour propagation,Claudia Bauzer Medeiros; Marc Joliveau; Geneviève Jomier; Florian De Vuyst,Abstract Sensor data on traffic events have prompted a wide range of research issues;related with the so-called ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems). Data are delivered forboth static (fixed) and mobile (embedded) sensors; generating large and complex spatio-temporal series. This scenario presents several research challenges; in spatio-temporaldata management and data analysis. Management issues involve; for instance; datacleaning and data fusion to support queries at distinct spatial and temporal granularities.Analysis issues include the characterization of traffic behavior for given space and/or timewindows; and detection of anomalous behavior (either due to sensor malfunction; or to trafficevents). This paper contributes to the solution of some of these issues through a new kind offramework to manage static sensor data. Our work is based on combining research on …,Geoinformatica,2010,9
Facilitating network data exploration with query previews: A study of user performance and preference,Egemen Tanin; Amnon Lotem; Ihab Haddadin; Ben Shneiderman; Catherine Plaisant; Laura Slaughter,Current network data exploration systems which use command languages (eg SQL) or formfill-in interfaces fail to give users an indication of the distribution of data items. This leadsmany users to waste time posing queries which have zero-hit or mega-hit result sets. Querypreviewing is a novel visual approach for browsing huge networked informationwarehouses. Query previews supply data distribution information about the database that isbeing searched and give continuous feedback about the size of the result set for the queryas it is being formed. Our within-subjects empirical comparison studied 12 subjects using aform fill-in interface; with and without query previews. We found statistically significantdifferences showing that query previews sped up performance by 1.6 to 2.1 times and led tohigher subjective satisfaction.,*,1998,9
K-coverage in regular deterministic sensor deployments,Parvin Asadzadeh Birjandi; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,An area is k-covered if every point of the area is covered by at least k sensors. K-coverage isnecessary for many applications; such as intrusion detection; data gathering; and objecttracking. It is also desirable in situations where a stronger environmental monitoringcapability is desired; such as military applications. In this paper; we study the problem of k-coverage in deterministic homogeneous deployments of sensors. We examine the threeregular sensor deployments-triangular; square and hexagonal deployments-for k-coverageof the deployment area; for k≥ 1. We compare the three regular deployments in terms ofsensor density. For each deployment; we compute an upper bound and a lower bound onthe optimal distance of sensors from each other that ensure k-coverage of the area. Wepresent the results for each k from 1 to 20 and show that the required number of sensors …,Intelligent Sensors; Sensor Networks and Information Processing; 2013 IEEE Eighth International Conference on,2013,8
Load balancing for moving object management in a P2P network,Mohammed Eunus Ali; Egemen Tanin; Rui Zhang; Lars Kulik,Abstract Online games and location-based services now form the potential applicationdomains for the P2P paradigm. In P2P systems; balancing the workload is essential foroverall performance. However; existing load balancing techniques for P2P systems weredesigned for stationary data. They can produce undesirable workload allocations for movingobjects that is continuously updated. In this paper; we propose a novel load balancingtechnique for moving object management using a P2P network. Our technique considers themobility of moving objects and uses an accurate cost model to optimize the performance inthe management network; in particular for handling location updates in tandem with queryprocessing. In a comprehensive set of experiments; we show that our load balancingtechnique gives constantly better update and query performance results than existing …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,8
P2p middleware for massively multi-player online games,Shanika Karunasekera; Scott Douglas; Egemen Tanin; Aaron Harwood,The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing paradigm is currently receiving considerable attention.Many recent research advances are enabling P2P systems to be used for complexapplications; beyond simple file sharing. We are currently focusing on Massively Multi-playerOnline Gaming (MMOG) applications. A P2P architecture offers several advantages overcentralized architectures for various applications; including MMOG. Decentralization withhigh scalability and no single point of failure forms the key advantage. Seamlessly unifyingmany peers under one application; especially for complex P2P applications such as MMOG;forms the main challenge. We demonstrate the use of a P2P middleware which enables thedevelopment of such complex applications; and efficient entity maintenance and interactionsfor the highly interactive and visual P2P MMOG application domain.,Proceedings of the 6th International Middleware Conference,2005,8
Complex applications over peer-to-peer networks,Aaron Harwood; Shanika Karunasekera; Sarana Nutanong; Egemen Tanin; M Truong,Existing Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications are designed to provide file sharing. We envisionmore complex applications on P2P systems; eg; P2P virtual-worlds; P2P auction networks;etc. We have developed a layered software architecture called Open Peer-to-Peer Network(OPeN) Architecture to enable such applications. In particular; the objective of our OPeNArchitecture is to allow application developers to focus on their tasks; rather than the detailsof the underlying P2P protocol; for a complex application; and to allow P2P applications tobe developed independently from a specific P2P protocol. The OPeN Architecture consistsof three layers: Connectivity Layer; Services Layer; and Application Layer. The ConnectivityLayer is responsible for P2P object management and routing where different protocols canbe used. We enable P2P protocols to be developed transparently to the higher levels of …,Poster Proceedings of the ACM Middleware,2004,8
Easiest-to-reach neighbor search,Jie Shao; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Studies in cognitive science have shown that people have different optimizationgoals in mind for route selection: beyond shortest travel distance (or time); criteria such assmallest number of turns or straightest path are often considered. A common query that atraveller in a foreign city may ask is" where is a facility of type X". When multiple facilities ofthe same type are available in the nearby area; usually not the nearest neighbor but the onewhich is easiest to find is preferred for giving instructions by locals; especially in anunfamiliar and complex urban environment. This paper studies a novel type of neighboringobject selection problem; taking cognitive complexity of navigation into account. The maindifficulty arises from incorporating spatial chunking and landmark information into neighborcomparisons.

The CASE histogram: privacy-aware processing of trajectory data using aggregates,Maryam Fanaeepour; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin; Benjamin IP Rubinstein,Abstract Due to the high uptake of location-based services (LBSs); large spatio-temporaldatasets of moving objects' trajectories are being created every day. An important task inspatial data analytics is to service range queries by returning trajectory counts within aqueried region. The question of how to keep an individual user's data private whilst enablingspatial data analytics by third parties has become an urgent research direction. Indeed; it isincreasingly becoming a concern for users. To preserve privacy we discard individualtrajectories and aggregate counts over a spatial and temporal partition. However the privacygained comes at a cost to utility: trajectories passing through multiple cells and re-entering aquery region; lead to inaccurate query responses. This is known as the distinct countingproblem. We propose the Connection Aware Spatial Euler (CASE) histogram to address …,GeoInformatica,2015,6

APPOINT: An approach for peer-to-peer offloading the Internet,Egemen Tanin; Hanan Samet,Abstract The Internet has recently become the medium of interaction with large volumes ofonline data. Enterprises in the public and private sectors made their data archives availableover the Internet. Working with such large volumes of online data is a challenging task.APPOINT (an Approach for Peer-to-Peer Offloading the INTernet); a centralized peer-to-peerapproach that helps users of the Internet transfer large volumes of online data efficiently; isintroduced with this paper. In APPOINT; active clients of a client-server architecture act onthe server's behalf and communicate with each other to decrease network latency; improveservice bandwidth; and resolve server congestions.

Is this you?: identifying a mobile user using only diagnostic features,Anthony Quattrone; Tanusri Bhattacharya; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin; James Bailey,Abstract Mobile smart phones capture a great amount of information about a user across avariety of different data domains. This information can be sensitive and allow for identifying auser profile; thus causing potential threats to a user's privacy. Our work shows thatdiagnostic information that is not considered sensitive; could be used to identify a user afterjust three consecutive days of monitoring. We have used the Device Analyzer dataset todetermine what features of a mobile device are important in identifying a user. Many mobilegames and applications collect diagnostic data as a means of identifying or resolving issues.Diagnostic data is commonly accepted as less sensitive information. Our experimentalresults demonstrate that using only diagnostic features like hardware statistics and systemsettings; a user's device can be identified at an accuracy of 94% with a Naive Bayes …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia,2014,5
Materialized views for count aggregates of spatial data,Anan Yaagoub; Xudong Liu; Goce Trajcevski; Egemen Tanin; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract We address the problem of efficient processing of count aggregate queries forspatial objects in OLAP systems. One of the main issues affecting the efficient spatialanalysis is the; so called; distinct counting problem. The core of the problem is due to the factthat spatial objects such as lakes; rivers; etc...–and their representations–have extents. Weinvestigate the trade-offs that arise when (semi) materialized views of the count aggregateare maintained in a hierarchical index and propose two data structures that are based on theQuadtree indexes: Fully Materialize Views (FMV) and Partially Materialized Views (PMV).Each aims at achieving a balance between the:(1) benefits in terms of response time forrange queries;(2) overheads in terms of extra space and update costs.

A survey on data processing issues in wireless sensor networks for enterprise information infrastructure,Kotagiri Ramamohanarao; Lars Kulik; Selvakennedy Selvadurai; Bernhard Scholz; Uwe Roehm; Egemen Tanin; Anastasios Viglas; Albert Zomaya; Chris Leckie,Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a key technology for a broad range of applicationssuch as environmental and habitat monitoring; traffic control; health monitoring; supply-chainmanagement; smart homes; security; and surveillance systems [16]. A WSN is collection of alarge number of inexpensive devices capable of sensing certain physical phenomena;carrying out simple processing tasks; as well as communicating with each other usingwireless networking technology in an adhoc manner. As the evolution of sensors followsMoore's law; sensors become smaller; cheaper; and more powerful. This evolution enablesthe deployment of systems that can consist of hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes.Typically; sensor networks are deployed to gather physical information in a robust andautonomous manner. The data collection can be either continuous or selective; ie; detect …,EII Network Taskforce on Wireless Sensor Networks; Survey Technical Report,2006,5
A location based aggregation algorithm for selective aggregate queries in sensor networks,Muhammad Umer; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,ABSTRACT In-network data aggregation algorithms are based on the premise that theenergy requirements for data collection in sensor networks (SNs) can be significantlyreduced by aggregating and collecting individual sensor readings over an efficient datacollection path. In this work; we focus on selective aggregate queries; ie; queries thataggregate data only from a subset of all network nodes. The task of optimal data collection insuch queries is an instance of the NP-hard minimal Steiner tree problem. We present anaggregation algorithm; called Pocket Driven Trajectories (PDT) that optimizes the datacollection path by approximating the global Steiner tree with a minimal overhead usingpurely local spatial knowledge. We show that selective aggregate queries can lead tovarious node participation scenarios characterized by spatial factors such as the …,Proceedings of GSN (International conference on geosensor networks),2006,5
Trip planning queries for subgroups in spatial databases,Tanzima Hashem; Tahrima Hashem; Mohammed Eunus Ali; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract In this paper; we introduce a novel type of trip planning queries; a subgroup tripplanning (SGTP) query that allows a group to identify the subgroup and the points ofinterests (POIs) from each required type (eg; restaurant; shopping center; movie theater) thathave the minimum aggregate trip distance for any subgroup size. The trip distance of a userstarts at the user's source location and ends at the user's destination via the POIs. Thecomputation of POI set for all possible subgroups with the straightforward application ofgroup trip planning (GTP) algorithms would be prohibitively expensive. We propose analgorithm to compute answers for different subgroup size concurrently with less queryprocessing overhead. We focus on both minimizing the total and maximum trip distance ofthe subgroup. We show the efficiency of our algorithms in experiments using both real …,Australasian Database Conference,2016,4
Spatial consensus queries in a collaborative environment,Mohammed Eunus Ali; Egemen Tanin; Peter Scheuermann; Sarana Nutanong; Lars Kulik,Abstract We introduce a new type of query for a location-based social network platform.Consider a scenario in which a group of users is trying to find a common meeting location;yet attempting to include all group members is introducing a significant traveling cost to mostof them. In this article; we formulate a new query type called the consensus query; which canbe used to help users explore these trade-off options to find a solution upon which everyonecan agree. Specifically; we study the problem of evaluating consensus queries in the contextof nearest neighbor queries; where the group is interested in finding a meeting place thatminimizes the travel distance for at least a specified number of group members. To help thegroup in selecting a suitable solution; the major challenge is to find optimal subgroups of allallowable subgroup sizes; ie; greater or equal to the minimum specified subgroup size …,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,2016,4
A unified framework for authenticating privacy preserving location based services,Tanzima Hashem; Shudip Datta; Tanzir Ul Islam; Mohammed Eunus Ali; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract An important class of location-based services (LBSs) is information queries thatprovide users with location information of nearby point of interests such as a restaurant; ahospital or a gas station. To access an LBS; a user has to reveal her location to the location-based service provider (LSP). From the revealed location; the LSP can infer privateinformation about the user's health; habit and preferences. Thus; along with the benefits;LBSs also bring privacy concern to the users. Hence; protecting the privacy of LBSs users isa major challenge. Another major challenge is to ensure the reliability and correctness of theprovided LBSs by the LSP; which is known as authentication. We develop a novelauthentication technique that supports variants of privacy preserving LBSs with less storageand communication overhead. More importantly; we present a unified framework that can …,Second International ACM Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2015,4
Euler histogram tree: a spatial data structure for aggregate range queries on vehicle trajectories,Hairuo Xie; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik; Peter Scheuermann; Goce Trajcevski; Maryam Fanaeepour,Abstract This work addresses the problem of aggregation of trajectories data. Specifically;we propose a tree-based data structure for counting vehicle trajectories by mapping theminto a set of spatial histograms with different granularities. We also present an approach forprocessing spatio-temporal range queries by aggregating the histograms in the queryrectangles. The proposed methodology can be used for preserving the privacy of vehicledrivers by maintaining aggregated trajectory data. In addition; as we show; it can be used tohandle the well-known distinct counting problem. Experimental results show that the newdata structure achieves a high level of accuracy in query results and consistentlyoutperforms the leading histogram-based approach.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science,2014,4
Opportunistic sampling-based query processing in wireless sensor networks,Muhammad Umer; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik,Abstract High resolution sampling of physical phenomenon is a prime application of largescale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). With hundreds of nodes deployed over vast tracts ofland; monitoring data can now be generated at unprecedented spatio-temporal scales.However; the limited battery life of individual nodes in the network mandates smart ways ofcollecting this data by maximizing localized processing of information at the node level. Inthis paper; we propose a WSN query processing method that enhances localizedinformation processing by harnessing the two inherent aspects of WSN communication; ie;multihop and multipath data transmission. In an active WSN where data collection queriesare regularly processed; multihop and multipath routing leads to a situation where asignificant proportion of nodes relay and overhear data generated by other nodes in the …,Geoinformatica,2013,4
V*-knn: An efficient algorithm for moving k nearest neighbor queries,Sarana Nutanong; Rui Zhang; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik,This demonstration program presents the V*-kNN algorithm; an efficient algorithm to processmoving k nearest neighbor queries (MkNN). The V*-kNN algorithm is based on a safe-regionconcept called the V*-Diagram. By incrementally maintaining the V*-Diagram; V*-kNNcontinuously provides accurate MkNN query results and supports dynamically changingvalues of k. Our approach exploits information regarding the current location of the querypoint and the search space in addition to the data objects. As a result; the V*-kNN has muchsmaller IO and computation costs than existing methods.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,4
Network virtualisation for transparent testing and experimentation of distributed applications,Chris Edwards; Aaron Harwood; Egemen Tanin,Popular network simulation tools; such as ns-2; are useful for undertaking experiments withemerging networking technologies. As networked applications become distributed at scalescomparable to the Internet; such as peer-to-peer applications; testing and experimentationbecomes increasingly difficult and important. With this paper; we are introducing anelaborate extension to existing simulation capabilities by allowing realistic highly distributedapplication prototypes to be attached to a simulator for transparent testing andexperimentation. We enable developers to focus on building their applications rather thandetailing simulation scripts. Testing can then be performed in a natural setting.

Fast learning of optimal connections in a peer-to-peer network,Aaron Harwood; Egemen Tanin; MH Truong,Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocol design is widely undertaken with the assumptions that peersand network connections are homogeneous resources. In practice this assumption is untrue.Furthermore; while there are some P2P networks that provide asymptotic cost optimaltopology; or routing; very few existing protocols combine topology optimization and resourceoptimization; the resulting performance is resource oblivious. We propose a class of trafficbased learning protocols; called FLOC protocols; that learn new connections betweenneighbors of neighbors. For an average routing table size of d and n peers; our protocol isseen to quickly converge from an inefficient network to an asymptotic cost optimal diameterof O (logd n); and simultaneously reduce network delay by approximately 50% in highlyheterogeneous networks.

Comparison of two image-space subdivision algorithms for Direct Volume Rendering on distributed-memory multicomputers,Egemen Tanin; Tahsin M Kurç; Cevdet Aykanat; Bülent Özgüç,Abstract Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) is a powerful technique for visualizing volumetricdata sets. However; it involves intensive computations. In addition; most of the volumetricdata sets consist of large number of 3D sampling points. Therefore; visualization of suchdata sets also requires large computer memory space. Hence; DVR is a good candidate forparallelization on distributed-memory multicomputers. In this work; image-spaceparallelization of Raycasting based DVR for unstructured grids on distributed-memorymulticomputers is presented and discussed. In order to visualize unstructured volumetricdatasets where grid points of the dataset are irregularly distributed over the 3D space; theunderlying algorithms should resolve the point location and view sort problems of the 3Dgrid points. In this paper; these problems are solved using a Scanline Z-buffer based …,International Workshop on Applied Parallel Computing,1995,4

The system uses skeletal tracking of the instructor and the students; renderedas virtual avatars. Using a virtual reality headset; the student can visualise the movement ofthe instructor's avatar; rendered in place of their own body.

Combining range-based and range-free methods: A unified approach for localization,Anthony Quattrone; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Localization schemes used for positioning are currently based on either range-based or range-free principles. We propose a unified approach that combines the strengthsof both methods while overcoming their limitations. Range-based methods rely on takingreliable measurements in which geometric techniques are then applied. These techniquesare very susceptible to imprecision in captured measurements. Range-free methods do notconsider the actual numerical sensor value; rather comparing magnitudes across sensors.These comparisons are not always reliable and may lead to an accumulation of errors. Ourunified approach mitigates these effects by first using a range-based method to determinean approximate location followed by a range-free method to refine the positioning estimatefurther. Our experiments show the mean estimation error improves when applying our …,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,3
Travel distance versus navigation complexity: A study on different spatial queries on road networks,Jie Shao; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin; Long Guo,Abstract Research on cognitive science indicates that humans often use different criteria forroute selection. An alternative type of spatial proximity search on road networks recently hasbeen proposed to find the easiest-to-reach neighboring object with the smallest navigationcomplexity. This paper presents an evaluation to compare the effectiveness of easiest-to-reach neighbor query against a classic nearest neighbor query in a real-world setting. Ouruser study demonstrates usability of the new spatial query type and suggests people maynot always care about travel distance most. To provide flexibility to accommodate differentrequirements; we also show how to achieve tradeoff between navigation complexity andtravel distance for advanced navigational assistance.,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,3
Location oblivious privacy protection for group nearest neighbor queries,AKM Mustafizur Rahman Khan; Tanzima Hashem; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik,Abstract Finding a convenient meeting point for a group is a common problem. For example;a group of users may want to meet at a restaurant that minimizes the group's total traveldistance. Such queries are called Group Nearest Neighbor (GNN) queries. Up to now; usershave had to rely on an external party; typically a location service provider (LSP); forcomputing an optimal meeting point. This implies that users have to trust the LSP with theirprivate locations. Existing techniques for private GNN queries either cannot resistsophisticated attacks or are computationally too expensive to be implemented on thepopular platform of mobile phones. This paper proposes an algorithm to efficiently processprivate GNN queries. To achieve high efficiency we propose an approach that approximatesa GNN with a high accuracy and is robust to attacks.

Protecting mobile users from visual privacy attacks,Mohammed Eunus Ali; Anika Anwar; Ishrat Ahmed; Tanzima Hashem; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract An increasing number of people are using mobile devices in public places such asbuses; trains; airports; coffee shops; and restaurants. Though the flexibility to work remotelyusing mobile devices make people more productive; this new working practice incurs un-authorized visual access of the mobile display by the bystanders; which we call visualprivacy attack. Failing to prevent un-authorized people viewing sensitive information such aspasswords; emails; and business information could lead to financial loss; public exposure;and embarrassment. In this paper; we propose a solution that captures the surroundingenvironment through user's mobile phone camera and determines whether any un-authorized person is obtaining visual access to the user's mobile screen.

Protection of sensitive trajectory datasets through spatial and temporal exchange,Elham Naghizade; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Privacy concerns place a great impediment to publishing and/or exchangingtrajectory data across companies and institutions. This has urged researchers to addressprivacy issues prior to trajectory data release. Currently; privacy preserving solutions distortoriginal data unnecessarily; hence; degrade data utility and make such data less useful forthird parties. We consider a trajectory as a sequence of stops and moves; and propose anapproach that exploits features of a trajectory as means for preserving privacy whilemaintaining a high level of utility. We introduce the concept of sensitivity for stops based onthe assumption that they are more vulnerable to privacy threats. We propose an efficientalgorithm that either substitutes sensitive stop points of a trajectory with moves from thesame trajectory or introduces a minimal detour if a less sensitive stop can not be found on …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,3
Local network voronoi diagrams,Sarana Nutanong; Egemen Tanin; Mohammed Eunus Ali; Lars Kulik,Abstract Continuous queries in road networks have gained significant research interests dueto advances in GIS and mobile computing. Consider the following scenario:" A driver uses anetworked GPS navigator to monitor five nearest gas stations in a road network." The mainchallenge of processing such a moving query is how to efficiently monitor network distancesof the k nearest and possible resultant objects. To enable result monitoring in real-time;researchers have devised techniques which utilize precomputed distances and results; eg;the network Voronoi diagram (NVD). However; the main drawback of preprocessing is that itrequires access to all data objects and network nodes; which means that it is not suitable forlarge datasets in many real life situations. The best existing method to monitor kNN resultswithout precomputation relies on executions of snapshot queries at network nodes …,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,3
Opportunistic sampling in wireless sensor networks,Muhammad Umer; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik,Abstract In an active WSN where user queries are regularly processed; a significantproportion of nodes relay and overhear data generated by other nodes in the network. In thispaper; we propose to exploit this mode of data communication towards a gradual buildup ofglobal knowledge. We show that by harnessing the multihop and multipath communicationadvantages; only a few user queries in a WSN can lead to an accumulation of accurateglobal knowledge at node level. This global knowledge can greatly improve numerous WSNapplications when used in data validation; event detection; and query optimization.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,3

While a cube requiressurface area 2d; we construct such a bubble having surface area very close to that of asphere; that is; proportional to cacm5510_b. gif (the minimum possible even without theconstraint of being periodic). Our method for constructing this" spherical cube" is inspired byfoundational questions in the theory of computation related to the concept of hardnessamplification. Our methods give new algorithms for" coordinated discretization" of high-dimensional data points; which have near-optimal noise resistance.

On the effectiveness of removing location information from trajectory data for preserving location privacy,Amina Hossain; Anthony Quattrone; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik,Abstract The ubiquity of GPS enabled smartphones with Internet connectivity has resulted inthe widespread development of location-based services (LBSs). People use these servicesto obtain useful advises for their daily activities. For example; a user can open a navigationapp to find a route that results in the shortest driving time from the current location to adestination. Nevertheless; people have to reveal location information to the LBS providers toleverage such services. Location information is sensitive since it can reveal habits about anindividual. LBS providers are aware of this and take measures to protect user privacy. Onewell established and simple approach is to remove GPS data from user data working withthe assumption that it will lead to a high degree of privacy. In this paper; we challenge thisnotion of removing location information while retaining other features would lead to a high …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science,2016,2
Location-based social networking for obtaining personalised driving advice,Abdullah AlDwyish; Egemen Tanin; Shanika Karunasekera,Abstract Major navigation companies have resorted to crowdsourcing for obtaining trafficdata to improve their services. In fact; a new generation of navigation systems are emergingfor the sole purpose of connecting drivers on the road (Waze. com) so that they benefit fromeach other. The focus of these efforts is on real-time traffic estimation. While obtaining real-time data is desirable and has great benefits; it is still limited; given the potential of thedetailed individual data from drivers. For example; commuters in a city have valuableknowledge about their city as a result of their daily commute over many years. Using driversas mere traffic sensors and aggregating their data desposes off any human knowledge thatexists in their choices.

On optimal arrangements of binary sensors,Parvin Asadzadeh; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin; Anthony Wirth,Abstract A large range of monitoring applications can benefit from binary sensor networks.Binary sensors can detect the presence or absence of a particular target in their sensingregions. They can be used to partition a monitored area and provide localizationfunctionality. If many of these sensors are deployed to monitor an area; the area ispartitioned into sub-regions: each sub-region is characterized by the sensors detectingtargets within it. We aim to maximize the number of unique; distinguishable sub-regions. Ourgoal is an optimal placement of both omni-directional and directional static binary sensors.We compute an upper bound on the number of unique sub-regions; which growsquadratically with respect to the number of sensors. In particular; we propose arrangementsof sensors within a monitored area whose number of unique sub-regions is asymptotically …,International Conference on Spatial Information Theory,2011,2
Spatio-temporal database research at the university of melbourne,Egemen Tanin; Rui Zhang; Lars Kulik,Abstract The spatio-temporal database research group at the University of Melbournefocuses on introducing new techniques for distributed systems such as mobile andubiquitous systems as well as P2P networks. Our approach is to exploit the spatial andtemporal nature of data and queries such as motion characteristics. In this article; we discussfour major themes and projects of the group:(i) nearest neighbor queries;(ii) temporal dataprocessing and continuous queries;(iii) P2P spatial data management; and (iv) locationprivacy.

Hierarchical Data Summarization,Egemen Tanin,A hash function is a well-defined deterministic algorithm that takes as input data of arbitrarylength and produces a short fixed-length digital representation of the data; or a digest; as itsoutput. The output of a hash function can serve the role of a digital ''fingerprint''of the inputdata; as an important design property of hash functions is that of collision resilience: twohashes produced on different inputs are very unlikely to result in the same value.Furthermore; given a hash function output; it is normally infeasible to find a (previouslyunseen) input that matches that output (this property is called preimage resistance).,*,2009,2
Accessing diverse geo-referenced data sources with the SAND spatial DBMS,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Egemen Tanin; Hanan Samet; Frantisek Brabec,Abstract The Internet has become the most frequently accessed medium for obtainingvarious types of data. In particular; government agencies; academic institutions; and privateenterprises have published gigabytes of geo-referenced data on the Web. However; toobtain geo-referenced data from the Web successfully; systems must be designed to becapable of understanding the data sets published in different data formats. Also; even if thedata sets are available in a simple known format; they often have poorly defined structures.With these issues in mind; we have developed an Internet-enabled data collection andconversion utility that interfaces with our prototype spatial database system; SAND. Usingthis utility; data can be retrieved from many different sources on the Web and converted intoa format understandable by the SAND spatial database management system.

Comparison of image space subdivision algorithms for parallel volume rendering,Egemen Tanin,In many scientific applications; results are presented as unstructured volumetric data sets.Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) is a powerful way of visualizing these volumetric data sets.However; it involves intensive computations. In addition; most of the volumetric data setsalso require huge memories. Hence; DVR is a good candidate for parallelization ondistributed memory multicomputers. Also most of the engineering simulations are done onmulticomputers. Therefore; visualization of these results on the same architectures wheresimulations are done avoids the overhead of transporting large amount of data. In order tovisualize unstructured volumetric data sets; the underlying algorithms should resolve thepoint location and the view sort problems of the 3D grid points. In this thesis; these problemsare solved by using the well-known Scanline Z-Buffer algorithm. Three image space …,*,1995,2
PrivacyPalisade: Evaluating app permissions and building privacy into smartphones,Anthony Quattrone; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao; Tao Gu,Privacy has become a key concern for smartphone users as many apps tend to access andshare sensitive data. However; it is not easily understandable for users which apps accesswhat type of data and which are the minimal access permissions required to achieve acertain functionality. Although there are apps targeting privacy concerns; they only showwhich type of data is accessed but not whether it is necessary for an app to achieve itsfunctionality. We propose a model that groups apps together in terms of advertisedfunctionality and assesses an app's privacy intrusiveness based on the requestedpermissions relative to similar apps. To improve user comprehension of permissions; weimplement PrivacyPalisade and demonstrate Android OS level modifications that use visualcues to indicate the privacy intrusiveness of an app. If an app requests a permission that …,Information; Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS); 2015 10th International Conference on,2015,1

OAL queries have many applications such asthe selection of the optimal location for a mobile facility such as a food truck or selection of avenue for an event. We exploit geometric properties and develop pruning techniques toeliminate unrelated path segments as well as locations.

How private can i be among public users?,Elham Naghizade; James Bailey; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract People are increasingly volunteering personal data. Services based on this datarely on a high number of participants and high data quality. Personal data is often seen asprivate and individuals are more likely to provide such data if they can choose its granularity;eg; instead of an exact value; they may provide a range. Focusing on spatial crowdsourceddata; this work aims to determine whether the common method of coarsening location dataof privacy-conscious individuals is an effective approach if fine-grained location data hasalso been submitted by privacy-apathetic users. We propose a novel inference attack torefine the location of privacy-conscious individuals. Our experiments suggest that even witha dataset that is mostly populated with privacy-conscious users; our technique succeedswith high precision and recall.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing,2015,1
Tell Me What You Want and I Will Tell Others Where You Have Been,Anthony Quattrone; Elham Naghizade; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Trajectory data does not only show the location of users over a period of time; butalso reveals a high level of detail regarding their lifestyle; preferences and habits. Hence; itis highly susceptible to privacy concerns. Trajectory privacy has become a key researchtopic when sharing/exchanging trajectory datasets. Most existing studies focus on protectingtrajectory data through obfuscating; anonymising or perturbing the data with the aim tomaximize user privacy. Although such approaches appear plausible; our work suggests thatprecise trajectory information can be inferred even from other sources of data. We considerthe case in which a location service provider only shares POI query results of users with thirdparties instead of exchanging users' raw trajectory data to preserve privacy. We develop aninference algorithm and show that it can effectively approximate original trajectories using …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,1

Using a Traffic Simulator for Navigation Service,Abdullah AlDwyish; Hairuo Xie; Egemen Tanin; Shanika Karunasekera; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao,Abstract Traffic congestion is a serious problem that is only expected to get worse in thefuture. Statistics shows that half of traffic congestion is caused by temporary disruptions likeaccidents. These events have dramatic impact on road network availability and cause hugedelays for commuters. Also; they are usually unexpected and hard to manage by trafficauthorities. State-of-the-art navigation systems started to provide real-time information abouttraffic conditions to help users make better routing decisions. However; traffic in the roadnetwork changes rapidly and the advice calculated now may not be valid after few minutes.This is especially critical in the presence of traffic incidents; where the impact of the incidentcould cause traffic to propagate to nearby roads. Thus; it is important for navigation systemsto consider the evolution and future impact of traffic events.

They willchange traffic significantly. Self-driving cars can infer and decide travel paths frompassenger input. Passengers do not need to involve in route planning. This provides greatopportunities for traffic management systems to collaborate and achieve more efficient trafficmanagement. By knowing most source-destination pairs of the passengers; we envisage anincreasingly integrated system that can optimize routes and traffic lights to minimize traveltime.

Ride-sharing is About Agreeing on a Destination,AKM Khan; Oscar Correa; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao,Abstract Ride-sharing is rapidly becoming an alternative form of transportation mainly due toits economic benefits. Existing research on ridesharing aims to optimally match trajectoriesbetween people with pre-selected destinations. In this paper; we show better ride-sharingarrangements are possible when users are presented with more destinations and agree ona common destination. Given a set of points of interest (POIs) and a set of users; ourapproach presents destination POIs and computes ride-sharing plans. Each arrangement fora subset of users that fit in a car can be presented as a minimum Steiner tree (MST) problem.An optimal solution of the overall problem minimizes the total length of all the MSTs.

Challenges of Differentially Private Release of Data Under an Open-world Assumption,Elham Naghizade; James Bailey; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Since its introduction a decade ago; differential privacy has been deployed andadapted in different application scenarios due to its rigorous protection of individuals' privacyregardless of the adversary's background knowledge. An urgent open research issue is howto query/release time evolving datasets in a differentially private manner. Most of theproposed solutions in this area focus on releasing private counters or histograms; whichinvolve low sensitivity; and the main focus of these solutions is minimizing the amount ofnoise and the utility loss throughout the process. In this paper we consider the case ofreleasing private numerical values with unbounded sensitivity in a dataset that grows overtime.

Toaddress certain challenges in emergency vehicle prioritization; we perform microscopicsimulations of an intelligent transportation system; where emergency vehicles broadcastcertain information about their routes to nearby vehicles and traffic lights.

Location privacy for group meetups,AKM Khan; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract A Group Nearest Neighbor (GNN) query finds a point of interest (POI) thatminimizes the aggregate distance for a group of users. In current systems; users have toreveal their exact; often sensitive locations to issue a GNN query. This calls for private GNNqueries. However; existing methods for private GNN queries either are computationally tooexpensive for mobile phones or cannot resist sophisticated attacks. Our approach canefficiently and effectively process an important variant of private GNN queries: queries thatminimize the maximum distance for any user in the group.

Mining city-wide encounters in real-time,Anthony Quattrone; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin,Abstract Recent advancements in data mining coupled with the ubiquity of mobile deviceshas led to the possibility of mining for events in real-time. We introduce the problem ofmining for an individual's encounters. As people travel; they may have encounters with oneanother. We are interested in detecting the encounters of traveling individuals at the exactmoment in which each of them occur. A simple solution is to use a nearest neighbor searchto return potential encounters; this results in slow query response times. To mine forencounters in real-time; we introduce a new algorithm that is efficient in capturingencounters by exploiting the observation that just the neighbors in a defined proximity needsto be maintained. Our evaluation demonstrates that our proposed method mines forencounters for millions of individuals in a city area within milliseconds.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,*

A Randomized Path Routing Algorithm for Decentralized Route Allocation in Transportation Networks,Uyen TV Nguyen; Shanika Karunasekera; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin; Rui Zhang; Haolan Zhang; Hairuo Xie; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao,Abstract Route planning in current route guidance systems is primarily based on the shortestpath strategy (eg; suggesting a path that minimizes the travel distance between source anddestination) for an individual driver. A drawback of such an approach is that there is a highprobability that many drivers; who share the same source and destination; follow the sameroute. This can lead to over-saturated road links. We propose a simple yet effective multiplepath routing algorithm that addresses this limitation. The proposed algorithm augments theA* search algorithm with a randomization component; which helps to perturb the order of thesearched nodes and to produce diversified routes for different drivers with the same sourceand destination. Our algorithm enables decentralized route allocations; ie; each vehiclecomputes its own route without a central server.

A simple localization system for ad-hoc indoor meetings through wireless connection points,Sangyeop Lee; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik,Abstract Wireless sensor technologies have become popular in recent years as the cost ofelectronics decreases. In addition; various sensors were incorporated into a smartphone;which caused the integration of many applications into one device. Navigation is a typicalapplication of a smartphone. A common assumption in navigation is that a person's positionhas to be known exactly so most papers have focused on the localization process itselfrather than customizing it for a specific application. In this paper we will show that complexsystems or algorithms are not necessary for the purpose of getting two parties to meet inindoor situations. A robust localization system was implemented using popular sensors in asmartphone and simple localization techniques. We show that this system can localize aperson with room-level accuracy to help two people to meet each other in a building.,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia,2014,*

For manyapplications; it is sufficient to monitor the boundary of a physical phenomenon instead of thefull extent of the phenomenon in return for significant energy savings. However; continuousmonitoring of a large phenomena with irregular boundaries will still incur a significantenergy expenditure in a sensor network. We propose a novel distributed algorithm;SpatialZip; to efficiently simplify the boundary resulting in less energy expenditure.,Intelligent Sensors; Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP); 2011 Seventh International Conference on,2011,*
On Optimal Arrangements of Binary Sensors,Parvin Asadzadeh Birjandi; Lars Kulik; Egemen Tanin; Anthony Wirth,A large range of monitoring applications can benefit from binary sensor networks. Binarysensors can detect the presence or absence of a particular target in their sensing regions.They can be used to partition a monitored area and provide localization functionality. If manyof these sensors are deployed to monitor an area; the area is partitioned into sub-regions:each sub-region is characterized by the sensors detecting targets within it. We aim tomaximize the number of unique; distinguishable sub-regions. Our goal is an optimalplacement of both omni-directional and directional static binary sensors. We compute anupper bound on the number of unique sub-regions; which grows quadratically with respectto the number of sensors. In particular; we propose arrangements of sensors within amonitored area whose number of unique sub-regions is asymptotically equivalent to the …,*,2011,*

Browsing Large Online Data Tables Using Generalized Query Previews (2001),Egemen Tanin; Ben Shneiderman,Companies; government agencies; and other organizations are making their data availableto the world over the Internet. They often use large online relational tables for this purpose.Users query such tables with front-ends that typically use menus or form fillin interfaces; butthese interfaces rarely give users information about the contents and distribution of the data.Such a situation leads users to waste time and network resources posing queries that havezero-hit or mega-hit results. Generalized query previews enable efficient browsing of largeonline databases by supplying data distribution information to the users. The datadistribution information provides continuous feedback about the size of the result set as thequery is being formed.

Current database front-ends do not giveusers information about the distribution of data. This leads many users to waste time andnetwork resources posing queries that have either zero-hit or mega-hit result sets. Querypreviews form a novel visual approach for browsing large databases. Query previews supplydata distribution information about the database that is being searched and give continuousfeedback about the size of the result set for the query as it is being formed. On the otherhand; query previews use only a few pre-selected attributes of the database. The distributioninformation is displayed only on these attributes. Unfortunately; many databases are formedof numerous relations and attributes.

く> Sponsored by,E Tanin; R Beigel; B Shneiderman,Abstract Dynamic query interfaces (DQIs) are a recently developed database accessmechanism that provides continuous real-time feedback to the user during queryformulation. Previous work shows that DQIs are an elegant and powerful interface to smalldatabases. Unfortunately; when applied to large databases; previous DQI algorithms slow toa crawl. We present a new incremental approach to DQI algorithms that works well withlarge databases; both in theory and in practice.,*,*,*
Spatial Spreadsheets and Browsers: Sand Internet Browser,Hanan Samet; Houman Alborzi; František Brabec; Frank Morgan; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Egemen Tanin; Claudio Esperança,Issues that concern the browsing of spatial and nonspatial data typical of geographicalinformation systems (GIS) in a distributed DBMS environment are being investigated. Theseissues include techniques for storage and retrieval of large volumes of vector and rasterdata; their transmission and presentation at multiple resolution levels; query optimizationparadigms which favor incremental (pipelined) evaluation plans; and interoperability. Themain goal of this project is to make possible for client applications to browse vast amounts ofspatial and non-spatial data over a local and/or wide area network at truly interactive rates.The peer-to-peer networking approach as well as the more general client-server approach isbeing considered. We also focus on interaction paradigms that make it unnecessary to resortto conventional query languages such as SQL (although our graphical query paradigm …,*,*,*

Algorithms for Direct Volume Rendering,Egemen Tanin; Tahsin M Kurg; Cevdet Aykanat; Biilent Dzgiig,Abstract. Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) is a powerful technique for visualizing volumetricdata sets. However; it involves intensive computations. In addition; most of the volumetricdata sets consist of large num—ber of 3D sampling points. Therefore; visualization of suchdata sets also requires large computer memory space. Hence; DVR is a good candidate forparallelization on distributed-memory multicomputers. In this work; image-spaceparallelization of Raycasting based DVR for unstructured grids on distributed-memorymulticomputers is presented and discussed. In order to visualize unstructured volumetricdatasets where grid points of the dataset are irregularly distributed over the 3D space; theunderlying algorithms should resolve the point location and view sort problems of the 3Dgrid points. In this paper; these problems are solved using a Scanline Z-buﬁer based …,*,*,*
