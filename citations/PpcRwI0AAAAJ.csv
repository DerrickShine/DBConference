Querying k-truss community in large and dynamic graphs,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Lu Qin; Wentao Tian; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Community detection which discovers densely connected structures in a networkhas been studied a lot. In this paper; we study online community search which is practicallyuseful but less studied in the literature. Given a query vertex in a graph; the problem is to findmeaningful communities that the vertex belongs to in an online manner. We propose a novelcommunity model based on the k-truss concept; which brings nice structural andcomputational properties. We design a compact and elegant index structure which supportsthe efficient search of k-truss communities with a linear cost with respect to the communitysize. In addition; we investigate the k-truss community search problem in a dynamic graphsetting with frequent insertions and deletions of graph vertices and edges. Extensiveexperiments on large real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,72
Robust reputation-based ranking on bipartite rating networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffery Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng,Abstract With the growth of the Internet and E-commerce; bipartite rating networks areubiquitous. In such bipartite rating networks; there exist two types of entities: the users andthe objects; where users give ratings to objects. A fundamental problem in such networks ishow to rank the objects by user's ratings. Although it has been extensively studied in the pastdecade; the existing algorithms either cannot guarantee convergence; or are not robust tothe spammers. In this paper; we propose six new reputation-based algorithms; where theusers' reputation is determined by the aggregated difference between the users' ratings andthe corresponding objects' rankings. We prove that all of our algorithms converge into aunique fixed point. The time and space complexity of our algorithms are linear wrt the size ofthe graph; thus they can be scalable to large datasets. Moreover; our algorithms are …,*,2012,52
Approximate closest community search in networks,Xin Huang; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng,Abstract Recently; there has been significant interest in the study of the community searchproblem in social and information networks: given one or more query nodes; find denselyconnected communities containing the query nodes. However; most existing studies do notaddress the" free rider" issue; that is; nodes far away from query nodes and irrelevant tothem are included in the detected community. Some state-of-the-art models have attemptedto address this issue; but not only are their formulated problems NP-hard; they do not admitany approximations without restrictive assumptions; which may not always hold in practice.In this paper; given an undirected graph G and a set of query nodes Q; we study communitysearch using the k-truss based community model. We formulate our problem of finding aclosest truss community (CTC); as finding a connected k-truss subgraph with the largest k …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,25
Clustering large attributed information networks: an efficient incremental computing approach,Hong Cheng; Yang Zhou; Xin Huang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract In recent years; many information networks have become available for analysis;including social networks; road networks; sensor networks; biological networks; etc. Graphclustering has shown its effectiveness in analyzing and visualizing large networks. The goalof graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into clusters based on variouscriteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity. Many existing graphclustering methods mainly focus on the topological structures; but largely ignore the vertexproperties which are often heterogeneous. Recently; a new graph clustering algorithm; SA-cluster; has been proposed which combines structural and attribute similarities through aunified distance measure. SA-Cluster performs matrix multiplication to calculate the randomwalk distances between graph vertices. As part of the clustering refinement; the graph …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2012,22
Top-K structural diversity search in large networks,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Social contagion depicts a process of information (eg; fads; opinions; news)diffusion in the online social networks. A recent study reports that in a social contagionprocess the probability of contagion is tightly controlled by the number of connectedcomponents in an individual's neighborhood. Such a number is termed structural diversity ofan individual and it is shown to be a key predictor in the social contagion process. Based onthis; a fundamental issue in a social network is to find top-k users with the highest structuraldiversities. In this paper; we; for the first time; study the top-k structural diversity searchproblem in a large network. Specifically; we develop an effective upper bound of structuraldiversity for pruning the search space. The upper bound can be incrementally refined in thesearch process. Based on such upper bound; we propose an efficient framework for top-k …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,20
Dense community detection in multi-valued attributed networks,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract The proliferation of rich information available for real world entities and theirrelationships gives rise to a general type of graph; namely multi-valued attributed graph;where graph vertices are associated with a number of attributes and a vertex may havemultiple values on an attribute. It would be useful if we can cluster such graphs into denselyconnected components with homogeneous attribute values. Recent work has studied graphclustering in attributed graphs considering the full attribute space. However; full spaceclustering often leads to poor results due to irrelevant attributes. In this paper; we studysubspace clustering in multi-valued attributed graph and propose an algorithm SCMAG forcommunity detection. Our algorithm uses a cell-based subspace clustering approach andidentifies cells with dense connectivity in the subspaces. Random walk with restart is …,Information Sciences,2015,19
Measuring the impact of MVC attack in large complex networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Zechao Shang,Abstract Measuring the impact of network attack is an important issue in network science. Inthis paper; we study the impact of maximal vertex coverage (MVC) attack in large complexnetworks; where the attacker aims at deleting as many edges of the network as possible byattacking a small fraction of nodes. First; we present two metrics to measure the impact ofMVC attack. To compute these metrics; we propose an efficient randomized greedyalgorithm with near-optimal performance guarantee. Second; we generalize the MVC attackinto an uncertain setting; in which a node is deleted by the attacker with a prior probability.We refer to the MVC attack under such uncertain environment as the probabilistic MVCattack. Based on the probabilistic MVC attack; we propose two adaptive metrics; and thenpresent an adaptive greedy algorithm for calculating such metrics accurately and …,Information Sciences,2014,16
Random-walk domination in large graphs,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng,We introduce and formulate two types of random-walk domination problems in graphsmotivated by a number of applications in practice (eg; item-placement problem in onlinesocial networks; Ads-placement problem in advertisement networks; and resource-placement problem in P2P networks). Specifically; given a graph G; the goal of the first typeof random-walk domination problem is to target k nodes such that the total hitting time of anL-length random walk starting from the remaining nodes to the targeted nodes is minimized.The second type of random-walk domination problem is to find k nodes to maximize theexpected number of nodes that hit any one targeted node through an L-length random walk.We prove that these problems are two special instances of the submodular set functionmaximization with cardinality constraint problem.

Truss decomposition of probabilistic graphs: Semantics and algorithms,Xin Huang; Wei Lu; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract A key operation in network analysis is the discovery of cohesive subgraphs. Thenotion of $ k $-truss has gained considerable popularity in this regard; based on its richstructure and efficient computability. However; many complex networks such as social;biological and communication networks feature uncertainty; best modeled usingprobabilities. Unfortunately the problem of discovering k-trusses in probabilistic graphs hasreceived little attention to date. In this paper; given a probabilistic graph G; number k andparameter γ--(0; 1]; we define a (k; γ)-truss as a maximal connected subgraph H⊆ G; inwhich for each edge; the probability that it is contained in at least (k-2) triangles is at least γ.We develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for decomposing a probabilisticgraph into such maximal (k; γ)-trusses. The above definition of a (k; γ)-truss is local in that …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,11
Measuring robustness of complex networks under MVC attack,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Zechao Shang,Abstract Measuring robustness of complex networks is a fundamental task for analyzing thestructure and function of complex networks. In this paper; we study the network robustnessunder the maximal vertex coverage (MVC) attack; where the attacker aims to delete as manyedges of the network as possible by attacking a small fraction of nodes. First; we present tworobustness metrics of complex networks based on MVC attack. We then propose an efficientrandomized greedy algorithm with near-optimal performance guarantee for computing theproposed metrics. Finally; we conduct extensive experiments on 20 real datasets. Theresults show that P2P and co-authorship networks are extremely robust under the MVCattack while both the online social networks and the Email communication networks exhibitvulnerability under the MVC attack.

Semi-supervised clustering of graph objects: a subgraph mining approach,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Jiong Yang; Jeffery Xu Yu; Hongliang Fei; Jun Huan,Abstract Semi-supervised clustering has recently received a lot of attention in the literature;which aims to improve the clustering performance with limited supervision. Most existingsemi-supervised clustering studies assume that the data is represented in a vector space;eg; text and relational data. When the data objects have complex structures; eg; proteins andchemical compounds; those semi-supervised clustering methods are not directly applicableto clustering such graph objects. In this paper; we study the problem of semi-supervisedclustering of data objects which are represented as graphs. The supervision information is inthe form of pairwise constraints of must-links and cannot-links. As there is no predefinedfeature set for the graph objects; we propose to use discriminative subgraph patterns as thefeatures. We design an objective function which incorporates the constraints to guide the …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,7
Attribute-driven community search,Xin Huang; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Recently; community search over graphs has gained significant interest. Inapplications such as analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks; citation graphs;and collaboration networks; nodes tend to have attributes. Unfortunately; most previouscommunity search algorithms ignore attributes and result in communities with poor cohesionwrt their node attributes. In this paper; we study the problem of attribute-driven communitysearch; that is; given an undirected graph G where nodes are associated with attributes; andan input query Q consisting of nodes V q and attributes W q; find the communities containingV q; in which most community members are densely inter-connected and have similarattributes. We formulate this problem as finding attributed truss communities (ATC); ie;finding connected and close k-truss subgraphs containing V q; with the largest attribute …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,5
A framework of algorithms: Computing the bias and prestige of nodes in trust networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng,A trust network is a social network in which edges represent the trust relationship betweentwo nodes in the network. In a trust network; a fundamental question is how to assess andcompute the bias and prestige of the nodes; where the bias of a node measures thetrustworthiness of a node and the prestige of a node measures the importance of the node.The larger bias of a node implies the lower trustworthiness of the node; and the largerprestige of a node implies the higher importance of the node. In this paper; we define avector-valued contractive function to characterize the bias vector which results in a richfamily of bias measurements; and we propose a framework of algorithms for computing thebias and prestige of nodes in trust networks. Based on our framework; we develop fouralgorithms that can calculate the bias and prestige of nodes effectively and robustly. The …,PloS one,2012,5
Community search over big graphs: Models; algorithms; and opportunities,Xin Huang; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jianliang Xu,Communities serve as basic structures for understanding the organization of many real-world networks; such as social; biological; collaboration; and communication networks.Recently; community search over large graphs has attracted significantly increasingattention; from simple and static graphs to evolving; attributed; location-based graphs.Different from the well-studied problem of community detection that finds all communities inan entire network; community search is to find the cohesive communities wrt the querynodes. In this tutorial; we survey the state-of-the-art of community search on various kinds ofnetworks across different application areas such as densely-connected community search;attributed community search; social circle discovery; and querying geosocial groups.

Querying intimate-core groups in weighted graphs,Dong Zheng; Jianquan Liu; Rong-Hua Li; Cigdem Aslay; Yi-Cheng Chen; Xin Huang,The semantic intimacy of relations in many real-world networks (eg; social; biological; andcommunication networks) can be modeled by weighted edges in which the moresemantically intimate relations between the nodes translate to smaller edge weights.Recently; the problem of community search that aims to find the cohesive groups containinga given set of query nodes has attracted a great deal of attention. However; the bulk ofliterature on community search problem assumes a simple unweighted input graph; ignoringhow semantically intimate the nodes have in retrieved communities. The discoveredcommunities may have a highly cohesive structure; while they perform poorly in thesemantic of intimate connections.

Attributed Community Analysis: Global and Ego-centric Views.,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract The proliferation of rich information available for real world entities and theirrelationships gives rise to a type of graph; namely attributed graph; where graph vertices areassociated with a number of attributes. The set of an attribute can be formed by a series ofkeywords. In attributed graphs; it is practically useful to discover communities of denselyconnected components with homogeneous attribute values. In terms of different aspects; thecommunity analysis tasks can be categorized into global network-wide and ego-centricpersonalized. The global network-wide community analysis considers the entire network;such that community detection; which is to find all communities in a network. On the otherhand; the ego-centric personalized community analysis focuses on the local neighborhoodsubgraph of given query nodes; such that community search.

AmpuBase: a transcriptome database for eight species of apple snails (Gastropoda: Ampullariidae),Jack CH Ip; Huawei Mu; Qian Chen; Jin Sun; Santiago Ituarte; Horacio Heras; Bert Van Bocxlaer; Monthon Ganmanee; Xin Huang; Jian-Wen Qiu,Gastropoda; with approximately 80;000 living species; is the largest class of Mollusca.Among gastropods; apple snails (family Ampullariidae) are globally distributed in tropicaland subtropical freshwater ecosystems and many species are ecologically andeconomically important. Ampullariids exhibit various morphological and physiologicaladaptations to their respective habitats; which make them ideal candidates for studyingadaptation; population divergence; speciation; and larger-scale patterns of diversity;including the biogeography of native and invasive populations. The limited availability ofgenomic data; however; hinders in-depth ecological and evolutionary studies of these non-model organisms.

Ontology-based Graph Visualization for Summarized View,Xin Huang; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; William K Cheung; Yanchun Zhang; Jiming Liu,Abstract Data summarization that presents a small subset of a dataset to users has beenwidely applied in numerous applications and systems. Many datasets are coded withhierarchical terminologies; eg; the international classification of Diseases-9; Medical SubjectHeading; and Gene Ontology; to name a few. In this paper; we study the problem ofselecting a diverse set of k elements to summarize an input dataset with hierarchicalterminologies; and visualize the summary in an ontology structure. We propose an efficientgreedy algorithm to solve the problem with (1-1/e)≈ 62%-approximation guarantee.Preliminary experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness andefficiency of the proposed algorithm for data summarization.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Discovering Hierarchical Subgraphs of K-Core-Truss,Zhen-jun Li; Wei-Peng Zhang; Rong-Hua Li; Jun Guo; Xin Huang; Rui Mao,Abstract Discovering dense subgraphs in a graph is a fundamental graph mining task; whichhas a wide range of applications in social networks; biology and graph visualization to namea few. Even the problems of computing most dense subgraphs (eg; clique; quasi-clique; k-densest subgraph) are NP-hard; there exists polynomial time algorithms for computing k-core and k-truss. In this paper; we propose a novel dense subgraph; k-core-truss; thatleverages on a new type of important edges based on the concepts of k-core and k-truss.Compared with k-core and k-truss; k-core-truss can significantly discover the interesting andimportant structural information outside the scope of the k-core and k-truss. We study twouseful problems of k-core-truss decomposition and k-core-truss search. In particular; wedevelop a k-core-truss decomposition algorithm to find all k-core-truss in a graph G by …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2017,*
I/O-efficient algorithms for top-k nearest keyword search in massive graphs,Qiankun Zhu; Hong Cheng; Xin Huang,Abstract Networks emerging nowadays usually have labels or textual content on the nodes.We model such commonly seen network as an undirected graph G; in which each node isattached with zero or more keywords; and each edge is assigned with a length. On suchnetworks; a novel and useful query is called top-k nearest keyword (k-NK k-NK) search.Given a query node q in G and a keyword λ λ; a k-NK k-NK query searches k nodes whichcontain λ λ and are nearest to q. The k-NK k-NK problem has been studied recently in theliterature. But most existing solutions assume that the graph as well as the constructed indexcan fit entirely in memory. As a result; they cannot be applied directly to very large-scalenetworks which are commonly found in practice; but cannot fit in memory. In this work; wedesign an I/O-efficient solution; which uses a compact disk index to answer a k-NK k-NK …,The VLDB Journal,2017,*
Mining Opinion Leaders in Big Social Network,Yi-Cheng Chen; Yi-Hsiang Chen; Chia-Hao Hsu; Hao-Jun You; Jianquan Liu; Xin Huang,Recently; due to the popularity of Web 2.0; considerable attention has been paid to theopinion leader discovery in social network. By identifying the opinion leaders; companies orgovernments can manipulate the selling or guiding public opinion; respectively. Additionally;detecting the influential comments is able to understand the source and trend of publicopinion formation. However; mining opinion leaders in a huge social network is a challengetask because of the complexity of graph processing and leadership analysis. In this study; anovel algorithm; OLMiner; is proposed to efficiently find the opinion leaders from a hugesocial network.

Mining and Querying Community Structure in Massive Networks,Xin Huang,Abstract Graph has been widely adopted to model complex networks in nature and humansociety. Community structures; as functional building blocks; exist in many real-worldnetworks; for example; social networks and biological networks. Thus; mining and queryingcommunity structure in massive networks is of great importance for a deeper understandingand better management of such networks. However; the massive graph volume (million-scale or even billion-scale) and rapid evolution present huge challenges; which need highlyefficient solutions.
