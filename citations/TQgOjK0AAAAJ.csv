PathSim: Meta path-based top-k similarity search in heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Tianyi Wu,ABSTRACT Similarity search is a primitive operation in database and Web search engines.With the advent of large-scale heterogeneous information networks that consist of multi-typed; interconnected objects; such as the bibliographic networks and social medianetworks; it is important to study similarity search in such networks. Intuitively; two objectsare similar if they are linked by many paths in the network. However; most existing similaritymeasures are defined for homogeneous networks. Different semantic meanings behindpaths are not taken into consideration. Thus they cannot be directly applied toheterogeneous networks. In this paper; we study similarity search that is defined among thesame type of objects in heterogeneous networks. Moreover; by considering different linkagepaths in a network; one could derive various similarity semantics. Therefore; we introduce …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 4 (11),2011,506
Ranking-based clustering of heterogeneous information networks with star network schema,Yizhou Sun; Yintao Yu; Jiawei Han,ABSTRACT A heterogeneous information network is an information network composed ofmultiple types of objects. Clustering on such a network may lead to better understanding ofboth hidden structures of the network and the individual role played by every object in eachcluster. However; although clustering on homogeneous networks has been studied overdecades; clustering on heterogeneous networks has not been addressed until recently. Arecent study proposed a new algorithm; RankClus; for clustering on bi-typed heterogeneousnetworks. However; a real-world network may consist of more than two types; and theinteractions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics that anetwork carries. In this paper; we study clustering of multi-typed heterogeneous networkswith a star network schema and propose a novel algorithm; NetClus; that utilizes links …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,362
RankClus: integrating clustering with ranking for heterogeneous information network analysis,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Peixiang Zhao; Zhijun Yin; Hong Cheng; Tianyi Wu,Abstract As information networks become ubiquitous; extracting knowledge from informationnetworks has become an important task. Both ranking and clustering can provide overallviews on information network data; and each has been a hot topic by itself. However;ranking objects globally without considering which clusters they belong to often leads todumb results; eg; ranking database and computer architecture conferences together may notmake much sense. Similarly; clustering a huge number of objects (eg; thousands of authors)in one huge cluster without distinction is dull as well. In this paper; we address the problemof generating clusters for a specified type of objects; as well as ranking information for alltypes of objects based on these clusters in a multi-typed (ie; heterogeneous) informationnetwork. A novel clustering framework called RankClus is proposed that directly …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,297
Co-author relationship prediction in heterogeneous bibliographic networks,Yizhou Sun; Rick Barber; Manish Gupta; Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,The problem of predicting links or interactions between objects in a network; is an importanttask in network analysis. Along this line; link prediction between co-authors in a co-authornetwork is a frequently studied problem. In most of these studies; authors are considered ina homogeneous network; ie; only one type of objects (author type) and one type of links (co-authorship) exist in the network. However; in a real bibliographic network; there are multipletypes of objects (eg; venues; topics; papers) and multiple types of links among these objects.In this paper; we study the problem of co-author relationship prediction in the heterogeneousbibliographic network; and a new methodology called PathPredict; ie; meta path-basedrelationship prediction model; is proposed to solve this problem. First; meta path-basedtopological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then; a supervised …,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2011 International Conference on,2011,279
LCARS: a location-content-aware recommender system,Hongzhi Yin; Yizhou Sun; Bin Cui; Zhiting Hu; Ling Chen,Abstract Newly emerging location-based and event-based social network services provideus with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their activity history. Auser can only visit a limited number of venues/events and most of them are within a limiteddistance range; so the user-item matrix is very sparse; which creates a big challenge fortraditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The problem becomes morechallenging when people travel to a new city where they have no activity history. In thispaper; we propose LCARS; a location-content-aware recommender system that offers aparticular user a set of venues (eg; restaurants) or events (eg; concerts and exhibitions) bygiving consideration to both personal interest and local preference. This recommendersystem can facilitate people's travel not only near the area in which they live; but also in a …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,215
Mining Heterogeneous Information Networks: Principles and Methodologies,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Real-world physical and abstract data objects are interconnected; forming gigantic;interconnected networks. By structuring these data objects and interactions between theseobjects into multiple types; such networks become semi-structured heterogeneousinformation networks. Most real-world applications that handle big data; includinginterconnected social media and social networks; scientific; engineering; or medicalinformation systems; online e-commerce systems; and most database systems; can bestructured into heterogeneous information networks. Therefore; effective analysis of large-scale heterogeneous information networks poses an interesting but critical challenge. In thisbook; we investigate the principles and methodologies of mining heterogeneous informationnetworks.

P-Rank: a comprehensive structural similarity measure over information networks,Peixiang Zhao; Jiawei Han; Yizhou Sun,Abstract With the ubiquity of information networks and their broad applications; the issue ofsimilarity computation between entities of an information network arises and drawsextensive research interests. However; to effectively and comprehensively measure" howsimilar two entities are within an information network" is nontrivial; and the problem becomeseven more challenging when the information network to be examined is massive anddiverse. In this paper; we propose a new similarity measure; P-Rank (Penetrating Rank);toward effectively computing the structural similarities of entities in real information networks.P-Rank enriches the well-known similarity measure; SimRank; by jointly encoding both in-and out-link relationships into structural similarity computation. P-Rank is proven to be aunified structural similarity framework; under which all state-of-the-art similarity measures …,Proceeding of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,182
When will it happen? -- relationship prediction in heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Charu C Aggarwal; Nitesh V Chawla,Abstract Link prediction; ie; predicting links or interactions between objects in a network; isan important task in network analysis. Although the problem has attracted much attentionrecently; there are several challenges that have not been addressed so far. First; mostexisting studies focus only on link prediction in homogeneous networks; where all objectsand links belong to the same type. However; in the real world; heterogeneous networks thatconsist of multi-typed objects and relationships are ubiquitous. Second; most current studiesonly concern the problem of whether a link will appear in the future but seldom pay attentionto the problem of when it will happen. In this paper; we address both issues and study theproblem of predicting when a certain relationship will happen in the scenario ofheterogeneous networks. First; we extend the link prediction problem to the relationship …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2012,180
On community outliers and their efficient detection in information networks,Jing Gao; Feng Liang; Wei Fan; Chi Wang; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Linked or networked data are ubiquitous in many applications. Examples includeweb data or hypertext documents connected via hyperlinks; social networks or user profilesconnected via friend links; co-authorship and citation information; blog data; movie reviewsand so on. In these datasets (called" information networks"); closely related objects thatshare the same properties or interests form a community. For example; a community inblogsphere could be users mostly interested in cell phone reviews and news. Outlierdetection in information networks can reveal important anomalous and interesting behaviorsthat are not obvious if community information is ignored. An example could be a low-incomeperson being friends with many rich people even though his income is not anomalously lowwhen considered over the entire population.

PathSelClus: Integrating Meta-Path Selection with User-Guided Object Clustering in Heterogeneous Information Networks,Yizhou Sun; Brandon Norick; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Xiao Yu,Abstract Real-world; multiple-typed objects are often interconnected; forming heterogeneousinformation networks. A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is theirpotential to generate many different results; carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. Inorder to generate desired clustering; we propose to use meta-path; a path that connectsobject types via a sequence of relations; to control clustering with distinct semantics.Nevertheless; it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (seeds) than a weightedcombination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus; wepropose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects innetworks; where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster asguidance. Then the system learns the weight for each meta-path that is consistent with the …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2013,167

Mining heterogeneous information networks: a structural analysis approach,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Most objects and data in the real world are of multiple types; interconnected;forming complex; heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However;most network science researchers are focused on homogeneous networks; withoutdistinguishing different types of objects and links in the networks. We view interconnected;multityped data; including the typical relational database data; as heterogeneousinformation networks; study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of structural types ofobjects and links in the networks; and develop a structural analysis approach on miningsemi-structured; multi-typed heterogeneous information networks.

Graph regularized transductive classification on heterogeneous information networks,Ming Ji; Yizhou Sun; Marina Danilevsky; Jiawei Han; Jing Gao,Abstract A heterogeneous information network is a network composed of multiple types ofobjects and links. Recently; it has been recognized that strongly-typed heterogeneousinformation networks are prevalent in the real world. Sometimes; label information isavailable for some objects. Learning from such labeled and unlabeled data via transductiveclassification can lead to good knowledge extraction of the hidden network structure.However; although classification on homogeneous networks has been studied for decades;classification on heterogeneous networks has not been explored until recently. In this paper;we consider the transductive classification problem on heterogeneous networked datawhich share a common topic. Only some objects in the given network are labeled; and weaim to predict labels for all types of the remaining objects.

Personalized entity recommendation: a heterogeneous information network approach,Xiao Yu; Xiang Ren; Yizhou Sun; Quanquan Gu; Bradley Sturt; Urvashi Khandelwal; Brandon Norick; Jiawei Han,Abstract Among different hybrid recommendation techniques; network-based entityrecommendation methods; which utilize user or item relationship information; are beginningto attract increasing attention recently. Most of the previous studies in this category onlyconsider a single relationship type; such as friendships in a social network. In manyscenarios; the entity recommendation problem exists in a heterogeneous informationnetwork environment. Different types of relationships can be potentially used to improve therecommendation quality. In this paper; we study the entity recommendation problem inheterogeneous information networks. Specifically; we propose to combine heterogeneousrelationship information for each user differently and aim to provide high-qualitypersonalized recommendation results using user implicit feedback data and personalized …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2014,137
Fast computation of simrank for static and dynamic information networks,Cuiping Li; Jiawei Han; Guoming He; Xin Jin; Yizhou Sun; Yintao Yu; Tianyi Wu,Abstract Information networks are ubiquitous in many applications and analysis on suchnetworks has attracted significant attention in the academic communities. One of the mostimportant aspects of information network analysis is to measure similarity between nodes ina network. SimRank is a simple and influential measure of this kind; based on a solidtheoretical" random surfer" model. Existing work computes SimRank similarity scores in aniterative mode. We argue that the iterative method can be infeasible and inefficient when; asin many real-world scenarios; the networks change dynamically and frequently. We envisionnon-iterative method to bridge the gap. It allows users not only to update the similarity scoresincrementally; but also to derive similarity scores for an arbitrary subset of nodes. To enablethe non-iterative computation; we propose to rewrite the SimRank equation into a non …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,124
itopicmodel: Information network-integrated topic modeling,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Jing Gao; Yintao Yu,Document networks; ie; networks associated with text information; are becomingincreasingly popular due to the ubiquity of Web documents; blogs; and various kinds ofonline data. In this paper; we propose a novel topic modeling framework for documentnetworks; which builds a unified generative topic model that is able to consider both text andstructure information for documents. A graphical model is proposed to describe thegenerative model. On the top layer of this graphical model; we define a novel multivariateMarkov Random Field for topic distribution random variables for each document; to modelthe dependency relationships among documents over the network structure. On the bottomlayer; we follow the traditional topic model to model the generation of text for eachdocument.

SHRINK: a structural clustering algorithm for detecting hierarchical communities in networks,Jianbin Huang; Heli Sun; Jiawei Han; Hongbo Deng; Yizhou Sun; Yaguang Liu,Abstract Community detection is an important task for mining the structure and function ofcomplex networks. Generally; there are several different kinds of nodes in a network whichare cluster nodes densely connected within communities; as well as some special nodeslike hubs bridging multiple communities and outliers marginally connected with acommunity. In addition; it has been shown that there is a hierarchical structure in complexnetworks with communities embedded within other communities. Therefore; a goodalgorithm is desirable to be able to not only detect hierarchical communities; but also identifyhubs and outliers. In this paper; we propose a parameter-free hierarchical network clusteringalgorithm SHRINK by combining the advantages of density-based clustering and modularityoptimization methods. Based on the structural connectivity information; the proposed …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,109
A Graph-Based Consensus Maximization Approach for Combining Multiple Supervised and Unsupervised Models,Jing Gao; Feng Liang; Wei Fan; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,*,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2013,100
Graph-based consensus maximization among multiple supervised and unsupervised models,Jing Gao; Feng Liang; Wei Fan; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Little work has been done to directly combine the outputs of multiple supervisedand unsupervised models. However; it can increase the accuracy and applicability ofensemble methods. First; we can boost the diversity of classification ensemble byincorporating multiple clustering outputs; each of which provides grouping constraints for thejoint label predictions of a set of related objects. Secondly; ensemble of supervised modelsis limited in applications which have no access to raw data but to the meta-level modeloutputs. In this paper; we aim at calculating a consolidated classification solution for a set ofobjects by maximizing the consensus among both supervised predictions and unsupervisedgrouping constraints. We seek a global optimal label assignment for the target objects;which is different from the result of traditional majority voting and model combination …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS),2009,100
Relation Strength-Aware Clustering of Heterogeneous Information Networks with Incomplete Attributes,Yizhou Sun; Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,Abstract With the rapid development of online social media; online shopping sites and cyber-physical systems; heterogeneous information networks have become increasingly popularand content-rich over time. In many cases; such networks contain multiple types of objectsand links; as well as different kinds of attributes. The clustering of these objects can provideuseful insights in many applications. However; the clustering of such networks can bechallenging since (a) the attribute values of objects are often incomplete; which implies thatan object may carry only partial attributes or even no attributes to correctly label itself; and(b) the links of different types may carry different kinds of semantic meanings; and it is adifficult task to determine the nature of their relative importance in helping the clustering for agiven purpose.

Predicting links in multi-relational and heterogeneous networks,Yang Yang; Nitesh Chawla; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Hani,Link prediction is an important task in network analysis; benefiting researchers andorganizations in a variety of fields. Many networks in the real world; for example socialnetworks; are heterogeneous; having multiple types of links and complex dependencystructures. Link prediction in such networks must model the influence propagating betweenheterogeneous relationships to achieve better link prediction performance than inhomogeneous networks. In this paper; we introduce Multi-Relational Influence Propagation(MRIP); a novel probabilistic method for heterogeneous networks. We demonstrate thatMRIP is useful for predicting links in sparse networks; which present a significant challengedue to the severe disproportion of the number of potential links to the number of real formedlinks. We also explore some factors that can inform the task of classification yet remain …,2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining,2012,89
Integrating community matching and outlier detection for mining evolutionary community outliers,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Temporal datasets; in which data evolves continuously; exist in a wide variety ofapplications; and identifying anomalous or outlying objects from temporal datasets is animportant and challenging task. Different from traditional outlier detection; which detectsobjects that have quite different behavior compared with the other objects; temporal outlierdetection tries to identify objects that have different evolutionary behavior compared withother objects. Usually objects form multiple communities; and most of the objects belongingto the same community follow similar patterns of evolution. However; there are some objectswhich evolve in a very different way relative to other community members; and we definesuch objects as evolutionary community outliers. This definition represents a novel type ofoutliers considering both temporal dimension and community patterns.

Community evolution detection in dynamic heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Jie Tang; Jiawei Han; Manish Gupta; Bo Zhao,Abstract As the rapid development of all kinds of online databases; huge heterogeneousinformation networks thus derived are ubiquitous. Detecting evolutionary communities inthese networks can help people better understand the structural evolution of the networks.However; most of the current community evolution analysis is based on the homogeneousnetworks; while a real community usually involves different types of objects in aheterogeneous network. For example; when referring to a research community; it contains aset of authors; a set of conferences or journals and a set of terms. In this paper; we study theproblem of detecting evolutionary multi-typed communities defined as net-clusters indynamic heterogeneous networks. A Dirichlet Process Mixture Model-based generativemodel is proposed to model the community generations.

Recommendation in heterogeneous information networks with implicit user feedback,Xiao Yu; Xiang Ren; Yizhou Sun; Bradley Sturt; Urvashi Khandelwal; Quanquan Gu; Brandon Norick; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recent studies suggest that by using additional user or item relationshipinformation when building hybrid recommender systems; the recommendation quality canbe largely improved. However; most such studies only consider a single type of relationship;eg; social network. Notice that in many applications; the recommendation problem exists inan attribute-rich heterogeneous information network environment. In this paper; we study theentity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. We propose tocombine various relationship information from the network with user feedback to providehigh quality recommendation results.

In this paper; we propose a novel and important problem inevolution behavior discovery. Given a series of snapshots of a temporal dataset; each ofwhich consists of evolving communities; our goal is to find objects which evolve in adramatically different way compared with the other community members. We define suchobjects as community trend outliers. It is a challenging problem as evolutionary patterns arehidden deeply in noisy evolving datasets and thus it is difficult to distinguish anomalousobjects from normal ones.

However; due to the diverse semantic meanings inheterogeneous information networks; which contain multi-typed entities and relationships;similarity measurement can be ambiguous without context. In this paper; we investigateentity similarity search and the resulting ambiguity problems in heterogeneous informationnetworks. We propose to use a meta-path-based ranking model ensemble to representsemantic meanings for similarity queries; exploit the possibility of using using user-guidanceto understand users query.

Heterogeneous source consensus learning via decision propagation and negotiation,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Nowadays; enormous amounts of data are continuously generated not only inmassive scale; but also from different; sometimes conflicting; views. Therefore; it is importantto consolidate different concepts for intelligent decision making. For example; to predict theresearch areas of some people; the best results are usually achieved by combining andconsolidating predictions obtained from the publication network; co-authorship network andthe textual content of their publications. Multiple supervised and unsupervised hypothesescan be drawn from these information sources; and negotiating their differences andconsolidating decisions usually yields a much more accurate model due to the diversity andheterogeneity of these models.

The traditional methods of homogeneous clusteringmethods do not result in a good typed-clustering. The design of heterogeneous methods forclustering can help us better understand the evolution of each of the types apart from theevolution of the network as a whole.

Meta-Path-Based Ranking with Pseudo Relevance Feedback on Heterogeneous Graph for Citation Recommendation,Xiaozhong Liu; Yingying Yu; Chun Guo; Yizhou Sun,Abstract The sheer volume of scholarly publications available online significantly challengeshow scholars retrieve the new information available and locate the candidate referencepapers. While classical text retrieval and pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) algorithms canassist scholars in accessing needed publications; in this study; we propose an innovativepublication ranking method with PRF by leveraging a number of meta-paths on theheterogeneous bibliographic graph. Different meta-paths on the graph address differentranking hypotheses; whereas the pseudo-relevant papers (from the retrieval results) areused as the seed nodes on the graph. Meanwhile; unlike prior studies; we propose"restricted meta-path" facilitated by a new context-rich heterogeneous network extracted fromfull-text publication content along with citation context.

Sampling Cube: A framework for statistical OLAP over sampling data,Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han; Zhijun Yin; Jae-Gil Lee; Yizhou Sun,Abstract Sampling is a popular method of data collection when it is impossible or too costlyto reach the entire population. For example; television show ratings in the United States aregathered from a sample of roughly 5;000 households. To use the results effectively; thesamples are further partitioned in a multidimensional space based on multiple attributevalues. This naturally leads to the desirability of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) oversampling data. However; unlike traditional data; sampling data is inherently uncertain; ie; notrepresenting the full data in the population. Thus; it is desirable to return not only queryresults but also the confidence intervals indicating the reliability of the results. Moreover; acertain segment in a multidimensional space may contain none or too few samples. Thisrequires some additional analysis to return trustable results.

Mining knowledge from interconnected data: a heterogeneous information network analysis approach,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu,Abstract Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected; forming complex;heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However; most peopleconsider a database merely as a data repository that supports data storage and retrievalrather than one or a set of heterogeneous information networks that contain rich; inter-related; multi-typed data and information. Most network science researchers only studyhomogeneous networks; without distinguishing the different types of objects and links in thenetworks. In this tutorial; we view database and other interconnected data as heterogeneousinformation networks; and study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of types ofobjects and links in the networks. We systematically introduce the technologies that caneffectively and efficiently mine useful knowledge from such information networks.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,32
Etm: Entity topic models for mining documents associated with entities,Hyungsul Kim; Yizhou Sun; Julia Hockenmaier; Jiawei Han,Topic models; which factor each document into different topics and represent each topic as adistribution of terms; have been widely and successfully used to better understandcollections of text documents. However; documents are also associated with furtherinformation; such as the set of real-world entities mentioned in them. For example; newsarticles are usually related to several people; organizations; countries or locations. Sincethose associated entities carry rich information; it is highly desirable to build moreexpressive; entity-based topic models; which can capture the term distributions for eachtopic; each entity; as well as each topic-entity pair. In this paper; we therefore introduce anovel Entity Topic Model (ETM) for documents that are associated with a set of entities.

Trust analysis with clustering,Manish Gupta; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Web provides rich information about a variety of objects. Trustability is a majorconcern on the web. Truth establishment is an important task so as to provide the rightinformation to the user from the most trustworthy source. Trustworthiness of informationprovider and the confidence of the facts it provides are inter-dependent on each other andhence can be expressed iteratively in terms of each other. However; a single informationprovider may not be the most trustworthy for all kinds of information. Every informationprovider has its own area of competence where it can perform better than others. We derivea model that can evaluate trustability on objects and information providers based on clusters(groups). We propose a method which groups the set of objects for which similar set ofproviders provide" good" facts; and provides better accuracy in addition to high quality …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference companion on World wide web,2011,31
Meta-path-based search and mining in heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Information networks that can be extracted from many domains are widely studied recently.Different functions for mining these networks are proposed and developed; such as ranking;community detection; and link prediction. Most existing network studies are onhomogeneous networks; where nodes and links are assumed from one single type. Inreality; however; heterogeneous information networks can better model the real-worldsystems; which are typically semi-structured and typed; following a network schema. In orderto mine these heterogeneous information networks directly; we propose to explore the metastructure of the information network; ie; the network schema. The concepts of meta-paths areproposed to systematically capture numerous semantic relationships across multiple typesof objects; which are defined as a path over the graph of network schema.

However; this assumption isoversimplified. In this study; we employ an innovative “context-rich heterogeneous network”approach; which paves a new way for citation recommendation task. In the network; wecharacterize (1) the importance of citation relationships between citing and cited papers; and(2) the topical citation motivation. Unlike earlier studies; the citation information; in this …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries,2014,27
Co-Evolution of Multi-Typed Objects in Dynamic Star Networks,Yizhou Sun; Jie Tang; Jiawei Han; Cheng Chen; Manish Gupta,Mining network evolution has emerged as an intriguing research topic in many domainssuch as data mining; social networks; and machine learning. While a bulk of research hasfocused on mining evolutionary patterns of homogeneous networks (eg; networks of friends);however; most real-world networks are heterogeneous; containing objects of different types;such as authors; papers; venues; and terms in a bibliographic network. Modeling co-evolution of multityped objects can capture richer information than that on single-typedobjects alone. For example; studying co-evolution of authors; venues; and terms in abibliographic network can tell better the evolution of research areas than just examining co-author network or term network alone. In this paper; we study mining co-evolution ofmultityped objects in a special type of heterogeneous networks; called star networks; and …,IEEE Trans. on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,27
Collaborative filtering with entity similarity regularization in heterogeneous information networks,Xiao Yu; Xiang Ren; Quanquan Gu; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Researchers have been studying hybrid recommender systems which combineuser-item rating data with external information in recent years. Some studies suggest that byleveraging additional user and/or item relations; eg; social network; the performance of therecommendation models can be improved. These studies; nevertheless; mostly utilize asingle type of external relationship. Considering the heterogeneity of real-world applications;we propose to position the well-studied recommendation problem in a heterogeneousinformation network context and attempt to incorporate different recommendation factors. Wediscuss how heterogeneous information network can benefit recommender systems andthen propose a matrix factorization based unified recommendation model to take advantageof both rating data and the related information network.

Query-driven discovery of semantically similar substructures in heterogeneous networks,Xiao Yu; Yizhou Sun; Peixiang Zhao; Jiawei Han,Abstract Heterogeneous information networks that contain multiple types of objects and linksare ubiquitous in the real world; such as bibliographic networks; cyber-physical networks;and social media networks. Although researchers have studied various data mining tasks ininformation networks; interactive query-based network exploration techniques have notbeen addressed systematically; which; in fact; are highly desirable for exploring large-scaleinformation networks. In this demo; we introduce and demonstrate our recent researchproject on query-driven discovery of semantically similar substructures in heterogeneousnetworks. Given a subgraph query; our system searches a given large information networkand finds efficiently a list of subgraphs that are structurally identical and semantically similar.Since data mining methods are used to obtain semantically similar entities (nodes); we …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,25
Meta Structure: Computing Relevance in Large Heterogeneous Information Networks,Zhipeng Huang; Yudian Zheng; Reynold Cheng; Yizhou Sun; Nikos Mamoulis; Xiang Li,Abstract A heterogeneous information network (HIN) is a graph model in which objects andedges are annotated with types. Large and complex databases; such as YAGO and DBLP;can be modeled as HINs. A fundamental problem in HINs is the computation of closeness; orrelevance; between two HIN objects. Relevance measures can be used in variousapplications; including entity resolution; recommendation; and information retrieval. Severalstudies have investigated the use of HIN information for relevance computation; however;most of them only utilize simple structure; such as path; to measure the similarity betweenobjects. In this paper; we propose to use meta structure; which is a directed acyclic graph ofobject types with edge types connecting in between; to measure the proximity betweenobjects. The strength of meta structure is that it can describe complex relationship …,KDD'16,2016,23
Apollo: Towards factfinding in participatory sensing,H Khac Le; J Pasternack; H Ahmadi; M Gupta; Y Sun; T Abdelzaher; J Han; D Roth; B Szymanski; S Adali,This demonstration presents Apollo; a new sensor information processing tool foruncovering likely facts in noisy participatory sensing data. Participatory sensing; whereusers proactively document and share their observations; has received significant attentionin recent years as a paradigm for crowd-sourcing observation tasks. However; it posesinteresting challenges in assessing confidence in the information received. By borrowingclustering and ranking tools from data mining literature; we show how to group data into sets(or claims); corroborating specific events or observations; then iteratively assess both claimand source credibility; ultimately leading to a ranking of described claims by their like-lihooldof occurrence. Apollo belongs to a category of tools called fact-finders. It is the first fact-finderdesigned and implemented specifically for participatory sensing.

Region-based online promotion analysis,Tianyi Wu; Yizhou Sun; Cuiping Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract This paper addresses a fundamental and challenging problem with broadapplications: efficient processing of region-based promotion queries; ie; to discover the top-kmost interesting regions for effective promotion of an object (eg; a product or a person) givenby user; where a region is defined over continuous ranged dimensions. In our problemcontext; the object can be promoted in a region when it is top-ranked in it. Such type ofpromotion queries involves an exponentially large search space and expensive aggregationoperations. For efficient query processing; we study a fresh; principled framework calledregion-based promotion cube (RepCube). Grounded on a solid cost analysis; we firstdevelop a partial materialization strategy to yield the provably maximum online pruningpower given a storage budget. Then; cell relaxation is performed to further reduce the …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,19
Task-Guided and Path-Augmented Heterogeneous Network Embedding for Author Identification,Ting Chen; Yizhou Sun,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of author identification under double-blindreview setting; which is to identify potential authors given information of an anonymizedpaper. Different from existing approaches that rely heavily on feature engineering; wepropose to use network embedding approach to address the problem; which canautomatically represent nodes into lower dimensional feature vectors. However; there aretwo major limitations in recent studies on network embedding:(1) they are usually general-purpose embedding methods; which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most ofthese approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks; where the heterogeneity ofthe network is ignored. Hence; challenges faced here are two folds:(1) how to embed thenetwork under the guidance of the author identification task; and (2) how to select the best …,Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2017,18
Resolving Entity Morphs in Censored Data.,Hongzhao Huang; Zhen Wen; Dian Yu; Heng Ji; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; He Li,Abstract In some societies; internet users have to create information morphs (eg “PeaceWest King” to refer to “Bo Xilai”) to avoid active censorship or achieve other communicationgoals. In this paper we aim to solve a new problem of resolving entity morphs to their realtargets. We exploit temporal constraints to collect crosssource comparable corpora relevantto any given morph query and identify target candidates. Then we propose various novelsimilarity measurements including surface features; meta-path based semantic features andsocial correlation features and combine them in a learning-to-rank framework.

Mining Knowledge from Data: An Information Network Analysis Approach,Jiawei Han; Yizhou Sun; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu,Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected; forming complex; heterogeneousbut often semistructured information networks. However; many database researchersconsider a database merely as a data repository that supports storage and retrieval ratherthan an information-rich; inter-related and multi-typed information network that supportscomprehensive data analysis; whereas many network researchers focus on homogeneousnetworks. Departing from both; we view interconnected; semi-structured datasets asheterogeneous; information-rich networks and study how to uncover hidden knowledge insuch networks. For example; a university database can be viewed as a heterogeneousinformation network; where objects of multiple types; such as students; professors; courses;departments; and multiple typed relationships; such as teach and advise are intertwined …,Proc. 2012 IEEE Int.

CPS claims manypromising applications; such as traffic observation; battlefield surveillance and sensor-network based monitoring. One important research topic in CPS is about the atypical eventanalysis; ie; retrieving the events from large amount of data and analyzing them with spatial;temporal and other multi-dimensional information. Many traditional approaches are notfeasible for such analysis since they use numeric measures and cannot describe thecomplex atypical events. In this study; we propose a new model of atypical cluster toeffectively represent those events and efficiently retrieve them from massive data. The …,Proc. 2012 IEEE Int.

Reciprocal Recommendation System for Online Dating,Peng Xia; Benyuan Liu; Yizhou Sun; Cindy Chen,Abstract Online dating sites have become popular platforms for people to look for potentialromantic partners. Different from traditional user-item recommendations where the goal is tomatch items (eg; books; videos; etc) with a user's interests; a recommendation system foronline dating aims to match people who are mutually interested in and likely to communicatewith each other. We introduce similarity measures that capture the unique features andcharacteristics of the online dating network; for example; the interest similarity between twousers if they send messages to same users; and attractiveness similarity if they receivemessages from same users. A reciprocal score that measures the compatibility between auser and each potential dating candidate is computed and the recommendation list isgenerated to include users with top scores.

Entity Matching across Heterogeneous Sources,Yang Yang; Yizhou Sun; Jie Tang; Bo Ma; Juanzi Li,Abstract Given an entity in a source domain; finding its matched entities from another (target)domain is an important task in many applications. Traditionally; the problem was usuallyaddressed by first extracting major keywords corresponding to the source entity and thenquery relevant entities from the target domain using those keywords. However; the methodwould inevitably fails if the two domains have less or no overlapping in the content. Anextreme case is that the source domain is in English and the target domain is in Chinese. Inthis paper; we formalize the problem as entity matching across heterogeneous sources andpropose a probabilistic topic model to solve the problem. The model integrates the topicextraction and entity matching; two core subtasks for dealing with the problem; into a unifiedmodel. Specifically; for handling the text disjointing problem; we use a cross-sampling …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,16
Causal relation of queries from temporal logs,Yizhou Sun; Kunqing Xie; Ning Liu; Shuicheng Yan; Benyu Zhang; Zheng Chen,Abstract In this paper; we study a new problem of mining causal relation of queries in searchengine query logs. Causal relation between two queries means event on one query is thecausation of some event on the other. We first detect events in query logs by efficientstatistical frequency threshold. Then the causal relation of queries is mined by the geometricfeatures of the events. Finally the Granger Causality Test (GCT) is utilized to further re-rankthe causal relation of queries according to their GCT coefficients. In addition; we develop a 2-dimensional visualization tool to display the detected relationship of events in a moreintuitive way. The experimental results on the MSN search engine query logs demonstratethat our approach can accurately detect the events in temporal query logs and the causalrelation of queries is detected effectively.,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,16
Predicting drug target interactions using meta-path-based semantic network analysis,Gang Fu; Ying Ding; Abhik Seal; Bin Chen; Yizhou Sun; Evan Bolton,In the context of drug discovery; drug target interactions (DTIs) can be predicted based onobserved topological features of a semantic network across the chemical and biologicalspace. In a semantic network; the types of the nodes and links are different. In order to takeinto account the heterogeneity of the semantic network; meta-path-based topologicalpatterns were investigated for link prediction. Supervised machine learning models wereconstructed based on meta-path topological features of an enriched semantic network;which was derived from Chem2Bio2RDF; and was expanded by adding compound andprotein similarity neighboring links obtained from the PubChem databases. The additionalsemantic links significantly improved the predictive performance of the supervised learningmodels.

Entity Embedding-based Anomaly Detection for Heterogeneous Categorical Events,Ting Chen; Lu-An Tang; Yizhou Sun; Zhengzhang Chen; Kai Zhang,Abstract: Anomaly detection plays an important role in modern data-driven securityapplications; such as detecting suspicious access to a socket from a process. In many cases;such events can be described as a collection of categorical values that are considered asentities of different types; which we call heterogeneous categorical events. Due to the lack ofintrinsic distance measures among entities; and the exponentially large event space; mostexisting work relies heavily on heuristics to calculate abnormal scores for events. Differentfrom previous work; we propose a principled and unified probabilistic model APE (Anomalydetection via Probabilistic pairwise interaction and Entity embedding) that directly modelsthe likelihood of events. In this model; we embed entities into a common latent space usingtheir observed co-occurrence in different events. More specifically; we first model the …,Proc. 25th Int.

Geo-SAGE: A Geographical Sparse Additive Generative Model for Spatial Item Recommendation,Weiqing Wang; Hongzhi Yin; Ling Chen; Yizhou Sun; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs); spatial itemrecommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive andinteresting venues and events; especially when users travel out of town. However; thisrecommendation is very challenging compared to the traditional recommender systems. Auser can visit only a limited number of spatial items; leading to a very sparse user-itemmatrix. Most of the items visited by a user are located within a short distance from wherehe/she lives; which makes it hard to recommend items when the user travels to a far awayplace. Moreover; user interests and behavior patterns may vary dramatically across differentgeographical regions. In light of this; we propose Geo-SAGE; a geographical sparse additivegenerative model for spatial item recommendation in this paper.

Modeling Topic Diffusion in Multi-Relational Bibliographic Information Networks,Huan Gui; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; George Brova,Abstract Information diffusion has been widely studied in networks; aiming to model thespread of information among objects when they are connected with each other. Most of thecurrent research assumes the underlying network is homogeneous; ie; objects are of thesame type and they are connected by links with the same semantic meanings. However; inthe real word; objects are connected via different types of relationships; forming multi-relational heterogeneous information networks. In this paper; we propose to modelinformation diffusion in such multi-relational networks; by distinguishing the power inpassing information around for different types of relationships. We propose two variations ofthe linear threshold model for multi-relational networks; by considering the aggregation ofinformation at either the model level or the relation level. In addition; we use real diffusion …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,15

Learning Global Term Weights for Content-based Recommender Systems,Yupeng Gu; Bo Zhao; David Hardtke; Yizhou Sun,Abstract Recommender systems typically leverage two types of signals to effectivelyrecommend items to users: user activities and content matching between user and itemprofiles; and recommendation models in literature are usually categorized into collaborativefiltering models; content-based models and hybrid models. In practice; when rich profilesabout users and items are available; and user activities are sparse (cold-start); effectivecontent matching signals become much more important in the relevance of therecommendation. The de-facto method to measure similarity between two pieces of text iscomputing the cosine similarity of the two bags of words; and each word is weighted by TF(term frequency within the document) x IDF (inverted document frequency of the word withinthe corpus). In general sense; TF can represent any local weighting scheme of the word …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web,2016,13

Topic-Factorized Ideal Point Estimation Model for Legislative Voting Network,Yupeng Gu; Yizhou Sun; Ning Jiang; Bingyu Wang; Ting Chen,Abstract Ideal point estimation that estimates legislators' ideological positions andunderstands their voting behavior has attracted studies from political science and computerscience. Typically; a legislator is assigned a global ideal point based on her voting or othersocial behavior. However; it is quite normal that people may have different positions ondifferent policy dimensions. For example; some people may be more liberal on economicissues while more conservative on cultural issues. In this paper; we propose a novel topic-factorized ideal point estimation model for a legislative voting network in a unifiedframework. First; we model the ideal points of legislators and bills for each topic instead ofassigning them to a global one. Second; the generation of topics are guided by the votingmatrix in addition to the text information contained in bills.

RelSim: Relation Similarity Search in Schema-Rich Heterogeneous Information Networks,Chenguang Wang; Yizhou Sun; Yanglei Song; Jiawei Han; Yangqiu Song; Lidan Wang; Ming Zhang,Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated the power of modeling real world data asheterogeneous information networks (HINs) consisting of multiple types of entities andrelations. Unfortunately; most of such studies (eg; similarity search) confine discussions onthe networks with only a few entity and relationship types; such as DBLP. In the real world;however; the network schema can be rather complex; such as Freebase. In such HINs withrich schema; it is often too much burden to ask users to provide explicit guidance in selectingrelations for similarity search. In this paper; we study the problem of relation similarity searchin schema-rich HINs. Under our problem setting; users are only asked to provide somesimple relation instance examples (eg;〈 Barack Obama; John Kerry〉 and〈 George W.Bush; Condoleezza Rice〉) as a query; and we automatically detect the latent semantic …,*,2016,9
Clustering and Ranking in Heterogeneous Information Networks via Gamma-Poisson Model,Junxiang Chen Wei Dai Yizhou Sun; Jennifer Dy,Abstract Clustering and ranking have been successfully applied independently tohomogeneous information networks; containing only one type of objects.

Recent research has shown that clustering and ranking can actuallymutually enhance each other; and several techniques have been developed to integrateclustering and ranking together on a heterogeneous information network.

Semantic frame-based document representation for comparable corpora,Hyungsul Kim; Xiang Ren; Yizhou Sun; Chi Wang; Jiawei Han,Document representation is a fundamental problem for text mining. Many efforts have beendone to generate concise yet semantic representation; such as bag-of-words; phrase;sentence and topic-level descriptions.

In this paper; we propose the use of frame; a high-level semantic unit; and construct frame-based representations to semantically describedocuments by bags of frames; using an information network approach. One major challengein this representation is that semantically similar frames may be of different forms.

Cross Social Media Recommendation,Xiaozhong Liu; Tian Xia; Yingying Yu; Chun Guo; Yizhou Sun,Abstract The proliferation of rich social media data revolutionizes the way people perceiveand understand the world. Unfortunately; so far; there does not exist a single social mediasystem that efficiently globalizes users around the world. Two well-known social mediasystems; Twitter and Facebook; are strictly blocked in mainland China for political reasons.Similarly; the second-largest microblogging system in the world; Sina Weibo; features adefault system language of Chinese; which rules out many users from other countries. As aresult; if we are interested in modeling the knowledge of the world; all research findingsbased on a single social media system (within a bubble) can be biased; and the socialnetworks or knowledge networks generated from a single system or social communitycannot fully represent people from around the world.

Evolutionary clustering and analysis of heterogeneous information networks,Manish Gupta; Charu Aggarwal; Jiawei Han; Yizhou Sun,ABSTRACT In this paper; we study the problem of evolutionary clustering of multi-typedobjects in a heterogeneous bibliographic network. The traditional methods of homogeneousclustering methods do not result in a good typed-clustering. The design of heterogeneousmethods for clustering can help us better understand the evolution of each of the types apartfrom the evolution of the network as a whole. In fact; the problem of clustering and evolutiondiagnosis are closely related because of the ability of the clustering process to summarizethe network and provide insights into the changes in the objects over time. We present sucha tightly integrated method for clustering and evolution diagnosis of heterogeneousbibliographic information networks.

Semi-supervised Learning over Heterogeneous Information Networks by Ensemble of Meta-graph Guided Random Walks,He Jiang; Yangqiu Song; Chenguang Wang; Ming Zhang; Yizhou Sun,Abstract Heterogeneous information network (HIN) is a general representation of many realworld data. The difference between HIN and traditional homogeneous network is that thenodes and edges in HIN are with types. In many applications; we need to consider the typesto make the decision more semantically meaningful. For annotationexpensive applications;a natural way is to consider semi-supervised learning over HIN. In this paper; we present asemi-supervised learning algorithm constrained by the types of HINs. We first decomposethe original HIN schema into several semantically meaningful meta-graphs consisting ofentity and relation types. Then random walk is performed to propagate the labels fromlabeled data to unlabeled data guided by the meta-graphs. After receiving labels from theresults of random walk guided by meta-graphs; we carefully compare different ensemble …,*,2017,4
Are you satisfied with life?: Predicting satisfaction with life from facebook,Susan Collins; Yizhou Sun; Michal Kosinski; David Stillwell; Natasha Markuzon,Abstract Social media can be beneficial in detecting early signs of emotional difficulty. Weutilized the Satisfaction with Life (SWL) index as a cognitive health measure and presentedmodels to predict an individual's SWL. Our models considered ego; temporal; and linkFacebook features collected through the myPersonality. org project. We demonstrated thestrong correlation between Big 5 personality features and SWL; and we used this insight tobuild two-step Random Forest Regression models from ego features.

Context-aware Entity Morph Decoding,Boliang Zhang; Hongzhao Huang; Xiaoman Pan; Sujian Li; Chin-Yew Lin; Heng Ji; Kevin Knight; Zhen Wen; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Bulent Yener,Abstract People create morphs; a special type of fake alternative names; to achieve certaincommunication goals such as expressing strong sentiment or evading censors. Forexample;“Black Mamba”; the name for a highly venomous snake; is a morph that KobeBryant created for himself due to his agility and aggressiveness in playing basketball games.This paper presents the first end-to-end context-aware entity morph decoding system thatcan automatically identify; disambiguate; verify morph mentions based on specific contexts;and resolve them to target entities. Our approach is based on an absolute “cold-start”-it doesnot require any candidate morph or target entity lists as input; nor any manually constructedmorph-target pairs for training.

Much knowl-edge can be derived from such information networks if we systematically develop aneffective and scalable database-oriented information network analysis technology. In thissystem demo; we take a computer science research publica-tion network as an example;which is an information net-work derived from an integration of DBLP; other web-basedinformation about researchers; and partially available cita-tion data; and construct aResearch-Insight system in order to demonstrate the power of database-oriented informationnetwork analysis.

Integrating Clustering with Ranking in Heterogeneous Information Networks Analysis,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Heterogeneous information networks; ie; the logic networks involving multi-typed;interconnected objects; are ubiquitous. For example; a bibliographic information networkcontains nodes including authors; conferences; terms and papers; and links correspondingto relations exiting between these objects. Extracting knowledge from information networkshas become an important task. Both ranking and clustering can provide overall views oninformation network data; and each has been a hot topic by itself. However; ranking objectsglobally without considering which clusters they belong to often leads to dumb results; eg;ranking database and computer architecture conferences together may not make muchsense. Similarly; clustering a huge number of objects (eg; thousands of authors) into onehuge cluster without distinction is dull as well. In contrast; a good cluster can lead to …,Link Mining: Models; Algorithms; and Applications,2010,4
On Sampling Strategies for Neural Network-based Collaborative Filtering,Ting Chen; Yizhou Sun; Yue Shi; Liangjie Hong,Abstract Recent advances in neural networks have inspired people to design hybridrecommendation algorithms that can incorporate both (1) user-item interaction informationand (2) content information including image; audio; and text. Despite their promising results;neural network-based recommendation algorithms pose extensive computational costs;making it challenging to scale and improve upon. In this paper; we propose a general neuralnetwork-based recommendation framework; which subsumes several existing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms; and address the efficiency issue by investigating samplingstrategies in the stochastic gradient descent training for the framework. We tackle this issueby first establishing a connection between the loss functions and the user-item interactionbipartite graph; where the loss function terms are defined on links while major …,Proceedings of the 23th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining.

Design of reciprocal recommendation systems for online dating,Peng Xia; Shuangfei Zhai; Benyuan Liu; Yizhou Sun; Cindy Chen,Abstract Online dating sites have become popular platforms for people to look for potentialromantic partners. Different from traditional user-item recommendations where the goal is tomatch items (eg; books; videos) with a user's interests; a recommendation system for onlinedating aims to match people who are mutually interested in and likely to communicate witheach other. We introduce similarity measures that capture the unique features andcharacteristics of the online dating network; for example; the interest similarity between twousers if they send messages to same users; and attractiveness similarity if they receivemessages from same users. A reciprocal score that measures the compatibility between auser and each potential dating candidate is computed; and the recommendation list isgenerated to include users with top scores.

Integrating Community and Role Detection in Information Networks,Ting Chen; Lu-An Tang; Yizhou Sun; Zhengzhang Chen; Haifeng Chen; Guofei Jiang,Abstract Community detection and role detection in information networks have receivedwide attention recently; where the former aims to detect the groups of nodes that are closelyconnected to each other and the latter aims to discover the underlying roles of nodes in thenetwork. Traditional studies treat these two problems as orthogonal issues and proposealgorithms for these two tasks separately. In this paper; we propose to integrate communitiesand roles in a unified model and detect both of them simultaneously for informationnetworks. Intuitively;(1) correctly detecting the communities in a network will lead to thesuccess of detecting roles of nodes; such as opinion leaders and followers in socialnetworks; and (2) correctly identifying the roles of the nodes will lead to a better networkmodeling and thus a better detection of communities.

Joint Text Embedding for Personalized Content-based Recommendation,Ting Chen; Liangjie Hong; Yue Shi; Yizhou Sun,Abstract: Learning a good representation of text is key to many recommendationapplications. Examples include news recommendation where texts to be recommended areconstantly published everyday. However; most existing recommendation techniques; suchas matrix factorization based methods; mainly rely on interaction histories to learnrepresentations of items. While latent factors of items can be learned effectively from userinteraction data; in many cases; such data is not available; especially for newly emergeditems. In this work; we aim to address the problem of personalized recommendation forcompletely new items with text information available. We cast the problem as a personalizedtext ranking problem and propose a general framework that combines text embedding withpersonalized recommendation.

ST-SAGE: A Spatial-Temporal Sparse Additive Generative Model for Spatial Item Recommendation,Weiqing Wang; Hongzhi Yin; Ling Chen; Yizhou Sun; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs); spatial itemrecommendation has become an important mobile application; especially when users travelaway from home. However; this type of recommendation is very challenging compared totraditional recommender systems. A user may visit only a limited number of spatial items;leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. This matrix becomes even sparser when the usertravels to a distant place; as most of the items visited by a user are usually located within ashort distance from the user's home. Moreover; user interests and behavior patterns mayvary dramatically across different time and geographical regions. In light of this; we proposeST-SAGE; a spatial-temporal sparse additive generative model for spatial itemrecommendation in this article.

Player Skill Decomposition in Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas,Zhengxing Chen; Yizhou Sun; Magy Seif El-Nasr; Truong-Huy D Nguyen,Abstract: Successful analysis of player skills in video games has important impacts on theprocess of enhancing player experience without undermining their continuous skilldevelopment. Moreover; player skill analysis becomes more intriguing in team-based videogames because such form of study can help discover useful factors in effective teamformation. In this paper; we consider the problem of skill decomposition in MOBA(MultiPlayer Online Battle Arena) games; with the goal to understand what player skill factorsare essential for the outcome of a game match. To understand the construct of MOBA playerskills; we utilize various skill-based predictive models to decompose player skills intointerpretative parts; the impact of which are assessed in statistical terms. We apply thisanalysis approach on two widely known MOBAs; namely League of Legends (LoL) and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.06253,2017,2
The Co-Evolution Model for Social Network Evolving and Opinion Migration,Yupeng Gu; Yizhou Sun; Jianxi Gao,Abstract Almost all real-world social networks are dynamic and evolving with time; wherenew links may form and old links may drop; largely determined by the homophily of socialactors (ie; nodes in the network). Meanwhile;(latent) properties of social actors; such as theiropinions; are changing along the time; partially due to social influence received from thenetwork; which will in turn affect the network structure. Social network evolution and nodeproperty migration are usually treated as two orthogonal problems; and have been studiedseparately. In this paper; we propose a co-evolution model that closes the loop by modelingthe two phenomena together; which contains two major components:(1) a networkgenerative model when the node property is known; and (2) a property migration modelwhen the social network structure is known.

As far as we are concerned; however; the vast majority of the existing methods onideology detection on social media have oversimplified the problem as a binaryclassification problem (ie; liberal vs. conservative).

Towards Representation Independent Similarity Search Over Graph Databases,Yodsawalai Chodpathumwan; Amirhossein Aleyasen; Arash Termehchy; Yizhou Sun,Abstract Finding similar entities is a fundamental problem in graph data analysis. Similaritysearch algorithms usually leverage the structural properties of the database to quantify thedegree of similarity between entities. However; the same information can be represented indifferent structures and the structural properties observed over particular representationsmay not hold for the alternatives. These algorithms are effective on some representationsand ineffective on others. We define the property of representation independence forsimilarity search algorithms as their robustness against transformations that modify thestructure of databases but preserve the information content. We introduce a widespreadgroup of such transformations called relationship reorganizing. We propose an algorithmcalled R-PathSim; which is provably robust under relationship reorganizing.

Perspective on Measurement Metrics for Community Detection Algorithms,Yang Yang; Yizhou Sun; Saurav Pandit; Nitesh V Chawla; Jiawei Han,Abstract Community detection or cluster detection in networks is often at the core of miningnetwork data. Whereas the problem is well-studied; given the scale and complexity ofmodern day social networks; detecting “reasonable” communities is often a hard problem.Since the first use of k-means algorithm in 1960s; many community detection algorithmshave been presented—most of which are developed with specific goals in mind and the ideaof detecting meaningful communities varies widely from one algorithm to another. As thenumber of clustering algorithms grows; so does the number of metrics on how to measurethem. Algorithms are often reduced to optimizing the value of an objective function such asmodularity and internal density. Some of these metrics rely on ground-truth; some do not. Inthis chapter we study these algorithms and aim to find whether these optimization based …,*,2013,2

Recommendation in Context-Rich Environment: An Information Network Analysis Approach,Yizhou Sun; Hongzhi Yin; Xiang Ren,Abstract Recommendation has received tremendous attention recently due to its wide andsuccessful applications across different domains. Different from traditional setting ofrecommendation tasks; modern recommendation tasks are usually exposed in a context-richenvironment. For example; in addition to a user-item rating matrix; users and items areconnected to other objects via different relationships and they are usually associated withrich attributes; such as text and spatio-temporal information. It turns out that heterogeneousinformation network serves a natural data model to capture the rich context of theserecommendation tasks.

Distant Meta-Path Similarities for Text-Based Heterogeneous Information Networks,Chenguang Wang; Yangqiu Song; Haoran Li; Yizhou Sun; Ming Zhang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Measuring network similarity is a fundamental data mining problem. Themainstream similarity measures mainly leverage the structural information regarding to theentities in the network without considering the network semantics. In the real world; theheterogeneous information networks (HINs) with rich semantics are ubiquitous. However;the existing network similarity doesn't generalize well in HINs because they fail to capturethe HIN semantics. The meta-path has been proposed and demonstrated as a right way torepresent semantics in HINs. Therefore; original meta-path based similarities (eg; PathSimand KnowSim) have been successful in computing the entity proximity in HINs. The intuitionis that the more instances of meta-path (s) between entities; the more similar the entities are.Thus the original meta-path similarity only applies to computing the proximity of two …,*,2017,1

Ranking Methods for Networks,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,In this entry; we introduce the ranking methods developed for networks. Different from otherranking methods defined in text or database systems; links or the structure information of thenetwork are significantly explored. For most of the ranking methods in networks; rankingscores are defined in a way that can be propagated in the network. Therefore; the rank scoreof an object is determined by other objects in the network; usually with stronger influencefrom closer objects and weaker influence from more remote ones. Methods for ranking innetworks can be categorized according to several aspects; such as global ranking vs. query-dependent ranking; based on whether the ranking result is dependent on a query; ranking inhomogeneous information,*,2014,1

RaRE: Social Rank Regulated Large-scale Network Embedding,Yupeng Gu; Yizhou Sun; Yanen Li; Yang Yang,ABSTRACT Network embedding algorithms that map nodes in a network into a low-dimensional vector space are prevalent in recent years; due to their superior performance inmany network-based tasks; such as clustering; classification; and link prediction. The mainassumption of existing algorithms is that the learned latent representation for nodes shouldpreserve the structure of the network; in terms of firstorder or higher-order connectivity. Inother words; nodes that are more similar will have higher probability to connect to eachother. This phenomena is typically explained as homophily in network science. However;there is another factor usually neglected by the existing embedding algorithms; which is thepopularity of a node. For example; celebrities in a social network usually receive numerousfollowers; which cannot be fully explained by the similarity of the two users. We denote …,*,2018,*
Learning K-way D-dimensional Discrete Code For Compact Embedding Representations,Ting Chen; Martin Renqiang Min; Yizhou Sun,Abstract: Embedding methods such as word embedding have become pillars for manyapplications containing discrete structures. Conventional embedding methods directlyassociate each symbol with a continuous embedding vector; which is equivalent to applyinglinear transformation based on" one-hot" encoding of the discrete symbols. Despite itssimplicity; such approach yields number of parameters that grows linearly with thevocabulary size and can lead to overfitting. In this work we propose a much more compact K-way D-dimensional discrete encoding scheme to replace the" one-hot" encoding. In" KDencoding"; each symbol is represented by a $ D $-dimensional code; and each of itsdimension has a cardinality of $ K $. The final symbol embedding vector can be generatedby composing the code embedding vectors. To learn the semantically meaningful code …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03067,2017,*
User Stance Prediction via Online Behavior Mining,Yizhou Sun,Abstract Nowadays social media; such as Twitter and all kinds of online forums; becomes aplatform where people can express their opinions implicitly or explicitly. For example; inTwitter; people follow people they trust; and retweet the tweets they agree. In online forums;such as PoliticalForum. com; people explicitly express their opinions and interact with eachother using text. Our goal is to understand people's stance on some (political) issueaccording to their online behaviors that can be captured in social media; including links theyhave issued and content they have generated; which is essential for national security andpolicy making. Existing attempts in this direction; however; oversimplified the problem inseveral aspects.

EOMM: An Engagement Optimized Matchmaking Framework,Zhengxing Chen; Su Xue; John Kolen; Navid Aghdaie; Kazi A Zaman; Yizhou Sun; Magy Seif El-Nasr,Abstract Matchmaking connects multiple players to participate in online player-versus-playergames. Current matchmaking systems depend on a single core strategy: create fair gamesat all times. These systems pair similarly skilled players on the assumption that a fair game isbest player experience. We will demonstrate; however; that this intuitive assumptionsometimes fails and that matchmaking based on fairness is not optimal for engagement. Inthis paper; we propose an Engagement Optimized Matchmaking (EOMM) framework thatmaximizes overall player engagement. We prove that equal-skill based matchmaking is aspecial case of EOMM on a highly simplified assumption that rarely holds in reality.

Weakly-Guided User Stance Prediction via Joint Modeling of Content and Social Interaction,Rui Dong; Yizhou Sun; Lu Wang; Yupeng Gu; Yuan Zhong,Abstract Social media websites have become a popular outlet for online users to expresstheir opinions on controversial issues; such as gun control and abortion. Understandingusers' stances and their arguments is a critical task for policy-making process and publicdeliberation. Existing methods rely on large amounts of human annotation for predictingstance on issues of interest; which is expensive and hard to scale to new problems. In thiswork; we present a weakly-guided user stance modeling framework which simultaneouslyconsiders two types of information: what do you say (via stance-based content generativemodel) and how do you behave (via social interaction-based graph regularization).

In attempting tofind the simplest possible; but sufficiently accurate; such model; we explore piecewise linearfunctions of input; output; and computational complexity. They are abstract in the sense thatthey capture fundamental algorithm properties; but do not require explicit modeling ofsystem and implementation details such as the number of disk accesses.

Toward Representation Independent Similarity Search Over Graphs,Yodsawalai Chodpathumwan; Arash Termehchy; Yizhou Sun; Amirhossein Aleyasin; Jose Picado,Abstract Finding similar entities over data graphs is an important problem with manyapplications. Current similarity search algorithms use intuitively appealing heuristics thatleverage the link information in the data graph to quantify the degree of similarity between itsentities. In this paper; using examples from real-world data sets; we show that peoplerepresent the same information using data graphs with different shapes. We argue that inorder for a similarity search algorithm to be usable and effective; it should be representationindependent: it should return essentially the same answers for a query over different graphsthat represent the same information. We formalize this property and show that the outcomeof current similarity search algorithms depend highly on data representation. Hence; theymay be effective on some datasets and ineffective over others. We also perform an …,Proceedings of Workshop on GRAph Data management Experiences and Systems,2014,*
Crowdsourcing Formal Decision Making Using Generalized Semantic Games,Ahmed Abdelmeged; Karl Lieberherr; Yizhou Sun,Abstract We are after a Wikipedia for formal scientific knowledge; a crowdsourcing systemwhere formal science claims are expressed as interpreted logical statements (aka claims).The crowd takes positions on claims and objectively argues these positions throughSemantic Games (SGs). SGs are zero-sum; two-person games where players take twocontradictory positions on claims and exchange examples and counter-examples to supporttheir positions and dispute their opponent's positions. SGs provide an attractive basis forsolving some key challenges that face crowdsourcing systems. More concretely; 1) thechallenge of defining user contributions is to some extent solved by SGs because SGplayers interact through a formal well-defined protocol. However; an SG is a binaryinteraction mechanism that needs to be scaled to the crowd. 2) SGs provide a basis for …,*,2013,*
