Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer,Chengfei Liu; Wei Lou; Yezi Zhu; Nagalakshmi Nadiminty; Chad T Schwartz; Christopher P Evans; Allen C Gao,Purpose: Enzalutamide; a second-generation antiandrogen; was recently approved for thetreatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in patients who no longer respondto docetaxel. Despite these advances that provide temporary respite; resistance toenzalutamide occurs frequently. Androgen receptor (AR) splice variants such as AR-V7have recently been shown to drive castration-resistant growth and resistance toenzalutamide. This study was designed to identify inhibitors of AR variants and test its abilityto overcome resistance to enzalutamide. Experimental Design: The drug screening wasconducted using luciferase activity assay to determine the activity of AR-V7 after treatmentwith the compounds in the Prestwick Chemical Library; which contains about 1;120 FDA-approved drugs. The effects of the identified inhibitors on AR-V7 activity and …,Clinical cancer research,2014,119
NF-κB2/p52 induces resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer: role of androgen receptor and its variants,Nagalakshmi Nadiminty; Ramakumar Tummala; Chengfei Liu; Joy Yang; Wei Lou; Christopher P Evans; Allen C Gao,Resistance of prostate cancer cells to the next-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide maybe mediated by a multitude of survival signaling pathways. In this study; we tested whetherincreased expression of NF-κB2/p52 induces prostate cancer cell resistance toenzalutamide and whether this response is mediated by aberrant androgen receptor (AR)activation and AR splice variant production. LNCaP cells stably expressing NF-κB2/p52exhibited higher survival rates than controls when treated with enzalutamide. C4-2B andCWR22Rv1 cells chronically treated with enzalutamide were found to express higher levelsof NF-κB2/p52. Downregulation of NF-κB2/p52 in CWR22Rv1 cells chronically treated withenzalutamide rendered them more sensitive to cell growth inhibition by enzalutamide.Analysis of the expression levels of AR splice variants by quantitative reverse …,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2013,101

Niclosamide enhances abiraterone treatment via inhibition of androgen receptor variants in castration resistant prostate cancer,Chengfei Liu; Cameron Armstrong; Yezi Zhu; Wei Lou; Allen C Gao,Abstract Considerable evidence from both clinical and experimental studies suggests thatandrogen receptor variants; particularly androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7); are critical inthe induction of resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. In this study; we investigatedthe role of AR-V7 in the cross-resistance of enzalutamide and abiraterone and examined ifinhibition of AR-V7 can improve abiraterone treatment response. We found thatenzalutamide-resistant cells are cross-resistant to abiraterone; and that AR-V7 confersresistance to abiraterone. Knock down of AR-V7 by siRNA in abiraterone resistantCWR22Rv1 and C4-2B MDVR cells restored their sensitivity to abiraterone; indicating thatAR-V7 is involved in abiraterone resistance. Abiraterone resistant prostate cancer cellsgenerated by chronic treatment with abiraterone showed enhanced AR-V7 protein …,Oncotarget,2016,27
Andrographolide targets androgen receptor pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer,Chengfei Liu; Nagalakshmi Nadiminty; Ramakumar Tummala; Jae Yeon Chun; Wei Lou; Yezi Zhu; Meng Sun; Christopher P Evans; Qinghua Zhou; Allen C Gao,Androgen receptor (AR) signaling not only plays a pivotal role in the development ofandrogen-dependent prostate cancer but is also important in the growth and survival ofcastration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The first line of treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer is the use of androgen deprivation therapy. However; mostpatients will eventually relapse due to development of CRPC. Thus; development of astrategy to target AR for treatment of CRPC is urgently needed. The authors have previouslyidentified andrographolide as an inhibitor of interleukin-6; which can suppress tumor growthof prostate cancer cells by screening compounds from the Prestwick Natural compoundlibrary. In this study; they identified that andrographolide can inhibit AR expression andprostate cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis. Andrographolide is able to down …,Genes & cancer,2011,27

However; little is known about the mechanisms underlying neuroendocrinedifferentiation induced by IL-6. METHODS Immunoblotting was performed to determine thestatus of RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and of neuroendocrine markers such asNeuron-specific Enolase (NSE); chromogranin A and synaptophysin in LNCaP cells treatedwith IL-6. To further study the impact of REST-mediated repression on neuroendocrinedifferentiation (NED) in LNCaP cells; either wild-type REST or a dominant-positive form ofREST; REST-VP16; in which both repressor domains of REST were replaced with theactivation domain of the herpes simplex virus protein VP16; was introduced into LNCaP …,The Prostate,2014,25
NF-κB2/p52: c-Myc: HnRNPA1 pathway regulates expression of androgen receptor splice variants and enzalutamide sensitivity in prostate cancer,Nagalakshmi Nadiminty; Ramakumar Tummala; Chengfei Liu; Wei Lou; Christopher P Evans; Allen C Gao,Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains dependent on androgen receptor (AR)signaling. Alternative splicing of the AR to generate constitutively active; ligand-independentvariants is one of the principal mechanisms that promote the development of resistance tonext-generation antiandrogens such as enzalutamide. Here; we demonstrate that thesplicing factor heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding protein A1 (hnRNPA1) plays a pivotalrole in the generation of AR splice variants such as AR-V7. hnRNPA1 is overexpressed inprostate tumors compared with benign prostates; and its expression is regulated by NF-κB2/p52 and c-Myc. CRPC cells resistant to enzalutamide exhibit higher levels of NF-κB2/p52; c-Myc; hnRNPA1; and AR-V7. Levels of hnRNPA1 and AR-V7 are positivelycorrelated with each other in prostate cancer.

Inhibition of AKR1C3 activation overcomes resistance to abiraterone in advanced prostate cancer,Chengfei Liu; Cameron M Armstrong; Wei Lou; Alan Lombard; Christopher P Evans; Allen C Gao,Abiraterone suppresses intracrine androgen synthesis via inhibition of CYP17A1. However;clinical evidence suggests that androgen synthesis is not fully inhibited by abiraterone andthe sustained androgen production may lead to disease relapse. In the present study; weidentified AKR1C3; an important enzyme in the steroidogenesis pathway; as a criticalmechanism driving resistance to abiraterone through increasing intracrine androgensynthesis and enhancing androgen signaling. We found that overexpression of AKR1C3confers resistance to abiraterone while downregulation of AKR1C3 resensitizes resistantcells to abiraterone treatment. In abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer cells; AKR1C3 isoverexpressed and the levels of intracrine androgens are elevated.

ABCB1 Mediates Cabazitaxel–Docetaxel Cross-Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer,Alan P Lombard; Chengfei Liu; Cameron M Armstrong; Vito Cucchiara; Xinwei Gu; Wei Lou; Christopher P Evans; Allen C Gao,Advancements in research have added several new therapies for castration-resistantprostate cancer (CRPC); greatly augmenting our ability to treat patients. However; CRPCremains an incurable disease due to the development of therapeutic resistance and theexistence of cross-resistance between available therapies. Understanding the interplaybetween different treatments will lead to improved sequencing and the creation ofcombinations that overcome resistance and prolong survival. Whether there exists cross-resistance between docetaxel and the next-generation taxane cabazitaxel is poorlyunderstood. In this study; we use C4-2B and DU145 derived docetaxel-resistant cell lines totest response to cabazitaxel. Our results demonstrate that docetaxel resistance confers cross-resistance to cabazitaxel. We show that increased ABCB1 expression is responsible for …,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2017,*
Taxane resistance in prostate cancer: A role for miRNA 181a,Cameron M Armstrong; Chengfei Liu; Wei Lou; Allen C Gao,Introduction: Docetaxel (DTX) is one of the primary drugs used for treating castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
