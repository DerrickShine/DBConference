A local search mechanism for peer-to-peer networks,Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti,Abstract One important problem in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is searching and retrievingthe correct information. However; existing searching mechanisms in pure peer-to-peernetworks are inefficient due to the decentralized nature of such networks. We propose twomechanisms for information retrieval in pure peer-to-peer networks. The first; the modifiedBreadth-First Search (BFS) mechanism; is an extension of the current Gnuttela protocol;allows searching with keywords; and is designed to minimize the number of messages thatare needed to search the network. The second; the Intelligent Search mechanism; uses thepast behavior of the P2P network to further improve the scalability of the search procedure.In this algorithm; each peer autonomously decides which of its peers are most likely toanswer a given query. The algorithm is entirely distributed; and therefore scales well with …,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,559

MicroHash: An Efficient Index Structure for Flash-Based Sensor Devices.,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Song Lin; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Walid A Najjar,Abstract In this paper we propose the MicroHash index; which is an efficient externalmemory structure for Wireless Sensor Devices (WSDs). The most prevalent storage mediumfor WSDs is flash memory. Our index structure exploits the asymmetric read/write and wearcharacteristics of flash memory in order to offer high performance indexing and searchingcapabilities in the presence of a low energy budget which is typical for the devices underdiscussion. A key idea behind MicroHash is to eliminate expensive random accessdeletions. We have implemented MicroHash in nesC; the programming language of theTinyOS [7] operating system. Our trace-driven experimentation with several real datasetsreveals that our index structure offers excellent search performance at a small cost ofconstructing and maintaining the index.,FAST,2005,184

A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for the deployment and power assignment problem in wireless sensor networks,Andreas Konstantinidis; Kun Yang; Qingfu Zhang; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti,Abstract A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) design often requires the decision of optimallocations (deployment) and transmit power levels (power assignment) of the sensors to bedeployed in an area of interest. Few attempts have been made on optimizing both decisionvariables for maximizing the network coverage and lifetime objectives; even though; most ofthe latter studies consider the two objectives individually. This paper defines themultiobjective Deployment and Power Assignment Problem (DPAP). Using the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D); the DPAP isdecomposed into a set of scalar subproblems that are classified based on their objectivepreference and tackled in parallel by using neighborhood information and problem-specificevolutionary operators; in a single run. The proposed operators adapt to the requirements …,Computer networks,2010,97
Information retrieval techniques for peer-to-peer networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are application-layer networks that let networked hosts shareresources in a distributed environment. An important attribute of P2P networks is the abilityto efficiently search the contents of other peers.

The threshold join algorithm for top-k queries in distributed sensor networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Zografoula Vagena; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki; V Tsotras; Michail Vlachos; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In this paper we present the Threshold Join Algorithm (TJA); which is an efficientTOP-k query processing algorithm for distributed sensor networks. The objective of a top-kquery is to find the k highest ranked answers to a user defined similarity function. Theevaluation of such a query in a sensor network environment is associated with the transfer ofdata over an extremely expensive communication medium. TJA uses a non-uniformthreshold on the queried attribute in order to minimize the number of tuples that have to betransferred towards the querying node. Additionally; TJA resolves queries in the networkrather than in a centralized fashion; which minimizes even more the consumption ofbandwidth and delay. Our preliminary experimental results; using our trace driven simulator;show that TJA is both practical and efficient.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Data management for sensor networks,2005,87
Exploiting locality for scalable information retrieval in peer-to-peer networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract An important problem in unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is the efficientcontent-based retrieval of documents shared by other peers. However; existing searchingmechanisms are not scaling well because they are either based on the idea of flooding thenetwork with queries or because they require some form of global knowledge. We proposethe Intelligent Search Mechanism (ISM) which is an efficient; scalable yet simple mechanismfor improving the information retrieval problem in P2P systems. Our mechanism is efficientsince it is bounded by the number of neighbors and scalable because no global knowledgeis required to be maintained. ISM consists of four components: A Profiling Structure whichlogs queryhit messages coming from neighbors; a Query Similarity function which calculatesthe similarity queries to a new query; RelevanceRank which is an online neighbor …,Information Systems,2005,69
A quantitative analysis of the gnutella network traffic,Demetris Zeinalipour-Yazti; Theodoros Folias,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing systems such as Gnutella; Morpheus and Freenethave recently attracted a lot of interest from the internet community because they realized adistributed infrastructure for sharing files. Such systems have shifted the Web's Client-Servermodel paradigm into a Client-Client model. The tremendous success of such systems hasproven that purely distributed search systems are feasible and that they may change the waywe interact on the Internet. P2P systems uncover many new exciting features such asrobustness; scalability and high fault tolerance but with a price. Most research concentrateson optimizing the communication and data model of such systems but inadequate work hasbeen done in area of analyzing such systems. Most approaches tend to use as their basissimulation models which can lead to wrong observations and solutions.,Department of Computer Science University of California,2002,60

The airplace indoor positioning platform for android smartphones,Christos Laoudias; George Constantinou; Marios Constantinides; Silouanos Nicolaou; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Christos G Panayiotou,In this demonstration paper; we present an indoor positioning system developed for Androidsmartphones; coined Airplace. To infer the unknown user location we rely on ubiquitousWLANs and exploit Received Signal Strength (RSS) values from neighboring Access Points(AP) that are constantly monitored by the mobile devices under normal operation. Oursystem follows a mobile-based network-assisted architecture to eliminate thecommunication overhead and respect user privacy.

Crowdsourced indoor localization for diverse devices through radiomap fusion,Christos Laoudias; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Christos G Panayiotou,Crowdsourcing is an emerging field that allows to tackle difficult problems by solicitingcontributions from common people; rather than trained professionals. In the post-pc era;where smartphones dominate the personal computing market offering both constant mobilityand large amounts of spatiotemporal sensory data; crowdsourcing is becoming increasinglypopular. In this context; crowdsourcing stands as the only viable solution for collecting thelarge amount of location-related network data required to support location-based services;eg; the signal strength radiomap of a fingerprinting localization system inside a multi-floorbuilding. However; this benefit does not come for free; because crowdsourcing also posesnew challenges in radiomap creation.

Optimized query routing trees for wireless sensor networks,Panayiotis Andreou; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Andreas Pamboris; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras,Abstract In order to process continuous queries over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs);sensors are typically organized in a Query Routing Tree (denoted as T) that provides eachsensor with a path over which query results can be transmitted to the querying node. Wefound that current methods deployed in predominant data acquisition systems construct T ina sub-optimal manner which leads to significant waste of energy. In particular; since T isconstructed in an ad hoc manner there is no guarantee that a given query workload will bedistributed equally among all sensors. That leads to data collisions which represent a majorsource of energy waste. Additionally; current methods only provide a topological-basedmethod; rather than a query-based method; to define the interval during which a sensingdevice should enable its transceiver in order to collect the query results from its children …,Information Systems,2011,41
Distributed spatio-temporal similarity search,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Song Lin; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract In this paper we introduce the distributed spatio-temporal similarity search problem:given a query trajectory Q; we want to find the trajectories that follow a motion similar to Q;when each of the target trajectories is segmented across a number of distributed nodes. Wepropose two novel algorithms; UB-K and UBLB-K; which combine local computations oflower and upper bounds on the matching between the distributed subsequences and Q.Such an operation generates the desired result without pulling together all the distributedsubsequences over the fundamentally expensive communication medium. Our solutions findapplications in a wide array of domains; such as cellular networks; wild life monitoring andvideo surveillance. Our experimental evaluation using realistic data demonstrates that ourframework is both efficient and robust to a variety of conditions.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,40

A typicalmaterialized view V maintains the complete results of a query Q in order to minimize the costof future query executions. In a sensor network context; maintaining consistency between Vand the underlying and distributed base relation R is very expensive in terms ofcommunication. Thus; our approach focuses on a subset V (sube. V) that unveils only the khighest-ranked answers at the sink for some user defined parameter k.

Efficient indexing data structures for flash-based sensor devices,Song Lin; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Walid A Najjar,Abstract Flash memory is the most prevalent storage medium found on modern wirelesssensor devices (WSDs). In this article we present two external memory index structures forthe efficient retrieval of records stored on the local flash memory of a WSD. Our indexstructures; MicroHash and MicroGF (micro grid files); exploit the asymmetric read/write andwear characteristics of flash memory in order to offer high-performance indexing andsearching capabilities in the presence of a low-energy budget; which is typical for thedevices under discussion. Both structures organize data and index pages on the flash mediausing a sorted by timestamp file organization. A key idea behind these index structures isthat expensive random access deletions are completely eliminated.

Data acquisition in sensor networks with large memories,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Som Neema; V Kalogeraki; D Gunopulos; Walid Najjar,Sensor Networks will soon become ubiquitous; making them essential tools for monitoringthe activity and evolution of our surrounding environment. However such environments areexpected to generate vast amounts of temporal data that needs to be processed in a power-effective manner. To this date sensor nodes feature small amounts of memory which mostlylimits their capabilities to queries that only refer to the current point in time. In this paper weinitiate a study on the deployment of large memories at sensor nodes. Such an approachgives birth to an array of new temporal and top-k queries which have been extensivelystudied by the database community.

Minimum-hot-spot query trees for wireless sensor networks,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We propose a distributed algorithm to construct a balanced communication tree thatserves in gathering data from the network nodes to a sink. Our algorithm constructs a near-optimally balanced communication tree with minimum overhead. The balancing of the nodedegrees results in the minimization of packet collisions during query execution; that wouldotherwise require numerous retransmissions and reduce the lifetime of the network. Wecompare our simple distributed algorithm against previous work and a centralized solutionand show that for most network layouts it outperforms competition and achieves tree balancevery close to the centralized algorithm. It also has the smallest energy overhead possible toconstruct the tree; increasing the lifetime of the network even more.,Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access,2010,26

Privacy-preserving indoor localization on smartphones,Andreas Konstantinidis; Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Paschalis Mpeis; Nikos Pelekis; Yannis Theodoridis,Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) have recently received considerable attention; mainlybecause GPS is unavailable in indoor spaces and consumes considerable energy. On theother hand; predominant Smartphone OS localization subsystems currently rely on server-side localization processes; allowing the service provider to know the location of a user at alltimes. In this paper; we propose an innovative algorithm for protecting users from locationtracking by the localization service; without hindering the provisioning of fine-grainedlocation updates on a continuous basis.

The micropulse framework for adaptive waking windows in sensor networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Panayiotis Andreou; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras; Andreas Pitsillides,In this paper we present MicroPulse; a novel framework for adapting the waking window of asensing device S based on the data workload incurred by a query Q. Assuming a typical tree-based aggregation scenario; the waking window is defined as the time interval r duringwhich S enables its transceiver in order to collect the results from its children. Minimizing thelength of r enables S to conserve energy that can be used to prolong the longevity of thenetwork and hence the quality of results. Our method is established on profiling recent dataacquisition activity and on identifying the bottlenecks using an in-network execution of theCritical Path Method. We show through trace-driven experimentation with a real dataset thatMicroPulse can reduce the energy cost of the waking window by three orders of magnitude.,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,16

Multi-objective query optimization in smartphone social networks,Andreas Konstantinidis; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Panayiotis Andreou; George Samaras,The bulk of social network applications for smart phones (eg; Twitter; Face book;Foursquare; etc.) currently rely on centralized or cloud-like architectures in order to carry outtheir data sharing and searching tasks. Unfortunately; the given model introduces both data-disclosure concerns (eg; disclosing all captured media to a central entity) and performanceconcerns (eg; consuming precious smart phone battery and bandwidth during contentuploads). In this paper; we present a novel framework; coined Smart Opt; for searchingobjects (eg; images; videos; etc.) captured by the users in a mobile social community. Ourframework; is founded on an in-situ data storage model; where captured objects remainlocal on their owner's smart phones and searches then take place over a novel lookupstructure we compute dynamically; coined the Multi-Objective Query Routing Tree (MO …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2011 12th IEEE International Conference on,2011,13

FSort: external sorting on flash-based sensor devices,Panayiotis Andreou; Orestis Spanos; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; George Samaras; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract In long-term deployments of Wireless Sensor Networks; it is often more efficient tostore sensor readings locally at each device and transmit those readings to the user onlywhen requested (ie; in response to a user query). Many of the techniques that collectinformation from a sensor network require that the data is sorted on some attribute (eg;range queries; top-k queries; join queries; etc.) Yet; the underlying storage medium of thesedevices (ie; Flash media) presents some unique characteristics which renders traditionaldisk-based sorting algorithms inefficient in this context. In this paper we devise the FSortalgorithm; an efficient external sorting algorithm for flash-based sensor devices with a smallmemory footprint. FSort minimizes the expensive write/delete operations of flash memoryminimizing in that way the consumption of energy. In particular; FSort uses a top-down …,Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Data Management for Sensor Networks,2009,12
Finding the K highest-ranked answers in a distributed network,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Zografoula Vagena; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras; Michail Vlachos; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In this paper; we present an algorithm for finding the k highest-ranked (or Top-k)answers in a distributed network. A Top-K query returns the subset of most relevant answers;in place of all answers; for two reasons:(i) to minimize the cost metric that is associated withthe retrieval of all answers; and (ii) to improve the recall and the precision of the answer-set;such that the user is not overwhelmed with irrelevant results. Our study focuses on multi-hopdistributed networks in which the data is accessible by traversing a network of nodes. Such asetting captures very well the computation framework of emerging Sensor Networks; Peer-to-Peer Networks and Vehicular Networks.

Structuring topologically aware overlay networks using domain names,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Vana Kalogeraki,Abstract Overlay networks are application layer systems which facilitate users in performingdistributed functions such as searches over the contents of other users. An importantproblem in such networks is that the connections among peers are arbitrary; leading in thatway to a topology structure; which does not match the underlying physical topology. Thistopology mismatch leads to large user experienced delays; degraded performance andexcessive resource consumption in Wide Area Networks. In this work we propose andevaluate the Distributed Domain Name Order (DDNO) technique; which makes unstructuredoverlay networks topologically aware. In DDNO; a node devotes half of its connections tonodes that share the same domain-name and the remaining half connections to randomnodes. The former connections achieve good performance; because the bulk of the …,Computer Networks,2006,11
Information retrieval in peer-to-peer systems,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti,Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are increasingly becoming popular because they offeropportunities for real-time communication; ad-hoc collaboration [12] and information sharing[23; 11] in a large-scale distributed environment. Peer-to-peer computing is defined as thesharing of computer resources and information through direct exchange. The most distinctcharacteristic of P2P computing is that there is symmetric communication between the peers;each peer has both a client and a server role. The advantages of the P2P systems are multi-dimensional; they improve scalability by enabling direct and real-time sharing of servicesand information; enable knowledge sharing by aggregating information and resources fromnodes that are located on geographically distributed and potentially heterogeneousplatforms; and; provide high availability by eliminating the need for a single centralized …,*,2003,11
Distributed in-memory processing of all k nearest neighbor queries,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Constantinos Costa; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Wang-Chien Lee; Evaggelia Pitoura,A wide spectrum of Internet-scale mobile applications; ranging from social networking;gaming and entertainment to emergency response and crisis management; all requireefficient and scalable All k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) computations over millions of movingobjects every few seconds to be operational. Most traditional techniques for computingAkNN queries are centralized; lacking both scalability and efficiency. Only recently;distributed techniques for shared-nothing cloud infrastructures have been proposed toachieve scalability for large datasets. These batch-oriented algorithms are sub-optimal dueto inefficient data space partitioning and data replication among processing units. In thispaper; we present Spitfire; a distributed algorithm that provides a scalable and high-performance AkNN processing framework.

Towards planet-scale localization on smartphones with a partial radiomap,Andreas Konstantinidis; Georgios Chatzimiloudis; Christos Laoudias; Silouanos Nicolaou; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti,Abstract The majority of smartphone localization systems use Assisted-GPS for fine-grainedlocalization in outdoor spaces or WiFi-based RSS (Received Signal Strength) technologiesfor coarse-grain positioning in indoor and outdoor spaces. The former consumes preciousenergy from mobile devices; is strictly affected by the environment (eg; cloudy day; forests;etc.) and does not work in indoor spaces. The latter collects RSS from WiFi beams within auser's vicinity and transfers an RSS vector to the server for localization; in which the positionof the user is disclosed possibly violating users' privacy. In this paper; we presentBloomMap; an innovative and efficient algorithm that conducts a localization process withoutunveiling the user's location to the localization service; minimizing the energy consumptionof the mobile unit and also minimizing the network traffic by not transferring large …,Proceedings of the 4th ACM international workshop on Hot topics in planet-scale measurement,2012,10

Power efficiency through tuple ranking in wireless sensor network monitoring,Panayiotis Andreou; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras,Abstract In this paper; we present an innovative framework for efficiently monitoring WirelessSensor Networks (WSNs). Our framework; coined KSpot; utilizes a novel top-k queryprocessing algorithm we developed; in conjunction with the concept of in-network views; inorder to minimize the cost of query execution. For ease of exposition; consider a set ofsensors acquiring data from their environment at a given time instance. The generatedinformation can conceptually be thought as a horizontally fragmented base relation R.Furthermore; the results to a user-defined query Q; registered at some sink point; canconceptually be thought as a view V. Maintaining consistency between V and R is veryexpensive in terms of communication and energy. Thus; KSpot focuses on a subset V′(⊆V) that unveils only the k highest-ranked answers at the sink; for some user defined …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2011,9
Towards self-managing QoS-enabled peer-to-peer systems,Vana Kalogeraki; Fang Chen; Thomas Repantis; Demetris Zeinalipour-Yazti,Abstract Peer-to-peer systems that dynamically interact; collaborate and share resources areincreasingly being deployed in wide-area environments. The inherent ad-hoc nature ofthese systems makes it difficult to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of thedistributed applications; thus having a direct impact on their scalability; efficiency andperformance. In this paper we propose adaptive algorithms to meet applications QoSdemands and balance the load across multiple peers. These comprise (a) resourcemanagement mechanisms to monitor resource loads and application latencies and (b) self-organization algorithms to dynamically select peers that maximize the probability of meetingthe applications' soft real-time and QoS requirements.

It is imperative for u to have a stable WiFi connection in order to either continuouslyreceive location updates from s or to download RMs a priori for offline navigation.

Distributed middleware architectures for scalable media services,Vana Kalogeraki; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Alex Delis,Abstract The fusion of Multimedia and Internet technology has introduced an ever-increasingdemand for large-scale reliable media services. This exposes the scalability limitations ofcurrent middleware architectures; as they traditionally operate on either very large-serverconfigurations or on tightly coupled distributed systems. On the other hand; the wideavailability of high-speed networks and the widespread deployment of powerful personalcomputing units by end users; has emphasized the advantages of the peer-to-peer (P2P)computing model. In this paper; we evaluate a number of different middleware architecturesthat facilitate the timely and reliable delivery of media services in P2P networks. Ourevaluated architectures exploit features including availability of high-performance links;replication and caching of popular items and finally state-of-the-art search techniques …,Journal of network and computer applications,2007,4

Indoor localization accuracy estimation from fingerprint data,Artyom Nikitin; Christos Laoudias; Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Panagiotis Karras; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti,The demand for indoor localization services has led to the development of techniques thatcreate a Fingerprint Map (FM) of sensor signals (eg; magnetic; Wi-Fi; bluetooth) atdesignated positions in an indoor space and then use FM as a reference for subsequentlocalization tasks. With such an approach; it is crucial to assess the quality of the FM beforedeployment; in a manner disregarding data origin and at any location of interest; so as toprovide deployment staff with the information on the quality of localization. Even though FM-based localization algorithms usually provide accuracy estimates during system operation(eg; visualized as uncertainty circle or ellipse around the user location); they do not provideany information about the expected accuracy before the actual deployment of thelocalization service. In this paper; we develop a novel frame-work for quality assessment …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2017 18th IEEE International Conference on,2017,3

2013 14th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),Miao Lin; Zhuo Qi Lee; Wen-Jing Hsu,Various Markov models have been proposed to model individuals' mobility; ie; thetransitions between locations. Although these studies are able to show high predictingaccuracy of individuals' next move; two basic assumptions of these studies; namely thestationarity of individuals' mobility sequence and the dependency of visiting the locations;have never been validated. Moreover; a famous recent...,*,*,*

A Quantitative Analysis of the Gnutella Network Traffic,Demetris Zeinalipour-Yazti Theodoros Folias,Abstract. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing systems such as Gnutella; Morpheus and Freenethave recently attracted a lot of interest from the internet community because they realized adistributed infrastructure for sharing files. Such systems have shifted the Web's Client-Servermodel paradigm into a Client-Client model. The tremendous success of such systems hasproven that purely distributed search systems are feasible and that they may change the waywe interact on the Internet. P2P systems uncover many new exciting features such asrobustness; scalability and high fault tolerance but with a price. Most research concentrateson optimizing the communication and data model of such systems but inadequate work hasbeen done in area of analyzing such systems. Most approaches tend to use as their basissimulation models which can lead to wrong observations and solutions. In this project we …,*,*,*

DNSR: Domain Name Suffix-based Routing in Overlay Networks⋆,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti,Abstract. Overlay Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are application layer networks which facilitateusers in performing distributed functions such as keyword searches over the data of otherusers. An important problem in such networks is that the connection among peers arearbitrary; leading in that way to a topology structure which doesn't match the underlyingphysical topology. This phenomenon leads to excessive network resource consumption inWide Area Networks as well as degraded user experience because of the incurred networkdelays. Most state-of-the-art research concentrates on structuring overlay networks in a waythat query messages can reach the appropriate nodes within some hop-count boundaries.These approaches are not taking into account the underlying network topology mismatchmaking it therefore inappropriate for wide area routing. In this work we propose and …,*,*,*
An Indoor Trajectory Comparison Framework for Android Smartphones,Christos Laoudias; Costandinos Costa; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Christos G Panayiotou,Abstract—We present a powerful distributed framework for comparing trajectories andanswering queries of the form:“Report objects (ie; trajectories) that follow a similarspatiotemporal motion to Q; where Q is some query trajectory”. Each trajectory resides in itsentirety in-situ; which is cheaper and more efficient for mobile devices. Our SmartTracealgorithm then deploys a search algorithm that exploits distributed similarity measures toderive the most relevant answers to Q quickly and efficiently. We extend this approach toenable trajectory similarity services indoors by using location dependent information; suchas the magnitude of signals emitted by WLAN Access Points.,*,*,*
