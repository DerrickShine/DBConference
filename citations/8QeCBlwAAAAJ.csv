To this end; a functional magneticresonance imaging workflow was defined; which participants had to either simulate or run inorder to produce some provenance representation; from which a set of identified querieshad to be implemented and executed. Sixteen teams responded to the challenge; andsubmitted their inputs. In this paper; we present the challenge workflow and queries; andsummarize the participants' contributions.

Provenance in scientific workflow systems.,Susan B Davidson; Sarah Cohen Boulakia; Anat Eyal; Bertram Ludäscher; Timothy M McPhillips; Shawn Bowers; Manish Kumar Anand; Juliana Freire,Abstract The automated tracking and storage of provenance information promises to be amajor advantage of scientific workflow systems. We discuss issues related to data andworkflow provenance; and present techniques for focusing user attention on meaningfulprovenance through “user views;” for managing the provenance of nested scientific data;and for using information about the evolution of a workflow specification to understand thedifference in the provenance of similar data products.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2007,223
Querying and managing provenance through user views in scientific workflows,Olivier Biton; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Susan B Davidson; Carmem S Hara,Workflow systems have become increasingly popular for managing experiments wheremany bioinformatics tasks are chained together. Due to the large amount of data generatedby these experiments and the need for reproducible results; provenance has become ofparamount importance. Workflow systems are therefore starting to provide support forquerying provenance. However; the amount of provenance information may beoverwhelming; so there is a need for abstraction mechanisms to help users focus on themost relevant information. The technique we pursue is that of" user views". Sincebioinformatics tasks may themselves be complex sub-workflows; a user view determineswhat level of sub-workflow the user can see; and thus what data and tasks are visible inprovenance queries. In this paper; we formalize the notion of user views; demonstrate …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,148

For the past 30 years; new high-throughput technologies have been developedgenerating large amounts of data; distributed across many data sources on the Web; with ahigh degree of semantic heterogeneity and different levels of quality. However; one suchdataset is not; by itself; sufficient for scientific discovery. Instead; it must be combined withother data and processed by bioinformatics tools for patterns; similarities; and unusualoccurrences to be observed.

Towards a model of provenance and user views in scientific workflows,Shirley Cohen; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Susan Davidson,Abstract Scientific experiments are becoming increasingly large and complex; with acommensurate increase in the amount and complexity of data generated. Data; bothintermediate and final results; is derived by chaining and nesting together multiple databasesearches and analytical tools. In many cases; the means by which the data are produced isnot known; making the data difficult to interpret and the experiment impossible to reproduce.Provenance in scientific workflows is thus of paramount importance. In this paper; weprovide a formal model of provenance for scientific workflows which is general (ie can beused with existing workflow systems; such as Kepler; myGrid and Chimera) and sufficientlyexpressive to answer the provenance queries we encountered in a number of case studies.Interestingly; our model not only takes into account the chained and nested structure of …,Data Integration in the Life Sciences,2006,84
Differencing provenance in scientific workflows,Zhuowei Bao; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Susan B Davidson; Anat Eyal; Sanjeev Khanna,Scientific workflow management systems are increasingly providing the ability to manageand query the provenance of data products. However; the problem of differencing theprovenance of two data products produced by executions of the same specification has notbeen adequately addressed. Although this problem is NP-hard for general workflowspecifications; an analysis of real scientific (and business) workflows shows that theirspecifications can be captured as series-parallel graphs overlaid with well-nested forkingand looping. For this natural restriction; we present efficient; polynomial-time algorithms fordifferencing executions of the same specification and thereby understanding the differencein the provenance of their data products. We then describe a prototype called PDiffView builtaround our differencing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability of our …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Addressing the provenance challenge using zoom,Sarah Cohen‐Boulakia; Olivier Biton; Shirley Cohen; Susan Davidson,Abstract ZOOM* UserViews presents a model of provenance for scientific workflows that issimple; generic; and yet sufficiently expressive to answer questions of data and stepprovenance that have been encountered in a large variety of scientific case studies. Inaddition; ZOOM builds on the concept of composite step-classes—or sub-workflows—whichis present in many scientific workflow systems to develop a notion of user views. This paperdiscusses the design and implementation of ZOOM in the context of the queries posed bythe provenance challenge; and shows how user views affect the level of granularity at whichprovenance information can be seen and reasoned about.

We will show how user views can be used to reducethe amount of information returned by provenance queries; while focusing on information theuser finds relevant.

Search; adapt; and reuse: the future of scientific workflows,Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Ulf Leser,Abstract Over the last years; a number of scientific workflow management systems (SciWFM)have been brought to a state of maturity that should permit their usage in a production-styleenvironment. This is especially true for the Life Sciences; but SciWFM also attractconsiderable attention in fields like geophysics or climate research. These developments;accompanied by the growing availability of analytical tools wrapped as (web) services; weredriven by a series of very interesting promises: End users will be empowered to developtheir own pipelines; reuse of services will be enhanced by easier integration into customworkflows; time necessary for developing analysis pipelines will decrease; etc. But despiteall efforts; SciWFM have not yet found widespread acceptance in their intended audience. Inthis paper; we argue that a wider adoption of SciWFM will only be achieved if the focus of …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2011,53
BioGuideSRS: querying multiple sources with a user-centric perspective,Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Olivier Biton; Susan Davidson; Christine Froidevaux,Abstract Summary: Biologists are frequently faced with the problem of integrating informationfrom multiple heterogeneous sources with their own experimental data. Given the largenumber of public sources; it is difficult to choose which sources to integrate withoutassistance. When doing this manually; biologists differ in their preferences concerning thesources to be queried as well as the strategies; ie the querying process they follow fornavigating through the sources. In response to these findings; we have developed BioGuideto assist scientists search for relevant data within external sources while taking theirpreferences and strategies into account. In this article; we present BioGuideSRS; a user-friendly system which automatically retrieves instances of data by using BioGuide on top ofthe sequence retrieval system (SRS).

Proteome informatics II: bioinformatics for comparative proteomics,Frédérique Lisacek; Sarah Cohen‐Boulakia; Ron D Appel,Abstract The present review attempts to cover the most recent initiatives directed towardsrepresenting; storing; displaying and processing protein-related data suited to undertake“comparative proteomics” studies. Data interpretation is brought into focus. Efforts investedinto analysing and interpreting experimental data increasingly express the need for addingmeaning. This trend is perceptible in work dedicated to determining ontologies; modellinginteraction networks; etc. In parallel; technical advances in computer science are spurred bythe development of the Web and the growing need to channel and understand massivevolumes of data. Biology benefits from these advances as an application of choice for manygeneric solutions. Some examples of bioinformatics solutions are discussed and directionsfor on-going and future work conclude the review.,Proteomics,2006,43
Path-based systems to guide scientists in the maze of biological data sources,Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Susan Davidson; Christine Froidevaux; Zoé Lacroix; Maria-Esther Vidal,Fueled by novel technologies capable of producing massive amounts of data for a singleexperiment; scientists are faced with an explosion of information which must be rapidlyanalyzed and combined with other data to form hypotheses and create knowledge. Today;numerous biological questions can be answered without entering a wet lab. Scientificprotocols designed to answer these questions can be run entirely on a computer. Biologicalresources are often complementary; focused on different objects and reflecting variousexperts' points of view. Exploiting the richness and diversity of these resources is crucial forscientists. However; with the increase of resources; scientists have to face the problem ofselecting sources and tools when interpreting their data.

Similarity search for scientific workflows,Johannes Starlinger; Bryan Brancotte; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Ulf Leser,Abstract With the increasing popularity of scientific workflows; public repositories are gainingimportance as a means to share; find; and reuse such workflows. As the sizes of theserepositories grow; methods to compare the scientific workflows stored in them become anecessity; for instance; to allow duplicate detection or similarity search. Scientific workflowsare complex objects; and their comparison entails a number of distinct steps from comparingatomic elements to comparison of the workflows as a whole. Various studies haveimplemented methods for scientific workflow comparison and came up with oftencontradicting conclusions upon which algorithms work best. Comparing these results iscumbersome; as the original studies mixed different approaches for different steps and useddifferent evaluation data and metrics.

Selecting biomedical data sources according to user preferences,Sarah Cohen Boulakia; Séverine Lair; Nicolas Stransky; Stéphane Graziani; François Radvanyi; Emmanuel Barillot; Christine Froidevaux,Abstract Motivation: Biologists are now faced with the problem of integrating information frommultiple heterogeneous public sources with their own experimental data contained inindividual sources. The selection of the sources to be considered is thus critically important.Results: Our aim is to support biologists by developing a module based on an algorithm thatpresents a selection of sources relevant to their query and matched to their own preferences.We approached this task by investigating the characteristics of biomedical data andintroducing several preference criteria useful for bioinformaticians. This work was carried outin the framework of a project which aims to develop an integrative platform for the multipleparametric analysis of cancer.

Their programming model appeals to bioinformaticians; whocan use them to easily specify complex data processing pipelines. Such a model isunderpinned by a graph structure; where nodes represent bioinformatics tasks and linksrepresent the dataflow. The complexity of such graph structures is increasing over time; withpossible impacts on scientific workflows reuse. In this work; we propose effective methodsfor workflow design; with a focus on the Taverna model.

Privacy issues in scientific workflow provenance,Susan B Davidson; Sanjeev Khanna; Sudeepa Roy; Sarah Cohen Boulakia,Abstract A scientific workflow often deals with proprietary modules as well as private orconfidential data; such as health or medical information. Hence providing exact answers toprovenance queries over all executions of the workflow may reveal private information. Inthis paper we first study the potential privacy issues in a scientific workflow--module privacy;data privacy; and provenance privacy; and frame several natural questions:(i) can weformally analyze module; data or provenance privacy giving provable privacy guarantees foran unlimited/bounded number of provenance queries?(ii) how can we answer provenancequeries; providing as much information as possible to the user while still guaranteeing therequired privacy? Then we look at module privacy in detail and propose a formal model fromour recent work in [11]. Finally we point to several directions for future work.,Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Workflow Approaches to New Data-centric Science,2010,19
(Re) use in public scientific workflow repositories,Johannes Starlinger; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Ulf Leser,Abstract Scientific workflows help in designing; managing; monitoring; and executing in-silico experiments. Since scientific workflows often are complex; sharing them by means ofpublic workflow repositories has become an important issue for the community. However;due to the increasing numbers of workflows available in such repositories; users have acrucial need for assistance in discovering the right workflow for a given task. To this end;identification of functional elements shared between workflows as a first step to derivemeaningful similarity measures for workflows is a key point. In this paper; we present theresults of a study we performed on the probably largest open workflow repository;myExperiment. org.

Layer decomposition: An effective structure-based approach for scientific workflow similarity,Johannes Starlinger; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Sanjeev Khanna; Susan B Davidson; Ulf Leser,Scientific workflows have become a valuable tool for large-scale data processing andanalysis. This has led to the creation of specialized online repositories to facilitate workflowsharing and reuse. Over time; these repositories have grown to sizes that call for advancedmethods to support workflow discovery; in particular for effective similarity search. Here; wepresent a novel and intuitive workflow similarity measure that is based on layerdecomposition. Layer decomposition accounts for the directed dataflow underlying scientificworkflows; a property which has not been adequately considered in previous methods. Wecomparatively evaluate our algorithm using a gold standard for 24 query workflows from arepository of almost 1500 scientific workflows; and show that it a) delivers the best results forsimilarity search; b) has a much lower runtime than other; often highly complex …,e-Science (e-Science); 2014 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2014,15
Using medians to generate consensus rankings for biological data,Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Alain Denise; Sylvie Hamel,Abstract Faced with the deluge of data available in biological databases; it becomesincreasingly difficult for scientists to obtain reasonable sets of answers to their biologicalqueries. A critical example appears in medicine; where physicians frequently need to getinformation about genes associated with a given disease. When they pose such queries toWeb portals (eg; Entrez NCBI) they usually get huge amounts of answers which are notranked; making them very difficult to be exploited. In the last years; while several rankingapproaches have been proposed; none of them is considered as the most promising.Instead of considering ranking methods as alternative approaches; we propose to generatea consensus ranking to highlight the common points of a set of rankings while minimizingtheir disagreements.

Next generation data integration for Life Sciences,Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Ulf Leser,Ever since the advent of high-throughput biology (eg; the Human Genome Project);integrating the large number of diverse biological data sets has been considered as one ofthe most important tasks for advancement in the biological sciences. Whereas the early daysof research in this area were dominated by virtual integration systems (such as multi-/federated databases); the current predominantly used architecture uses materialization.Systems are built using ad-hoc techniques and a large amount of scripting. However; recentyears have seen a shift in the understanding of what a “data integration system” actuallyshould do; revitalizing research in this direction.

PDiffView: Viewing the difference in provenance of workflow results,Zhuowei Bao; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Susan B Davidson; Pierrick Girard,Abstract Scientific workflow systems are becoming increasingly important for managing in-silico experiments. Such experiments are typically specified as directed flow graphs; inwhich the nodes represent modules and edges represent data flow between the modules.Each execution (aka run) of an experiment may vary the parameters and data inputs to themodules in the specification; furthermore; alternative paths of the workflow may be followed.In this process; the scientist's goal is to identify parameter settings and approaches whichlead to good final results. Comparing workflow executions of the same specification andunderstanding the difference between them is thus of paramount importance forunderstanding the provenance of final results [4].,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,12

Toaddress this problem; we have designed BioGuide1; a user-centric framework that helpsscientists choose sources and tools according to their preferences and strategy; byspecifying queries through a user-friendly visual interface. In this paper; we provide acomplete RDF representation of BioGuide and introduce XPR (eXtensible Path language forRDF); an extension of FSL2 that is expressive enough to model all BioGuide queries.BioGuide queries modeled as XPR expressions can then be saved; compared; evaluatedand exchanged through the Web between users and applications.,*,2006,10

Challenges; in particular incontext of climate change and food security; are numerous. High-throughput platforms havebeen introduced to observe the dynamic growth of a large number of plants in differentenvironmental conditions. Instead of considering a few genotypes at a time (as it is the casewhen phenomic traits are measured manually); such platforms make it possible to usecompletely new kinds of approaches. However; the datasets produced by such widelyinstrumented platforms are huge; constantly augmenting and produced by increasinglycomplex experiments; reaching a point where distributed computation is mandatory toextract knowledge from data.

Gene List significance at-a-glance with GeneValorization,Bryan Brancotte; Anne Biton; Isabelle Bernard-Pierrot; François Radvanyi; Fabien Reyal; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia,Abstract Motivation: High-throughput technologies provide fundamental informationsconcerning thousands of genes. Many of the current research laboratories daily use one ormore of these technologies and end-up with lists of genes. Assessing the originality of theresults obtained includes being aware of the number of publications available concerningindividual or multiple genes and accessing information about these publications. Faced withthe exponential growth of publications avaliable and number of genes involved in a study;this task is becoming particularly difficult to achieve.

Various studies haveimplemented methods for rank aggregation and may have come up with contradictingconclusions upon which algorithms work best. Comparing such results is cumbersome; asthe original studies mixed different approaches and used very different evaluation datasetsand metrics. Additionally; in real applications; the rankings to be aggregated may not bepermutations where elements are strictly ordered; but they may have ties where someelements are placed at the same position. However; most of the studies have not consideredties. This paper introduces the first large scale study of algorithms for rank aggregation withties.

Such alternative reformulations are then used to rank the queryresults using a new consensus ranking strategy.

We highlight recent work in this area onuser views; showing how they can be efficiently computed given user input on relevance; orand how pre-existing views can be corrected to provide accurate provenance information.We also discuss how to search a repository of workflow specifications and their views;returning workflows at an appropriate level of complexity with respect to a hierarchy of …,SWPM,2009,3
Biobrowsing: Making the most of the data available in Entrez,Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Kevin Masini,Abstract One of the most popular ways to access public biological data is using portals; likeEntrez (NCBI) which allows users to navigate through the data of 34 major biologicalsources following cross-references. In this process; data entries are inspected one after theother and cross-references to additional data available in other sources may be followed.This navigational process may be time-consuming and may not be easily reproduced fromone entry to another. Most importantly; only a few sources are initially queried; biologists donot exploit all the richness of the data provided by Entrez; and in particular they may notexplore alternative source paths that provide complementary information.

Review of the selected proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Data Integration in the Life Sciences 2008,Amos Bairoch; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Christine Froidevaux,Background For several years now; there has been an exponential growth of the amount oflife science data (eg; sequenced complete genomes; 3D structures; DNA chips; Massspectroscopy data) most of which are generated by high throughput experiments. Thisexponential corpus of data is stored and made available through a large number ofdatabases and resources over the web; but unfortunately still with a high degree of semanticheterogeneity and varying levels of quality. These data must be combined together andprocessed by bioinformatics tools deployed on powerful and efficient platforms to permit theuncovering of patterns; similarities and in general to help in the process of discovery.Analysing complex; voluminous; and heterogeneous data and guiding the analysis of dataare thus of paramount importance and necessitate the involvement of data integration …,*,2008,2
Bioguidesrs: Querying multiple sources with a user perspective,Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Olivier Biton; Christine Froidevaux,Abstract: Biologists are faced with the problem of integrating information from multipleheterogeneous public sources with their own experimental data contained in individualsources. It is difficult for them to choose between the numerous sources without assistance.Interestingly; biologists not only express preferences concerning the sources to be queriedbut also differ in their strategies ie the querying process they follow for navigating throughthe sources. In [3] we have introduced BioGuide; as a user-centric framework that allows tospecify various querying processes and takes into account user preferences on the sources.In this paper; we present BioGuideSRS; a user-friendly system which accesses instances ofdata by using BioGuide on top of the SRS system.

Sharq guide: Finding relevant biological data and queries in a peer data management system,Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Olivier Biton; Shirley Cohen; Zachary Ives; Val Tannen; Susan Davidson,Scientists are now faced with an explosion of information which must be rapidly analyzed toform hypotheses and create knowledge. A major challenge lies in how to effectively shareinformation among collaborating; yet autonomous; biological partners. These partners arepeers in the sense that they have a diversity of perspectives (and hence heterogeneous andcomplementary schemas); dynamic data; and the possibility of intermittent connectivity orparticipation. SHARQ (Sharing Heterogeneous and Autonomous Resources and Queries) isa collaborative project between the database group at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn)and two biological research groups from Penn Center for Bioinformatics and the Children'sHospital of Philadelphia.

This first implies the automation of the measurement of a large number of traitsto characterize plant growth; plant development and plant functioning. It also requires afluent and versatile interaction between data and continuously evolving plant responsemodels; that are essential in the analysis of the marker x environment interaction and in theintegration of processes for predicting crop performance [1].

DistillFlow: removing redundancy in scientific workflows,Jiuqiang Chen; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia; Christine Froidevaux; Carole Goble; Paolo Missier; Alan R Williams,Abstract Scientific workflows management systems are increasingly used by scientists tospecify complex data processing pipelines. Workflows are represented using a graphstructure; where nodes represent tasks and links represent the dataflow. However; thecomplexity of workflow structures is increasing over time; reducing the rate of scientificworkflows reuse. Here; we introduce DistillFlow; a tool based on effective methods forworkflow design; with a focus on the Taverna model. DistillFlow is able to detect" anti-patterns" in the structure of workflows (idiomatic forms that lead to over-complicated design)and replace them with different patterns to reduce the workflow's overall structuralcomplexity. Rewriting workflows in this way is beneficial both in terms of user experienceand workflow maintenance.,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,1
Distilling structure in scientific workflows,Juiqiang Chen; Christine Froidevaux; Carole Goble; Alan R Williams; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia,Methods Our study has been conducted on a set of 1;014 distinct workflows extracted fromthe Taverna workflows available in myExperiment in May 2012. We have implemented thealgorithm of (Valdes et al.; 1979) to detect whether workflow graphs are SP. Intuitively; SPstructures are graph structures having one main input (I in figure 1 (a)) and one main output(O in Figure 1 (a)); without loops and which can be synchronized. In particular the patternhighlighted in Figure 1 (b) is forbidden (in this pattern; arcs can be replaced by pathsinvolving intermediate nodes). In this pattern; node w is responsible for the graph non to beSP. Such a node is called a reduction node (Bein et al.; 1992) and is duplicated in SPFlow.In the workflow depicted in Figure 1 (a) the getGeneInfo processor is a reduction node sothat the workflow is not SP. Among the 390 workflows with non SP structures (38; 5%); we …,EMBnet. journal,2012,1

Preferences for queries in a mediator approach,Alain Bidault; Sarah Cohen Boulakia; Christine Froidevaux,Abstract. The problem of integrating relevant information obtained from multipleheterogeneous sources is a complex task; with which biologists are now faced. In this paper;we address the problem of querying biomedical databases in a mediator context. Wepropose to exploit the metadata of the sources to take into account user preferences. Themediator system we present is designed within a tractable logical framework. It allows bothtransparent and cooperative querying and makes it possible to keep track of the origins ofthe instances provided as answers. Our proposal is generic in that it is relevant not only forbioinformatics; but could also be applied to other domains for which metadata are available.,Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2004,*

On Provenance and Reuse of scientific workflows to analyze big biological data,Sarah Cohen-Boulakia,Typical analysis processes in the Life Sciences are complex; multi-staged; and large. One ofthe most important challenges is to properly represent; manage; and execute such in-silicoexperiments. As a response to these needs; scientific workflow management systems havebeen introduced. They provide an environment to guide a scientific analysis process fromdesign to execution. This area is largely driven by the bioinformatics community and alsoattracts attention in fields like geophysics or climate research. In a scientific workflow; theanalysis processes are represented at a high level of abstraction which enhances flexibility;reuse; and modularity while allowing for optimization; parallelization; provenance tracking;debugging etc. Differences with business and ETL workflows have been studied extensively[7]: scientific workflows have building blocks which are complex user-defined functions …,*,*,*
