Snowball: Extracting relations from large plain-text collections,Eugene Agichtein; Luis Gravano,Abstract Text documents often contain valuable structured data that is hidden Yin regularEnglish sentences. This data is best exploited infavailable as arelational table that we coulduse for answering precise queries or running data mining tasks. We explore a technique forextracting such tables from document collections that requires only a handful of trainingexamples from users. These examples are used to generate extraction patterns; that in turnresult in new tuples being extracted from the document collection. We build on this idea andpresent our Snowball system. Snowball introduces novel strategies for generating patternsand extracting tuples from plain-text documents. At each iteration of the extraction process;Snowball evaluates the quality of these patterns and tuples without human intervention; andkeeps only the most reliable ones for the next iteration. In this paper we also develop a …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries,2000,1353
Finding high-quality content in social media,Eugene Agichtein; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis; Gilad Mishne,Abstract The quality of user-generated content varies drastically from excellent to abuse andspam. As the availability of such content increases; the task of identifying high-qualitycontent sites based on user contributions--social media sites--becomes increasinglyimportant. Social media in general exhibit a rich variety of information sources: in addition tothe content itself; there is a wide array of non-content information available; such as linksbetween items and explicit quality ratings from members of the community. In this paper weinvestigate methods for exploiting such community feedback to automatically identify highquality content. As a test case; we focus on Yahoo! Answers; a large communityquestion/answering portal that is particularly rich in the amount and types of content andsocial interactions available in it. We introduce a general classification framework for …,Proceedings of the 2008 international conference on web search and data mining,2008,1247
Improving web search ranking by incorporating user behavior information,Eugene Agichtein; Eric Brill; Susan Dumais,Abstract We show that incorporating user behavior data can significantly improve ordering oftop results in real web search setting. We examine alternatives for incorporating feedbackinto the ranking process and explore the contributions of user feedback compared to othercommon web search features. We report results of a large scale evaluation over 3;000queries and 12 million user interactions with a popular web search engine. We show thatincorporating implicit feedback can augment other features; improving the accuracy of acompetitive web search ranking algorithms by as much as 31% relative to the originalperformance.,Proceedings of the 29th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2006,1121
Learning user interaction models for predicting web search result preferences,Eugene Agichtein; Eric Brill; Susan Dumais; Robert Ragno,Abstract Evaluating user preferences of web search results is crucial for search enginedevelopment; deployment; and maintenance. We present a real-world study of modeling thebehavior of web search users to predict web search result preferences. Accurate modelingand interpretation of user behavior has important applications to ranking; click spamdetection; web search personalization; and other tasks. Our key insight to improvingrobustness of interpreting implicit feedback is to model query-dependent deviations from theexpected" noisy" user behavior. We show that our model of clickthrough interpretationimproves prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art clickthrough methods. We generalize ourapproach to model user behavior beyond clickthrough; which results in higher preferenceprediction accuracy than models based on clickthrough information alone. We report …,Proceedings of the 29th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2006,539
Discovering authorities in question answer communities by using link analysis,Pawel Jurczyk; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Question-Answer portals such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers are quickly becomingrich sources of knowledge on many topics which are not well served by general web searchengines. Unfortunately; the quality of the submitted answers is uneven; ranging fromexcellent detailed answers to snappy and insulting remarks or even advertisements forcommercial content. Furthermore; user feedback for many topics is sparse; and can beinsufficient to reliably identify good answers from the bad ones. Hence; estimating theauthority of users is a crucial task for this emerging domain; with potential applications toanswer ranking; spam detection; and incentive mechanism design. We present an analysisof the link structure of a general-purpose question answering community to discoverauthoritative users; and promising experimental results over a dataset of more than 3 …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,371
Exploiting diverse knowledge sources via maximum entropy in named entity recognition,Andrew Borthwick; John Sterling; Eugene Agichtein; Ralph Grishman,Abstract This paper describes a novel statistical namedentity (ie" proper name") recognitionsystem built around a maximum entity framework. By working v; ithin the framework ofmaximum entropy theory and utilizing a flexible object-based architecture; the system is ableto make use of an extraordinarily diverse range of knowledge sources in making its taggingdecisions. These knowledge sources include capitalization features; lexical features;features indicating the current section of text (ie headline or main body); and dictionaries ofsingle or multi-word terms. The purely statistical system contains no hand-generatedpatterns and achieves a result comparable with the best statistical systems. However; whencombined with other handcoded systems; the system achieves scores that exceed thehighest comparable scores thus-far published.,Sixth Workshop on Very Large Corpora,1998,276
Finding the right facts in the crowd: factoid question answering over social media,Jiang Bian; Yandong Liu; Eugene Agichtein; Hongyuan Zha,Abstract Community Question Answering has emerged as a popular and effective paradigmfor a wide range of information needs. For example; to find out an obscure piece of trivia; it isnow possible and even very effective to post a question on a popular community QA sitesuch as Yahoo! Answers; and to rely on other users to provide answers; often withinminutes. The importance of such community QA sites is magnified as they create archives ofmillions of questions and hundreds of millions of answers; many of which are invaluable forthe information needs of other searchers. However; to make this immense body ofknowledge accessible; effective answer retrieval is required. In particular; as any user cancontribute an answer to a question; the majority of the content reflects personal; oftenunsubstantiated opinions. A ranking that combines both relevance and quality is required …,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web,2008,272
Predicting information seeker satisfaction in community question answering,Yandong Liu; Jiang Bian; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Question answering communities such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers haveemerged as popular; and often effective; means of information seeking on the web. Byposting questions for other participants to answer; information seekers can obtain specificanswers to their questions. Users of popular portals such as Yahoo! Answers already havesubmitted millions of questions and received hundreds of millions of answers from otherparticipants. However; it may also take hours--and sometime days--until a satisfactoryanswer is posted. In this paper we introduce the problem of predicting information seekersatisfaction in collaborative question answering communities; where we attempt to predictwhether a question author will be satisfied with the answers submitted by the communityparticipants. We present a general prediction model; and develop a variety of content …,Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2008,263
NYU: Description of the MENE named entity system as used in MUC-7,Andrew Borthwick; John Sterling; Eugene Agichtein; Ralph Grishman,This paper describes a new system called Maximum Entropy Named Entity" or MENE"pronounced meanie" which was NYU's entrant in the MUC-7 named entity evaluation. Byworking within the framework of maximum entropy theory and utilizing a flexible object-based architecture; the system is able to make use of an extraordinarily diverse range ofknowledge sources in making its tagging decisions. These knowledge sources includecapitalization features; lexical features and features indicating the current type of text ieheadline or main body. It makes use of a broad array of dictionaries of useful single or multi-word terms such as first names; company names; and corporate suffixes. These dictionariesrequired no manual editing and were either downloaded from the web or were simplyobvious" lists entered by hand.

A word at a time: computing word relatedness using temporal semantic analysis,Kira Radinsky; Eugene Agichtein; Evgeniy Gabrilovich; Shaul Markovitch,Abstract Computing the degree of semantic relatedness of words is a key functionality ofmany language applications such as search; clustering; and disambiguation. Previousapproaches to computing semantic relatedness mostly used static language resources;while essentially ignoring their temporal aspects. We believe that a considerable amount ofrelatedness information can also be found in studying patterns of word usage over time.Consider; for instance; a newspaper archive spanning many years. Two words such as" war"and" peace" might rarely co-occur in the same articles; yet their patterns of use over timemight be similar. In this paper; we propose a new semantic relatedness model; TemporalSemantic Analysis (TSA); which captures this temporal information. The previous state of theart method; Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA); represented word semantics as a vector of …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web,2011,249
Learning search engine specific query transformations for question answering,Eugene Agichtein; Steve Lawrence; Luis Gravano,ABSTRACT We introduce a method for learning query transformations that improves theability to retrieve answers to questions from an information retrieval system. During thetraining stage the method involves automatically learning phrase features for classifyingquestions into different types; automatically generating candidate query transformations froma training set of question/answer pairs; and automatically evaluating the candidatetransforms on target information retrieval systems such as real-world general purposesearch engines. At run time; questions are transformed into a set of queries; and re-rankingis performed on the documents retrieved. We present a prototype search engine; Tritus; thatapplies the method to web search engines.

Learning to recognize reliable users and content in social media with coupled mutual reinforcement,Jiang Bian; Yandong Liu; Ding Zhou; Eugene Agichtein; Hongyuan Zha,Abstract Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular forum for usersto pose questions for other users to answer. Over the last few years; CQA portals such asNaver and Yahoo! Answers have exploded in popularity; and now provide a viablealternative to general purpose Web search. At the same time; the answers to past questionssubmitted in CQA sites comprise a valuable knowledge repository which could be a goldmine for information retrieval and automatic question answering. Unfortunately; the quality ofthe submitted questions and answers varies widely-increasingly so that a large fraction ofthe content is not usable for answering queries. Previous approaches for retrieving relevantand high quality content have been proposed; but they require large amounts of manuallylabeled data--which limits the applicability of the supervised approaches to new sites and …,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,168
Mining reference tables for automatic text segmentation,Eugene Agichtein; Venkatesh Ganti,Abstract Automatically segmenting unstructured text strings into structured records isnecessary for importing the information contained in legacy sources and text collections intoa data warehouse for subsequent querying; analysis; mining and integration. In this paper;we mine tables present in data warehouses and relational databases to develop anautomatic segmentation system. Thus; we overcome limitations of existing supervised textsegmentation approaches; which require comprehensive manually labeled training data.Our segmentation system is robust; accurate; and efficient; and requires no additionalmanual effort. Thorough evaluation on real datasets demonstrates the robustness andaccuracy of our system; with segmentation accuracy exceeding state of the art supervisedapproaches.,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,156
Querying text databases for efficient information extraction,Eugene Agichtein; Luis Gravano,A wealth of information is hidden within unstructured text. This information is often bestexploited in structured or relational form; which is suited for sophisticated query processing;for integration with relational databases; and for data mining. Current information extractiontechniques extract relations from a text database by examining every document in thedatabase; or use filters to select promising documents for extraction. The exhaustivescanning approach is not practical or even feasible for large databases; and the currentfiltering techniques require human involvement to maintain and to adapt to new databasesand domains. We develop an automatic query-based technique to retrieve documents usefulfor the extraction of user-defined relations from large text databases; which can be adaptedto new domains; databases; or target relations with minimal human effort. We report a …,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,141
The influence of caption features on clickthrough patterns in web search,Charles LA Clarke; Eugene Agichtein; Susan Dumais; Ryen W White,Abstract Web search engines present lists of captions; comprising title; snippet; and URL; tohelp users decide which search results to visit. Understanding the influence of features ofthese captions on Web search behavior may help validate algorithms and guidelines fortheir improved generation. In this paper we develop a methodology to use clickthrough logsfrom a commercial search engine to study user behavior when interacting with search resultcaptions. The findings of our study suggest that relatively simple caption features such as thepresence of all terms query terms; the readability of the snippet; and the length of the URLshown in the caption; can significantly influence users' Web search behavior.,Proceedings of the 30th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2007,135
Ready to buy or just browsing?: detecting web searcher goals from interaction data,Qi Guo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract An improved understanding of the relationship between search intent; result quality;and searcher behavior is crucial for improving the effectiveness of web search. While recentprogress in user behavior mining has been largely focused on aggregate server-side clicklogs; we present a new class of search behavior models that also exploit fine-grained userinteractions with the search results. We show that mining these interactions; such as mousemovements and scrolling; can enable more effective detection of the user's search goals.Potential applications include automatic search evaluation; improving search ranking; resultpresentation; and search advertising. We describe extensive experimental evaluation overboth controlled user studies; and logs of interaction data collected from hundreds of realusers. The results show that our method is more effective than the current state-of-the-art …,Proceedings of the 33rd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2010,129
Extracting synonymous gene and protein terms from biological literature,Hong Yu; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Motivation: Genes and proteins are often associated with multiple names. Morenames are added as new functional or structural information is discovered. Because authorscan use any one of the known names for a gene or protein; information retrieval andextraction would benefit from identifying the gene and protein terms that are synonyms of thesame substance. Results: We have explored four complementary approaches for extractinggene and protein synonyms from text; namely the unsupervised; partially supervised; andsupervised machine-learning techniques; as well as the manual knowledge-basedapproach. We report results of a large scale evaluation of these alternatives over an archiveof biological journal articles. Our evaluation shows that our extraction techniques could be avaluable supplement to resources such as SWISSPROT; as our systems were able to …,Bioinformatics,2003,121
TM-LDA: efficient online modeling of latent topic transitions in social media,Yu Wang; Eugene Agichtein; Michele Benzi,Abstract Latent topic analysis has emerged as one of the most effective methods forclassifying; clustering and retrieving textual data. However; existing models such as LatentDirichlet Allocation (LDA) were developed for static corpora of relatively large documents. Incontrast; much of the textual content on the web; and especially social media; is temporallysequenced; and comes in short fragments; including microblog posts on sites such asTwitter and Weibo; status updates on social networking sites such as Facebook andLinkedIn; or comments on content sharing sites such as YouTube. In this paper we proposea novel topic model; Temporal-LDA or TM-LDA; for efficiently mining text streams such as asequence of posts from the same author; by modeling the topic transitions that naturallyarise in these data. TM-LDA learns the transition parameters among topics by minimizing …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,120
Find it if you can: a game for modeling different types of web search success using interaction data,Mikhail Ageev; Qi Guo; Dmitry Lagun; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract A better understanding of strategies and behavior of successful searchers is crucialfor improving the experience of all searchers. However; research of search behavior hasbeen struggling with the tension between the relatively small-scale; but controlled labstudies; and the large-scale log-based studies where the searcher intent and many otherimportant factors have to be inferred. We present our solution for performing controlled; yetrealistic; scalable; and reproducible studies of searcher behavior. We focus on difficultinformational tasks; which tend to frustrate many users of the current web search technology.First; we propose a principled formalization of different types of" success" for informationalsearch; which encapsulate and sharpen previously proposed models. Second; we present ascalable game-like infrastructure for crowdsourcing search behavior studies; specifically …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,115
Beyond dwell time: estimating document relevance from cursor movements and other post-click searcher behavior,Qi Guo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Result clickthrough statistics and dwell time on clicked results have been shownvaluable for inferring search result relevance; but the interpretation of these signals can varysubstantially for different tasks and users. This paper shows that that post-click searcherbehavior; such as cursor movement and scrolling; provides additional clues for betterestimating document relevance. To this end; we identify patterns of examination andinteraction behavior that correspond to viewing a relevant or non-relevant document; anddesign a new Post-Click Behavior (PCB) model to capture these patterns. To our knowledge;PCB is the first to successfully incorporate post-click searcher interactions such as cursormovements and scrolling on a landing page for estimating document relevance. Weevaluate PCB on a dataset collected from a controlled user study that contains …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,111
To search or to crawl?: towards a query optimizer for text-centric tasks,Panagiotis G Ipeirotis; Eugene Agichtein; Pranay Jain; Luis Gravano,Abstract Text is ubiquitous and; not surprisingly; many important applications rely on textualdata for a variety of tasks. As a notable example; information extraction applications derivestructured relations from unstructured text; as another example; focused crawlers explore theweb to locate pages about specific topics. Execution plans for text-centric tasks follow twogeneral paradigms for processing a text database: either we can scan; or'crawl;" the textdatabase or; alternatively; we can exploit search engine indexes and retrieve the documentsof interest via carefully crafted queries constructed in task-specific ways. The choicebetween crawl-and query-based execution plans can have a substantial impact on bothexecution time and output" completeness"(eg; in terms of recall). Nevertheless; this choice istypically ad-hoc and based on heuristics or plain intuition.

Towards predicting web searcher gaze position from mouse movements,Qi Guo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract A key problem in information retrieval is inferring the searcher's interest in theresults; which can be used for implicit feedback; query suggestion; and result ranking andsummarization. One important indicator of searcher interest is gaze position-that is; theresults or the terms in a result listing where a searcher concentrates her attention. Capturingthis information normally requires eye tracking equipment; which until now has limited theuse of gaze-based feedback to the laboratory. While previous research has reported acorrelation between mouse movement and gaze position; we are not aware of previous workon automatically inferring searcher's gaze position from mouse movement or similarinterface interactions. In this paper; we report the first results on automatically inferringwhether the searcher's gaze position is coordinated with the mouse position-a crucial …,CHI'10 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2010,99
Classifying and characterizing query intent,Azin Ashkan; Charles LA Clarke; Eugene Agichtein; Qi Guo,Abstract Understanding the intent underlying users' queries may help personalize searchresults and improve user satisfaction. In this paper; we develop a methodology for using adclickthrough logs; query specific information; and the content of search engine result pagesto study characteristics of query intents; specially commercial intent. The findings of ourstudy suggest that ad clickthrough features; query features; and the content of search engineresult pages are together effective in detecting query intent. We also study the effect of querytype and the number of displayed ads on the average clickthrough rate. As a practicalapplication of our work; we show that modeling query intent can improve the accuracy ofpredicting ad clickthrough for previously unseen queries.,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2009,82
Exploring mouse movements for inferring query intent,Qi Guo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Clickthrough on search results have been successfully used to infer user interestand preferences; but are often noisy and potentially ambiguous. We explore the potential ofa complementary; more sensitive signal-mouse movements-in providing insights into theintent behind a web search query. We report preliminary results of studying user mousemovements on search result pages; with the goal of inferring user intent-in particular; toexplore whether we can automatically distinguish the different query classes such asnavigational vs. informational. Our preliminary exploration confirms the value of studyingmouse movements for user intent inference; and suggests interesting avenues for futureexploration.,Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2008,82
Hits on question answer portals: exploration of link analysis for author ranking,Pawel Jurczyk; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Question-Answer portals such as Naver and Yahoo!

However; despite the increased popularity; the quality of answers is uneven; andwhile some users usually provide good answers; many others often provide bad answers.Hence; estimating the authority; or the expected quality of users; is a crucial task for thisemerging domain; with potential applications to answer ranking and to incentive mechanismdesign. We adapt a powerful link analysis methodology from the web domain as a first steptowards estimating authority in Question Answer portals.

Snowball: A prototype system for extracting relations from large text collections,Eugene Agichtein; Luis Gravano; Jeff Pavel; Viktoriya Sokolova; Aleksandr Voskoboynik,Text documents often hide valuable structured data. For example; a collection of newspaperarticles might contain information on the location of the headquarters of a number oforganizations. If we need to find the location of the headquarters of; say; Microsoft; we couldtry and use traditional information-retrieval techniques for finding documents that contain theanswer to our query. Alternatively; we could answer such a query more precisely if wesomehow had available a table listing all the organization-location pairs that are mentionedin our document collection. One could view the extraction process as automatically buildinga materialized view over the unstructured text data. In this demo we present an interactiveprototype of our Snowball system for extracting relations from collections of plain-textdocuments with minimal human participation. Our method builds on the DIPRE idea …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,75

By posting questions for other participants to answer; information seekers can obtainspecific answers to their questions. Users of CQA portals have already contributed millionsof questions; and received hundreds of millions of answers from other participants.

Identifying best bet web search results by mining past user behavior,Eugene Agichtein; Zijian Zheng,Abstract The top web search result is crucial for user satisfaction with the web searchexperience. We argue that the importance of the relevance at the top position necessitatesspecial handling of the top web search result for some queries. We propose an effectiveapproach of leveraging millions of past user interactions with a web search engine toautomatically detect" best bet" top results preferred by majority of users. Interestingly; thisproblem can be more effectively addressed with classification than using state-of-the-artgeneral ranking methods. Furthermore; we show that our general machine learningapproach achieves precision comparable to a heavily tuned; domain-specific algorithm; withsignificantly higher coverage. Our experiments over millions of user interactions forthousands of queries demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our techniques.,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,71
A few bad votes too many?: towards robust ranking in social media,Jiang Bian; Yandong Liu; Eugene Agichtein; Hongyuan Zha,Abstract Online social media draws heavily on active reader participation; such as voting orrating of news stories; articles; or responses to a question. This user feedback is invaluablefor ranking; filtering; and retrieving high quality content-tasks that are crucial with theexplosive amount of social content on the web. Unfortunately; as social media moves intothe mainstream and gains in popularity; the quality of the user feedback degrades. Some ofthis is due to noise; but; increasingly; a small fraction of malicious users are trying to" gamethe system" by selectively promoting or demoting content for profit; or fun. Hence; aneffective ranking of social media content must be robust to noise in the user interactions; andin particular to vote spam.

Exploring question subjectivity prediction in community QA,Baoli Li; Yandong Liu; Ashwin Ram; Ernest V Garcia; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract In this paper we begin to investigate how to automatically determine the subjectivityorientation of questions posted by real users in community question answering (CQA)portals. Subjective questions seek answers containing private states; such as personalopinion and experience. In contrast; objective questions request objective; verifiableinformation; often with support from reliable sources. Knowing the question orientationwould be helpful not only for evaluating answers provided by users; but also for guiding theCQA engine to process questions more intelligently.

Predicting web searcher satisfaction with existing community-based answers,Qiaoling Liu; Eugene Agichtein; Gideon Dror; Evgeniy Gabrilovich; Yoelle Maarek; Dan Pelleg; Idan Szpektor,Abstract Community-based Question Answering (CQA) sites; such as Yahoo! Answers;Baidu Knows; Naver; and Quora; have been rapidly growing in popularity. The resultingarchives of posted answers to questions; in Yahoo! Answers alone; already exceed in size 1billion; and are aggressively indexed by web search engines. In fact; a large number ofsearch engine users benefit from these archives; by finding existing answers that addresstheir own queries. This scenario poses new challenges and opportunities for both searchengines and CQA sites. To this end; we formulate a new problem of predicting thesatisfaction of web searchers with CQA answers. We analyze a large number of websearches that result in a visit to a popular CQA site; and identify unique characteristics ofsearcher satisfaction in this setting; namely; the effects of query clarity; query-to-question …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,60
Mining touch interaction data on mobile devices to predict web search result relevance,Qi Guo; Haojian Jin; Dmitry Lagun; Shuai Yuan; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Fine-grained search interactions in the desktop setting; such as mouse cursormovements and scrolling; have been shown valuable for understanding user intent;attention; and their preferences for Web search results. As web search on smart phones andtablets becomes increasingly popular; previously validated desktop interaction models haveto be adapted for the available touch interactions such as pinching and swiping; and for thedifferent device form factors. In this paper; we present; to our knowledge; the first in-depthstudy of modeling interactions on touch-enabled device for improving Web search ranking.In particular; we evaluate a variety of touch interactions on a smart phone as implicitrelevance feedback; and compare them with the corresponding fine-grained interactions ona desktop computer with mouse and keyboard as the primary input devices.

Search; interrupted: understanding and predicting search task continuation,Eugene Agichtein; Ryen W White; Susan T Dumais; Paul N Bennet,Abstract Many important search tasks require multiple search sessions to complete. Taskssuch as travel planning; large purchases; or job searches can span hours; days; or evenweeks. Inevitably; life interferes; requiring the searcher either to recover the" state" of thesearch manually (most common); or plan for interruption in advance (unlikely). The goal ofthis work is to better understand; characterize; and automatically detect search tasks that willbe continued in the near future. To this end; we analyze a query log from the Bing Websearch engine to identify the types of intents; topics; and search behavior patternsassociated with long-running tasks that are likely to be continued. Using our insights; wedevelop an effective prediction algorithm that significantly outperforms both the previousstate-of-the-art method; and even the ability of human judges; to predict future task …,Proceedings of the 35th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2012,53

Scaling Information Extraction to Large Document Collections.,Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Information extraction and text mining applications are just beginning to tap theimmense amounts of valuable textual information available online. In order to extractinformation from millions; and in some cases; billions of documents; different solutions toscalability emerged. We review key approaches for scaling up information extraction;including using general-purpose search engines as well as indexing techniques specializedfor information extraction applications. Scalable information extraction is an active area ofresearch; and we highlight some of the opportunities and challenges in this area that arerelevant to the database community.,IEEE Data Eng.

Viewser: Enabling large-scale remote user studies of web search examination and interaction,Dmitry Lagun; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Web search behaviour studies; including eye-tracking studies of search resultexamination; have resulted in numerous insights to improve search result quality andpresentation. Yet; eye tracking studies have been restricted in scale; due to the expense andthe effort required. Furthermore; as the reach of the Web expands; it becomes increasinglyimportant to understand how searchers around the world see and interact with the searchresults. To address both challenges; we introduce ViewSer; a novel methodology forperforming web search examination studies remotely; at scale; and without requiring eye-tracking equipment. ViewSer operates by automatically modifying the appearance of asearch engine result page; to clearly show one search result at a time as if through a"viewport"; while partially blurring the rest and allowing the participant to move the …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,45

On the evolution of the yahoo! answers QA community,Yandong Liu; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract While question answering communities have been gaining popularity for severalyears; we wonder if the increased popularity actually improves or degrades the userexperience. In addition; automatic QA systems; which utilize different sources such assearch engines and social media; are emerging rapidly. QA communities have alreadycreated abundant resources of millions of questions and hundreds of millions of answers.The question whether they will continue to serve as an effective source is of information forweb search and question answering is of vital importance. In this poster; we investigate thetemporal evolution of a popular QA community-Yahoo! Answers; with respect to itseffectiveness in answering three basic types of questions: factoid; opinion and complexquestions. Our experiments show that Yahoo! Answers keeps growing rapidly; while its …,Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2008,40
When web search fails; searchers become askers: understanding the transition,Qiaoling Liu; Eugene Agichtein; Gideon Dror; Yoelle Maarek; Idan Szpektor,Abstract While Web search has become increasingly effective over the last decade; for manyusers' needs the required answers may be spread across many documents; or may not existon the Web at all. Yet; many of these needs could be addressed by asking people viapopular Community Question Answering (CQA) services; such as Baidu Knows; Quora; orYahoo! Answers. In this paper; we perform the first large-scale analysis of how searchersbecome askers. For this; we study the logs of a major web search engine to trace thetransformation of a large number of failed searches into questions posted on a popular CQAsite. Specifically; we analyze the characteristics of the queries; and of the patterns of searchbehavior that precede posting a question; the relationship between the content of theattempted queries and of the posted questions; and the subsequent actions the user …,Proceedings of the 35th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2012,39
Modeling answerer behavior in collaborative question answering systems,Qiaoling Liu; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract A key functionality in Collaborative Question Answering (CQA) systems is theassignment of the questions from information seekers to the potential answerers. Anattractive solution is to automatically recommend the questions to the potential answererswith expertise or interest in the question topic. However; previous work has largely ignored akey problem in question recommendation-namely; whether the potential answerer is likely toaccept and answer the recommended questions in a timely manner. This paper explores thecontextual factors that influence the answerer behavior in a large; popular CQA system; withthe goal to inform the construction of question routing and recommendation systems.Specifically; we consider when users tend to answer questions in a large-scale CQA system;and how answerers tend to choose the questions to answer. Our results over a dataset of …,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2011,38
Modeling query-based access to text databases,Eugene Agichtein; Panagiotis Ipeirotis; Luis Gravano,Abstract require access to such databases often resort to querying to extract relevantdocuments because of two main reasons. First; some text databases on the web are not"crawlable;" and hence the only way to retrieve their documents is via querying. Second;applications often require only a small fraction of a database's contents; so retrievingrelevant documents via querying is an attractive choice from an efficiency viewpoint; even forcrawlable databases. Often an application's query-based strategy starts with a small numberof user-provided queries. Then; new queries are extracted--in an application-dependent way--from the documents in the initial query results; and the process iterates. The success of thiscommon type of strategy relies on retrieved documents" contributing" new queries. If newdocuments fail to produce new queries; then the process might stall before all relevant …,In WebDB,2003,37
You've got answers: towards personalized models for predicting success in community question answering,Yandong Liu; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Question answering communities such as Yahoo! Answers have emerged as apopular alternative to general-purpose web search. By directly interacting with otherparticipants; information seekers can obtain specific answers to their questions. However;user success in obtaining satisfactory answers varies greatly. We hypothesize thatsatisfaction with the contributed answers is largely determined by the asker's priorexperience; expectations; and personal preferences. Hence; we begin to developpersonalized models of asker satisfaction to predict whether a particular question author willbe satisfied with the answers contributed by the community participants. We formalize thisproblem; and explore a variety of content; structure; and interaction features for this taskusing standard machine learning techniques.

Combining text mining and sequence analysis to discover protein functional regions,Eleazar Eskin; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Recently presented protein sequence classification models can identify relevantregions of the sequence. This observation has many potential applications to detectingfunctional regions of proteins. However; identifying such sequence regions automatically isdifficult in practice; as relatively few types of information have enough annotated sequencesto perform this analysis. Our approach addresses this data scarcity problem by combiningtext and sequence analysis. First; we train a text classifier over the explicit textualannotations available for some of the sequences in the dataset; and use the trainedclassifier to predict the class for the rest of the unlabeled sequences. We then train a jointsequence text classifier over the text contained in the functional annotations of thesequences; and the actual sequences in this larger; automatically extended dataset …,*,2003,36
Detecting cognitive impairment by eye movement analysis using automatic classification algorithms,Dmitry Lagun; Cecelia Manzanares; Stuart M Zola; Elizabeth A Buffalo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract The Visual Paired Comparison (VPC) task is a recognition memory test that hasshown promise for the detection of memory impairments associated with mild cognitiveimpairment (MCI). Because patients with MCI often progress to Alzheimer's Disease (AD);the VPC may be useful in predicting the onset of AD. VPC uses noninvasive eye tracking toidentify how subjects view novel and repeated visual stimuli. Healthy control subjectsdemonstrate memory for the repeated stimuli by spending more time looking at the novelimages; ie; novelty preference. Here; we report an application of machine learning methodsfrom computer science to improve the accuracy of detecting MCI by modeling eye movementcharacteristics such as fixations; saccades; and re-fixations during the VPC task. Thesecharacteristics are represented as features provided to automatic classification algorithms …,Journal of neuroscience methods,2011,35
Using the past to score the present: Extending term weighting models through revision history analysis,Ablimit Aji; Yu Wang; Eugene Agichtein; Evgeniy Gabrilovich,Abstract The generative process underlies many information retrieval models; notablystatistical language models. Yet these models only examine one (current) version of thedocument; effectively ignoring the actual document generation process. We posit that aconsiderable amount of information is encoded in the document authoring process; and thisinformation is complementary to the word occurrence statistics upon which most modernretrieval models are based. We propose a new term weighting model; Revision HistoryAnalysis (RHA); which uses the revision history of a document (eg; the edit history of a pagein Wikipedia) to redefine term frequency-a key indicator of document topic/relevance formany retrieval models and text processing tasks. We then apply RHA to document rankingby extending two state-of-the-art text retrieval models; namely; BM25 and the generative …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,32
Factoid Question Answering over Unstructured and Structured Web Content.,Silviu Cucerzan; Eugene Agichtein,*,TREC,2005,31
Overview of the TREC 2015 LiveQA Track.,Eugene Agichtein; David Carmel; Dan Pelleg; Yuval Pinter; Donna Harman,The LiveQA track; now in its second year; is focused on real-time question answering for real-user questions. During the test period; real user questions are drawn from those newlysubmitted on a popular community question answering site; Yahoo Answers (YA); that havenot yet been answered. These questions are sent to the participating systems; who providean answer in real time. Returned answers are judged by the NIST assessors on a 4-levelLikert scale. The most challenging aspects of this task are that the questions can be on anyone of many popular topics; are informally stated; and are often complex and at least partlysubjective. Furthermore; the participant systems must return an answer in under 60 seconds;which places additional; and realistic; constraints on the kind of processing that a systemcan do. In addition to the main real-time question answering task; this year we introduced …,TREC,2015,29
Estimating ad clickthrough rate through query intent analysis,Azin Ashkan; Charles LA Clarke; Eugene Agichtein; Qi Guo,Clickthrough rate; bid; and cost-per-click are known to be among the factors that impact therank of an ad shown on a search result page. Search engines can benefit from estimating adclickthrough in order to determine the quality of ads and maximize their revenue. In thispaper; a methodology is developed to estimate ad clickthrough rate by exploring userqueries and clickthrough logs. As we demonstrate; the average ad clickthrough ratedepends to a substantial extent on the rank position of ads and on the total number of adsdisplayed on the page. This observation is utilized by a baseline model to calculate theexpected clickthrough rate for various ads. We further study the impact of query intent on theclickthrough rate; where query intent is predicted using a combination of query features andthe content of search engine result pages.

Predicting accuracy of extracting information from unstructured text collections,Eugene Agichtein; Silviu Cucerzan,Abstract Exploiting lexical and semantic relationships in large unstructured text collectionscan significantly enhance managing; integrating; and querying information locked inunstructured text. Most notably; named entities and relations between entities are crucial foreffective question answering and other information retrieval and knowledge managementtasks. Unfortunately; the success in extracting these relationships can vary for differentdomains; languages; and document collections.

Improving search result summaries by using searcher behavior data,Mikhail Ageev; Dmitry Lagun; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Query-biased search result summaries; or" snippets"; help users decide whether aresult is relevant for their information need; and have become increasingly important forhelping searchers with difficult or ambiguous search tasks. Previously published snippetgeneration algorithms have been primarily based on selecting document fragments mostsimilar to the query; which does not take into account which parts of the document thesearchers actually found useful. We present a new approach to improving result summariesby incorporating post-click searcher behavior data; such as mouse cursor movements andscrolling over the result documents. To achieve this aim; we develop a method for collectingbehavioral data with precise association between searcher intent; document examinationbehavior; and the corresponding document fragments. In turn; this allows us to …,Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2013,28

Confidence estimation methods for partially supervised relation extraction,Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Text documents convey valuable information about entities and relations betweenentities that can be exploited in structured form for data mining; retrieval; and integration. Apromising direction is a family of partially-supervised relation extraction systems that requirelittle manual training. However; the output of such systems tend to be noisy; and hence it iscrucial to be able to estimate the quality of the extracted information. We present Expectation-Maximization algorithms for automatically evaluating the quality of the extraction patternsand derived relation tuples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety ofrelations.,*,2006,28
Predicting web search success with fine-grained interaction data,Qi Guo; Dmitry Lagun; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Detecting and predicting searcher success is essential for automatically evaluatingand improving Web search engine performance. In the past; Web searcher behavior data;such as result clickthrough; dwell time; and query reformulation sequences; have beensuccessfully used for a variety of tasks; including prediction of success in a search session.However; the effectiveness of the previous approaches has been limited; as they tend toignore how searchers actually view and interact with the visited pages. We show that fine-grained interactions; such as mouse cursor movements and scrolling; provide additionalclues for better predicting success of a search session as a whole. To this end; we identifypatterns of examination and interaction behavior that correspond to search success; anddesign a new Fine-grained Session Behavior (FSB) model to capture these patterns.

Discovering common motifs in cursor movement data for improving web search,Dmitry Lagun; Mikhail Ageev; Qi Guo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Web search behavior and interaction data; such as mouse cursor movements; canprovide valuable information on how searchers examine and engage with the web searchresults. This interaction data is far richer than traditional search click data; and can be usedto improve search ranking; evaluation; and presentation. Unfortunately; the diversity andcomplexity inherent in this interaction data make it more difficult to capture salient behaviorcharacteristics through traditional feature engineering. To address this problem; weintroduce a novel approach of automatically discovering frequent subsequences; or motifs;in mouse cursor movement data. In order to scale our approach to realistic datasets; weintroduce novel optimizations for motif discovery; specifically designed for mining cursormovement data. As a practical application; we show that by encoding the motifs …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2014,26
Combining Lexical; Syntactic; and Semantic Evidence for Textual Entailment Classification.,Eugene Agichtein; Walt Askew; Yandong Liu,Abstract This paper describes the Emory system for recognizing textual entailment as usedfor the RTE4 track at the TAC 2008 competition. We use a supervised machine learningapproach to train a classifier over a variety of lexical; syntactic; and semantic metrics. Wetreat the output of each metric as a feature; and train a classifier on the provided data fromthe previous RTE tracks. As a result; our system is general; easily extensible; and naturallysupports both two-way and threeway versions of the entailment task; as well as confidenceestimation for the predictions. The results on both the training and the official data arepromising; placing our system within the top 30% of all submissions.,TAC,2008,24
A Comparative Study of Demographic Attribute Inference in Twitter.,Xin Chen; Yu Wang; Eugene Agichtein; Fusheng Wang,Abstract Social media platforms have become a major gateway to receive and analyzepublic opinions. Understanding users can provide invaluable context information of theirsocial media posts and significantly improve traditional opinion analysis models.Demographic attributes; such as ethnicity; gender; age; among others; have beenextensively applied to characterize social media users. While studies have shown that usergroups formed by demographic attributes can have coherent opinions towards politicalissues; these attributes are often not explicitly coded by users through their profiles. Previouswork has demonstrated the effectiveness of different user signals such as users' posts andnames in determining demographic attributes. Yet; these efforts mostly evaluate linguisticsignals from users' posts and train models from artificially balanced datasets. In this paper …,ICWSM,2015,22
Query ambiguity revisited: clickthrough measures for distinguishing informational and ambiguous queries,Yu Wang; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Understanding query ambiguity in web search remains an important open problem.In this paper we reexamine query ambiguity by analyzing the result clickthrough data.Previously proposed clickthrough-based metrics of query ambiguity tend to conflateinformational and ambiguous queries. To distinguish between these query classes; weintroduce novel metrics based on the entropy of the click distributions of individualsearchers. Our experiments over a clickthrough log of commercial search enginedemonstrate the benefits of our approach for distinguishing informational from trulyambiguous queries.,Human Language Technologies: The 2010 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2010,20
Finding similar questions in collaborative question answering archives: toward bootstrapping-based equivalent pattern learning,Tianyong Hao; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Many questions submitted to Collaborative Question Answering (CQA) sites havesimilar questions answered before. We propose a precise approach of automatically findingan answer to such questions by automatically identifying “equivalent” questions submittedand answered; in the past. Our method is based on automatically generating equivalentquestion patterns by grouping together questions that have previously obtained the sameanswers. The generated patterns are used as seed patterns to match more questions toextract large number of equivalent patterns by a new bootstrapping-based learning method.The resulting patterns can be applied to match a new question to an equivalent one that hasalready been answered; and thus suggest potential answers automatically.

Detecting success in mobile search from interaction,Qi Guo; Shuai Yuan; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Predicting searcher success and satisfaction is a key problem in Web search; whichis essential for automatic evaluating and improving search engine performance. Thisproblem has been studied actively in the desktop search setting; but not specifically formobile search; despite many known differences between the two modalities. As mobiledevices become increasingly popular for searching the Web; improving the searcherexperience on such devices is becoming crucially important. In this paper; we explore thepossibility of predicting searcher success and satisfaction in mobile search with a smartphone. Specifically; we investigate client-side interaction signals; including the number ofbrowsed pages; and touch screen-specific actions such as zooming and sliding.

Combining Strategies for Extracting Relations from Text Collections.,Eugene Agichtein; Eleazar Eskin; Luis Gravano,Abstract Text documents often contain valuable structured data that is hidden in regularEnglish sentences. This data is best exploited if available as a relational table that we coulduse for answering precise queries or for running data mining tasks. Our Snowball systemextracts these relations from document collections starting with only a handful of user-provided example tuples. Based on these tuples; Snowball generates patterns that are used;in turn; to find more tuples. In this paper we introduce a new pattern and tuple generationscheme for Snowball; with different strengths and weaknesses than those of our originalsystem. We also show preliminary results on how we can combine the two versions ofSnowball to extract tuples more accurately.,ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Research Issues in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2000,19
Discovering semantic biomedical relations utilizing the web,Saurav Sahay; Sougata Mukherjea; Eugene Agichtein; Ernest V Garcia; Shamkant B Navathe; Ashwin Ram,Abstract To realize the vision of a Semantic Web for Life Sciences; discovering relationsbetween resources is essential. It is very difficult to automatically extract relations from Webpages expressed in natural language formats. On the other hand; because of the explosivegrowth of information; it is difficult to manually extract the relations. In this paper we presenttechniques to automatically discover relations between biomedical resources from the Web.For this purpose we retrieve relevant information from Web Search engines and Pubmeddatabase using various lexico-syntactic patterns as queries over SOAP web services. Thepatterns are initially handcrafted but can be progressively learnt. The extracted relations canbe used to construct and augment ontologies and knowledge bases.

Trust; but verify: Predicting contribution quality for knowledge base construction and curation,Chun How Tan; Eugene Agichtein; Panos Ipeirotis; Evgeniy Gabrilovich,Abstract The largest publicly available knowledge repositories; such as Wikipedia andFreebase; owe their existence and growth to volunteer contributors around the globe. Whilethe majority of contributions are correct; errors can still creep in; due to editors' carelessness;misunderstanding of the schema; malice; or even lack of accepted ground truth. If leftundetected; inaccuracies often degrade the experience of users and the performance ofapplications that rely on these knowledge repositories. We present a new method; CQUAL;for automatically predicting the quality of contributions submitted to a knowledge base.Significantly expanding upon previous work; our method holistically exploits a variety ofsignals; including the user's domains of expertise as reflected in her prior contributionhistory; and the historical accuracy rates of different types of facts.

Improving entity search over linked data by modeling latent semantics,Nikita Zhiltsov; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Entity ranking has become increasingly important; both for retrieving structuredentities and for use in general web search applications. The most common format for linkeddata; RDF graphs; provide extensive semantic structure via predicate links. While thesemantic information is potentially valuable for effective search; the resulting adjacencymatrices are often sparse; which introduces challenges for representation and ranking. Inthis paper; we propose a principled and scalable approach for integrating of latent semanticinformation into a learning-to-rank model; by combining compact representation of semanticsimilarity; achieved by using a modified algorithm for tensor factorization; with explicit entityinformation. Our experiments show that the resulting ranking model scales well to the graphswith millions of entities; and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline on realistic Yahoo …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,16

If a commercial intent exists; and if anad is related to the user's information need; the user may click on that ad. In this paper; wedevelop a methodology for using ad clickthrough logs from a commercial search engine tostudy characteristics of commercial intent. The findings of our study suggest that adclickthrough features; such as deliberation time; are effective in detecting query intent. Wealso study the effect of query type and the number of displayed ads on ad clickthroughbehavior.,SIGIR Workshop,2008,16

Our study shows that a relatively small number of binaryrelationships account for most of the queries in the sample. This empirically validates anapproach of analyzing query logs to identify the relationships most relevant to user needsand populating corresponding fact tables from the collection for factoid question answering.Our analysis shows that such an approach can lead to substantial coverage of userquestions.,Proceedings of the 28th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2005,16

That is;questions that require immediate responses are pushed out of the way by the trivial but morerecently arriving questions. Unlike other questions in collaborative question answering(CQA) for which users might be willing to wait until good answers appear; urgent questionsare likely to be of interest to the asker only if answered in the next few minutes or hours.

Question answering over implicitly structured web content,Eugene Agichtein; Chris Burges; Eric Brill,Abstract Implicitly structured content on the Web such as HTML tables and lists can beextremely valuable for web search; question answering; and information retrieval; as theimplicit structure in a page often reflects the underlying semantics of the data. Unfortunately;exploiting this information presents significant challenges due to the immense amount ofimplicitly structured content on the web; lack of schema information; and unknown sourcequality. We present TQA; a web-scale system for automatic question answering that is oftenable to find answers to real natural language questions from the implicitly structured contenton the web.

When a knowledge base is not enough: Question answering over knowledge bases with external text data,Denis Savenkov; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract One of the major challenges for automated question answering over KnowledgeBases (KBQA) is translating a natural language question to the Knowledge Base (KB)entities and predicates. Previous systems have used a limited amount of training data tolearn a lexicon that is later used for question answering. This approach does not make useof other potentially relevant text data; outside the KB; which could supplement the availableinformation. We introduce a new system; Text2KB; that enriches question answering over aknowledge base by using external text data. Specifically; we revisit different phases in theKBQA process and demonstrate that text resources improve question interpretation;candidate generation and ranking.

The key to developing an accurate and scalablesystem for this task is to train a query segmentation or attribute detection system overlabeled data; which can be acquired automatically from query and click-through logs. Themain contribution of our work is a new method to automatically acquire such training data-resulting in significantly higher segmentation performance; compared to previously reportedmethods.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,11
Touch Screens for Touchy Issues: Analysis of Accessing Sensitive Information from Mobile Devices.,Dan Pelleg; Denis Savenkov; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Smartphones; and other similar devices; are ideal for private activities: They arecarried on the body and can be physically secured from prying eyes.

SEEFT: Planned Social Event Discovery and Attribute Extraction by Fusing Twitter and Web Content.,Yu Wang; David Fink; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Social events comprise some of the most popular topics in social media.Automatically identifying planned social events and extracting structured information; suchas event title; date; and location; would enable more effective index; display and search forsocial events. However; the informal and noisy nature of language used in social media candegrade the quality of event extraction; resulting in broken titles; incorrect or absentattributes-making the resulting event databases not suitable for realistic applications.Previous work mostly focused on event identification and categorization in Twitter. Yet; eventtitle extraction; arguably one of the most useful and difficult tasks in this domain; has neverbeen investigated.

Inparticular; we experimentally compare the retrieval effectiveness of four geographical latentvariable models: two geographical variants of post-hoc LDA; latent variable model withouthidden topics and a topic model that can separate background from geographically …,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2015,8
Relation extraction from community generated question-answer pairs,Denis Savenkov; Wei-Lwun Lu; Jeff Dalton; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Community question answering (CQA) websites contain millions of question andanswer (QnA) pairs that represent real users' interests. Traditional methods for relationextraction from natural language text operate over individual sentences. However answertext is sometimes hard to understand without knowing the question; eg; it may not name thesubject or relation of the question. This work presents a novel model for relation extractionfrom CQA data; which uses discourse of QnA pairs to predict relations between entitiesmentioned in question and answer sentences. Experiments on 2 publicly available datasetsdemonstrate that the model can extract from∼ 20% to∼ 40% additional relation triples; notextracted by existing sentence-based models.,Proceedings of the 2015 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Student Research Workshop,2015,8
Effects of task and domain on searcher attention,Dmitry Lagun; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Previous studies of online user attention during information seeking tasks havemainly focused on analyzing searcher behavior in the web search settings. While thesestudies enabled better understanding of search result examination; their findings might notgeneralize for the tasks and search interfaces in other domains such as Shopping or SocialMedia. In this paper we present; to best of our knowledge; the first cross-domain comparisonof search examination behavior and patterns of aggregated attention across Web Search;News; Shopping and Social Network domains. We investigate how domain of the searchand the scope of the information need affect search examination; and find significantdifferences beyond those arising from natural disparities between individuals. For example;we find that the mean fixation duration; a common indicator of cognitive load; varies …,Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval,2014,8
Exploring searcher interactions for distinguishing types of commercial intent,Qi Guo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract An improved understanding of the relationship between search intent; result quality;and searcher behavior is crucial for improving the effectiveness of web search. While recentprogress in user behavior mining has been largely focused on aggregate server-side clicklogs; we present a new search behavior model that incorporates fine-grained userinteractions with the search results. We show that mining these interactions; such as mousemovements and scrolling; can enable more effective detection of the user's search intent.Potential applications include automatic search evaluation; improving search ranking; resultpresentation; and search advertising. As a case study; we report results on distinguishingbetween" research" and" purchase" variants of commercial intent; that show our method tobe more effective than the current state-of-the-art.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,7
Semantic annotation and inference for medical knowledge discovery,Saurav Sahay; Eugene Agichtein; Baoli Li; Ernest V Garcia; Ashwin Ram,Abstract We describe our vision for a new generation medical knowledge annotation andacquisition system called SENTIENT-MD (“Semantic Annotation and Inference for MedicalKnowledge Discovery”). Key aspects of our vision include deep Natural LanguageProcessing techniques to abstract the text into a more semantically meaningfulrepresentation guided by domain ontology. In particular; we introduce a notion of semanticfitness to model an optimal level of abstract representation for a text fragment given adomain ontology. We apply this notion to appropriately condense and merge nodes insemantically annotated syntactic parse trees. These transformed semantically annotatedtrees are more amenable to analysis and inference for abstract knowledge discovery; suchas for automatically inferring general medical rules for enhancing an expert system for …,Proceedings of the NSF Symp. on Next Generation of Data Mining: 10-12 October 2007,2007,7
The importance of being socially-savvy: quantifying the influence of social networks on microblog retrieval,Alexander Kotov; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Social media users create virtual connections for various reasons: personal andprofessional. While significant research efforts have been spent on exploring the dynamicsof creation of social network connections; little is known about how those connectionsinfluence the content generated by social media users. In this work; we quantitativelyevaluate the influence of social networks on social media content providers. Additionally; wepropose several document expansion methods; which leverage the content generated bythe social networks of the authors of social media documents and compare theireffectiveness. Experimental results on a large sample of Twitter data indicate that retrievalmodels discriminatively leveraging social network content for document expansionoutperform both traditional; socially-unaware retrieval models and retrieval models that …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,6
Temporal latent semantic analysis for collaboratively generated content: preliminary results,Yu Wang; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Latent semantic analysis (LSA) has been intensively studied because of its wideapplication to Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. Yet; traditionalmodels such as LSA only examine one (current) version of the document. However; due tothe recent proliferation of collaboratively generated content such as threads in onlineforums; Collaborative Question Answering archives; Wikipedia; and other versioned content;the document generation process is now directly observable. In this study; we explore howthis additional temporal information about the document evolution could be used to enhancethe identification of latent document topics. Specifically; we propose a novel hidden-topicmodeling algorithm; temporal Latent Semantic Analysis (tLSA); which elegantly extends LSAto modeling document revision history using tensor decomposition.

Extracting relations from XML documents,Eugene Agichtein; CT Howard Ho; Vanja Josifovski; Joerg Gerhardt,Abstract XML is becoming a prevalent format for data exchange. Many XML documents havecomplex schemas that are not always known; and can vary widely between informationsources and applications. In contrast; database applications rely mainly on the flat relationalmodel. We propose a novel; partially supervised approach for extracting user-definedrelations from XML documents with unknown schema. The extracted relations can bedirectly used by an RDBMS; or utilized for information integration or data mining tasks. Ourmethod attempts to automatically capture the lexical and structural features that indicate therelevant portions of the input document; based on a few user-annotated examples. Thisinformation can then be used to extract the relation of interest from documents with schemaspotentially different from the training examples. We present preliminary experiments …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2003,6
Searcher in a strange land: Understanding web search from familiar and unfamiliar locations,Elad Kravi; Eugene Agichtein; Ido Guy; Yaron Kanza; Avihai Mejer; Dan Pelleg,Abstract With mobile devices; web search is no longer limited to specific locations. Peopleconduct search from practically anywhere; including at home; at work; when traveling andwhen on vacation. How should this influence search tools and web services? In this paper;we argue that information needs are affected by the familiarity of the environment. Toformalize this idea; we propose a new contextualization model for activities on the web. Themodel distinguishes between a search from a familiar place (F-search) and a search from anunfamiliar place (U-search). We formalize the notion of familiarity; and propose a method toidentify familiar places. An analysis of a query log of millions of users; demonstrates thedifferences between search activities in familiar and in unfamiliar locations.

Towards estimating web search result relevance from touch interactions on mobile devices,Qi Guo; Haojian Jin; Dmitry Lagun; Shuai Yuan; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Fine-grained search interactions such as mouse cursor movements and scrollinghave been shown to be valuable for modeling user attention and preferences of Web searchresults; in the desktop setting. However; users increasingly search the Web on touch-enabled devices such as smart phones and tablets; where they zoom and swipe instead ofmousing and scrolling. In this paper; we present; to our knowledge; the first study of the utilityof touch interactions on a mobile devices for estimating Web search result relevance--whichcan in turn be used for search result ranking and evaluation. In particular; we explore avariety of touch interaction signals as implicit relevance feedback; based on a user study of26 users and hundreds of unique Web search queries; result clicks; and page examinations.Our experimental results show that touch interactions provide more effective implicit …,CHI'13 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2013,5
ViewSer: a tool for large-scale remote studies of Web search result examination,Dmitry Lagun; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Web search behavior studies; including eye-tracking studies of search resultexamination; have resulted in numerous insights to improve search result quality andpresentation. Yet; these studies have been severely restricted in scale; due to the expenseand effort required. We propose a novel methodology for crowdsourcing web searchbehavior studies-specifically focusing on performing large-scale studies of resultexamination behavior. We present a viewport-based examination interface (ViewSer); whichenables remotely tracking searcher examination behavior; without requiring eye trackingequipment. We show that ViewSer induces similar viewing and clickthrough behavior;compared to in-lab users monitored with eye tracking; in a study with over 100 remoteparticipants.

Domain Ontology Construction from Biomedical Text.,Saurav Sahay; Baoli Li; Ernest V Garcia; Eugene Agichtein; Ashwin Ram,Abstract-NLM's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a very large ontology ofbiomedical and health data. In order to be used effectively for knowledge processing; itneeds to be customized to a specific domain. In this paper; we present techniques toautomatically discover domain-specific concepts; discover relationships between theseconcepts; build a context map from these relationships; link these domain concepts with thebestmatching concept identifiers in UMLS using our context map and UMLS concept trees;and finally assign categories to the discovered relationships. This specific domain ontologyof terms and relationships using evidential information can serve as a basis for applicationsin analysis; reasoning and discovery of new relationships. We have automatically built anontology for the Nuclear Cardiology domain as a testbed for our techniques.,IC-AI,2007,5
Predicting Extraction Performance Using Context Language Models,Eugene Agichtein; Silviu Cucerzan,Abstract Exploiting lexical and semantic relationships in text can dramatically improveinformation retrieval accuracy. Most notably; named entities and relations between entitiesare crucial for effective question answering and other information retrieval tasks.Unfortunately; the success in extracting these relationships can vary for different domainsand document collections. Predicting extraction performance is an important step towardsintegration of information extraction technology for high accuracy information retrieval. In thispaper; we present a general language modeling method for quantifying the difficulty ofinformation extraction tasks.

Crowdsourcing for (almost) real-time question answering,Denis Savenkov; Scott Weitzner; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Modern search engines have made dramatic progress in the answering of manyuser's questions about facts; such as those that might be retrieved or directly inferred from aknowledge base. However; many other questions that real users ask are more complex;such as asking for opinions or advice for a particular situation; and are still largely beyondthe competence of the computer systems. As conversational agents become more popular;QA systems are increasingly expected to handle such complex questions; and to do so in(nearly) real-time; as the searcher is unlikely to wait longer than a minute or two for ananswer. One way to overcome some of the challenges in complex question answering iscrowdsourcing. We explore two ways crowdsourcing can assist a question answeringsystem that operates in (near) real time: by providing answer validation; which could be …,Proceedings of the Workshop on Human-Computer Question Answering,2016,4
Real-time community question answering: Exploring content recommendation and user notification strategies,Qiaoling Liu; Tomasz Jurczyk; Jinho Choi; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Community-based Question Answering (CQA) services allow users to find andshare information by interacting with others. A key to the success of CQA services is thequality and timeliness of the responses that users get. With the increasing use of mobiledevices; searchers increasingly expect to find more local and time-sensitive information;such as the current special at a cafe around the corner. Yet; few services provide such hyper-local and time-aware question answering. This requires intelligent content recommendationand careful use of notifications (eg; recommending questions to only selected users). Toexplore these issues; we developed RealQA; a real-time CQA system with a mobileinterface; and performed two user studies: a formative pilot study with the initial systemdesign; and a more extensive study with the revised UI and algorithms.

Towards tracking political sentiment through microblog data,Yu Wang; Tom Clark; Jeffrey Staton; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract People express and amplify political opinions in Microblogs such as Twitter;especially when major political decisions are made. Twitter provides a useful vehicle forcapturing and tracking popular opinion on burning issues of the day. In this paper; we focuson tracking the changes in political sentiment related to the US Supreme Court (SCOTUS)and its decisions; focusing on the key dimensions on support; emotional intensity; andpolarity. Measuring changes in these sentiment dimensions could be useful for social andpolitical scientists; policy makers; and the public. This preliminary work adapts existingsentiment analysis techniques to these new dimensions and the specifics of the corpus(Twitter). We illustrate the promise of our work with an important case study of trackingsentiment change building up to; and immediately following one recent landmark …,Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Social Dynamics and Personal Attributes in Social Media,2014,4
Towards task-based snippet evaluation: preliminary results and challenges,Mikhail Ageev; Dmitry Lagun; Eugene Agichtein,ABSTRACT Query-biased search result summaries; or “snippets”; help users decidewhether a result is relevant for their information need; and have become increasinglyimportant for helping searchers with difficult or ambiguous search tasks. However; existingsnippet evaluation methods focus on the snippet quality of summarizing the document forthe given query; and do not consider the user's search task. We propose a methodology fortask-based snippet evaluation; with the aim of directly evaluating how how well the snippetshelp users to satisfy their information need. This includes an open-source infrastructure forcollecting controlled yet realistic searcher behavior data; that could allow analysis of searchsession success as a function of snippet generation quality. We also present preliminaryresults of using this methodology; and identify some of the challenges that remain.,MUBE (SIGIR Workshop),2013,4
The answer is at your fingertips: improving passage retrieval for web question answering with search behavior data,Mikhail Ageev; Dmitry Lagun; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Passage retrieval is a crucial first step of automatic Question Answering (QA). Whileexisting passage retrieval algorithms are effective at selecting document passages mostsimilar to the question; or those that contain the expected answer types; they do not take intoaccount which parts of the document the searchers actually found useful. We propose; to thebest of our knowledge; the first successful attempt to incorporate searcher examination datainto passage retrieval for question answering. Specifically; we exploit detailed examinationdata; such as mouse cursor movements and scrolling; to infer the parts of the document thesearcher found interesting; and then incorporate this signal into passage retrieval for QA.Our extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our method significantly improvespassage retrieval; compared to using textual features alone. As an additional contribution …,Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2013,4
Understanding “abandoned” ads: towards personalized commercial intent inference via mouse movement analysis,Qi Guo; Eugene Agichtein; Charles LA Clarke; Azin Ashkan,ABSTRACT Clickthrough on ads and search results have been successfully used to inferuser interest and preferences; but these indicators are typically most effective for modelingthe “dominant” or most popular intent for a query. In this paper we begin to explore rich client-side instrumentation for inferring personalized commercial intent of users. In particular; weinvestigate whether mouse movement over search results can provide clues into the users'intent. As one practical application; we attempt to understand the causes of “abandoned”—unclicked—ads: that is; to automatically distinguish whether a user's search had nocommercial intent at all; or if the commercial intent was present; but the ads were notsufficiently relevant. Our preliminary results indicate that in some cases mouse movementanalysis can help distinguish these cases; providing information about user intent not …,Information Retrieval in Advertising,2008,4
Web question answering: Beyond factoids: SIGIR 2015 workshop,Eugene Agichtein; David Carmel; Charles LA Clarke; Praveen Paritosh; Dan Pelleg; Idan Szpektor,Automatic question answering is a central topic in information retrieval. Web search engineshave made great progress at answering factoid queries; such as “how many people live inAustralia?”. These can provide a succinct answer; up to a few words in length; andsometimes offer additional information such as related facts or entities. However; for deeperquestions which could benefit from a longer response (eg;“history of Australia”); currentsearch engine resort to returning a link to a detailed web document. Alternatively; such aquestion might be posted on a Community Question Answering (CQA) site (“VisitingAustralia in May; what should I see?”); hoping to get a human authored and detailedresponse.

To hint or not: exploring the effectiveness of search hints for complex informational tasks,Denis Savenkov; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Extensive previous research has shown that searchers often require assistancewith query formulation and refinement. Yet; it is not clear what kind of assistance is mostuseful; and how effective it is both objectively (eg; in terms of task success) and subjectively(eg; in terms of searcher percep-tion of the search difficulty). This work describes the resultsof a controlled user study comparing the effects of provid-ing specific vs. generic searchhints on search success and satisfaction. Our results indicate that specific search hints tendto effectively improve searcher success rates and reduce perceived effort; while genericones can be detrimental in both search effectiveness and user satisfaction. The results ofthis study are an important step towards the design of future search systems that couldeffectively assist and guide the user in accomplishing complex search tasks.,Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval,2014,3
Using Twitter to Study Public Discourse in the Wake of Judicial Decisions: Public Reactions to the Supreme Court’s Same-Sex Marriage Cases,Tom S Clark; Jeffrey K Staton; Yu Wang; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract At the intersection of behavioral and institutional studies of policy-making lie aseries of questions about how elite choices affect mass public opinion. Scholars haveconsidered how judicial decisions—especially US Supreme Court decisions—affectindividuals' support for specific policy positions. These studies yield a series of competingfindings. Whereas past research uses opinion surveys to assess how individuals' opinionsare shaped; we believe that modern techniques for analyzing social media provides analyticleverage traditional approaches do not offer. We present a framework for employing Twitterdata to study mass opinion discourse. We find the Supreme Court's decisions relating tosame-sex marriage in 2013 had significant effects on how the public discussed same-sexmarriage and had a polarizing effect on mass opinion. We conclude by connecting these …,*,2014,3
Bootstrap-based equivalent pattern learning for collaborative question answering,Tianyong Hao; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Semantically similar questions are submitted to collaborative question answeringsystems repeatedly even though these questions already contain best answers before. Tosolve the problem; we propose a precise approach of automatically finding an answer tosuch questions by identifying “equivalent” questions submitted and answered. Our method isbased on a new pattern generation method T-IPG to automatically extract equivalentquestion patterns. Taking these patterns from training data as seed patterns; we furtherpropose a bootstrap-based pattern learning method to extend more equivalent patterns onthese seed patterns. The resulting patterns can be applied to match a new question to anequivalent one that has already been answered; and thus suggest potential answersautomatically. We experimented with this approach over a large collection of more than …,International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics,2012,3
Mining query structure from click data: a case study of product queries,Julia Kiseleva; Eugene Agichtein; Daniel Billsus,Abstract Most of the information on the Web is inherently structured; product pages of largeonline shopping sites such as Amazon. com being a typical example. Yet; unstructuredkeyword queries are still the most common way to search for such structured information;producing an ambiguities and poor ranking; and by that degrading user experience. Thisproblem can be resolved by query segmentation; that is; transformation of unstructuredkeyword queries into structured queries. The resulting queries can be used to searchproduct databases more accurately; and improve result presentation and query suggestion.The main contribution of our work is a novel approach to query segmentation based onunsupervised machine learning. Its highlight is that query and click-through logs are used fortraining.

Information organization and retrieval with collaboratively generated content,Eugene Agichtein; Evgeniy Gabrilovich,Abstract Proliferation of ubiquitous access to the Internet enables millions of Web users tocollaborate online on a variety of activities. Many of these activities result in the constructionof large repositories of knowledge; either as their primary aim (eg; Wikipedia) or as a by-product (eg; Yahoo! Answers). In this tutorial; we will discuss organizing and exploitingCollaboratively Generated Content (CGC) for information organization and retrieval.Specifically; we intend to cover two complementary areas of the problem:(1) using suchcontent as a powerful enabling resource for knowledge-enriched; intelligent representationsand new information retrieval algorithms; and (2) development of supporting technologiesfor extracting; filtering; and organizing collaboratively created content.

Exploring web browsing context for collaborative question answering,Qiaoling Liu; Yandong Liu; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Collaborative Question Answering (CQA) sites such as Yahoo! Answers and recentreal-time CQA sites such as Aardvark; provide a promising approach for informationseeking. Yet; the behavior of the answerers; especially the factors influencing the quality andtimeliness of the answers; are not well understood. We hypothesize that the informationcontext of the answerer at the time a question is received is an important factor in theeffectiveness of CQA systems. As a first step in exploring this hypothesis; our study showsthat the relevant web browsing context can have significant positive effects on theanswerers' reported ability; effort; and willingness to answer questions.,Proceedings of the third symposium on Information interaction in context,2010,3
The nays have it: exploring effects of sentiment in collaborative knowledge sharing,Ablimit Aji; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract In this paper we study what effects sentiment have on the temporal dynamics ofuser interaction and content generation in a knowledge sharing setting. We try to identifyhow sentiment influences interaction dynamics in terms of answer arrival; user ratingsarrival; community agreement and content popularity. Our study suggests that" NegativityBias" triggers more community attention and consequently more content contribution.

Beyond session segmentation: predicting changes in search intent with client-side user interactions,Qi Guo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Effective search session segmentation" grouping queries according to common taskor intent" can be useful for improving relevance; search evaluation; and query suggestion.Previous work has largely attempted to segment search sessions off-line; after the fact. Incontrast; we present preliminary investigation of predicting; in real time; whether a user isabout to switch interest-that is; whether the user is about to finish the current search andswitch to another search task (or stop searching altogether). We explore an approach for thistask using client-side user behavior such as clicks; scrolls; and mouse movements;contextualized by the content of the search result pages and previous searches. Ourexperiments over thousands of real searches show that we can identify context and userbehavior patterns that indicate that a user is about to switch to a new search task.

QXtract: a building block for efficient information extraction from text databases,Eugene Agichtein; Luis Gravano,Background: A wealth of information is hidden within unstructured text. This information isoften best utilized in structured or relational form; which is suited for sophisticated queryprocessing; for integration with relational databases; and for data mining. For example;newspaper and e-mail archives contain information that could be useful to analysts andgovenment agencies. Information extraction systems produce a structured representation ofthe information that is “buried” in text documents. Unfortunately; processing each documentis computationally expensive; and is not feasible for large text databases or for the web. Withmany database sizes exceeding millions of documents; processing time is becoming abottleneck for exploiting information extraction technology.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,3
What Do You Mean Exactly?: Analyzing Clarification Questions in CQA,Pavel Braslavski; Denis Savenkov; Eugene Agichtein; Alina Dubatovka,Abstract Search as a dialogue is an emerging paradigm that is fueled by the proliferation ofmobile devices and technological advances; eg in speech recognition and natural languageprocessing. Such an interface allows search systems to engage in a dialogue with usersaimed at fulfilling their information needs. One key capability required to make such searchdialogues effective is asking clarification questions (CLARQ) proactively; when a user'sintent is not clear; which could help the system provide more useful responses. With this inmind; we explore the dialogues between the users on a community question answering(CQA) website as a rich repository of information-seeking interactions. In particular; we studythe clarification questions asked by CQA users in two different domains; analyze theirbehavior; and the types of clarification questions asked. Our results suggest that the types …,Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Conference Human Information Interaction and Retrieval,2017,2

When the crowd is not enough: Improving user experience with social media through automatic quality analysis,Dan Pelleg; Oleg Rokhlenko; Idan Szpektor; Eugene Agichtein; Ido Guy,Abstract Social media gives voice to the people; but also opens the door to low-qualitycontributions; which degrade the experience for the majority of users. To address the latterissue; the prevailing solution is to rely on the â wisdom of the crowdsâ to promote goodcontent (eg; via votes or â likeâ buttons); or to downgrade bad content. Unfortunately; suchcrowd feedback may be sparse; subjective; and slow to accumulate. In this pa-per; weinvestigate the effects; on the users; of automatically filtering question-answering content;using a combination of syntactic; semantic; and social signals. Using this filtering; a large-scale experiment with real users was performed to mea-sure the resulting engagement andsatisfaction. To our knowledge; this experiment represents the first reported large-scale userstudy of automatically curating social media content in real time.

Towards inferring web searcher intent from behavior data,Eugene Agichtein; Qi Guo,Abstract Inferring searcher intent is a central problem in information retrieval: for effectiveranking and result presentation; the retrieval system must know what the searcher is lookingfor. This position paper describes our ongoing efforts towards the development of machinelearning techniques to infer search intent from search behavior actions such as queryreformulations; clicks; browsing; or scrolling over the search results. That is; our goal is todevelop the methodology to combine two sides of the search process; query specificationand result interactions; by training robust machine learning models to recover the searchintent from observable behavior clues.,*,2010,2

The search and social media workshop at SIGIR 2009,Eugene Agichtein; Marti A Hearst; Ian Soboro,Social applications are the fastest growing segment of the web. They establish new forumsfor content creation; allow people to connect to each other and share information; and permitnovel applications at the intersection of people and information.

Exploring client-side instrumentation for personalized search intent inference,Qi Guo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Clickthrough on search results have been successfully used to infer user interestand preferences; but are often noisy and potentially ambiguous. The reason mainly lies inthat the clickthrough features are inherently a rep-resentation of the majority of user intents;rather than the information needs of the individual users for a given query instance. In thispaper; we explore how to recover personalized search intent for each search instance; us-ing a more sensitive and rich client-side instrumentation (including mouse movements) toprovide additional in-sights into the intent behind each query instance. We re-portpreliminary results of learning to infer query intent over rich instrumentation of search resultpages. In par-ticular; we explore whether we can automatically distin-guish the differentquery classes such as navigational vs. informational queries. Our preliminary results …,In Proc. of ITWP,2008,2

Exploring Conversational Search With Humans; Assistants; and Wizards,Alexandra Vtyurina; Denis Savenkov; Eugene Agichtein; Charles LA Clarke,Abstract Chatbots and conversational assistants are becoming increasingly popular.However; for information seeking scenarios; these systems still have very limitedconversational abilities; and primarily serve as proxies to existing web search engines. Inthis work; we ask: what would conversational search look like with a truly intelligentassistant? To begin answering this question empirically; we conduct a user study; in which21 participants are each given 3 information seeking tasks to solve using a text-based chatinterface. To complete each task; participants conversed with three conversational agents:an existing commercial system; a human expert; and a perceived experimental automaticsystem; backed by a human'wizard'behind the curtain.

SIGIR 2016 workshop WebQA II: Web question answering beyond factoids,Alessandro Moschitti; Lluiís Márquez; Preslav Nakov; Eugene Agichtein; Charles Clarke; Idan Szpektor,Abstract Web search engines have made great progress at answering factoid queries.However; they are not well-tailored for managing more complex questions; especially whenthey require explanation and/or description. The WebQA workshop series aims at exploringdiverse approaches to answering questions on the Web. This year; particular emphasis willbe given to Community Question Answering (CQA); where comments by the users engagedin the forum communities can be used to answer new questions. Questions posted on theWeb can be short and ambiguous (similarly to Web queries to a search engine). Theseissues make the WebQA task more challenging than traditional QA; and finding the mosteffective approaches for it remains an open problem.,Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2016,1
Emory University at TREC LiveQA 2016: Combining Crowdsourcing and Learning-To-Rank Approaches for Real-Time Complex Question Answering.,Denis Savenkov; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract This paper describes the two QA systems we developed to participate in the TRECLiveQA 2016 shared task. The first run represents an improvement of our fully automatic real-time QA system from LiveQA 2015; Emory-QA.

Re-examining search result snippet examination time for relevance estimation,Dmitry Lagun; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Previous studies of web search result examination have provided valuable insightsin understanding and modelling searcher behavior. Yet; recent work (eg;[3]) has beendeveloped based on the assumption that the time a searcher spends examining a particularresult abstract or snippet; correlates with result relevance. While this idea is intuitivelyattractive; to the best of our knowledge it has not been empirically tested. This posterinvestigates this hypothesis empirically; in a controlled setting; using eye tracking equipmentto compare search result examination time with result relevance. Interestingly; while wereplicate previous findings showing examination time to be indicative of whole-pagerelevance; we find that viewing time of individual results alone is a poor indicator of eitherabsolute result relevance or even of pairwise preferences.

VPW: an interactive prototype of a web-based visual paired comparison cognitive diagnostic test,Dmitry Lagun; Cecelia Manzanares; Stuart M Zola; Elizabeth A Buffalo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract The Visual Paired Comparison (VPC) task is widely used to measure recognitionmemory in psychology and neuroscience research. Recently; the VPC task has shownpromise as a diagnostic for the amnestic subtype of Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI).Patients diagnosed with aMCI are at an increased risk for developing dementia; especiallyAlzheimer's disease. However; current implementations of VPC require eye trackingequipment; which is costly and not widely available. This demonstration shows our earlyprototype of a Web-based version of the VPC task; the Viewport Viewing task (VPW); thatrequires only a computer with a mouse. A key contribution of VPW is using a computermouse to induce viewing behavior similar to the original VPC task; so that it can be analyzedto measure the subject's novelty preference. Additionally; the interactive VPW prototype …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Health Informatics Symposium,2010,1
Towards automatic question answering over social media by learning question equivalence patterns,Tianyong Hao; Wenyin Liu; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract Many questions submitted to Collaborative Question Answering (CQA) sites havebeen answered before. We propose an approach to automatically generating an answer tosuch questions based on automatically learning to identify" equivalent" questions. Our maincontribution is an unsupervised method for automatically learning question equivalencepatterns from CQA archive data. These patterns can be used to match new questions to theirequivalents that have been answered before; and thereby help suggest answersautomatically. We experimented with our method approach over a large collection of morethan 200;000 real questions drawn from the Yahoo! Answers archive; automaticallyacquiring over 300 groups of question equivalence patterns. These patterns allow ourmethod to obtain over 66% precision on automatically suggesting answers to new …,Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010 Workshop on Computational Linguistics in a World of Social Media,2010,1

TECHNICAL REPORT YR-2007-005,Eugene Agichtein; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis; Gilad Mishne,ABSTRACT: The quality of user-generated content varies drastically from excellent to abuseand spam. As the availability of such content increases; the task of identifying high-qualitycontent in sites based on user contributions—social media sites—becomes increasinglyimportant. Social media in general exhibit a rich variety of information sources: in addition tothe content itself; there is a wide array of non-content information available; such as linksbetween items and explicit quality ratings from members of the community. In this paper weinvestigate methods for exploiting such community feedback to automatically identify highquality content. As a test case; we focus on Yahoo!

Did You Really Just Have a Heart Attack? Towards Robust Detection of Personal Health Mentions in Social Media,Payam Karisani; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract: Millions of users share their experiences on social media sites; such as Twitter;which in turn generate valuable data for public health monitoring; digital epidemiology; andother analyses of population health at global scale. The first; critical; task for theseapplications is classifying whether a personal health event was mentioned; which we callthe (PHM) problem. This task is challenging for many reasons; including typically shortlength of social media posts; inventive spelling and lexicons; and figurative language;including hyperbole using diseases like" heart attack" or" cancer" for emphasis; and not as ahealth self-report. This problem is even more challenging for rarely reported; or frequent butambiguously expressed conditions; such as" stroke". To address this problem; we propose ageneral; robust method for detecting PHMs in social media; which we call WESPAD; that …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09130,2018,*

Characterizing eye movement as a predictor of cognitive decline: Applying machine learning to improve prediction accuracy,Dmitry Lagun; Cecelia Manzanares; Elizabeth Buffalo; Eugene Agichtein; Stuart Zola,Background We have recently demonstrated the use of an innovative and sensitivebehavioral assay; the Visual Paired Comparison (VPC) task; to successfully predict thetransition from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI); and from MCI to Alzheimer'sdisease (AD)(Zola; et al.; 2013). For a subset of subjects; however; predictability is less clear(" gray zone"). We report here that the application of Machine Learning algorithms and eyemovement characteristics can significantly improve the predictive ability of the task for thissubset of individuals. Methods The VPC task measures how individuals view side-by-sidenovel and familiar images. Normal individuals typically look at the novel image about two-thirds of the viewing time. Previous work has relied on a single parameter; ie; percent timeviewing the novel image (novelty preference; NP).

Improving entity search over linked data by modeling latent semantics,E Agichtein; N Zhiltsov,Entity ranking has become increasingly important; both for retrieving structured entities andfor use in general web search applications. The most common format for linked data; RDFgraphs; provide extensive semantic structure via predicate links. While the semanticinformation is potentially valuable for effective search; the resulting adjacency matrices areoften sparse; which introduces challenges for representation and ranking. In this paper; wepropose a principled and scalable approach for integrating of latent semantic informationinto a learning-to-rank model; by combining compact representation of semantic similarity;achieved by using a modified algorithm for tensor factorization; with explicit entityinformation. Our experiments show that the resulting ranking model scales well to the graphswith millions of entities; and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline on realistic Yahoo …,*,2013,*

Querying Large Text Databases for Efficient Information Extraction,Eugene Agichtein; Luis Gravano,Abstract A wealth of data is hidden within unstructured text. This data is often best exploitedin structured or relational form; which is suited for sophisticated query processing; forintegration with relational databases; and for data mining. Current information extractiontechniques extract relations from a text database by examining every document in thedatabase. This exhaustive approach is not practical; or sometimes even feasible; for largedatabases. In this paper; we develop an efficient query-based technique to identifydocuments that are potentially useful for the extraction of a target relation. We start bysampling the database to characterize the documents from which an information extractionsystem manages to extract relevant tuples. Then; we apply machine learning andinformation retrieval techniques to derive queries likely to match additional useful …,*,2002,*

Participant Responses,Eugene Agichtein,What are the limitations of visual user interfaces for task-based search and how can weovercome them?[1; 2] shows when a transparent user model (or task model) can fail. Unlike[1; 2] which implement an offline search system or a text-based transparent user model;[3]presents a 2-D visualization based approach; which can overcome some of the limitations ofthe past approaches.What are the properties that should be considered when evaluatingtask-based search system user interfaces that emphasize transparency?[4] suggests a list ofaims for explanatory recommender systems; which could be helpful for defining the aims oftask-based search system user interfaces.,*,*,*
Enhancing Usability and Accessibility of Web-based Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease,JongHo Shin; Dmitry Lagun; Haojian Jin; Cecelia Manzanares; Stuart M Zola; Elizabeth Buffalo; Eugene Agichtein,Abstract We describe our progress on developing a Web-based automated behavioral testfor mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI has is now known to be an early harbinger ofAlzheimer's disease; which affects millions of Americans. The Web Visual PairedComparison (VPCW) test measures visual recognition memory by observing how a patientviews familiar or novel images; and has been shown to be effective in the clinical setting.Yet; the main power of the technology is that VPC-W could be administered on any internet-enabled computer. At the same time; VPC-W requires a patient to move a computer mouseor touchpad to examine images; which introduces accessibility and usability challenges;especially for Elderly patients (the target population) many of whom have limited priorexposure of comfort with computer use. To address this challenge; we introduce …,*,*,*

Welcome from the CQA 2012 Workshop Chairs,Eugene Agichtein; Gideon Dror; Yoelle Maarek,Background: Despite the continuous progress of Web search engines in the last 20 years;many users' needs still remain unanswered. Two common reasons for queries not beingsatisfied are (1) the intent behind the query not being well expressed; and (2) the absence ofrelevant content. Subjective or narrow needs; for which content was not created before theneed was expressed; will keep appearing no matter how Web search engines progress.This innate limitation of web search engines has led to the emergence of CommunityQuestion Answering (CQA) services in the last decade; such as Yahoo! Answers; BaiduZhidao; Quora; Facebook Questions; and many topic-specific forums such as StackOverflow. These services are designed to help users obtain information from a community;offering a wide variety of approaches (eg; broadcasting the question to the whole …,*,*,*

Data Engineering,Jens Dittrich; Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles; Lukas Blunschi; Ziyang Liu; Peng Sun; Yu Huang; Yichuan Cai; Yi Chen; Eugene Agichtein; Evgeniy Gabrilovich; Hongyuan Zha,Abstract The Starfish project at Duke University aims to provide MapReduce users andapplications with good performance automatically; without any need on their part tounderstand and manipulate the numerous tuning knobs in a MapReduce system. This paperdescribes the What-if Engine; an indispensable component in Starfish; which serves asimilar purpose as a costing engine used by the query optimizer in a Database system. Wediscuss the problem and challenges addressed by the What-if Engine. We also discuss thetechniques used by the What-if Engine and the design decisions that led us to thesetechniques.,*,*,*

Information Retrieval in Advertising,Ewa Dominowska; Eugene Agichtein; Evgeniy Gabrilovich; James G Shanahan,Advertising is a multi-billion dollar industry that has become a significant component of theWeb browsing experience. Online advertising systems incorporate many informationretrieval techniques by combining content analysis; user interaction models; and commercialconstraints. Advances in online advertising have come from integrating several coreresearch areas: information retrieval; data mining; machine learning; and user modeling.The workshop will serve as an open forum for discussion of new ideas and current researchrelated to information retrieval topics relevant to online advertising. The outcome will be aset of full and short papers covering a variety of topics. The short paper format will allowresearchers new to the area to actively participate and explore novel themes. It will alsoenable researchers without access to extensive empirical data to propose ideas and …,*,*,*
Extracting Synonymous Gene and Protein Terms from Biomedical Literature,Hong Yu; Eugene Agichtein,ABSTRACT Genes and proteins are often associated with multiple names; and more namesare added as new functional or structural information is discovered. Because authors oftenalternate between these synonyms; information retrieval and extraction benefits fromidentifying these synonymous names. We have compared four different approaches forextracting synonyms from text; based on unsupervised; semi-supervised; and supervisedmachine-learning techniques; as well as a system incorporating hand-crafted extractionrules and heuristics. We evaluated these over a collection of more than 50;000 biological full-text biological journal articles. Availability: The extracted (and evaluated) synonymous geneor protein name pairs are available at http://synonyms. cs. columbia. edu/,*,*,*
