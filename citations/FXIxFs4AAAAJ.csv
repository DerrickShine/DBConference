XPath containment in the presence of disjunction; DTDs; and variables,Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract XPath is a simple language for navigating an XML tree and returning a set ofanswer nodes. The focus in this paper is on the complexity of the containment problem forvarious fragments of XPath. In addition to the basic operations (child; descendant; filter; andwildcard); we consider disjunction; DTDs and variables. Wrt variables we study twosemantics:(1) the value of variables is given by an outer context;(2) the value of variables isdefined existentially. We establish an almost complete classification of the complexity of thecontainment problem wrt these fragments.,Database Theory—ICDT 2003,2002,301
Finite state machines for strings over infinite alphabets,Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick; Victor Vianu,Abstract Motivated by formal models recently proposed in the context of XML; we studyautomata and logics on strings over infinite alphabets. These are conservative extensions ofclassical automata and logics defining the regular languages on finite alphabets.Specifically; we consider register and pebble automata; and extensions of first-order logicand monadic second-order logic. For each type of automaton we consider one-way and two-way variants; as well as deterministic; nondeterministic; and alternating control. Weinvestigate the expressiveness and complexity of the automata and their connection to thelogics; as well as standard decision problems. Some of our results answer open questions ofKaminski and Francez on register automata.,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2004,275
Expressiveness and complexity of XML Schema,Wim Martens; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick; Geert Jan Bex,Abstract The common abstraction of XML Schema by unranked regular tree languages is notentirely accurate. To shed some light on the actual expressive power of XML Schema;intuitive semantical characterizations of the Element Declarations Consistent (EDC) rule areprovided. In particular; it is obtained that schemas satisfying EDC can only reason aboutregular properties of ancestors of nodes. Hence; with respect to expressive power; XMLSchema is closer to DTDs than to tree automata. These theoretical results arecomplemented with an investigation of the XML Schema Definitions (XSDs) occurring inpractice; revealing that the extra expressiveness of XSDs over DTDs is only used to a verylimited extent. As this might be due to the complexity of the XML Schema specification andthe difficulty of understanding the effect of constraints on typing and validation of schemas …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,230
Automata theory for XML researchers,Frank Neven,The advent of XML initiated a symbiosis between document research; databases and formallanguages (see; eg; the survey by Vianu [38]). This symbiosis resulted; for instance; in thedevelopment of unranked tree automata [3]. In brief; unranked trees are finite labeled treeswhere nodes can have an arbitraxy number of children. So; there is no fixed rank associatedto each label. As the structure of XML documents can be adequately represented byunranked trees; unranked tree automata can serve XML research in four different ways:(i) asa basis of schema languages [10; 12; 13; 18; 19] and validating of schemas;(ii) as anevaluation mechanism for pattern languages [4; 32; 24];(iii) as an algorithmic toolbox (eg;XPath containment [16] and typechecking [15]); and (iv) as a new paradigm: unranked treeautomata use regular string languages to deal with unrankedness. The latter simple but …,ACM Sigmod Record,2002,222
Automata; logic; and XML,Frank Neven,Abstract We survey some recent developments in the broad area of automata and logicwhich are motivated by the advent of XML. In particular; we consider unranked treeautomata; tree-walking automata; and automata over infinite alphabets. We focus on theirconnection with logic and on questions imposed by XML.,International Workshop on Computer Science Logic,2002,208
Query automata over finite trees,Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract A main task in document transformation and information retrieval is locatingsubtrees satisfying some pattern. Therefore; unary queries; ie; queries that map a tree to aset of its nodes; play an important role in the context of structured document databases. Themotivation of this work is to understand how the natural and well-studied computation modelof tree automata can be used to compute such queries. We define a query automaton (QA)as a deterministic two-way finite automaton over trees that has the ability to select nodesdepending on the state and the label at those nodes. We study QAs over ranked as well asover unranked trees. Unranked trees differ from ranked ones in that there is no bound on thenumber of children of nodes. We characterize the expressiveness of the different formalismsas the unary queries definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO). In contrast to the …,Theoretical Computer Science,2002,198
DTDs versus XML schema: a practical study,Geert Jan Bex; Frank Neven; Jan Van den Bussche,Abstract Among the various proposals answering the shortcomings of Document TypeDefinitions (DTDs); XML Schema is the most widely used. Although DTDs and XML SchemaDefinitions (XSDs) differ syntactically; they are still quite related on an abstract level. Indeed;freed from all syntactic sugar; XML Schemas can be seen as an extension of DTDs with arestricted form of specialization. In the present paper; we inspect a number of DTDs andXSDs harvested from the web and try to answer the following questions:(1) which of theextra features/expressiveness of XML Schema not allowed by DTDs are effectively used inpractice; and;(2) how sophisticated are the structural properties (ie the nature of regularexpressions) of the two formalisms. It turns out that at present real-world XSDs only sparinglyuse the new features introduced by XML Schema: on a structural level the vast majority of …,Proceedings of the 7th international workshop on the web and databases: colocated with ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2004,2004,183
A formal model for an expressive fragment of XSLT,Geert Jan Bex; Sebastian Maneth; Frank Neven,Abstract The extension of the eXtensible Style sheet Language (XSL) by variables andpassing of data values between template rules has generated a powerful XML querylanguage: eXtensible Style sheet Language Transformations (XSLT). An informalintroduction to XSTL is given; on the bases of which a formal model of a fragment of XSLT isdefined. This formal model is in the spirit of tree transducers; and its semantics is defined byrewrite relations. It is shown that the expressive power of the fragment is already beyond thatof most other XML query languages. Finally; important properties such as termination andclosure under composition are considered.,Information Systems,2002,141
Inference of concise DTDs from XML data,Geert Jan Bex; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick; Karl Tuyls,Abstract We consider the problem to infer a concise Document Type Definition (DTD) for agiven set of XML-documents; a problem which basically reduces to learning of conciseregular expressions from positive example strings. We identify two such classes: singleoccurrence regular expressions (SOREs) and chain regular expressions (CHAREs). Bothclasses capture the far majority of the regular expressions occurring in practical DTDs andare succinct by definition. We present the algorithm iDTD (infer DTD) that learns SOREs fromstrings by first inferring an automaton by known techniques and then translating thatautomaton to a corresponding SORE; possibly by repairing the automaton when noequivalent SORE can be found. In the process; we introduce a novel automaton to regularexpression rewrite technique which is of independent interest. We show that iDTD …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,129
Expressive and efficient pattern languages for tree-structured data,Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract It would be desirable to have a query language for tree-structured data that is (1) aseasily usable as SQL;(2) as expressive as monadic second-order logic (MSO); and (3)efficiently evaluable. The paper develops some ideas in this direction. Towards (1) thespecification of sets of vertices of a tree by combining conditions on their induced subtreewith conditions on their path to the root is proposed. Existing query languages allow regularexpressions (hence MSO logic) in path conditions but are limited in expressing subtreeconditions. It is shown that such query languages fall short of capturing all MSO queries. Onthe other hand; allowing a certain guarded fragment of MSO-logic in the specification ofsubtree conditions results in a language fulfilling (2);(3) and; anguably;(1).,Proceedings of the nineteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2000,120
Inferring XML schema definitions from XML data,Geert Jan Bex; Frank Neven; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract Although the presence of a schema enables many optimizations for operations onXML documents; recent studies have shown that many XML documents in practice either donot refer to a schema; or refer to a syntactically incorrect one. It is therefore of utmostimportance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate schemas fromsets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on theinference of Document Type Definitions (DTDs for short); we will consider the inference ofXML Schema Definitions (XSDs for short)---the increasingly popular schema formalism thatis turning DTDs obsolete. In contrast to DTDs where the content model of an elementdepends only on the element's name; the content model in an XSD can also depend on thecontext in which the element is used. Hence; while the inference of DTDs basically …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,118
XML with data values: typechecking revisited,Noga Alon; Tova Milo; Frank Neven; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,Abstract We investigate the typechecking problem for XML queries: statically verifying thatevery answer to a query conforms to a given output DTD; for inputs satisfying a given inputDTD. This problem had been studied by a subset of the authors in a simplified frameworkthat captured the structure of XML documents but ignored data values. We revisit here thetypechecking problem in the more realistic case when data values are present in documentsand tested by queries. In this extended framework; typechecking quickly becomesundecidable. However; it remains decidable for large classes of queries and DTDs ofpractical interest. The main contribution of the present paper is to trace a fairly tight boundaryof decidability for typechecking with data values. The complexity of typechecking in thedecidable cases is also considered.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2003,116
Learning deterministic regular expressions for the inference of schemas from XML data,Geert Jan Bex; Wouter Gelade; Frank Neven; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract Inferring an appropriate DTD or XML Schema Definition (XSD) for a given collectionof XML documents essentially reduces to learning deterministic regular expressions fromsets of positive example words. Unfortunately; there is no algorithm capable of learning thecomplete class of deterministic regular expressions from positive examples only; as we willshow. The regular expressions occurring in practical DTDs and XSDs; however; are suchthat every alphabet symbol occurs only a small number of times. As such; in practice itsuffices to learn the subclass of deterministic regular expressions in which each alphabetsymbol occurs at most k times; for some small k. We refer to such expressions as k-occurrence regular expressions (k-OREs for short). Motivated by this observation; weprovide a probabilistic algorithm that learns k-OREs for increasing values of k; and selects …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2010,109
Expressiveness of structured document query languages based on attribute grammars,Frank Neven; Jan Van den Bussche,Abstract Structured document databases can be naturally viewed as derivation trees of acontext-free grammar. Under this view; the classical formalism of attribute grammarsbecomes a formalism for structured document query languages. From this perspective; westudy the expressive power of BAGs: Boolean-valued attribute grammars with propositionallogic formulas as semantic rules; and RAGs: relation-valued attribute grammars with first-order logic formulas as semantic rules. BAGs can express only unary queries; RAGs canexpress queries of any arity. We first show that the (unary) queries expressible by BAGs areprecisely those definable in monadic second-order logic. We then show that the queriesexpressible by RAGs are precisely those definable by first-order inductions of linear depth;or; equivalently; those computable in linear time on a parallel machine with polynomially …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2002,103
Frontiers of tractability for typechecking simple XML transformations,Wim Martens; Frank Neven,Abstract Typechecking consists of statically verifying whether the output of an XMLtransformation is always conform to an output type for documents satisfying a given inputtype. We focus on complete algorithms which always produce the correct answer. Weconsider top–down XML transformations incorporating XPath expressions and abstractdocument types by grammars and tree automata. By restricting schema languages andtransformations; we identify several practical settings for which typechecking can be done inpolynomial time. Moreover; the resulting framework provides a rather complete picture as weshow that most scenarios cannot be enlarged without rendering the typechecking problemintractable. So; the present research sheds light on when to use fast complete algorithmsand when to reside to sound but incomplete ones.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2007,101
Succinctness of the complement and intersection of regular expressions,Wouter Gelade; Frank Neven,Abstract We study the succinctness of the complement and intersection of regularexpressions. In particular; we show that when constructing a regular expression defining thecomplement of a given regular expression; a double exponential size increase cannot beavoided. Similarly; when constructing a regular expression defining the intersection of afixed and an arbitrary number of regular expressions; an exponential and doubleexponential size increase; respectively; cannot be avoided. All mentioned lower boundsimprove the existing ones by one exponential and are tight in the sense that the targetexpression can be constructed in the corresponding time class; that is; exponential ordouble exponential time. As a by-product; we generalize a theorem by Ehrenfeucht andZeiger stating that there is a class of DFAs which are exponentially more succinct than …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2012,87
Inference of concise regular expressions and DTDs,Geert Jan Bex; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract We consider the problem of inferring a concise Document Type Definition (DTD) fora given set of XML-documents; a problem that basically reduces to learning concise regularexpressions from positive examples strings. We identify two classes of concise regularexpressions—the single occurrence regular expressions (SOREs) and the chain regularexpressions (CHAREs)—that capture the far majority of expressions used in practical DTDs.For the inference of SOREs we present several algorithms that first infer an automaton for agiven set of example strings and then translate that automaton to a corresponding SORE;possibly repairing the automaton when no equivalent SORE can be found.

Structured document transformations based on XSL,Sebastian Maneth; Frank Neven,Abstract Based on the recursion mechanism of the XML transformation language XSL; thedocument transformation language DTL is defined. First the instantiation DTL reg isconsidered that uses regular expressions as pattern language. This instantiation closelyresembles the navigation mechanism of XSL. For DTL reg the complexity of relevantdecision problems such as termination of programs; usefulness of rules and equivalence ofselection patterns; is addressed. Next; a much more powerful abstraction of XSL isconsidered that uses monadic second-order logic formulas as pattern language (DTL mso).If DTL mso is restricted to top-down transformations (DTL mso d); then a computationalmodel can be defined which is a natural generalization to unranked trees of topdown treetransducers with look-ahead. The look-ahead can be realized by a straightforward bottom …,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,1999,73
Complexity of decision problems for simple regular expressions,Wim Martens; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract We study the complexity of the inclusion; equivalence; and intersection problem forsimple regular expressions arising in practical XML schemas. These basically consist of theconcatenation of factors where each factor is a disjunction of strings possibly extended with'*'or '?'. We obtain lower and upper bounds for various fragments of simple regularexpressions. Although we show that inclusion and intersection are already intractable forvery weak expressions; we also identify some tractable cases. For equivalence; we onlyprove an initial tractability result leaving the complexity of more general cases open. Themain motivation for this research comes from database theory; or more specifically XML andsemi-structured data. We namely show that all lower and upper bounds for inclusion andequivalence; carry over to the corresponding decision problems for extended context-free …,International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science,2004,71
Extensions of attribute grammars for structured document queries,Frank Neven,Abstract Document specification languages like XML; model docu-ments using extendedcontext-free grammars. These differ from standard context-free grammars in that they allowarbitrary regular expressions on the right-hand side of productions. To query suchdocuments; we in-troduce a new form of attribute grammars (extended AGs) that workdirectly over extended context-free grammars rather than over standard context-freegrammars. Viewed as a query language; extended AGs are particularly relevant as they cantake into account the inherent order of the children of a node in a document. We show thattwo key properties of standard attribute grammars carry over to extended AGs: efficiency ofevaluation and decidability of well-definedness. We further characterize the expressivenessof extended AGs in terms of monadic second-order logic and establish the complexity of …,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,1999,71
Relational transducers for declarative networking,Tom J Ameloot; Frank Neven; Jan Van den Bussche,Abstract Motivated by a recent conjecture concerning the expressiveness of declarativenetworking; we propose a formal computation model for “eventually consistent” distributedquerying; based on relational transducers. A tight link has been conjectured betweencoordination-freeness of computations; and monotonicity of the queries expressed by suchcomputations. Indeed; we propose a formal definition of coordination-freeness and confirmthat the class of monotone queries is captured by coordination-free transducer networks.Coordination-freeness is a semantic property; but the syntactic class of “oblivious”transducers we define also captures the same class of monotone queries. Transducernetworks that are not coordination-free are much more powerful.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2013,69
Typechecking top-down uniform unranked tree transducers,Wim Martens; Frank Neven,Abstract We investigate the typechecking problem for XML queries: statically verifying thatevery answer to a query conforms to a given output schema; for inputs satisfying a giveninput schema. As typechecking quickly turns undecidable for query languages capable oftesting equality of data values; we return to the limited framework where we abstract XMLdocuments as labeled ordered trees. We focus on simple top-down recursivetransformations motivated by XSLT and structural recursion on trees. We parameterize theproblem by several restrictions on the transformations (deleting; non-deleting; boundedwidth) and consider both tree automata and DTDs as output schemas. The complexity of thetypechecking problems in this scenario range from PTIME to EXP-TIME.,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,68
Typechecking XML views of relational databases,Noga Alon; Tova Milo; Frank Neven; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,Abstract Motivated by the need to export relational databases as XML data in the context ofthe Web; we investigate the typechecking problem for transformations of relational data intotree data (XML). The problem consists of statically verifying that the output of everytransformation belongs to a given output tree language (specified for XML by a DTD); forinput databases satisfying given integrity constraints. The typechecking problem isparameterized by the class of formulas defining the transformation; the class of output treelanguages; and the class of integrity constraints. While undecidable in its most generalformulation; the typechecking problem has many special cases of practical interest that turnout to be decidable. The main contribution of this article is to trace a fairly tight boundary ofdecidability for typechecking in this framework. In the decidable cases we examine the …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2003,52

Scalable multi-query optimization for exploratory queries over federated scientific databases,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Frank Neven; Dieter Van de Craen; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract The diversity and large volumes of data processed in the Natural Sciences todayhas led to a proliferation of highly-specialized and autonomous scientific databases withinherent and often intricate relationships. As a user-friendly method for querying thiscomplex; ever-expanding network of sources for correlations; we propose exploratoryqueries. Exploratory queries are loosely-structured; hence requiring only minimal userknowledge of the source network. Evaluating an exploratory query usually involves theevaluation of many distributed queries. As the number of such distributed queries canquickly become large; we attack the optimization problem for exploratory queries byproposing several multi-query optimization algorithms that compute a global evaluation planwhile minimizing the total communication cost; a key bottleneck in distributed settings …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,48
Simple off the shelf abstractions for XML schema,Wim Martens; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract Although the advent of XML Schema [25] has rendered DTDs obsolete; research onpractical XML optimization is mostly biased towards DTDs and tends to largely ignore XSDs(some notable exceptions non-withstanding). One of the underlying reasons is mostprobably the perceived simplicity of DTDs versus the alleged impenetrability of XMLSchema. Indeed; optimization wrt DTDs has a local flavor and usually reduces to reasoningabout the accustomed formalism of regular expressions. XSDs; on the other hand; evenwhen sufficiently stripped down; are related to the less pervious class of unranked regulartree automata [6; 19; 20; 21]. Recent results on the structural expressiveness of XSDs [19];however; show that XSDs are in fact much closer to DTDs than to tree automata; leveragingthe possibility to directly extend techniques for DTD-based XML optimization to the realm …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2007,44
Design and analysis of query languages for structured documents. A formal and logical approach,Frank Neven,This dissertation introduces query languages for structured documents and investigates theirexpressiveness and optimization. It is natural to model structured documents; like forexample XML documents; by labeled trees where the children of a node are ordered. Wetherefore revisit some of the established formal language theory formalisms for computationson trees but approach them from a query language perspective. We start with a study of theclassical formalism of attribute grammars to query documents modeled as derivation trees ofcontext-free grammars. By restricting the attributes to Booleans and relations; and thesemantic rules to propositional logic and first-order logic formulas; respectively; we obtainpowerful query languages well suited for expressing unary and relational queries. Furtherrestrictions as well as generalizations lead to a complete picture of the expressiveness of …,*,1999,43
Complexity of decision problems for XML schemas and chain regular expressions,Wim Martens; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,We study the complexity of the inclusion; equivalence; and intersection problem of extendedchain regular expressions (eCHAREs). These are regular expressions with a very simplestructure: they basically consist of the concatenation of factors; where each factor is adisjunction of strings; possibly extended with “*”;“+”; or “?”. Though of a very simple form; theusage of such expressions is widespread as eCHAREs; for instance; constitute a superclass of the regular expressions most frequently used in practice in schema languages forXML. In particular; we show that all our lower and upper bounds for the inclusion andequivalence problem carry over to the corresponding decision problems for extendedcontext-free grammars; and to single-type and restrained competition tree grammars. Thesegrammars form abstractions of document type definitions (DTDs); XML schema definitions …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2009,42
Simplifying XML schema: effortless handling of nondeterministic regular expressions,Geert Jan Bex; Wouter Gelade; Wim Martens; Frank Neven,Abstract Whether beloved or despised; XML Schema is momentarily the only industriallyaccepted schema language for XML and is unlikely to become obsolete any time soon.Nevertheless; many nontransparent restrictions unnecessarily complicate the design ofXSDs. For instance; complex content models in XML Schema are constrained by theinfamous unique particle attribution (UPA) constraint. In formal language theoretic terms; thisconstraint restricts content models to deterministic regular expressions. As the latterconstitute a semantic notion and no simple corresponding syntactical characterization isknown; it is very difficult for non-expert users to understand exactly when and why contentmodels do or do not violate UPA. In the present paper; we therefore investigate solutions torelieve users from the burden of UPA by automatically transforming nondeterministic …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,38
Complexity and composition of synthesized web services,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Wouter Gelade; Frank Neven; Antonella Poggi,Abstract The paper investigates fundamental decision problems and composition synthesisfor Web services commonly found in practice. We propose a notion of synthesized Webservices (ASTs) to specify the behaviors of the services. Upon receiving a sequence of inputmessages; an AST issues multiple queries to a database and generates actions; in parallel;it produces external messages and database updates by synthesizing the actions parallellygenerated. In contrast to previous models for Web services; ASTs advocate parallelprocessing and (deterministic) synthesis of actions. We classify ASTs based on what queriesan AST can issue; how the synthesis of actions is expressed; and whether unbounded inputsequences are allowed in a single interaction session. We show that the behaviors of Webservices supported by various prior models; data-driven or not; can be specified by …,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2008,34
Optimizing schema languages for XML: Numerical constraints and interleaving,Wouter Gelade; Wim Martens; Frank Neven,Abstract The presence of a schema offers many advantages in processing; translating;querying; and storage of XML data. Basic decision problems like equivalence; inclusion; andnon-emptiness of intersection of schemas form the basic building blocks for schemaoptimization and integration; and algorithms for static analysis of transformations. It isthereby paramount to establish the exact complexity of these problems. Most commonschema languages for XML can be adequately modeled by some kind of grammar withregular expressions at right-hand sides. In this paper; we observe that apart from the usualregular operators of union; concatenation and Kleene-star; schema languages also allownumerical occurrence constraints and interleaving operators.

On the power of tree-walking automata,Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract Tree-walking automata (TWAs) recently received new attention in the fields offormal languages and databases.

It isconjectured by Engelfriet and Hoogeboom that TWAs cannot define all regular treelanguages; or equivalently; all of monadic second-order logic. We prove this conjecture for arestricted; but powerful; class of TWAs. In particular; we show that 1-bounded TWAs; that isTWAs that are only allowed to traverse every edge of the input tree at most once in everydirection; cannot define all regular languages.

Making queries tractable on big data with preprocessing: through the eyes of complexity theory,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Frank Neven,Abstract A query class is traditionally considered tractable if there exists a polynomial-time(PTIME) algorithm to answer its queries. When it comes to big data; however; PTIMEalgorithms often become infeasible in practice. A traditional and effective approach to copingwith this is to preprocess data off-line; so that queries in the class can be subsequentlyevaluated on the data efficiently. This paper aims to provide a formal foundation for thisapproach in terms of computational complexity.(1) We propose a set of Π-tractable queries;denoted by ΠT Q 0; to characterize classes of queries that can be answered in parallel poly-logarithmic time (NC) after PTIME preprocessing.(2) We show that several natural queryclasses are Π-tractable and are feasible on big data.(3) We also study a set ΠT Q of queryclasses that can be effectively converted to Π-tractable queries by refactorizing its data …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,27
Typed query languages for databases containing queries,Frank Neven; Jan Van den Bussche; Dirk Van Gucht; Gottfried Vossen,Abstract This paper introduces and studies the relational meta algebra; a statically typedextension of the relational algebra to allow for meta programming in databases. In this metaalgebra one can manipulate database relations involving not only stored data values (as inclassical relational databases) but also stored relational algebra expressions. Topicsdiscussed include modeling of advanced database applications involving “procedural data”;desirability as well as limitations of a strict typing discipline in this context; equivalence witha first-order calculus; and global expressive power and non-redundancy of the proposedformalism.,Information systems,1999,27
On the power of walking for querying tree-structured data,Frank Neven,Abstract XSLT is the prime example of an XML query language based on tree-walking.Indeed; stripped down; XSLT is just a tree-walking tree-transducer equipped with registersand look-ahead. Motivated by this connection; we want to pinpoint the computational powerof devices based on tree-walking. We show that in the absence of unique identifiers evenvery powerful extensions of the tree-walking paradigm are not relationally complete. That is;these extensions do not capture all of first-order logic. In contrast; when unique identifiersare available; we show that various restrictions allow to capture LOGSPACE; PTIME;PSPACE; and EXPTIME. These complexity classes are defined wrt a Turing machine modelworking directly on (attributed) trees. When no attributes are present; relational storage doesnot add power; whether look-ahead adds power is related to the open question whether …,Proceedings of the twenty-first ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2002,24

Typechecking top-down XML transformations: Fixed input or output schemas,Wim Martens; Frank Neven; Marc Gyssens,Abstract Typechecking consists of statically verifying whether the output of an XMLtransformation always conforms to an output type for documents satisfying a given inputtype. In this general setting; both the input and output schema as well as the transformationare part of the input for the problem. However; scenarios where the input or output schemacan be considered to be fixed; are quite common in practice. In the present work; weinvestigate the computational complexity of the typechecking problem in the latter setting.,Information and Computation,2008,21

Weaker forms of monotonicity for declarative networking: a more fine-grained answer to the CALM-conjecture,Tom J Ameloot; Bas Ketsman; Frank Neven; Daniel Zinn,Abstract The CALM-conjecture; first stated by Hellerstein [2010] and proved in its revisedform by Ameloot et al.[2013] within the framework of relational transducer networks; assertsthat a query has a coordination-free execution strategy if and only if the query is monotone.Zinn et al.[2012] extended the framework of relational transducer networks to allow forspecific data distribution strategies and showed that the nonmonotone win-move query iscoordination-free for domain-guided data distributions. In this article; we extend the story byequating increasingly larger classes of coordination-free computations with increasinglyweaker forms of monotonicity and present explicit Datalog variants that capture each ofthese classes. One such fragment is based on stratified Datalog where rules are required tobe connected with the exception of the last stratum. In addition; we characterize …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,18
Logical definability and query languages over ranked and unranked trees,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin; Frank Neven,Abstract We study relations on trees defined by first-order constraints over a vocabulary thatincludes the tree extension relation T &pr; T′(holding if and only if every branch of Textends to a branch of T′); unary node-tests; and a binary relation checking whether thedomains of two trees are equal. We consider both ranked and unranked trees. These aretrees with and without a restriction on the number of children of nodes. We adopt the model-theoretic approach to tree relations and study relations definable over the structureconsisting of the set of all trees and the aforementioned predicates. We relate definability ofsets and relations of trees to computability by tree automata. We show that some naturalrestrictions correspond to familiar logics in the more classical setting where every tree is astructure over a fixed vocabulary; and to logics studied in the context of XML pattern …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2007,18
Attribute grammars for unranked trees as a query language for structured documents,Frank Neven,Abstract Document specification languages; like for instance XML; model documents usingextended context-free grammars. These differ from standard context-free grammars in thatthey allow arbitrary regular expressions on the right-hand side of productions. To query suchdocuments; we introduce a new form of attribute grammars (extended AGs) that work directlyover extended context-free grammars rather than over standard context-free grammars.Viewed as a query language; extended AGs are particularly relevant as they can take intoaccount the inherent order of the children of a node in a document. We show that non-circularity remains decidable in EXPTIME and establish the complexity of the non-emptinessand equivalence problem of extended AGs to be complete for EXPTIME. As an applicationwe show that the Region Algebra expressions can be efficiently translated into extended …,Journal of computer and system sciences,2005,18
Succinctness of pattern-based schema languages for XML,Wouter Gelade; Frank Neven,Abstract Martens et al. defined a pattern-based specification language equivalent inexpressive power to the widely adopted XML Schema definitions (XSDs). This languageconsists of rules of the form (r; s) where r and s are regular expressions and can be seen asa type-free extension of DTDs with vertical regular expressions. Sets of such rules can beinterpreted both in an existential or universal way. In the present paper; we study thesuccinctness of both semantics wrt each other and wrt the common abstraction of XSDs interms of single-type extended DTDs. The investigation is carried out relative to three kinds ofvertical pattern languages: regular; linear; and strongly linear patterns. We also consider thecomplexity of the simplification problem for each of the considered pattern-based schemas.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2011,17
Simplifying XML schema: single-type approximations of regular tree languages,Wouter Gelade; Tomasz Idziaszek; Wim Martens; Frank Neven; Jan Paredaens,Abstract XML Schema Definitions (XSDs) can be adequately abstracted by the single-typeregular tree languages. It is well known that these form a strict subclass of the robust class ofregular unranked tree languages. Sadly; in this respect; XSDs are not closed under thebasic operations of union and set difference; complicating important tasks in schemaintegration and evolution. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the union anddifference of two XSDs can be approximated within the framework of single-type regular treelanguages. We consider both optimal lower and upper approximations. We also address themore general question of how to approximate an arbitrary regular tree language by an XSDand consider the complexity of associated decision problems.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2013,16
Static analysis of XML transformation and schema languages,Wim Martens,XML (eXtensible Markup Language) has currently evolved to the standard data exchangeformat for the World Wide Web [ABS99]. Its main advantages are that it offers an intuitive andstandard way of structuring a very wide range of data and that it admits the use of user-defined tags. The latter allows user communities to develop their own format of XMLdocuments; which is defined by an XML schema. The presence of such a schema improvesthe efficiency of many tasks like; for instance; query processing; query optimization; andautomatic data integration.,*,2006,15
SchemaScope: a system for inferring and cleaning XML schemas,Geert Jan Bex; Frank Neven; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract We present SchemaScope; a system to derive Document Type Definitions and XMLschema from a corpus of sample XML documents. Tools are provided to visualize; clean andrefine existing or inferred schemas. A number of use cases illustrate the versatility of thesystem; as well as various types of applications.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,14
XML schemas without order,Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract XML schemas consist of context-free grammars that allow regular expressions onthe right-hand side of productions. In the schema definition language ScmDL; XML schemasare enhanced to; among other things; mark nodes as ordered or as unordered. Anunordered node is then derived by a production with a regular expression r if the stringinduced by its children belongs to the symmetric closure of r. The symmetric closure of rconsists of all permutations of all strings in r. We say that a language is unordered if it equalsits symmetric closure. In this paper we also consider various other formalisms to specifyunordered languages: shuffle expressions; order-invariant regular expressions; and twological languages Lmod;≥ and L≥. The latter allow to express modular and/or≥ constraintson the number of times symbols can occur. We characterize the expressiveness of the …,Unpublished manuscript,1999,14
Bonxai: Combining the simplicity of DTD with the expressiveness of XML schema,Wim Martens; Frank Neven; Matthias Niewerth; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract While the migration from DTD to XML Schema was driven by a need for increasedexpressivity and flexibility; the latter was also significantly more complex to use andunderstand. Whereas DTDs are characterized by their simplicity; XML Schema Definitions(XSDs) are notoriously difficult. In this paper; we introduce the XML specification languageBonXai which possesses most features of XSDs; including its expressivity; while retainingthe simplicity of DTDs. In brief; the latter is achieved by sacrificing the explicit use of types infavor of simple patterns expressing contexts for elements. The goal of BonXai is by nomeans to replace XML Schema; but rather to provide a simpler DTD-like alternative toschema designers that do not need the explicit use of types. Therefore; BonXai can be seenas a practical front-end for XML Schema. A particular strong point of BonXai is its solid …,Proceedings of the 34th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2015,13
Discovering XSD keys from XML data,Marcelo Arenas; Jonny Daenen; Frank Neven; Martin Ugarte; Jan Van Den Bussche; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract A great deal of research into the learning of schemas from XML data has beenconducted in recent years to enable the automatic discovery of XML schemas from XMLdocuments when no schema or only a low-quality one is available. Unfortunately; and instrong contrast to; for instance; the relational model; the automatic discovery of even thesimplest of XML constraints; namely XML keys; has been left largely unexplored in thiscontext. A major obstacle here is the unavailability of a theory on reasoning about XML keysin the presence of XML schemas; which is needed to validate the quality of candidate keys.The present article embarks on a fundamental study of such a theory and classifies thecomplexity of several crucial properties concerning XML keys in the presence of an XSD;like; for instance; testing for consistency; boundedness; satisfiability; universality; and …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,13
Logical definability and query languages over unranked trees,Leonid Libkin; Frank Neven,Unranked trees; that is; trees with no restriction on the number of children of nodes; haverecently attracted much attention; primarily as an abstraction of XML (Extensible MarkupLanguage) documents. In this paper; we study logical definability over unranked trees; aswell as collections of unranked trees; that can be viewed as databases of XML documents.The traditional approach to definability is to view each tree as a structure of a fixedvocabulary; and study the expressive power of various logics on trees. A different approach;based on model theory; considers a structure whose universe is the set of all trees; andstudies definable sets and relations; this approach extends smoothly to the setting ofdefinability over collections of trees. We study the latter; model-theoretic approach. We findsets of operations on unranked trees that define regular tree languages; and show that …,Logic in Computer Science; 2003.

Definability problems for graph query languages,Timos Antonopoulos; Frank Neven; Frédéric Servais,Abstract Given a graph; a relation on its nodes; and a query language Q of interest; we studythe Q-definability problem which amounts to deciding whether there exists a query in Qdefining precisely the given relation over the given graph. Previous research has identifiedthe complexity of FO-and CQ-definability.

SLIDER: a generic metaheuristic for the discovery of correlated motifs in protein-protein interaction networks,Peter Boyen; Dries Van Dyck; Frank Neven; Roeland CHJ van Ham; Aalt DJ van Dijk,Abstract Correlated motif mining (cmm) is the problem of finding overrepresented pairs ofpatterns; called motifs; in sequences of interacting proteins. Algorithmic solutions for cmmthereby provide a computational method for predicting binding sites for protein interaction. Inthis paper; we adopt a motif-driven approach where the support of candidate motif pairs isevaluated in the network. We experimentally establish the superiority of the Chi-square-based support measure over other support measures. Furthermore; we obtain that cmm isan np-hard problem for a large class of support measures (including Chi-square) andreformulate the search for correlated motifs as a combinatorial optimization problem.

Developing and analyzing XSDs through BonXai,Wim Martens; Matthias Niewerth; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract BonXai is a versatile schema specification language expressively equivalent toXML Schema. It is not intended as a replacement for XML Schema but it can serve as anadditional; user-friendly front-end. It offers a simple way and a lightweight syntax to specifythe context of elements based on regular expressions rather than on types. In this demo weshow the front-end capabilities of BonXai and exemplify its potential to offer a novel way toview existing XML Schema Definitions. In particular; we present several usage scenariosspecifically targeted to showcase the ease of specifying; modifying; and understanding XMLSchema Definitions through BonXai.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,10
Expressiveness and complexity of XML publishing transducers,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Frank Neven,Abstract A number of languages have been developed for specifying XML publishing; that is;transformations of relational data into XML trees. These languages generally describe thebehaviors of a middleware controller that builds an output tree iteratively; issuing queries toa relational source and expanding the tree with the query results at each step. To study thecomplexity and expressive power of XML publishing languages; this article proposes anotion of publishing transducers; which generate XML trees from relational data. We study avariety of publishing transducers based on what relational queries a transducer can issue;what temporary stores a transducer can use during tree generation; and whether or notsome tree nodes are allowed to be virtual; that is; excluded from the output tree. We firstshow how existing XML publishing languages can be characterized by such transducers …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2008,10
Parallel-correctness and transferability for conjunctive queries,Tom J Ameloot; Gaetano Geck; Bas Ketsman; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract A dominant cost for query evaluation in modern massively distributed systems is thenumber of communication rounds. For this reason; there is a growing interest in single-roundmultiway join algorithms where data are first reshuffled over many servers and thenevaluated in a parallel but communication-free way. The reshuffling itself is specified as adistribution policy. We introduce a correctness condition; called parallel-correctness; for theevaluation of queries wrt a distribution policy. We study the complexity of parallel-correctness for conjunctive queries as well as transferability of parallel-correctness betweenqueries. We also investigate the complexity of transferability for certain families ofdistribution policies; including the Hypercube distribution policies.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2017,9

Datalog queries distributing over components,Tom Ameloot; Bas Ketsman; Frank Neven; Daniel Zinn,We investigate the class D of queries that distribute over components. These are the queriesthat can be evaluated by taking the union of the query results over the connectedcomponents of the database instance. We show that it is undecidable whether a (positive)Datalog program distributes over components. Additionally; we show that connectedDatalog¬(the fragment of Datalog¬ where all rules are connected) provides an effectivesyntax for Datalog¬ programs that distribute over components under the stratified as well asunder the well-founded semantics. As a corollary; we obtain a simple proof for one of themain results in previous work; namely; that the classic win-move query is in F2 (a particularclass of coordination-free queries).,*,2015,9
On implementing structured document query facilities on top of a DOOD,Frank Neven; Jan Van den Bussche,Abstract The paper consists of two parts. In the first part we introduce a model for structureddocument databases where we propose Boolean-valued attribute grammars (BAGs) as aquery facility. In the second part we show that DOOD technology offers a natural platform ontop of which this model as a whole can be conveniently implemented. Each structureddocument database is mapped to an OO-database and each BAG is translated intodeductive rules. Our translation is such that the well-founded semantics and the naivebottom-up fixpoint procedure of the deductive rules capture the evaluation of the BAG. Wealso present a modification of the translation suited to the inflationary semantics.,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1997,8
Parallel-correctness and containment for conjunctive queries with union and negation,Gaetano Geck; Bas Ketsman; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract: Single-round multiway join algorithms first reshuffle data over many servers andthen evaluate the query at hand in a parallel and communication-free way. A key question iswhether a given distribution policy for the reshuffle is adequate for computing a given query;also referred to as parallel-correctness. This paper extends the study of the complexity ofparallel-correctness and its constituents; parallel-soundness and parallel-completeness; tounions of conjunctive queries with and without negation. As a by-product it is shown that thecontainment problem for conjunctive queries with negation is coNEXPTIME-complete.Subjects: Databases (cs. DB) Cite as: arXiv: 1512.06246 [cs.

Distributed streaming with finite memory,Frank Neven; Nicole Schweikardt; Frédéric Servais; Tony Tan,Abstract We introduce three formal models of distributed systems for query evaluation onmassive databases: Distributed Streaming with Register Automata (DSAs); DistributedStreaming with Register Transducers (DSTs); and Distributed Streaming with RegisterTransducers and Joins (DSTJs). These models are based on the key-value paradigm wherethe input is transformed into a dataset of key-value pairs; and on each key a localcomputation is performed on the values associated with that key resulting in another set ofkey-value pairs. Computation proceeds in a constant number of rounds; where the result ofthe last round is the input to the next round; and transformation to key-value pairs is requiredto be generic. The difference between the three models is in the local computation part. InDSAs it is limited to making one pass over its input using a register automaton; while in …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2015,7
Generating; sampling and counting subclasses of regular tree languages,Timos Antonopoulos; Floris Geerts; Wim Martens; Frank Neven,Abstract To experimentally validate learning and approximation algorithms for XML SchemaDefinitions (XSDs); we need algorithms to generate uniformly at random a corpus of XSDsas well as a similarity measure to compare how close the generated XSD resembles thetarget schema. In this paper; we provide the formal foundation for such a testbed. We adoptsimilarity measures based on counting the number of common and different trees in the twolanguages; and we develop the necessary machinery for computing them. We use theformalism of extended DTDs (EDTDs) to represent the unranked regular tree languages. Inparticular; we obtain an efficient algorithm to count the number of trees up to a certain size inan unambiguous EDTD. The latter class of unambiguous EDTDs encompasses the morefamiliar classes of single-type; restrained competition and bottom-up deterministic EDTDs …,Theory of Computing Systems,2013,7

Adding for-loops to first-order logic,Frank Neven; Martin Otto; Jurek Tyszkiewicz; Jan Van den Bussche,Abstract We study the query language BQL: the extension of the relational algebra with for-loops. We also study FO (FOR): the extension of first-order logic with a for-loop variant of thepartial fixpoint operator. In contrast to the known situation with query languages; whichinclude while-loops instead of for-loops; BQL and FO (FOR) are not equivalent. Among thetopics we investigate are: the precise relationship between BQL and FO (FOR); inflationaryversus noninflationary iteration; the relationship with logics that have the ability to count; andnested versus unnested loops.,Information and Computation,2001,7
Deterministic top-down tree automata: past; present; and future.,Wim Martens; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract In strong contrast to their non-deterministic counterparts; deterministic top-downtree automata received little attention in the scientific literature. The aim of this article is tosurvey recent and less recent results and stipulate new research directions for top-downdeterministic tree automata motivated by the advent of the XML data exchange format. Inparticular; we survey different ranked and unranked top-down tree automata models anddiscuss expressiveness; closure properties and the complexity of static analysis problems.,Logic and automata,2008,6
SCULPT: A schema language for tabular data on the web,Wim Martens; Frank Neven; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract Inspired by the recent working effort towards a recommendation by the World WideWeb Consortium (W3C) for tabular data and metadata on the Web; we present in this papera concept for a schema language for tabular web data called SCULPT. The languageconsists of rules constraining and defining the structure of regions in the table. Theseregions are defined through the novel formalism of region selection expressions. We presenta formal model for SCULPT and obtain a linear time combined complexity evaluationalgorithm. In addition; we consider weak and strong streaming evaluation for SCULPT andpresent a SCULPT fragment for each of these streaming variants. Finally; we discuss severalextensions of SCULPT including alternative semantics; types; complex content; and exploreregion selection expressions as a basis for a transformation language.,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,5
Optimizing monitoring queries over distributed data,Frank Neven; Dieter Van de Craen,Abstract Scientific data in the life sciences is distributed over various independent multi-format databases and is constantly expanding. We discuss a scenario where a life scienceresearch lab monitors over time the results of queries to remote databases beyond theircontrol. Queries are registered at a local system and get executed on a daily basis in batchmode. The goal of the paper is to study evaluation strategies minimizing the total number ofaccesses to databases when evaluating all queries in bulk. We use an abstraction based onthe relational model with fan-out constraints and conjunctive queries. We show that theabove problem remains np-hard in two restricted settings: queries of bounded depth and thescenario with a fixed schema. We further show that both restrictions taken together results ina tractable problem. As the constant for the latter algorithm is too high to be feasible in …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,5
Gumbo: Guarded fragment queries over big data,Jonny Daenen; Frank Neven; Tony Tan,We present Gumbo; a system for the efficient evaluation of guarded fragment queries on topof Hadoop and Spark. A key asset of Gumbo is the reduced number of jobs in comparisonwith recent systems such as Pig; Hive or Shark. For unnested guarded fragment queries;Gumbo even provides a constant bound on the number of jobs independent of the size ofthe query. In the demo; we will address the following features of Gumbo: ease-of-use; queryplan construction and visualisation; and query execution.,*,2015,4
Optimal broadcasting strategies for conjunctive queries over distributed data,Bas Ketsman; Frank Neven,Abstract In a distributed context where data is dispersed over many computing nodes;monotone queries can be evaluated in an eventually consistent and coordination-freemanner through a simple but naive broadcasting strategy which makes all data available onevery computing node. In this paper; we investigate more economical broadcastingstrategies for full conjunctive queries without self-joins that only transmit a part of the localdata necessary to evaluate the query at hand. We consider oblivious broadcasting strategieswhich determine which local facts to broadcast independent of the data at other computingnodes. We introduce the notion of broadcast dependency set (BDS) as a sound andcomplete formalism to represent locally optimal oblivious broadcasting functions.

Mining minimal motif pair sets maximally covering interactions in a protein-protein interaction network,Peter Boyen; Frank Neven; Dries Van Dyck; Felipe Valentim; Aalt van Dijk,Abstract Correlated motif covering (CMC) is the problem of finding a set of motif pairs; ie;pairs of patterns; in the sequences of proteins from a protein-protein interaction network (PPI-network) that describe the interactions in the network as concisely as possible. In otherwords; a perfect solution for CMC would be a minimal set of motif pairs that describes theinteraction behavior perfectly in the sense that two proteins from the network interact if andonly if their sequences match a motif pair in the minimal set. In this paper; we introduce andformally define CMC and show that it is closely related to the red-blue set cover (RBSC)problem and its weighted version (WRBSC)—both well-known NP-hard problems for thatthere exist several algorithms with known approximation factor guarantees. We prove thehardness of approximation of CMC by providing an approximation factor preserving …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB),2013,3
The complexity of text-preserving XML transformations,Timos Antonopoulos; Wim Martens; Frank Neven,Abstract While XML is nowadays adopted as the de facto standard for data exchange;historically; its predecessor SGML was invented for describing electronic documents; ie;marked up text. Actually; today there are still large volumes of such XML texts. We considersimple transformations which can change the internal structure of documents; that is; themark-up; and can filter out parts of the text but do not disrupt the ordering of the words.Specifically; we focus on XML transformations where the transformed document is asubsequence of the input document when ignoring mark-up. We call the latter text-preserving XML transformations. We characterize such transformations as copy-andrearrange-free transductions. Furthermore; we study the problem of deciding whether agiven XML transducer is text-preserving over a given tree language.

BioScout: a life-science query monitoring system,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Frank Neven; Dieter Van de Craen,Abstract Scientific data are available through an increasing number of heterogeneous;independently evolving; sources. Although the sources themselves are independentlyevolving; the data stored in them are not. There exist inherent and intricate relationshipsbetween the distributed data-sets and scientists are routinely required to write distributedqueries in this setting. Being non-experts in computer science; the scientists are faced withtwo major challenges:(i) How to express such distributed queries. This is a non-trivial task;even if we assume that scientists are familiar with query languages like SQL. Such queriescan get arbitrarily complex as more sources are considered;(ii) How to efficiently evaluatesuch distributed queries. An efficient evaluation must account for batches of hundreds (oreven thousands) of submitted queries and must optimize all of them as a whole.

Data partitioning for single-round multi-join evaluation in massively parallel systems,Tom J Ameloot; Gaetano Geck; Bas Ketsman; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract A dominant cost for query evaluation in modern massively distributed systems is thenumber of communication rounds. For this reason; there is a growing interest in single-roundmultiway join algorithms where data is first reshuffled over many servers and then evaluatedin a parallel but communication-free way. The reshuffling itself is specified as a distributionpolicy. We introduce a correctness condition; called parallel-correctness; for the evaluationof queries wrt a distribution policy. We provide a semantical characterization for whenconjunctive queries (and extensions thereof) are parallel-correct and give matchingcomplexity bounds for the associated decision problem. Motivated by scenarios for workloadoptimization; we further consider the problem of parallel-correctness transfer from a query Qto a query Q0; that is; whether Q0 is parallelcorrect for all distribution policies for which Q …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2016,2
Deciding twig-definability of node selecting tree automata,Timos Antonopoulos; Dag Hovland; Wim Martens; Frank Neven,Abstract Node selecting tree automata (NSTAs) constitute a general formalism definingunary queries over trees. Basically; a node is selected by an NSTA when it is visited in aselecting state during an accepting run. We consider twig patterns as an abstraction ofXPath. Since the queries definable by NSTAs form a strict superset of twig-definable queries;we study the complexity of the problem to decide whether the query by a given NSTA is twig-definable. In particular; we obtain that the latter problem is EXPTIME-complete. In addition;we show that it is also EXPTIME-complete to decide whether the query by a given NSTA isdefinable by a node selecting string automaton.,Theory of Computing Systems,2015,2
Interactome-Wide Prediction of Protein-Protein Binding Sites Reveals Effects of Protein Sequence Variation in Arabidopsis thaliana,Felipe Leal Valentim; Frank Neven; Peter Boyen; Aalt DJ van Dijk,The specificity of protein-protein interactions is encoded in those parts of the sequence thatcompose the binding interface. Therefore; understanding how changes in protein sequenceinfluence interaction specificity; and possibly the phenotype; requires knowing the locationof binding sites in those sequences. However; large-scale detection of protein interfacesremains a challenge. Here; we present a sequence-and interactome-based approach tomine interaction motifs from the recently published Arabidopsis thaliana interactome. Theresultant proteome-wide predictions are available via www. ab. wur. nl/sliderbio and set thestage for further investigations of protein-protein binding sites.

An extensible light-weight XML-based monitoring system for sequence databases,Dieter Van de Craen; Frank Neven; Kerstin Koch,Abstract Life science researchers want biological information in their interest to becomeavailable to them as soon as possible. A monitoring system is a solution that relievesbiologists from periodic exploration of databases. In particular; it allows them to express theirinterest in certain data by means of queries/constraints; they are then notified when newdata arrives satisfying these queries/constraints. We describe a sequence monitoring systemXSeqM where users can combine metadata queries on sequence records with constraintson an alignment against a given source sequence. The system is an XML-based solutionwhere constraints are specified through search fields in a user-friendly web interface andwhich are then translated to corresponding XPath-expressions. The system is easilyextensible as addition of new databases to the system then only amounts to the …,International Workshop on Data Integration in the Life Sciences,2006,2

Structured document query languages based on attribute grammars: locality and non-determinism,Frank Neven,Abstract Structured document databases can be naturally viewed as derivation trees of acontext-free grammar. Under this view; the classical formalism of attribute grammarsbecomes a formalism for structured document query languages. In previous work; westudied Boolean-valued attribute grammars (BAGs) and relation-valued attribute grammars(RAGs) from this view point. In the first part of this paper; we continue the investigation ofBAGs. We show that the unary queries expressible by BAGs that can be evaluated in aconstant number of steps are precisely those definable by strongly Gaifman-local first-orderlogic formulas. In the second part we consider Boolean-valued and relation-valuedrelational attribute grammars. Relational attribute grammars are a generalization ofstandard; functional; attribute grammars; where the semantic rules do not specify …,*,1999,2
Reasoning on data partitioning for single-round multi-join evaluation in massively parallel systems,Tom J Ameloot; Gaetano Geck; Bas Ketsman; Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract Evaluating queries over massive amounts of data is a major challenge in the bigdata era. Modern massively parallel systems; such as; Spark; organize query answering asa sequence of rounds each consisting of a distinct communication phase followed by acomputation phase. The communication phase redistributes data over the available servers;while in the subsequent computation phase each server performs the actual computation onits local data. There is a growing interest in single-round algorithms for evaluating multiwayjoins where data is first reshuffled over the servers and then evaluated in a parallel butcommunication-free way. As the amount of communication induced by a reshuffling of thedata is a dominating cost in such systems; we introduce a framework for reasoning aboutdata partitioning to detect when we can avoid the data reshuffling step. Specifically; we …,Communications of the ACM,2017,1

Datalog Queries Distributing over Components,Tom J Ameloot; Bas Ketsman; Frank Neven; Daniel Zinn,Abstract We investigate the class D of queries that distribute over components. These arethe queries that can be evaluated by taking the union of the query results over the connectedcomponents of the database instance. We show that it is undecidable whether a (positive)Datalog program distributes over components. Additionally; we show that connectedDatalog¬(the fragment of Datalog¬ where all rules are connected) provides an effectivesyntax for Datalog¬ programs that distribute over components under the stratified as well asunder the well-founded semantics. As a corollary; we obtain a simple proof for one of themain results in previous work [Zinn et al. 2012]; namely that the classic win-move query is inF 2 (a particular class of coordination-free queries).,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2017,*

Logical Aspects of Massively Parallel and Distributed Systems,Frank Neven,Abstract Database research has witnessed a renewed interest for data processing indistributed and parallel settings. While distributed and parallel data management systemshave been around for quite some time; it is the rise of cloud computing and the advent of BigData that presents the community with new challenges. This paper highlights recentresearch concerning the logical foundations of massively parallel and distributed systems.The first part of the paper concerns massively parallel systems where computation proceedsin a number of synchronized rounds. Here; the focus is on evaluation algorithms forconjunctive queries as well as on reasoning about correctness and optimization of suchalgorithms. The second part of the paper addresses a distributed asynchronous settingwhere eventual consistency comes into play.

Parallel evaluation of multi-semi-joins,Jonny Daenen; Frank Neven; Tony Tan; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract While services such as Amazon AWS make computing power abundantly available;adding more computing nodes can incur high costs in; for instance; pay-as-you-go planswhile not always significantly improving the net running time (aka wall-clock time) of queries.In this work; we provide algorithms for parallel evaluation of SGF queries in MapReduce thatoptimize total time; while retaining low net time. Not only can SGF queries specify all semi-join reducers; but also more expressive queries involving disjunction and negation. SinceSGF queries can be seen as Boolean combinations of (potentially nested) semi-joins; weintroduce a novel multi-semi-join (MSJ) MapReduce operator that enables the evaluation ofa set of semi-joins in one job. We use this operator to obtain parallel query plans for SGFqueries that outvalue sequential plans wrt net time and provide additional optimizations …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,*

XML Types,Frank Neven,XML access control refers to the practice of limiting access to (parts of) XML data to onlyauthorized users.

Although the sources themselves are independently evolving; the datastored in them are not. There exist inherent and intricate relationships between thedistributed data-sets and scientists are routinely required to write distributed queries in thissetting. Being non-experts in computer science; the scientists are faced with two majorchallenges:(i) How to express such distributed queries. This is a non-trivial task; even if weassume that scientists are familiar with query languages like SQL. Such queries can getarbitrarily complex as more sources are considered;(ii) How to efficiently evaluate suchdistributed queries. An efficient evaluation must account for batches of hundreds (or eventhousands) of submitted queries and must optimize all of them as a whole. In this demo …,*,2008,*

As a user-friendly method for querying this complex; ever-expanding network of sources for correlations; we propose exploratory queries. Exploratoryqueries are loosely-structured; hence requiring only minimal user knowledge of the sourcenetwork. Evaluating an exploratory query usually involves the evaluation of many distributedqueries. As the number of such distributed queries can quickly become large; we attack theoptimization problem for exploratory queries by proposing several multi-query optimizationalgorithms that compute a global evaluation plan while minimizing the total communicationcost; a key bottleneck in distributed settings.

Expressiveness and complexity of XML publishing transducers,Fan Wenfei; Floris Geerts; Frank Neven,A number of languages have been developed for specifying XML publishing; ie;transformations of relational data into XML trees. These languages generally describe thebehaviors of a middleware controller that builds an output tree iteratively; issuing queries toa relational source and expanding the tree with the query results at each step. To study thecomplexity and expressive power of XML publishing languages; this paper proposes anotion of publishing transducers. Unlike automata for querying XML data; a publishingtransducer generates a new XML tree rather than performing a query on an existing tree. Westudy a variety of publishing transducers based on what relational queries a transducer canissue; what temporary stores a transducer can use during tree generation; and whether ornot some tree nodes are allowed to be virtual; ie; excluded from the output tree.

On the complexity of XPath containment in the presence of disjunction; DTDs; and variables,Thomas Schwentick; Frank Neven,XPath is a simple language for navigating an XML-tree and returning a set of answer nodes.The focus in this paper is on the complexity of the containment problem for variousfragments of XPath. We restrict attention to the most common XPath expressions whichnavigate along the child and/or descendant axis. In addition to basic expressions using onlynode tests and simple predicates; we also consider disjunction and variables (ranging overnodes). Further; we investigate the containment problem relative to a given DTD. Withrespect to variables we study two semantics;(1) the original semantics of XPath; where thevalues of variables are given by an outer context; and (2) an existential semanticsintroduced by Deutsch and Tannen; in which the values of variables are existentiallyquantified. In this framework; we establish an exact classification of the complexity of the …,Logical Methods in Computer Science,2006,*
Proceedings of the Eight International Workshop on the Web and Databases,A Doan; Frank NEVEN; R McCann; Geert Jan BEX,ABSTRACT Recently; there has been increased interest in the retrieval and integration ofhidden-Web data with a view to leverage high-quality information available in onlinedatabases. Although previous works have addressed many aspects of the actual integration;including matching form schemata and automatically filling out forms; the problem of locatingrelevant data sources has been largely overlooked. Given the dynamic nature of the Web;where data sources are constantly changing; it is crucial to automatically discover theseresources. However; considering the number of documents on the Web (Google alreadyindexes over 8 billion documents); automatically finding tens; hundreds or even thousandsof forms that are relevant to the integration task is really like looking for a few needles in ahaystack.

Exploiting Structural Similarity For Effective Web Information Extraction,Elio Masciari; Sergio Flesca; Giuseppe Manco; Luigi Pontieri; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract In this paper we propose an architecture that exploit web pages stucturalinformation for the extraction of relevant information from them. In this architecture; a primaryrole played by a distance-based classification methodology is devised. Such a methodologyis based on an efficient and effective technique for detecting structural similarities amongsemistructured documents; which significantly differs from standard methods based ongraph-matching algorithms. The technique is based on the idea of representing the structureof a document as a time series in which each occurrence of a tag corresponds to a givenimpulse. By analyzing the frequencies of the corresponding Fourier transform; we can hencestate the degree of similarity between documents. Experiments on real data show theeffectiveness of the proposed technique.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2005,*

DTDs versus XML Schema: A Practical Study.,Frank NEVEN; Geert Jan BEX; Jan Van den Bussche,Among the various proposals answering the shortcomings of Document Type Definitions(DTDs); XML Schema is the most widely used. Although DTDs and XML Schema Defintions(XSDs) differ syntactically; they are still quite related on an abstract level. Indeed; freed fromall syntactic sugar; XML Schemas can be seen as an extension of DTDs with a restrictedform of specialization. In the present paper; we inspect a number of DTDs and XSDsharvested from the web and try to answer the following questions:(1) which of the extrafeatures/expressiveness of XML Schema not allowed by DTDs are effectively used inpractice; and;(2) how sophisticated are the structural properties (ie the nature of regularexpressions) of the two formalisms.

Forinstance; the daily updates to Genbank alone range in size from 40 till 200 Megabytes.Therefore; the answers to searches may vary over time as more data becomes available.Consider the following motivating example: a certain biological experiment on a rareorganism results in a set of genes. A search of the available data reveals a set of relatedgenes in other organisms. However; only for a very small fraction of those genes theirfunction is known. In addition; none of the current pathways in Kegg or BioCyc mention aprotein related to one of these genes. The researcher therefore would like to be notified …,*,*,*
