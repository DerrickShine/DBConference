Communication steps for parallel query processing,Paul Beame; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the problem of computing conjunctive queries over large databases onparallel architectures without shared storage. Using the structure of such a query q and theskew in the data; we study tradeoffs between the number of processors; the number ofrounds of communication; and the per-processor load—the number of bits each processorcan send or can receive in a single round—that are required to compute q. Since eachprocessor must store its received bits; the load is at most the number of bits of storage perprocessor. When the data are free of skew; we obtain essentially tight upper and lowerbounds for one round algorithms; and we show how the bounds degrade when there isskew in the data. In the case of skewed data; we show how to improve the algorithms whenapproximate degrees of the (necessarily small number of) heavy-hitter elements are …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2017,93
Parallel evaluation of conjunctive queries,Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract The availability of large data centers with tens of thousands of servers has led to thepopular adoption of massive parallelism for data analysis on large datasets. Several querylanguages exist for running queries on massively parallel architectures; some based on theMapReduce infrastructure; others using proprietary implementations. Motivated by this trend;this paper analyzes the parallel complexity of conjunctive queries. We propose a very simplemodel of parallel computation that captures these architectures; in which the complexityparameter is the number of parallel steps requiring synchronization of all servers. We studythe complexity of conjunctive queries and give a complete characterization of the querieswhich can be computed in one parallel step. These form a strict subset of hierarchicalqueries; and include flat queries like R (x; y); S (x; z); T (x; v); U (x; w); tall queries like R (x …,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,69
Query-based data pricing,Paraschos Koutris; Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data is increasingly being bought and sold online; and Web-based marketplaceservices have emerged to facilitate these activities. However; current mechanisms for pricingdata are very simple: buyers can choose only from a set of explicit views; each with aspecific price. In this article; we propose a framework for pricing data on the Internet that;given the price of a few views; allows the price of any query to be derived automatically. Wecall this capability query-based pricing. We first identify two important properties that thepricing function must satisfy; the arbitrage-free and discount-free properties. Then; we provethat there exists a unique function that satisfies these properties and extends the seller'sexplicit prices to all queries. Central to our framework is the notion of query determinacy; andin particular instance-based determinacy: we present several results regarding the …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2015,68
Parallel skyline queries,Foto N Afrati; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract In this paper; we design and analyze parallel algorithms for skyline queries. Theskyline of a multidimensional set consists of the points for which no other point exists that isat least as good along every dimension. As a framework for parallel computation; we useboth the MP model proposed in Koutris and Suciu (2011); which requires that the data isperfectly load-balanced; and a variation of the model in Afrati and Ullman (2010); the GMPmodel; which demands weaker load balancing constraints. In addition to load balancing; wewant to minimize the number of blocking steps; where all processors must wait andsynchronize. We propose a 2-step algorithm in the MP model for any dimension of thedataset; as well a 1-step algorithm for the case of 2 and 3 dimensions. Finally; we present a1-step algorithm in the GMP model for any number of dimensions and a 1-step algorithm …,Theory of Computing Systems,2015,64
Skew in parallel query processing,Paul Beame; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the problem of computing a conjunctive query q in parallel; using p ofservers; on a large database. We consider algorithms with one round of communication; andstudy the complexity of the communication. We are especially interested in the case wherethe data is skewed; which is a major challenge for scalable parallel query processing. Weestablish a tight connection between the fractional edge packing of the query and theamount of communication in two cases. First; in the case when the only statistics on thedatabase are the cardinalities of the input relations; and the data is skew-free; we providematching upper and lower bounds (up to a polylogarithmic factor of p) expressed in terms offractional edge packings of the query q. Second; in the case when the relations are skewedand the heavy hitters and their frequencies are known; we provide upper and lower …,Proceedings of the 33rd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2014,60

Database-as-a-service for long-tail science,Bill Howe; Garret Cole; Emad Souroush; Paraschos Koutris; Alicia Key; Nodira Khoussainova; Leilani Battle,Abstract Database technology remains underused in science; especially in the long tail—thesmall labs and individual researchers that collectively produce the majority of scientificoutput. These researchers increasingly require iterative; ad hoc analysis over ad hocdatabases but cannot individually invest in the computational and intellectual infrastructurerequired for state-of-the-art solutions. We describe a new “delivery vector” for databasetechnology called SQLShare that emphasizes ad hoc integration; query; sharing; andvisualization over pre-defined schemas. To empower non-experts to write complex queries;we synthesize example queries from the data itself and explore limited English hints toaugment the process.

Toward practical query pricing with QueryMarket,Paraschos Koutris; Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract We develop a new pricing system; QueryMarket; for flexible query pricing in a datamarket based on an earlier theoretical framework (Koutris et al.; PODS 2012). To build sucha system; we show how to use an Integer Linear Programming formulation of the pricingproblem for a large class of queries; even when pricing is computationally hard. Further; weleverage query history to avoid double charging when queries purchased over time haveoverlapping information; or when the database is updated. We then present a technique thatfairly shares revenue when multiple sellers are involved. Finally; we implement ourapproach in a prototype and evaluate its performance on several query workloads.,proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2013,29
Optimizing large-scale Semi-Naïve datalog evaluation in hadoop,Marianne Shaw; Paraschos Koutris; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract We explore the design and implementation of a scalable Datalog system usingHadoop as the underlying runtime system. Observing that several successful projectsprovide a relational algebra-based programming interface to Hadoop; we argue that anatural extension is to add recursion to support scalable social network analysis; internettraffic analysis; and general graph query. We implement semi-naive evaluation in Hadoop;then apply a series of optimizations spanning fundamental changes to the Hadoopinfrastructure to basic configuration guidelines that collectively offer a 10x improvement inour experiments. This work lays the foundation for a more comprehensive cost-basedalgebraic optimization framework for parallel recursive Datalog queries.,*,2012,22
Querymarket demonstration: Pricing for online data markets,Paraschos Koutris; Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract Increasingly data is being bought and sold online. To facilitate such transactions;online data market-places have emerged to provide a service for sellers to price views ontheir data; and buyers to buy such views. These marketplaces neither support the sale of ad-hoc queries (that are not one of the specified views); nor do they support queries that joindatasets. We present QueryMarket; a prototype data marketplace that automaticallyextrapolates prices to ad-hoc queries; including those with joins; from the manually pricedviews. We call this capability" query-based pricing" and describe how it is superior toexisting pricing methods; and how it provides more flexible pricing for the sellers. We thenshow how QueryMarket implements query-based pricing and how it generates explanationsfor the prices it computes.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,21
The data complexity of consistent query answering for self-join-free conjunctive queries under primary key constraints,Paraschos Koutris; Jef Wijsen,Abstract A relational database is said to be uncertain if primary key constraints can possiblybe violated. A repair (or possible world) of an uncertain database is obtained by selecting amaximal number of tuples without ever selecting two distinct tuples with the same primarykey value. For any Boolean query q; CERTAINTY (q) is the problem that takes an uncertaindatabase db as input; and asks whether q is true in every repair of db. The complexity of thisproblem has been particularly studied for q ranging over the class of self-join-free Booleanconjunctive queries. A research challenge is to determine; given q; whether CERTAINTY (q)belongs to complexity classes FO; P; or coNP-complete. In this paper; we combine existingtechniques for studying the above complexity classification task.

Worst-case optimal algorithms for parallel query processing,Paraschos Koutris; Paul Beame; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we study the communication complexity for the problem of computinga conjunctive query on a large database in a parallel setting with p servers. In contrast toprevious work; where upper and lower bounds on the communication were specified forparticular structures of data (either data without skew; or data with specific types of skew); inthis work we focus on worst-case analysis of the communication cost. The goal is to findworst-case optimal parallel algorithms; similar to the work of (Ngo et al. 2012) for sequentialalgorithms. We first show that for a single round we can obtain an optimal worst-casealgorithm.

A dichotomy on the complexity of consistent query answering for atoms with simple keys,Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract: We study the problem of consistent query answering under primary key violations.In this setting; the relations in a database violate the key constraints and we are interested inmaximal subsets of the database that satisfy the constraints; which we call repairs. For aboolean query Q; the problem CERTAINTY (Q) asks whether every such repair satisfies thequery or not; the problem is known to be always in coNP for conjunctive queries. However;there are queries for which it can be solved in polynomial time. It has been conjectured thatthere exists a dichotomy on the complexity of CERTAINTY (Q) for conjunctive queries: it iseither in PTIME or coNP-complete. In this paper; we prove that the conjecture is indeed truefor the case of conjunctive queries without self-joins; where each atom has as a key either asingle attribute (simple key) or all attributes of the atom.

Distributed data deduplication,Xu Chu; Ihab F Ilyas; Paraschos Koutris,Abstract Data deduplication refers to the process of identifying tuples in a relation that referto the same real world entity. The complexity of the problem is inherently quadratic withrespect to the number of tuples; since a similarity value must be computed for every pair oftuples. To avoid comparing tuple pairs that are obviously non-duplicates; blockingtechniques are used to divide the tuples into blocks and only tuples within the same blockare compared. However; even with the use of blocking; data deduplication remains a costlyproblem for large datasets. In this paper; we show how to further speed up datadeduplication by leveraging parallelism in a shared-nothing computing environment. Ourmain contribution is a distribution strategy; called Dis-Dedup; that minimizes the maximumworkload across all worker nodes and provides strong theoretical guarantees.

A discussion on pricing relational data,Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu; Prasang Upadhyaya,Abstract There exists a growing market for structured data on the Internet today; and thismotivates a theoretical study of how relational data should be priced. We advocate for aframework where the seller defines a pricing scheme; by essentially stipulating the price ofsome queries; and the buyer is allowed to purchase data expressed by any query they wish:the system will derive the price automatically from the pricing scheme. We show that; inorder to understand pricing; one needs to understand determinacy first. We also discusssome other open problems in pricing relational data.,*,2013,14
Consistent query answering for primary keys,Paraschos Koutris; Jef Wijsen,Abstract We study the complexity of consistent query answering with respect to primary keyviolations; for self-join-free conjunctive queries. A repair of a possibly inconsistent databaseis obtained by selecting a maximal number of tuples without selecting two distinct tuples withthe same primary key value. For any Boolean query q; CERTAINTY (q) is the problem thattakes a database as input; and asks whether q is true in every repair of the database. Thecomplexity of this problem has been extensively studied for q ranging over the class of self-join-free Boolean conjunctive queries.

Online sum-radii clustering,Dimitris Fotakis; Paraschos Koutris,Abstract In Online Sum-Radii Clustering; n demand points arrive online and must beirrevocably assigned to a cluster upon arrival. The cost of each cluster is the sum of a fixedopening cost and its radius; and the objective is to minimize the total cost of the clustersopened by the algorithm. We show that the deterministic competitive ratio of Online Sum-Radii Clustering for general metric spaces is Θ (log n); where the upper bound follows froma primal–dual algorithm and holds for general metric spaces; and the lower bound is validfor ternary Hierarchically Well-Separated Trees (HSTs) and for the Euclidean plane.Combined with the results of (Csirik et al.; MFCS 2010); this result demonstrates that thedeterministic competitive ratio of Online Sum-Radii Clustering changes abruptly; fromconstant to logarithmic; when we move from the line to the plane.

The design of arbitrage-free data pricing schemes,Shaleen Deep; Paraschos Koutris,Abstract: Motivated by a growing market that involves buying and selling data over the web;we study pricing schemes that assign value to queries issued over a database. Previouswork studied pricing mechanisms that compute the price of a query by extending a dataseller's explicit prices on certain queries; or investigated the properties that a pricing functionshould exhibit without detailing a generic construction. In this work; we present a formalframework for pricing queries over data that allows the construction of general families ofpricing functions; with the main goal of avoiding arbitrage. We consider two types of pricingschemes: instance-independent schemes; where the price depends only on the structure ofthe query; and answer-dependent schemes; where the price also depends on the queryoutput. Our main result is a complete characterization of the structure of pricing functions …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.09376,2016,3

Deterministic load balancing for parallel joins,Paraschos Koutris; Nivetha Singara Vadivelu,Abstract We study the problem of distributing the tuples of a relation to a number ofprocessors organized in an r-dimensional hypercube; which is an important task for paralleljoin processing. In contrast to previous work; which proposed randomized algorithms for thetask; we ask here the question of how to construct efficient deterministic distributionstrategies that can optimally load balance the input relation. We first present some generallower bounds on the load for any dimension; these bounds depend not only on the size ofthe relation; but also on the maximum frequency of each value in the relation. We thenconstruct an algorithm for the case of 1 dimension that is optimal within a constant factor;and an algorithm for the case of 2 dimensions that is optimal within a polylogarithmic factor.Our 2-dimensional algorithm is based on an interesting connection with the vector load …,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Algorithms and Systems for MapReduce and Beyond,2016,2
Oblivious k-shot broadcasting in ad hoc radio networks,Paraschos Koutris; Aris Pagourtzis,Abstract We study distributed broadcasting protocols with few transmissions ('shots') in radionetworks of unknown topology. In particular; we examine the case in which a bound k isgiven and a node may transmit at most k times during the broadcasting protocol. We focuson oblivious algorithms; that is; algorithms where each node decides whether to transmit ornot with no consideration of the transmission history. Our main contributions are (a) a lowerbound of Ω (n 2/k) on the broadcasting time of any oblivious k-shot broadcasting algorithmand (b) an oblivious broadcasting protocol that achieves a matching upper bound; namely O(n 2/k); for every k≤√ n and an upper bound of O (n 3/2) for every k>√ n. We also initiatethe study of the behavior of general broadcasting protocols by showing an Ω (n 2) lowerbound for any adaptive 1-shot broadcasting protocol.,Proceedings of the Seventeenth Computing: The Australasian Theory Symposium-Volume 119,2011,2
Infrastructure leasing problems,Paraschos Koutris,Abstract Infrastructure problems are important for a wide variety of applications in networks;business and planning. The standard assumption for modeling these problems is that; whena resource is purchased; it can be used at any time in the future; without inducing furthercost. However; this fails to capture how time may influence the cost; in the realworld;resources can be leased for various time periods or the cost may vary according to theamount of time a resource is utilized. Motivated by this; we introduce a leasing framework forinfrastructure problems; where a resource can be purchased for various periods of time (day;week; month) with a different cost. Naturally; purchasing a resource for a longer time periodcosts more; but the average cost per day is smaller. We first examine the structure of leasingproblems and show a surprising connection to multistage stochastic optimization. Then …,*,2010,2

In particular; we examine the case in which a bound k isgiven and a node may transmit at most k times during the broadcasting protocol. We focuson almost oblivious algorithms for k-shot broadcasting; that is; algorithms where the nodesdecide whether to transmit or not with very little consideration of the transmission history. Inthis context; we show a lower bound of Ω (n 2/k) on the broadcasting time of any almostoblivious k-shot broadcasting algorithm. We also present an almost oblivious protocol thatmatches the above lower bound for every k≤√ n.,Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGACT-SIGOPS symposium on Principles of distributed computing,2010,2
Answering conjunctive queries with inequalities,Paraschos Koutris; Tova Milo; Sudeepa Roy; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we study the complexity of answering conjunctive queries (CQ) withinequalities (≠). In particular; we are interested in comparing the complexity of the querywith and without inequalities. The main contribution of our work is a novel combinatorialtechnique that enables us to use any Select-Project-Join query plan for a given CQ withoutinequalities in answering the CQ with inequalities; with an additional factor in running timethat only depends on the query. The key idea is to define a new projection operator; whichkeeps a small representation (independent of the size of the database) of the set of inputtuples that map to each tuple in the output of the projection; this representation is used toevaluate all the inequalities in the query. Second; we generalize a result by Papadimitriouand Yannakakis (1997) and give an alternative algorithm based on the color-coding …,Theory of Computing Systems,2017,1

A Guide to Formal Analysis of Join Processing in Massively Parallel Systems,Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Over the last decade; there has been an enormous increase in the volume of data that isbeing stored; processed and analyzed. In order to improve the performance of queryprocessing on such amounts of data; many modern data management systems (eg Spark[23; 28]; Hadoop [13; 9; 24]; and others [19; 14]) have resorted to the power of parallelism tospeed up computation. Parallelism enables the distribution of computation for data-intensivetasks into hundreds; or even thousands of machines; and thus significantly reduces thecompletion time for several crucial data processing tasks. In this paper; we present a surveyon recent results [18; 4; 5; 17] that study the computational complexity of mulitway joinprocessing in such massively parallel systems. Our goal is twofold. First; we introduce asimple theoretical model; called the MPC (Massively Parallel Computation) model; that …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2017,1
m-tables: Representing missing data,Bruhathi Sundarmurthy; Paraschos Koutris; Willis Lang; Jeffrey Naughton; Val Tannen,Abstract Representation systems have been widely used to capture different forms ofincomplete data in various settings. However; existing representation systems are notexpressive enough to handle the more complex scenarios of missing data that can occur inpractice: these could vary from missing attribute values; missing a known number of tuples;or even missing an unknown number of tuples. In this work; we propose a newrepresentation system called m-tables; that can represent many different types of missingdata. We show that m-tables form a closed; complete and strong representation systemunder both set and bag semantics and are strictly more expressive than conditional tablesunder both the closed and open world assumptions. We further study the complexity ofcomputing certain and possible answers in m-tables. Finally; we discuss how to" interpret" …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2017,1
Algorithmic Aspects of Parallel Data Processing,Paraschos Koutris; Semih Salihoglu; Dan Suciu,Abstract In the last decade or so we have witnessed a growing interest in processing largedata sets on large distributed clusters. The idea was pioneered by the MapReduceframework; and has been widely adopted by several other systems; including PigLatin; Hive;Scope; U-SQL; Dremmel; Spark and Myria. A large part of the complex data analysisperformed by these systems consists of a sequence of relatively simple query operations;such as joining two or more tables. This survey discusses recent algorithmic developmentsfor distributed data processing. It uses a theoretical model of parallel processing called theMassively Parallel Computation (MPC) model; which is a simplification of the BSP modelwhere the only cost is given by the amount of communication and the number ofcommunication rounds.

Compressed Representations of Conjunctive Query Results,Shaleen Deep; Paraschos Koutris,Abstract: Relational queries; and in particular join queries; often generate large outputresults when executed over huge datasets. Thus; it is often infeasible to store thematerialized output if we plan to reuse it to answer further queries over the result. Motivatedby this observation; we study the problem of constructing space-efficient {\em compressedrepresentations} of the output of conjunctive queries; with the goal of supporting the efficientevaluation of queries over the intermediate compressed result; instead of the original inputdatabase. In particular; we examine an important tradeoff: minimizing the {\em space}necessary to store the compressed result; versus minimizing the {\em answer time} and {\emdelay} when we answer queries over the result. Our main contribution is a novel datastructure; which can be tuned to trade off space for answer time. The tradeoff allows us to …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06186,2017,*

QIRANA demonstration: real time scalable query pricing,Shaleen Deep; Paraschos Koutris; Yash Bidasaria,Abstract The last decade has seen a deluge in data collection and dissemination across abroad range of areas. This phenomena has led to creation of online data markets whereentities engage in sale and purchase of data. In this scenario; the key challenge for the datamarket platform is to ensure that it allows real time; scalable; arbitrage-free pricing of userqueries. At the same time; the platform needs to flexible enough for sellers in order tocustomize the setup of the data to be sold. In this paper; we describe the demonstration of Qirana; a light weight framework that implements query-based pricing at scale. The frameworkacts as a layer between the end users (buyers and sellers) and the database.

Model-based Pricing: Do Not Pay for More than What You Learn!,Lingjiao Chen; Paraschos Koutris; Arun Kumar,Abstract While a lot of work has focused on improving the efficiency; scalability; and usabilityof machine learning (ML); little work has studied the cost of data acquisition for ML-basedanalytics. Datasets are already being bought and sold in marketplaces for various tasks;including ML. But current marketplaces force users to buy such data in whole or as fixedsubsets without any awareness of the ML tasks they are used for. This leads to sub-optimalchoices and missed opportunities for both data sellers and buyers. In this paper; we outlineour vision for a formal and practical pricing framework we call model-based pricing that aimsto resolve such issues. Our key observation is that ML users typically need only as muchdata as needed to meet their accuracy goals; which leads to novel trade-offs between price;accuracy; and runtimes.

In particular; we examine the case in which a bound k isgiven and a node may transmit at most k times during the broadcasting protocol. Initially; wefocus on oblivious algorithms for k-shot broadcasting; that is; algorithms where at each stepeach node decides whether to transmit or not with no consideration of the transmissionhistory. Our main contributions are (a) a lower bound of Ω (n 2/k) on the broadcasting time ofany oblivious k-shot broadcasting algorithm; and (b) an oblivious broadcasting protocol thatachieves a matching upper bound; namely O (n 2/k); for every k≤ n and an upper bound ofO (n 3/2) for every k> n. We also study the general case of adaptive broadcasting …,Journal of Discrete Algorithms,2017,*
Worst-Case Optimal Algorithms for Parallel Query Processing,Paul Beame; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract: In this paper; we study the communication complexity for the problem of computinga conjunctive query on a large database in a parallel setting with $ p $ servers. In contrast toprevious work; where upper and lower bounds on the communication were specified forparticular structures of data (either data without skew; or data with specific types of skew); inthis work we focus on worst-case analysis of the communication cost. The goal is to findworst-case optimal parallel algorithms; similar to the work of [18] for sequential algorithms.We first show that for a single round we can obtain an optimal worst-case algorithm. Theoptimal load for a conjunctive query $ q $ when all relations have size equal to $ M $ is $ O(M/p^{1/\psi^*}) $; where $\psi^* $ is a new query-related quantity called the edge quasi-packing number; which is different from both the edge packing number and edge cover …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.01848,2016,*
$ k $-shot Broadcasting in Ad Hoc Radio Networks,Sushanta Karmakar; Paraschos Koutris; Aris Pagourtzis; Dimitris Sakavalas,Abstract: We study distributed broadcasting protocols with few transmissions (shots') in radionetworks where the topology is unknown. In particular; we examine the case in which abound $ k $ is given and a node may transmit at most $ k $ times during the broadcastingprotocol. Initially; we focus on oblivious algorithms for $ k $-shot broadcasting; that is;algorithms where each node decides whether to transmit or not with no consideration of thetransmission history. Our main contributions are (a) a lower bound of $\Omega (n^ 2/k) $ onthe broadcasting time of any oblivious $ k $-shot broadcasting algorithm and (b) an obliviousbroadcasting protocol that achieves a matching upper bound; namely $ O (n^ 2/k) $; forevery $ k\le\sqrt {n} $ and an upper bound of $ O (n^{3/2}) $ for every $ k>\sqrt {n} $. We alsostudy the general case of adaptive broadcasting protocols where nodes decide whether …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.08393,2016,*
Query Processing for Massively Parallel Systems,Paraschos Koutris,The need to analyze and understand big data has changed the landscape of datamanagement over the last years. To process the large amounts of data available to users inboth industry and science; many modern data management systems leverage the power ofmassive parallelism. The challenge of scaling computation to thousands of processing unitsdemands that we change our thinking on how we design such systems; and on how weanalyze and design parallel algorithms. In this dissertation; I study the fundamental problemof query processing for modern massively parallel architectures. I propose a theoreticalmodel; the MPC model (Massively Parallel Computation); to analyze the performance ofparallel algorithms for query processing. In the MPC model; the data is initially evenlydistributed among p servers. The computation proceeds in rounds: each round consists of …,*,2015,*

Technical Report UW-CSE-11-03-01,Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract The availability of large data centers with tens of thousands of servers has led to thepopular adoption of massive parallelism for data analysis on large datasets. Several querylanguages exist for running queries on massively parallel architectures; some based on theMapReduce infrastructure; others using proprietary implementations. Motivated by this trend;this paper analyzes the parallel complexity of conjunctive queries. We propose a very simplemodel of parallel computation that captures these architectures; in which the complexityparameter is the number of parallel steps requiring synchronization of all servers. We studythe complexity of conjunctive queries and give a complete characterization of the querieswhich can be computed in one parallel step. These form a strict subset of hierarchicalqueries; and include flat queries like R (x; y); S (x; z); T (x; v); U (x; w); tall queries like R (x …,*,*,*
