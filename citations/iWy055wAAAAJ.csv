Practical data-oriented microaggregation for statistical disclosure control,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep Maria  Mateo-Sanz,Microaggregation is a statistical disclosure control technique for microdata disseminated instatistical databases. Raw microdata (ie; individual records or data vectors) are grouped intosmall aggregates prior to publication. Each aggregate should contain at least k data vectorsto prevent disclosure of individual information; where k is a constant value preset by the dataprotector. No exact polynomial algorithms are known to date to microaggregate optimally; ie;with minimal variability loss. Methods in the literature rank data and partition them intogroups of fixed-size; in the multivariate case; ranking is performed by projecting data vectorsonto a single axis. In this paper; candidate optimal solutions to the multivariate andunivariate microaggregation problems are characterized. In the univariate case; twoheuristics based on hierarchical clustering and genetic algorithms are introduced which …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and data Engineering,2002,575
Ordinal; continuous and heterogeneous k-anonymity through microaggregation,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract k-Anonymity is a useful concept to solve the tension between data utility andrespondent privacy in individual data (microdata) protection. However; the generalizationand suppression approach proposed in the literature to achieve k-anonymity is not equallysuited for all types of attributes:(i) generalization/suppression is one of the few possibilitiesfor nominal categorical attributes;(ii) it is just one possibility for ordinal categorical attributeswhich does not always preserve ordinality;(iii) and it is completely unsuitable for continuousattributes; as it causes them to lose their numerical meaning. Since attributes leading todisclosure (and thus needing k-anonymization) may be nominal; ordinal and alsocontinuous; it is important to devise k-anonymization procedures which preserve thesemantics of each attribute type as much as possible. We propose in this paper to use …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,382
Efficient remote data possession checking in critical information infrastructures,Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Antoni Martinez-Balleste; Yves Deswarte; Jean-Jacques Quisquater,Checking data possession in networked information systems such as those related to criticalinfrastructures (power facilities; airports; data vaults; defense systems; etc.) is a matter ofcrucial importance. Remote data possession checking protocols permit to check that aremote server can access an uncorrupted file in such a way that the verifier does not need toknow beforehand the entire file that is being verified. Unfortunately; current protocols onlyallow a limited number of successive verifications or are impractical from the computationalpoint of view. In this paper; we present a new remote data possession checking protocolsuch that: 1) it allows an unlimited number of file integrity verifications; 2) its maximumrunning time can be chosen at set-up time and traded off against storage at the verifier.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,327
A quantitative comparison of disclosure control methods for microdata,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenc Torra,As described in Chapter 5; there is a plethora of statistical disclosure control (SDC) methodsto protect microdata. This chapter provides guidance in choosing a particular SDC methodby comparing some of the methods discussed in Chapter 5 on the basis of both informationloss and disclosure risk. Information loss can be readily quantified using analyticalmeasures (either generic or data-use-specific). It is far more difficult to assess disclosure riskin a way that is both analytical and applicable to all methods. For this reason; our approachto disclosure risk evaluation is empirical; based on reidentification experiments carried outusing record-linkage algorithms.,Confidentiality; disclosure and data access: theory and practical applications for statistical agencies,2001,314
A provably secure additive and multiplicative privacy homomorphism,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Privacy homomorphisms (PHs) are encryption transformations mapping a set ofoperations on cleartext to another set of operations on ciphertext. If addition is one of theciphertext operations; then it has been shown that a PH is insecure against a chosen-cleartext attack. Thus; a PH allowing full arithmetic on encrypted data can be at best secureagainst known-cleartext attacks. We present one such PH (none was known so far) whichcan be proven secure against known-cleartext attacks; as long as the ciphertext space ismuch larger than the cleartext space. Some applications to delegation of sensitivecomputing and data and to e-gambling are briefly outlined.,International Conference on Information Security,2002,312

Disclosure control methods and information loss for microdata,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenc Torra,Statistical disclosure control (SDC) seeks to modify statistical data so that they can bepublished without giving away confidential information that can be linked to specificrespondents. The challenge for SDC is to achieve this modification with minimum loss of thedetail and accuracy sought by database users. SDC methods for microdata are usuallyknown as masking methods; of which there is a wide range. From the point of view of theiroperational principles; current masking methods fall into the following two categories(Willenborg and De Waal 2001):• Perturbative. The microdata set is distorted beforepublication. In this way; unique combinations of scores in the original dataset may disappearand new unique combinations may appear in the perturbed dataset; such confusion isbeneficial for preserving statistical confidentiality. The perturbation method used should …,Confidentiality; disclosure; and data access: theory and practical applications for statistical agencies,2001,218
A new privacy homomorphism and applications,Josep Domingo i Ferrer,Abstract An additive and multiplicative privacy homomorphism is an encryption functionmapping addition and multiplication of cleartext data into two operations on encrypted data.One such privacy homomorphism is introduced which has the novel property of seemingsecure against a known-cleartext attack. An application to multilevel statistical computationis presented; namely classified retrieval of exact statistics from unclassified computation ondisclosure-protected (perturbed) data.,Information Processing Letters,1996,212
A scalable robust authentication protocol for secure vehicular communications,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Agusti Solanas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Existing authentication protocols to secure vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) raisechallenges such as certificate distribution and revocation; avoidance of computation andcommunication bottlenecks; and reduction of the strong reliance on tamper-proof devices.This paper efficiently copes with these challenges with a decentralized group-authenticationprotocol in the sense that the group is maintained by each roadside unit (RSU) rather thanby a centralized authority; as in most existing protocols that are employing group signatures.In our proposal; we employ each RSU to maintain and manage an on-the-fly group within itscommunication range. Vehicles entering the group can anonymously broadcast vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) messages; which can be instantly verified by the vehicles in the same group(and neighboring groups). Later; if the message is found to be false; a third party can be …,IEEE Transactions on vehicular Technology,2010,207
On the complexity of optimal microaggregation for statistical disclosure control,Anna Oganian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Statistical disclosure control (SDC); also termed inference control two decades ago;is an integral part of data security dealing with the protection of statistical data. The basicproblem in SDC is to release data in a way that does not lead to disclosure of individualinformation (high security) but preserves the informational content as much as possible (lowinformation loss). SDC is dual with data mining in the sense that progress of data miningtechniques forces official statistics to continuously improve SDC techniques: the morepowerful the inferences that can be made on a released data set; the more protection isneeded so that no inference jeopardizes the privacy of individual respondents' data. Thispaper deals with the computational complexity of optimal microaggregation; where optimalmeans yielding minimal information loss for a fixed security level.

Balanced trustworthiness; safety; and privacy in vehicle-to-vehicle communications,Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Ursula González-Nicolás,Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are being designed to improve traffic safety andefficiency. To meet this goal; the messages disseminated in VANETs must be trustworthy.We propose a privacy-preserving system that guarantees message trustworthiness invehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Vehicle privacy is provided as long as a vehicledoes not attempt to endorse the same message more than once. In spite of a messagehaving been validly endorsed; if it is later found to be false; the system offers the possibilityof a posteriori tracing the message generator and its endorsers. Our proposal demonstratesa number of distinctive features. The system is equipped with both a priori and a posterioricountermeasures. The threshold used for a priori endorsement can adaptively changeaccording to the message urgency and traffic context; rather than being preset in the …,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2010,184
Asymmetric group key agreement,Qianhong Wu; Yi Mu; Willy Susilo; Bo Qin; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract A group key agreement (GKA) protocol allows a set of users to establish a commonsecret via open networks. Observing that a major goal of GKAs for most applications is toestablish a confidential channel among group members; we revisit the group key agreementdefinition and distinguish the conventional (symmetric) group key agreement fromasymmetric group key agreement (ASGKA) protocols. Instead of a common secret key; onlya shared encryption key is negotiated in an ASGKA protocol. This encryption key isaccessible to attackers and corresponds to different decryption keys; each of which is onlycomputable by one group member. We propose a generic construction of one-roundASGKAs based on a new primitive referred to as aggregatable signature-based broadcast(ASBB); in which the public key can be simultaneously used to verify signatures and …,Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques,2009,163
A methodology for direct and indirect discrimination prevention in data mining,Sara Hajian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Data mining is an increasingly important technology for extracting useful knowledge hiddenin large collections of data. There are; however; negative social perceptions about datamining; among which potential privacy invasion and potential discrimination. The latterconsists of unfairly treating people on the basis of their belonging to a specific group.Automated data collection and data mining techniques such as classification rule mininghave paved the way to making automated decisions; like loan granting/denial; insurancepremium computation; etc. If the training data sets are biased in what regards discriminatory(sensitive) attributes like gender; race; religion; etc.; discriminatory decisions may ensue. Forthis reason; anti-discrimination techniques including discrimination discovery andprevention have been introduced in data mining. Discrimination can be either direct or …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Enginering,2013,150
Comparing SDC methods for microdata on the basis of information loss and disclosure risk,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep M Mateo-Sanz; Vicenç Torra,Abstract: We present in this paper the first empirical comparison of SDC methods formicrodata which encompasses both continuous and categorical microdata. Based on re-identification experiments; we try to optimize the tradeoff between information loss anddisclosure risk. First; relevant SDC methods for continuous and categorical microdata areidentified. Then generic information loss measures (not targeted to specific data uses) aredefined; both in the continuous and the categorical case. Disclosure risk is assessed usingempirical re-identification. Two approaches to empirical re-identification are used: Euclideanrecord linkage and probabilistic record linkage. The results of this comparison will be usedto come up with better SDC for microdata in the recently started EU-funded project CASC.,Pre-proceedings of ETK-NTTS,2001,147
Efficient multivariate data-oriented microaggregation,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Antoni Martínez-Ballesté; Josep Maria Mateo-Sanz; Francesc Sebé,Abstract Microaggregation is a family of methods for statistical disclosure control (SDC) ofmicrodata (records on individuals and/or companies); that is; for masking microdata so thatthey can be released while preserving the privacy of the underlying individuals. Theprinciple of microaggregation is to aggregate original database records into small groupsprior to publication. Each group should contain at least k records to prevent disclosure ofindividual information; where k is a constant value preset by the data protector. Recently;microaggregation has been shown to be useful to achieve k-anonymity; in addition to itbeing a good masking method.

A critique of k-anonymity and some of its enhancements,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,k-Anonymity is a privacy property requiring that all combinations of key attributes in adatabase be repeated at least for k records. It has been shown that k-anonymity alone doesnot always ensure privacy. A number of sophistications of k-anonymity have been proposed;like p-sensitive k-anonymity; l-diversity and t-closeness. This paper explores theshortcomings of those properties; none of which turns out to be completely convincing.,Availability; Reliability and Security; 2008. ARES 08.

Trustworthy privacy-preserving car-generated announcements in vehicular ad hoc networks,Vanesa Daza; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé; Alexandre Viejo,Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) allow vehicle-to-vehicle communication and; inparticular; vehicle-generated announcements. Provided that the trustworthiness of suchannouncements can be guaranteed; they can greatly increase the safety of driving. A newsystem for vehicle-generated announcements is presented that is secure against externaland internal attackers attempting to send fake messages. Internal attacks are thwarted byusing an endorsement mechanism based on threshold signatures. Our system outperformsprevious proposals in message length and computational cost. Three different privacy-preserving variants of the system are also described to ensure that vehicles volunteering togenerate and/or endorse trustworthy announcements do not have to sacrifice their privacy.,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2009,108
Record linkage methods for multidatabase data mining,Vicenç Torra; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Record linkage is one of the existing preprocessing techniques used for data cleaning for distributedand non-homogoneous databases. Such databases contain information about the same individualsdescribed using the same vari- ables that; frequently; do not match due to accidental distortionof the datal. Record linkage techniques are applied in such cases to find the records that correspondto the same individuals and to make databases consistent. Multi- database mining; that typicallycombines databases from different sources and; therefore; non-homogeneous also benefits fromthese tools. This chapter describes existing mechanisms for re-identifying those pairs of recordsin two different data files corresponding to the same individual. We review in this chapter recordlinkage techniques in the case where the files share a set of variables. Techniques for files notsharing any variable have recently been proposed in [10] and will not be discussed here …,*,2003,105
From t-closeness-like privacy to postrandomization via information theory,David Rebollo-Monedero; Jordi Forne; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,t-Closeness is a privacy model recently defined for data anonymization. A data set is said tosatisfy t-closeness if; for each group of records sharing a combination of key attributes; thedistance between the distribution of a confidential attribute in the group and the distributionof the attribute in the entire data set is no more than a threshold t. Here; we define a privacymeasure in terms of information theory; similar to t-closeness. Then; we use the tools of thattheory to show that our privacy measure can be achieved by the postrandomization method(PRAM) for masking in the discrete case; and by a form of noise addition in the general case.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,101
Disclosure risk assessment in statistical microdata protection via advanced record linkage,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract The performance of Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) methods for microdata(also called masking methods) is measured in terms of the utility and the disclosure riskassociated to the protected microdata set. Empirical disclosure risk assessment based onrecord linkage stands out as a realistic and practical disclosure risk assessmentmethodology which is applicable to every conceivable masking method. The intruder isassumed to know an external data set; whose records are to be linked to those in theprotected data set; the percent of correctly linked record pairs is a measure of disclosure risk.This paper reviews conventional record linkage; which assumes shared variables betweenthe external and the protected data sets; and then shows that record linkage—and thusdisclosure—is still possible without shared variables.,Statistics and Computing,2003,89
Reference data sets to test and compare SDC methods for protection of numerical microdata,Ruth Brand; J Domingo-Ferrer; JM Mateo-Sanz,During the CASC Research Meeting held in April 2002 in Plymouth; the need was detectedfor reference data sets to test and compare microdata SDC methods. This document is a non-scheduled joint CASC deliverable by Destatis and URV and contains the description of threedata sets which are proposed as reference data for numerical microdata protection. Thethree data sets are described below and are called “CENSUS”;“EIA” and “Tarragona”. The“CENSUS” and “Tarragona” data sets have been used by the URV team in theirpublications. The “EIA” data set is proposed by Ruth Brand (Destatis) as an additional andsomewhat larger data set. All three data sets seem to represent reasonably well real datasets used in business statistics.,European Project IST-2000-25069 CASC,2002,87
V-MDAV: a multivariate microaggregation with variable group size,Agusti Solanas; Antoni Martinez-Balleste; J Domingo-Ferrer,Summary. Microaggregation is a clustering problem with minimum size constraints on theresulting clusters or groups; the number of groups is unconstrained and the within-grouphomogeneity should be maximized. In the context of privacy in statistical databases;microaggregation is a well-known approach to obtaining anonymized versions ofconfidential microdata. Optimally solving microaggregation on multivariate data sets isknown to be difficult (NP-hard). Therefore; heuristic methods are used in practice. This paperpresents a new heuristic approach to multivariate microaggregation; which provides variable-sized groups (and thus higher within-group homogeneity) with a computational cost similarto the one of fixed-size microaggregation heuristics.,17th COMPSTAT Symposium of the IASC; Rome,2006,86

For allthe above (and similar) technologies to fully unleash their potential in the industry andsociety; there are two pillars that cannot be overlooked: security and privacy. Both propertiesare especially relevant if we focus on ad-hoc wireless networks; where devices are requiredto cooperate–eg from routing to the application layer–to attain their goals. In this paper; wesurvey emerging and established wireless ad-hoc technologies and we highlight theirsecurity/privacy features and deficiencies.

A survey of inference control methods for privacy-preserving data mining,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Inference control in databases; also known as Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC); is aboutprotecting data so they can be published without revealing confidential information that canbe linked to specific individuals among those to which the data correspond. This is animportant application in several areas; such as official statistics; health statistics; e-commerce (sharing of consumer data); etc. Since data protection ultimately means datamodification; the challenge for SDC is to achieve protection with minimum loss of theaccuracy sought by database users. In this chapter; we survey the current state of the art inSDC methods for protecting individual data (microdata). We discuss several information lossand disclosure risk measures and analyze several ways of combining them to assess theperformance of the various methods.

Probabilistic information loss measures in confidentiality protection of continuous microdata,Josep M Mateo-Sanz; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé,Abstract Inference control for protecting the privacy of microdata (individual data) should tryto optimize the tradeoff between data utility (low information loss) and protection againstdisclosure (low disclosure risk). Whereas risk measures are bounded between 0 and 1;information loss measures proposed in the literature for continuous data are unbounded;which makes it awkward to trade off information loss for disclosure risk. We propose in thispaper to use probabilities to define bounded information loss measures for continuousmicrodata.,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,85
Privacy and Data Protection by Design-from policy to engineering,George Danezis; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Marit Hansen; Jaap-Henk Hoepman; Daniel Le Metayer; Rodica Tirtea; Stefan Schiffner,Abstract: Privacy and data protection constitute core values of individuals and of democraticsocieties. There have been decades of debate on how those values-and legal obligations-can be embedded into systems; preferably from the very beginning of the design process.One important element in this endeavour are technical mechanisms; known as privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Their effectiveness has been demonstrated by researchersand in pilot implementations. However; apart from a few exceptions; eg; encryption becamewidely used; PETs have not become a standard and widely used component in systemdesign. Furthermore; for unfolding their full benefit for privacy and data protection; PETsneed to be rooted in a data governance strategy to be applied in practice.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1501.03726,2015,82
User-private information retrieval based on a peer-to-peer community,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Maria Bras-Amorós; Qianhong Wu; Jesús Manjón,Abstract Private information retrieval (PIR) is normally modeled as a game between twoplayers: a user and a database. The user wants to retrieve some item from the databasewithout the latter learning which item is retrieved. Most current PIR protocols are ill-suited toprovide PIR from a search engine or large database:(i) their computational complexity islinear in the size of the database;(ii) they assume active cooperation by the database serverin the PIR protocol. If the database cannot be assumed to cooperate; a peer-to-peer (P2P)user community is a natural alternative to achieve some query anonymity: a user gets herqueries submitted on her behalf by other users in the P2P community. In this way; thedatabase still learns which item is being retrieved; but it cannot obtain the real queryhistories of users; which become diffused among the peer users. We name this relaxation …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2009,79
Simulatable certificateless two-party authenticated key agreement protocol,Lei Zhang; Futai Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Key agreement (KA) allows two or more users to negotiate a secret session keyamong them over an open network. Authenticated key agreement (AKA) is a KA protocolenhanced to prevent active attacks. AKA can be achieved using a public-key infrastructure(PKI) or identity-based cryptography. However; the former suffers from a heavy certificatemanagement burden while the latter is subject to the so-called key escrow problem.Recently; certificateless cryptography was introduced to mitigate these limitations. In thispaper; we first propose a security model for AKA protocols using certificateless cryptography.Following this model; we then propose a simulatable certificateless two-party AKA protocol.Security is proven under the standard computational Diffie–Hellman (CDH) and bilinearDiffie–Hellman (BDH) assumptions. Our protocol is efficient and practical; because it …,Information Sciences,2010,78

Discrimination prevention in data mining for intrusion and crime detection,Sara Hajian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Antoni Martinez-Balleste,Automated data collection has fostered the use of data mining for intrusion and crimedetection. Indeed; banks; large corporations; insurance companies; casinos; etc. areincreasingly mining data about their customers or employees in view of detecting potentialintrusion; fraud or even crime. Mining algorithms are trained from datasets which may bebiased in what regards gender; race; religion or other attributes. Furthermore; mining is oftenoutsourced or carried out in cooperation by several entities. For those reasons;discrimination concerns arise. Potential intrusion; fraud or crime should be inferred fromobjective misbehavior; rather than from sensitive attributes like gender; race or religion.

LHS-based hybrid microdata vs rank swapping and microaggregation for numeric microdata protection,Ramesh A Dandekar; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé,Abstract In previous work by Domingo-Ferrer et al.; rank swapping and multivariatemicroaggregation has been identified as well-performing masking methods for microdataprotection. Recently; Dandekar et al. proposed using synthetic microdata; as an option; inplace of original data by using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) technique. The LHS methodfocuses on mimicking univariate as well as multivariate statistical characteristics of originaldata. The LHS-based synthetic data does not allow one to one comparison with originaldata. This prevents estimating the overall information loss by using current measures. In thispaper we utilize unique features of LHS method to create hybrid data sets and evaluate theirperformance relative to rank swapping and multivariate microaggregation using generalizedinformation loss and disclosure risk measures.,*,2002,76
Enhancing data utility in differential privacy via microaggregation-based $ $ k $ $ k-anonymity,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; Sergio Martínez,Abstract It is not uncommon in the data anonymization literature to oppose the “old” k k-anonymity model to the “new” differential privacy model; which offers more robust privacyguarantees. Yet; it is often disregarded that the utility of the anonymized results provided bydifferential privacy is quite limited; due to the amount of noise that needs to be added to theoutput; or because utility can only be guaranteed for a restricted type of queries. This is incontrast with k k-anonymity mechanisms; which make no assumptions on the uses ofanonymized data while focusing on preserving data utility from a general perspective. In thispaper; we show that a synergy between differential privacy and k k-anonymity can be found:k k-anonymity can help improving the utility of differentially private responses to arbitraryqueries. We devote special attention to the utility improvement of differentially private …,The VLDB Journal,2014,72

Microaggregation for database and location privacy,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Data aggregation is a central principle underlying many applications in computerscience; from artificial intelligence to data security and privacy. Microaggregation is a specialclustering problem where the goal is to cluster a set of points into groups of at least k pointsin such a way that groups are as homogeneous as possible. A usual homogeneity criterionis the minimization of the within-groups sum of squares. Microaggregation appeared inconnection with anonymization of statistical databases. When discussing microaggregationfor information systems; points are database records. This paper extends the use ofmicroaggregation for k-anonymity to implement the recent property of p-sensitive k-anonymity in a more unified and less disruptive way.

Regression for ordinal variables without underlying continuous variables,Vicenç Torra; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep M Mateo-Sanz; Michael Ng,Abstract Several techniques exist nowadays for continuous (ie numerical) data analysis andmodeling. However; although part of the information gathered by companies; statisticaloffices and other institutions is numerical; a large part of it is represented using categoricalvariables in ordinal or nominal scales. Techniques for model building on categorical dataare required to take advantage of such a wealth of information. In this paper; currentapproaches to regression for ordinal data are reviewed and a new proposal is describedwhich has the advantage of not assuming any latent continuous variable underlying thedependent ordinal variable. Estimation in the new approach can be implemented usinggenetic algorithms. An artificial example is presented to illustrate the feasibility of theproposal.,Information Sciences,2006,62

However;when data are encrypted using an ABE scheme; key management is difficult if there is alarge number of users from various backgrounds. In this paper; we elaborate on ABE andpropose a new versatile cryptosystem referred to as ciphertext-policy hierarchical ABE (CP-HABE). In a CP-HABE scheme; the attributes are organized in a matrix and the users havinghigher-level attributes can delegate their access rights to the users at a lower level. Thesefeatures enable a CP-HABE system to host a large number of users from differentorganizations by delegating keys; eg; enabling efficient data sharing among …,Information Sciences,2014,61
Privacy homomorphisms for social networks with private relationships,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Alexandre Viejo; Francesc Sebé; Úrsula González-Nicolás,Abstract Enabling private relationships in social networks is an important issue recentlyraised in the literature. We describe in this paper a new protocol which offers privaterelationships allowing resource access through indirect relationships without requiring amediating trusted third party (although an optimistic trusted third party is used which onlyacts in case of conflict). Thanks to homomorphic encryption; our scheme prevents theresource owner from learning the relationships and trust levels between the users whocollaborate in the resource access. In this way; the number of users who might refusecollaboration due to privacy concerns is minimized. This results in increased resourceavailability; as the chances that certain nodes become isolated at a given period of time arereduced. Empirical evidence is provided about the proposed protocol being scalable and …,Computer Networks,2008,59
Simple collusion-secure fingerprinting schemes for images,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Herrera-Joancomartí,This paper describes a robust watermarking algorithm and a collusion-secure fingerprintingscheme based on it. Watermarking robustness is obtained by using the JPEG algorithm todecide mark location and magnitude; the proposed algorithm supports multiple marking. Theproperties of dual binary Hamming codes are exploited to obtain a fingerprinting schemesecure against collusion of two buyers. The fingerprinting construction proposed here issimpler than previous collusion-secure proposals.,Information Technology: Coding and Computing; 2000. Proceedings. International Conference on,2000,59
Anonymous fingerprinting based on committed oblivious transfer,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Thwarting unlawful redistribution of information sold electronically is a majorproblem of information-based electronic commerce. Anonymous fingerprinting hasappeared as a technique for copyright protection which is compatible with buyer anonymityin electronic transactions. However; the complexity of known algorithms for anonymousfingerprinting deters their practical implementation; since they rely either on securemultiparty computation or on general zero-knowledge proofs. A scheme for anonymousfingerprinting based on committed oblivious transfer is presented in this paper where allcomputations can be performed efficiently.,International Workshop on Public Key Cryptography,1999,58
Hybrid microdata using microaggregation,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Úrsula González-Nicolás,Abstract Statistical disclosure control (also known as privacy-preserving data mining) ofmicrodata is about releasing data sets containing the answers of individual respondentsprotected in such a way that:(i) the respondents corresponding to the released recordscannot be re-identified;(ii) the released data stay analytically useful. Usually; the protecteddata set is generated by either masking (ie perturbing) the original data or by generatingsynthetic (ie simulated) data preserving some pre-selected statistics of the original data.Masked data may approximately preserve a broad range of distributional characteristics;although very few of them (if any) are exactly preserved; on the other hand; synthetic dataexactly preserve the pre-selected statistics and may seem less disclosive than masked data;but they do not preserve at all any statistics other than those pre-selected. Hybrid data …,Information Sciences,2010,57
Rule protection for indirect discrimination prevention in data mining,Sara Hajian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Antoni Martinez-Balleste,Abstract Services in the information society allow automatically and routinely collecting largeamounts of data. Those data are often used to train classification rules in view of makingautomated decisions; like loan granting/denial; insurance premium computation; etc. If thetraining datasets are biased in what regards sensitive attributes like gender; race; religion;etc.; discriminatory decisions may ensue. Direct discrimination occurs when decisions aremade based on biased sensitive attributes. Indirect discrimination occurs when decisionsare made based on non-sensitive attributes which are strongly correlated with biasedsensitive attributes. This paper discusses how to clean training datasets and outsourceddatasets in such a way that legitimate classification rules can still be extracted but indirectlydiscriminating rules cannot.,International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2011,55
Post-masking optimization of the tradeoff between information loss and disclosure risk in masked microdata sets,Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep Maria Mateo-Sanz; Vicenç Torra,Abstract Previous work by these authors has been directed to measuring the performance ofmicrodata masking methods in terms of information loss and disclosure risk. Based on theproposed metrics; we show here how to improve the performance of any particular maskingmethod. In particular; post-masking optimization is discussed for preserving as much aspossible the moments of first and second order (and thus multivariate statistics) withoutincreasing the disclosure risk. The technique proposed can also be used for syntheticmicrodata generation and can be extended to preservation of all moments up to m-th order;for any m.,*,2002,55
Median‐based aggregation operators for prototype construction in ordinal scales,Josep Domingo‐Ferrer; Vicenc Torra,Abstract This article studies aggregation operators in ordinal scales for their application toclustering (more specifically; to microaggregation for statistical disclosure risk). In particular;we consider these operators in the process of prototype construction. This study analyzesmain aggregation operators for ordinal scales [plurality rule; medians; Sugeno integrals (SI);and ordinal weighted means (OWM); among others] and shows the difficulties for theirapplication in this particular setting. Then; we propose two approaches to solve thedrawbacks and we study their properties. Special emphasis is given to the study ofmonotonicity because the operator is proven nonsatisfactory for this property. Exhaustiveempirical work shows that in most practical situations; this cannot be considered aproblem.© 2003 Wiley Periodicals; Inc.,International Journal of intelligent systems,2003,54
Location privacy in location-based services: Beyond TTP-based schemes,Agusti Solanas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Antoni Martínez-Ballesté,Abstract. Location-Based Services (LBS) are gaining importance due to the advances inmobile networks and positioning technologies. Nevertheless; the wide deployment of LBScan jeopardise the privacy of their users; so ensuring user privacy is paramount to thesuccess of those services. This article surveys the most relevant techniques for guaranteeinglocation privacy to LBS users. The rigid dichotomy between schemes which rely on TrustedThird Parties (TTP-based) and those which do not (TTP-free) is emphasised. Also; theconvenience of both approaches is discussed and some ideas on the future of locationprivacy in these services are sketched.,Proceedings of the 1st international workshop on privacy in location-based applications (PILBA),2008,52
Short 3-secure fingerprinting codes for copyright protection,Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract A construction is presented to obtain 3-secure fingerprinting codes for copyrightprotection. Resistance against collusions of up to three buyers is achieved with a codewordlength dramatically shorter than the one required by the general Boneh-Shaw construction.Thus the proposed fingerprints require much less embedding capacity. Due to their veryclandestine nature; collusions tend to involve a small number of buyers; so that there isplenty of use for codes providing cost-effective protection against collusions of size up to 3.,Australasian Conference on Information Security and Privacy,2002,52
Short collusion-secure fingerprints based on dual binary Hamming codes,J Domingo-Ferrer; J Herrera-Joancomarti,Electronic copyright protection is increasingly dependent on fingerprinting and watermarkingtechniques. The properties of dual binary Hamming codes are exploited to obtainfingerprinting scheme secure against collusion of two buyers. The advantage over previousproposals is that collusion security is obtained using well-known and shorter length errorcorrecting codes.,Electronics Letters,2000,52
A three-dimensional conceptual framework for database privacy,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Database privacy is an ambiguous concept; whose meaning is usually context-dependent. We give a conceptual framework for technologies in that field in terms of threedimensions; depending on whose privacy is considered: i) respondent privacy (to avoid re-identification of patients or other individuals to whom the database records refer); ii) ownerprivacy (to ensure that the owner must not give away his dataset); and iii) user privacy (topreserve the privacy of queries submitted by a data user). Examples are given to clarify whythese are three independent dimensions. Some of the pitfalls related to combining theprivacy interests of respondents; owners and users are discussed. An assessment ofdatabase privacy technologies against the three dimensions is also included.,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2007,49
Anonymous fingerprinting of electronic information with automatic identification of redistributors,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Fingerprinting is a technique for protecting intellectual ownership of electronic information.Anonymous fingerprinting schemes were recently proposed to allow a seller to fingerprintinformation sold to a buyer without knowing the identity of the buyer and without the sellerseeing the fingerprinted copy. Finding a (redistributed) fingerprinted copy enables the sellerto find out and prove to third parties whose copy it was. The authors present the firstanonymous fingerprinting scheme in which the help of a registration authority is not requiredin order to identify a redistributor.,Electronics Letters,1998,49
Resampling for statistical confidentiality in contingency tables,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep M Mateo-Sanz,Abstract Resampling schemes; and especially the bootstrap method; were proposed as asubclass of perturbation methods to ensure statistical confidentiality in statistical databases.Later; a method based on bootstrapping was presented to achieve the more specific task ofanonymising contingency tables. In this paper; we argue that the latter proposal is eitherinefficient from a computational point of view or insecure due to a high disclosure risk. Forillustration; we show that this bootstrap-based procedure for contingency tables can beemulated and outperformed by a cell-oriented random perturbation method; whosecomplexity can be theoretically quantified. For a given disclosure risk; our cell-orientedperturbation method is more efficient. For a given computational complexity; our cell-oriented method exhibits a lower disclosure risk. More generally; it can be concluded that …,Computers & Mathematics with Applications,1999,48
Identity-based remote data possession checking in public clouds,Huaqun Wang; Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Checking remote data possession is of crucial importance in public cloud storage. It enablesthe users to check whether their outsourced data have been kept intact without downloadingthe original data. The existing remote data possession checking (RDPC) protocols havebeen designed in the PKI (public key infrastructure) setting. The cloud server has to validatethe users' certificates before storing the data uploaded by the users in order to prevent spam.This incurs considerable costs since numerous users may frequently upload data to thecloud server. This study addresses this problem with a new model of identity-based RDPC(ID-RDPC) protocols. The authors present the first ID-RDPC protocol proven to be secureassuming the hardness of the standard computational Diffie-Hellman problem.

h (k)-Private information retrieval from privacy-uncooperative queryable databases,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Agusti Solanas; Jordi Castellà-Roca,Purpose–This paper aims to address the privacy problem associated with the use of internetsearch engines. The purpose of the paper is to propose and validate a set of methods andprotocols to guarantee the privacy of users' queries. Design/methodology/approach–In thispaper h (k)-private information retrieval (h (k)-PIR) is defined as a practical compromisebetween computational efficiency and privacy. Also presented are h (k)-PIR protocols thatcan be used to query any database; which does not even need to know that the user is tryingto preserve his or her privacy. Findings–The proposed methods are able to properly protectthe privacy of users' queries. When internet users apply the protocols; search engines (egGoogle) are not able to determine unequivocally the real interests of their users. The qualityof the results does decrease with the increase in privacy; but the obtained trade-off is …,Online Information Review,2009,47
Microaggregation-and permutation-based anonymization of movement data,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Rolando Trujillo-Rasua,Abstract Movement data; that is; trajectories of mobile objects; are automatically collected inhuge quantities by technologies such as GPS; GSM or RFID; among others. Publishing andexploiting such data is essential to improve transportation; to understand the dynamics of theeconomy in a region; etc. However; there are obvious threats to the privacy of individuals iftheir trajectories are published in a way which allows re-identification of the individualbehind a trajectory. We contribute to the literature on privacy-preserving publication oftrajectories by presenting a distance measure for trajectories which naturally considers bothspatial and temporal aspects of trajectories; is computable in polynomial time; and cancluster trajectories not defined over the same time span. Our distance measure can benaturally instantiated using other existing similarity measures for trajectories that are …,Information Sciences,2012,46
Fast generation of accurate synthetic microdata,Josep Maria Mateo-Sanz; Antoni Martínez-Ballesté; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Generation of a synthetic microdata set that reproduces the statistical properties ofan original microdata set is a promising approach to statistical disclosure control (SDC) ofmicrodata. In this paper; a new method for generating continuous synthetic microdata isproposed. The covariance matrix and the univariate statistics of the original data set areexactly preserved. The method is non-iterative and its complexity grows linearly with thenumber of records to be protected.,International Workshop on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2004,46
Multi-application smart cards and encrypted data; processing,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Some existing approaches to multi-application smart card design rely on the cardcontaining data and importing the code of functions (methods) to be performed on data. Acomplementary solution is proposed in this paper to relax the requirement-or rather thebottleneck-that all confidential data and processing be supported by the card. Our approachis based on running some applications outside the card using encrypted data processing;specifically privacy homomorphisms. Examples of privacy homomorphisms are given; one ofwhich is very recent and allows full arithmetic on encrypted data while remaining secureagainst known-cleartext attacks.,Future Generation Computer Systems,1997,44
Probabilistic k-anonymity through microaggregation and data swapping,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,k-Anonymity is a privacy property used to limit the risk of re-identification in a microdata set.A data set satisfying k-anonymity consists of groups of k records which are indistinguishableas far as their quasi-identifier attributes are concerned. Hence; the probability of re-identifying a record within a group is 1/k. We introduce the probabilistic k-anonymityproperty; which relaxes the indistinguishability requirement of k-anonymity and only requiresthat the probability of re-identification be the same as in k-anonymity. Two computationalheuristics to achieve probabilistic k-anonymity based on data swapping are proposed:MDAV microaggregation on the quasi-identifiers plus swapping; and individual rankingmicroaggregation on individual confidential attributes plus swapping. We reportexperimental results; where we compare the utility of original; k-anonymous and …,Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); 2012 IEEE International Conference on,2012,43
Bridging broadcast encryption and group key agreement,Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Lei Zhang; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Oriol Farras,Abstract Broadcast encryption (BE) schemes allow a sender to securely broadcast to anysubset of members but requires a trusted party to distribute decryption keys. Group keyagreement (GKA) protocols enable a group of members to negotiate a common encryptionkey via open networks so that only the members can decrypt the ciphertexts encrypted underthe shared encryption key; but a sender cannot exclude any particular member fromdecrypting the ciphertexts. In this paper; we bridge these two notions with a hybrid primitivereferred to as contributory broadcast encryption (CBE). In this new primitive; a group ofmembers negotiate a common public encryption key while each member holds a decryptionkey. A sender seeing the public group encryption key can limit the decryption to a subset ofmembers of his choice. Following this model; we propose a CBE scheme with short …,International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security,2011,43
Provably secure one-round identity-based authenticated asymmetric group key agreement protocol,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract The newly introduced notion of asymmetric group key agreement (AGKA) enablesexternal users to securely send messages to group members. The existing AGKA is onlysecure against passive attacks which are too weak to capture the attacks in the real world. Inthis paper; we formalize an active security model for identity-based authenticatedasymmetric group key agreement (IB-AAGKA). We then present an efficient identity-basedbatch multi-signature; from which we construct an IB-AAGKA protocol. Our protocol is provensecure under the Bilinear Diffie–Hellman Exponent (BDHE) assumption. The active securityfeature implies that the protocol can withstand more realistic attacks. The identity-basedfeature eliminates the need of certificates and solves the certificate management problem intraditional public-key cryptosystems. Finally; an effective trade-off is provided to balance …,Information sciences,2011,43
A public-key protocol for social networks with private relationships,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract The need for protecting the privacy of relationships in social networks has recentlybeen stressed in the literature. Conventional protection mechanisms in those networks dealwith the protection of resources and data; ie with deciding whether access to resources anddata held by a user (owner) should be granted to a requesting user (requestor). However;the relationships between users are also sensitive and need protection: knowing who istrusted by a user and to what extent leaks a lot of confidential information about that user.The use of symmetric key cryptography to implement private relationships in social networkshas recently been proposed. We show in this paper how to use public-key cryptography toreduce the overhead caused by private relationships.,International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2007,43
Outlier protection in continuous microdata masking,Josep Maria Mateo-Sanz; Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Masking methods protect data sets against disclosure by perturbing the originalvalues before publication. Masking causes some information loss (masked data are notexactly the same as original data) and does not completely suppress the risk of disclosurefor the individuals behind the data set. Information loss can be measured by observing thedifferences between original and masked data while disclosure risk can be measured bymeans of record linkage and confidentiality intervals. Outliers in the original data set areparticularly difficult to protect; as they correspond to extreme inviduals who stand out fromthe rest. The objective of our work is to compare; for different masking methods; theinformation loss and disclosure risk related to outliers. In this way; the protection leveloffered by different masking methods to extreme individuals can be evaluated.,International Workshop on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2004,43
Advances in inference control in statistical databases: An overview,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Inference control in statistical databases is a discipline with several other names;such as statistical disclosure control; statistical disclosure limitation; or statistical databaseprotection. Regardless of the name used; current work in this very active field is rooted in thework that was started on statistical database protection in the 70s and 80s. Massiveproduction of computerized statistics by government agencies combined with an increasingsocial importance of individual privacy has led to a renewed interest in this topic. This is anoverview of the latest research advances described in this book.,*,2002,43
Query profile obfuscation by means of optimal query exchange between users,David Rebollo-Monedero; Jordi Forne; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,We address the problem of query profile obfuscation by means of partial query exchangesbetween two users; in order for their profiles of interest to appear distorted to the informationprovider (database; search engine; etc.). We illustrate a methodology to reach mutualprivacy gain; that is; a situation where both users increase their own privacy protectionthrough collaboration in query exchange. To this end; our approach starts with amathematical formulation; involving the modeling of the users' apparent profiles asprobability distributions over categories of interest; and the measure of their privacy as thecorresponding Shannon entropy. The question of which query categories to exchangetranslates into finding optimization variables representing exchange policies; for variousoptimization objectives based on those entropies; possibly under exchange traffic …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2012,42
On the security of microaggregation with individual ranking: analytical attacks,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Anna Oganian; Àngel Torres; Josep M Mateo-Sanz,Microaggregation is a statistical disclosure control technique. Raw microdata (ie individualrecords) are grouped into small aggregates prior to publication. With fixed-size groups; eachaggregate contains k records to prevent disclosure of individual information. Individualranking is a usual criterion to reduce multivariate microaggregation to univariate case: theidea is to perform microaggregation independently for each variable in the record. Usingdistributional assumptions; we show in this paper how to find interval estimates for theoriginal data based on the microaggregated data. Such intervals can be considerablynarrower than intervals resulting from subtraction of means; and can be useful to detect lackof security in a microaggregated data set. Analytical arguments given in this paper confirmrecent empirical results about the unsafety of individual ranking microaggregation.,International Journal of Uncertainty; Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems,2002,41
Spatial-domain image watermarking robust against compression; filtering; cropping; and scaling,Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Herrera,Abstract Two robust spatial-domain watermarking algorithms for image copyright protectionare described in this paper. The first one is robust against compression; filtering andcropping. Like all published crop-proof algorithms; the one proposed here requires theoriginal image for mark recovery. Robustness against compression and filtering is obtainedby using the JPEG algorithm to decide on mark location and magnitude; robustness againstcropping is achieved through a repetition code. The second watermarking algorithm usesvisual components and is robust against compression; filtering; scaling and moderaterotations.,International Workshop on Information Security,2000,41
Anonymization of nominal data based on semantic marginality,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; Guillem Rufian-Torrell,Abstract Nominal attributes are very common in data sets about individuals; specificallymedical data like patient healthcare records. Attributes of this type tend to be sensitive due totheir personal nature. If public-use data sets need to be released; eg for clinical researchpurposes; data should be first anonymized. However; since most anonymization methodsomit data semantics when dealing with nominal attributes (eg in a medical data setdiagnosis is a nominal attribute); anonymization results in unnecessary information loss forsuch attributes; which is especially serious given their analytical importance. In this paper;we present a knowledge-based numerical mapping for nominal attributes that captures andquantifies their underlying semantics. Using this mapping; we show how to computesemantically and mathematically coherent mean; variance and covariance functions for …,Information Sciences,2013,40
Micro-aggregation-based heuristics for p-sensitive k-anonymity: one step beyond,Agusti Solanas; Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Micro-data protection is a hot topic in the field of Statistical Disclosure Control(SDC); that has gained special interest after the disclosure of 658000 queries by the AOLsearch engine in August 2006. Many algorithms; methods and properties have beenproposed to deal with micro-data disclosure; p-Sensitive k-anonymity has been recentlydefined as a sophistication of k-anonymity. This new property requires that there be at leastp different values for each confidential attribute within the records sharing a combination ofkey attributes. Like k-anonymity; the algorithm originally proposed to achieve this propertywas based on generalisations and suppressions; when data sets are numerical this hasseveral data utility problems; namely turning numerical key attributes into categorical;injecting new categories; injecting missing data; and so on. In this article; we recall the …,Proceedings of the 2008 international workshop on Privacy and anonymity in information society,2008,37

A privacy homomorphism allowing eld operations on encrypted data,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Herrera-Joancomart,Abstract Privacy homomorphisms (PHs) are encryption transformations that allow directcomputation on encrypted data. Known secure PHs allow addition and multiplication to becarried out on encrypted data; but do not allow computation of inverses. We present in thispaper a PH which allows addition; multiplication and multiplicative inverse computation tobe performed on encrypted data. An additive PH can at most be secure against a known-cleartext attack; unfortunately; in its current state the new proposal is only secure againstciphertext-only attacks.,*,1998,36
A bibliometric index based on the collaboration distance between cited and citing authors,Maria Bras-Amorós; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract The popular h-index used to measure scientific output can be described in terms ofa pool of evaluated objects (the papers); a quality function on the evaluated objects (thenumber of citations received by each paper) and a sentencing line crossing the origin;whose intersection with the graph of the quality function yields the index value (in the h-index this is a line with slope 1). Based on this abstraction; we present a new index; the c-index; in which the evaluated objects are the citations received by an author; a group ofauthors; a journal; etc.; the quality function of a citation is the collaboration distance betweenthe authors of the cited and the citing papers; and the sentencing line can take slopesbetween 0 and∞. As a result; the new index counts only those citations which are significantenough; where significance is proportional to collaboration distance. Several advantages …,Journal of Informetrics,2011,35
t-closeness through microaggregation: Strict privacy with enhanced utility preservation,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; Sergio Martinez,Microaggregation is a technique for disclosure limitation aimed at protecting the privacy ofdata subjects in microdata releases. It has been used as an alternative to generalization andsuppression to generate k-anonymous data sets; where the identity of each subject ishidden within a group of k subjects. Unlike generalization; microaggregation perturbs thedata and this additional masking freedom allows improving data utility in several ways; suchas increasing data granularity; reducing the impact of outliers; and avoiding discretization ofnumerical data. k-Anonymity; on the other side; does not protect against attribute disclosure;which occurs if the variability of the confidential values in a group of k subjects is too small.To address this issue; several refinements of k-anonymity have been proposed; amongwhich t-closeness stands out as providing one of the strictest privacy guarantees.

Fast transmission to remote cooperative groups: a new key management paradigm,Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Lei Zhang; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jesús A Manjón,The problem of efficiently and securely broadcasting to a remote cooperative group occursin many newly emerging networks. A major challenge in devising such systems is toovercome the obstacles of the potentially limited communication from the group to thesender; the unavailability of a fully trusted key generation center; and the dynamics of thesender. The existing key management paradigms cannot deal with these challengeseffectively. In this paper; we circumvent these obstacles and close this gap by proposing anovel key management paradigm. The new paradigm is a hybrid of traditional broadcastencryption and group key agreement. In such a system; each member maintains a singlepublic/secret key pair. Upon seeing the public keys of the members; a remote sender cansecurely broadcast to any intended subgroup chosen in an ad hoc way. Following this …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2013,33
Towards fuzzy c-means based microaggregation,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract National Statistical Offices collect data from respondents and then publishes them.To avoid disclosure; data is protected before the release. One of the existing maskingmethods is microaggregation. This method is based on obtaining a set of clusters (clusteringstage) and then aggregating the values of the elements in the cluster (aggregation stage). Inthis work we propose the use of fuzzy c-means in the clustering stage.,*,2002,33
A comparative study of microaggregation methods,Josep Maria Mateo Sanz; Josep Domingo Ferrer,Microaggregation is a statistical disclosure control technique for microdata. Raw microdata(ie individual records) are grouped into small aggregates prior to publication. Eachaggregate should contain at least k records to prevent disclosure of individual information.Fixed-size microaggregation consists of taking fixed-size microaggregates (size k). Data-oriented microaggregation (with variable group size) was introduced recently. Regardless ofthe group size; microaggregations on a multidimensional data set can be formed usingunivariate techniques on projected data or using multivariate techniques. This paperpresents the first method for multivariate fixed-sixe microaggregation. In addition; a real dataset is used to compare the information loss and output data quality of fixed-size vs. data-oriented; and univariate vs. multivariate microaggregation.,*,1998,33
Generalization-based privacy preservation and discrimination prevention in data publishing and mining,Sara Hajian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Oriol Farràs,Abstract Living in the information society facilitates the automatic collection of huge amountsof data on individuals; organizations; etc. Publishing such data for secondary analysis (eglearning models and finding patterns) may be extremely useful to policy makers; planners;marketing analysts; researchers and others. Yet; data publishing and mining do not comewithout dangers; namely privacy invasion and also potential discrimination of the individualswhose data are published. Discrimination may ensue from training data mining models (egclassifiers) on data which are biased against certain protected groups (ethnicity; gender;political preferences; etc.). The objective of this paper is to describe how to obtain data setsfor publication that are:(i) privacy-preserving;(ii) unbiased regarding discrimination; and (iii)as useful as possible for learning models and finding patterns.

Coprivacy: towards a theory of sustainable privacy,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract We introduce the novel concept of coprivacy or co-operative privacy to makeprivacy preservation attractive. A protocol is coprivate if the best option for a player topreserve her privacy is to help another player in preserving his privacy. Coprivacy makes anindividual's privacy preservation a goal that rationally interests other individuals: it is a matterof helping oneself by helping someone else. We formally define coprivacy in terms of Nashequilibria. We then extend the concept to: i) general coprivacy; where a helping player'sutility (ie interest) may include earning functionality and security in addition to privacy; ii)mixed coprivacy; where mixed strategies and mixed Nash equilibria are allowed with somerestrictions; iii) correlated coprivacy; in which Nash equilibria are replaced by correlatedequilibria.

From t-closeness to PRAM and noise addition via information theory,David Rebollo-Monedero; Jordi Forné; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract t-Closeness is a privacy model recently defined for data anonymization. A data setis said to satisfy t-closeness if; for each group of records sharing a combination of keyattributes; the distance between the distribution of a confidential attribute in the group andthe distribution of the attribute in the data is no more than a threshold t. We state here the t-closeness property in terms of information theory and then use the tools of that theory toshow that t-closeness can be achieved by the PRAM masking method in the discrete caseand by a form of noise addition in the general case.,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2008,31

Both started in the1970s; but the 1980s and the early 1990s saw little privacy activity on the computer …,*,2006,31
On the connections between statistical disclosure control for microdata and some artificial intelligence tools,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract Statistical disclosure control (SDC) and artificial intelligence (AI) use similar tools fordifferent purposes. This work describes the common elements of both areas to increase theirsynergy. SDC is a discipline that seeks to modify statistical data so that they can bepublished (typically by National Statistical Offices) without giving away the identity of anyindividual behind the data. When dealing with individual data (microdata in SDC jargon);both SDC procedures and AI knowledge integration procedures use similar principles fordifferent purposes (masking data vs. improving its quality). Similarities can also be found formethods evaluating re-identification risk in SDC and data mining tools for making dataconsistent. This paper explores those methodological connections with the aim ofstimulating interaction between both fields. In particular; data mining turns out to be a …,Information Sciences,2003,31
Identity-based authenticated asymmetric group key agreement protocol,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract In identity-based public-key cryptography; an entity's public key can be easilyderived from its identity. The direct derivation of public keys in identity-based public-keycryptography eliminates the need for certificates and solves certain public key managementproblems in traditional public-key cryptosystems. Recently; the notion of asymmetric groupkey agreement was introduced; in which the group members merely negotiate a commonencryption key which is accessible to any entity; but they hold respective secret decryptionkeys. In this paper; we first propose a security model for identity-based authenticatedasymmetric group key agreement (IB-AAGKA) protocols. We then propose an IB-AAGKAprotocol which is proven secure under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent assumption.,International Computing and Combinatorics Conference,2010,30
Privacy in statistical databases,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; V Torra,Privacy in statistical databases is a discipline whose purpose is to provide solutions to thetension between the social; political; economic; and corporate demand of accurateinformation; and the legal and ethical obligation to protect the privacy of the various partiesinvolved. Those parties are the respondents (the individuals and enterprises to which thedatabase records refer); the data owners (those organizations investing in data collection)and the users (the ones querying the database or the search engine; who would like theirqueries to stay confidential). Beyond law and ethics; there are also practical reasons for data-collecting agencies and corporations to invest in respondent privacy: if individualrespondents feel their privacy is guaranteed; they are likely to provide more accurateresponses. Data owner privacy is primarily motivated by practical considerations: if an …,Lecture notes in computer science,2004,30
Discrimination-and privacy-aware patterns,Sara Hajian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Anna Monreale; Dino Pedreschi; Fosca Giannotti,Abstract Data mining is gaining societal momentum due to the ever increasing availability oflarge amounts of human data; easily collected by a variety of sensing technologies. We aretherefore faced with unprecedented opportunities and risks: a deeper understanding ofhuman behavior and how our society works is darkened by a greater chance of privacyintrusion and unfair discrimination based on the extracted patterns and profiles. Considerthe case when a set of patterns extracted from the personal data of a population of individualpersons is released for a subsequent use into a decision making process; such as; eg;granting or denying credit. First; the set of patterns may reveal sensitive information aboutindividual persons in the training population and; second; decision rules based on suchpatterns may lead to unfair discrimination; depending on what is represented in the …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2015,29
On the privacy offered by (k; δ)-anonymity,Rolando Trujillo-Rasua; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract The widespread deployment of technologies with tracking capabilities; like GPS;GSM; RFID and on-line social networks; allows mass collection of spatio-temporal dataabout their users. As a consequence; several methods aimed at anonymizing spatio-temporal data before their publication have been proposed in recent years. Such methodsare based on a number of underlying privacy models. Among these models;(k; δ)-anonymityclaims to extend the widely used k-anonymity concept by exploiting the spatial uncertaintyδ≥ 0 in the trajectory recording process. In this paper; we prove that; for any δ> 0 (that is;whenever there is actual uncertainty);(k; δ)-anonymity does not offer trajectory k-anonymity;that is; it does not hide an original trajectory in a set of k indistinguishable anonymizedtrajectories. Hence; the methods based on (k; δ)-anonymity; like Never Walk Alone (NWA) …,Information Systems,2013,29
A k-anonymous approach to privacy preserving collaborative filtering,Fran Casino; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Constantinos Patsakis; Domènec Puig; Agusti Solanas,Abstract This article proposes a new technique for Privacy Preserving Collaborative Filtering(PPCF) based on microaggregation; which provides accurate recommendations estimatedfrom perturbed data whilst guaranteeing user k-anonymity. The experimental resultspresented in this article show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in protectingusers' privacy without compromising the quality of the recommendations. In this sense; theproposed approach perturbs data in a much more efficient way than other well-knownmethods such as Gaussian Noise Addition (GNA).,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2015,28
A scalable RFID authentication protocol supporting ownership transfer and controlled delegation,Albert Fernandez-Mir; Rolando Trujillo-Rasua; Jordi Castellà-Roca; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract RFID systems allow fast and automatic identification of RFID tags through awireless channel. Information on product items like name; model; purpose; expiration date;etc.; can be easily stored and retrieved from RFID tags attached to items. That is why; in thenear future; RFID tags can be an active part of our everyday life when interacting with itemsaround us. Frequently; such items may change hands during their life-cycle. Therefore;beyond RFID identification protocols; there is a need for secure and private ownershiptransfer protocols in RFID systems. To ensure privacy to tag owners; the keys of tags areusually updated during the ownership transfer process. However; none of the previousproposals takes advantage of this property to improve the system scalability. To the best ofour knowledge; we propose the first RFID identification protocol supporting ownership …,International Workshop on Radio Frequency Identification: Security and Privacy Issues,2011,28
Privacy-aware peer-to-peer content distribution using automatically recombined fingerprints,David Megías; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Multicast distribution of content is not suited to content-based electronic commercebecause all buyers obtain exactly the same copy of the content; in such a way that unlawfulredistributors cannot be traced. Unicast distribution has the shortcoming of requiring oneconnection with each buyer; but it allows the merchant to embed a different serial number inthe copy obtained by each buyer; which enables redistributor tracing. Peer-to-peer (P2P)distribution is a third option which may combine some of the advantages of multicast andunicast: on the one hand; the merchant only needs unicast connections with a few seedbuyers; who take over the task of further spreading the content; on the other hand; if a properfingerprinting mechanism is used; unlawful redistributors of the P2P-distributed content canstill be traced. In this paper; we propose a novel fingerprinting mechanism for P2P content …,Multimedia Systems,2014,27
Distributed multicast of fingerprinted content based on a rational peer-to-peer community,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David MegíAs,Abstract In conventional multicast transmission; one sender sends the same content to a setof receivers. This precludes fingerprinting the copy obtained by each receiver (in view ofredistribution control and other applications). A straightforward alternative is for the sender toseparately fingerprint and send in unicast one copy of the content for each receiver. Thisapproach is not scalable and may implode the sender. We present a scalable solution fordistributed multicast of fingerprinted content; in which receivers rationally co-operate infingerprinting and spreading the content. Furthermore; fingerprinting can be anonymous; inorder for honest receivers to stay anonymous.,Computer Communications,2013,27
Rational behavior in peer-to-peer profile obfuscation for anonymous keyword search,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Úrsula González-Nicolás,Abstract User profiling in web search has the advantage of enabling personalized websearch: the quality of the results offered by the search engine to the user is increased bytaking the user's interests into account when presenting those results. The negative side isthat the interests and the query history of users may contain information considered asprivate; hence; technology should be provided for users to avoid profiling if they wish so.There are several anti-profiling approaches in web search; from basic levelcountermeasures to private information retrieval and including profile obfuscation. Exceptprivate information retrieval (PIR); which hides the retrieved item from the database; the restof approaches focus on anonymizing the user's identity and fall into the category ofanonymous keyword search (also named sometimes user-private information retrieval) …,Information Sciences,2012,27
Validating distance-based record linkage with probabilistic record linkage,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract This work compares two alternative methods for record linkage: distance based andprobabilistic record linkage. It compares the performance of both approaches when data iscategorical. To that end; a distance over ordinal and nominal scales is defined. The papershows that; for categorical data; distance-based and probabilistic-based record linkage leadto similar results in relation to the number of re-identified records. As a consequence; thedistance proposed for ordinal and nominal scales is implicitly validated.,*,2002,27
Aggregation techniques for statistical confidentiality,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract This chapter describes microaggregation; a technique for statistical confidentialitythat uses aggregation operators. We describe the goals of statistical confidentiality and itsapplication to continuous and categorical data. We show the application of the method to asmall publicly available data set. The chapter finishes by reviewing some of the practicalproblems of the application of microaggregation to statistical disclosure control.,*,2002,27
Big data privacy: challenges to privacy principles and models,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract This paper explores the challenges raised by big data in privacy-preserving datamanagement. First; we examine the conflicts raised by big data with respect to preexistingconcepts of private data management; such as consent; purpose limitation; transparencyand individual rights of access; rectification and erasure. Anonymization appears as the besttool to mitigate such conflicts; and it is best implemented by adhering to a privacy model withprecise privacy guarantees. For this reason; we evaluate how well the two main privacymodels used in anonymization (k-anonymity and ε ε-differential privacy) meet therequirements of big data; namely composability; low computational cost and linkability.,Data Science and Engineering,2016,26
Preserving security and privacy in large-scale VANETs,Bo Qin; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Lei Zhang,Abstract Upcoming vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) allowing vehicles to talk to eachother are expected to enhance safety and efficiency in transportation systems. This type ofnetworks is especially attractive in highly populated urban areas overwhelmed with trafficcongestions and accidents. Besides vulnerabilities versus attacks against traffic safety anddriver privacy; a large-scale VANET in a metropolitan area raises scalability andmanagement challenges. This paper employs identity-based group signatures (IBGS) todivide a large-scale VANET into easy-to-manage groups and establish liability in vehicularcommunications while preserving privacy. Each party's human-recognizable identity is usedas its public key and no additional certificate is required. This efficiently avoids thecomplicated certificate management of existing protocols. We further investigate selfish …,International Conference on Information and Communications Security,2011,26
Multivariate microaggregation based genetic algorithms,Agusti Solanas; Antoni Martinez-Balleste; Josep M Mateo-Sanz; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Microaggregation is a clustering problem with cardinality constraints that originated in thearea of statistical disclosure control for micro data. This article presents a method formultivariate microaggregation based on genetic algorithms (GA). The adaptations requiredto characterize the multivariate microaggregation problem are explained and justified.Extensive experimentation has been carried out with the aim of finding the best values forthe most relevant parameters of the modified GA: the population size and the crossover andmutation rates. The experimental results demonstrate that our method finds the optimalsolution to the problem in almost all experiments when working with small data sets. Thus;for small data sets the proposed method performs better than known polynomial heuristicsand can be combined with these for larger data sets. Moreover; a sensitivity analysis of …,Intelligent Systems; 2006 3rd International IEEE Conference on,2006,26
A critique of the sensitivity rules usually employed for statistical table protection,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenc Torra,In statistical disclosure control of tabular data; sensitivity rules are commonly used to decidewhether a table cell is sensitive and should therefore not be published. The most popularsensitivity rules are the dominance rule; the p%-rule and the pq-rule. The dominance rulehas received critiques based on specific numerical examples and is being graduallyabandoned by leading statistical agencies. In this paper; we construct generalcounterexamples which show that none of the above rules does adequately reflectdisclosure risk if cell contributors or coalitions of them behave as intruders: in that case;releasing a cell declared non-sensitive can imply higher disclosure risk than releasing a celldeclared sensitive. As possible solutions; we propose an alternative sensitivity rule basedon the concentration of relative contributions. More generally; we suggest to complement …,International Journal of Uncertainty; Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems,2002,26
FRR: Fair remote retrieval of outsourced private medical records in electronic health networks,Huaqun Wang; Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Cloud computing is emerging as the next-generation IT architecture. However;cloud computing also raises security and privacy concerns since the users have no physicalcontrol over the outsourced data. This paper focuses on fairly retrieving encrypted privatemedical records outsourced to remote untrusted cloud servers in the case of medicalaccidents and disputes. Our goal is to enable an independent committee to fairly recover theoriginal private medical records so that medical investigation can be carried out in aconvincing way. We achieve this goal with a fair remote retrieval (FRR) model in whicheither t investigation committee members cooperatively retrieve the original medical data ornone of them can get any information on the medical records. We realize the first FRRscheme by exploiting fair multi-member key exchange and homomorphic privately …,Journal of biomedical informatics,2014,25
Differential privacy via t-closeness in data publishing,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrert,k-Anonymity and e-differential privacy are two main privacy models proposed within thecomputer science community. Whereas the former was proposed for privacy-preserving datapublishing; ie data set anonymization; the latter initially arose in the context of interactivedatabases and was later extended to data publishing. We show here that t-closeness; one ofthe extensions of k-anonymity; can actually yieldε-differential privacy in data publishingwhen t= exp (ε). We detail a construction based on bucketization that realizes the previousimplication; hence; as an ancillary result; we provide a new computational procedure toachieve t-closeness and ε-differential privacy in data publishing.,Privacy; Security and Trust (PST); 2013 Eleventh Annual International Conference on,2013,24
FuturICT—The road towards ethical ICT,Jeroen van den Hoven; Dirk Helbing; Dino Pedreschi; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Fosca Gianotti; Markus Christen,Abstract The pervasive use of information and communication technology (ICT) in modernsocieties enables countless opportunities for individuals; institutions; businesses andscientists; but also raises difficult ethical and social problems. In particular; ICT helped tomake societies more complex and thus harder to understand; which impedes social andpolitical interventions to avoid harm and to increase the common good. To overcome thisobstacle; the large-scale EU flagship proposal FuturICT intends to create a platform foraccessing global human knowledge as a public good and instruments to increase ourunderstanding of the information society by making use of ICT-based research. In thiscontribution; we outline the ethical justification for such an endeavor. We argue that theethical issues raised by FuturICT research projects overlap substantially with many of the …,The European Physical Journal Special Topics,2012,24
Safety and privacy in vehicular communications,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Qianhong Wu,Abstract Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will improve traffic safety and efficiencyprovided that car-to-car communication stays trustworthy. Therefore; it is crucial to ensurethat the information conveyed by vehicle-generated messages is reliable. A sensible optionis to request that the content of a message originated by a certain vehicle be endorsed bynearby peer vehicles. However; neither message generation nor message endorsementshould entail any privacy loss on the part of vehicles co-operating in it. This chapter surveysthe available solutions to this security-privacy tension and analyzes their limitations. A newprivacy-preserving system is sketched which guarantees message authentication throughboth a priori and a posteriori countermeasures.,*,2009,24
Empirical disclosure risk assessment of the ipso synthetic data generators,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra; Josep M Mateo-Sanz; Francesc Sebé,Abstract. Information Preserving Statistical Obfuscation (IPSO) is a family of three methodsIPSO-A; IPSO-B; IPSO-C for numerical synthetic data generation designed by Burridge in2003. This paper reports on empirical work carried out to assess the re-identification risk ofeach method in different worst-case disclosure scenarios; with different datasets and usingdifferent record linkage methods. The conclusions of this study give some insight on howIPSO and other synthetic data generators can be tuned to minimize re-identification risk.Further; we discuss how a similar analysis could be conducted for synthetic generators ofcategorical data.,Monographs in official statistics-work session on statistical data confidentiality,2005,24
Information-theoretic disclosure risk measures in statistical disclosure control of tabular data,J Domingo-Feffer; Anna Oganian; Vicenç Torra,Statistical database protection is a part of information security which tries to preventpublished statistical information (tables; individual records) from disclosing the contributionof specific respondents. This paper shows how to use information-theoretic concepts tomeasure disclosure risk for tabular data. The proposed disclosure risk measure iscompatible with a broad class of disclosure protection methods and can be extended forcomputing disclosure risk for a set of linked tables.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2002.

Efficient smart-card based anonymous fingerprinting,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Herrera-Joancomartí,Abstract Thwarting unlawful redistribution of information sold electronically is a majorproblem of information-based electronic commerce. Anonymous fingerprinting hasappeared as a technique for copyright protection which is compatible with buyer anonymityin electronic transactions. However; the complexity of known algorithms for anonymousfingerprinting is too high for practical implementation on standard computers; let alone smartcards. A scheme for anonymous fingerprinting is presented in this paper where all buyercomputations can be performed by the buyer's smart card.,International Conference on Smart Card Research and Advanced Applications,1998,24
From t-closeness to differential privacy and vice versa in data anonymization,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract k-anonymity and ε-differential privacy are two mainstream privacy models; theformer introduced to anonymize data sets and the latter to limit the knowledge gain thatresults from including one individual in the data set. Whereas basic k-anonymity onlyprotects against identity disclosure; t-closeness was presented as an extension of k-anonymity that also protects against attribute disclosure. We show here that; if not quiteequivalent; t-closeness and ε-differential privacy are strongly related to one another when itcomes to anonymizing data sets. Specifically; k-anonymity for the quasi-identifiers combinedwith ε-differential privacy for the confidential attributes yields stochastic t-closeness (anextension of t-closeness); with ta function of k and ε. Conversely; t-closeness can yield ε-differential privacy when t= exp (ε/2) and the assumptions made by t-closeness about the …,Knowledge-Based Systems,2015,23
Asymmetric group key agreement protocol for open networks and its application to broadcast encryption,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Úrsula González-Nicolás,Abstract Asymmetric group key agreement is a recently introduced versatile cryptographicprimitive. It allows a group of users to negotiate a common encryption key which isaccessible to any entities; and each user only holds her respective secret decryption key.This concept not only enables confidential communications among group users but alsopermits any outsider to send encrypted messages to the group. The existing instantiation isonly secure against passive adversaries. In this paper; we first introduce an authenticatedasymmetric group key agreement protocol which offers security against active attacks inopen networks. Based on this protocol; we then propose a broadcast encryption systemwithout relying on a trusted dealer to distribute the secret keys to the users. Our system isequipped with the perfect forward security property and has short ciphertexts. Improved …,Computer Networks,2011,23
Aggregation of trustworthy announcement messages in vehicular ad hoc networks,Alexandre Viejo; Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) allow vehicle-to-vehicle communication and; inparticular; vehicle-generated announcements. Vehicles can use such announcements towarn nearby vehicles about road conditions (traffic jams; accidents). Thus; they can greatlyincrease the safety of driving. However; their trustworthiness must be guaranteed. A newsystem for vehicle-generated announcements is presented that is secure against externaland internal attackers attempting to send fake messages. Internal attacks are thwarted byusing an endorsement mechanism based on multisignatures. Besides; this scheme ensuresthat vehicles volunteering to generate and/or endorse trustworthy announcements do nothave to sacrifice their privacy.,Vehicular Technology Conference; 2009.

Measuring risk and utility of anonymized data using information theory,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Rebollo-Monedero,Abstract Before releasing anonymized microdata (individual data) it is essential to evaluatewhether: i) their utility is high enough for their release to make sense; ii) the risk that theanonymized data result in disclosure of respondent identity or respondent attribute values islow enough. Utility and disclosure risk measures are used for the above evaluation; whichnormally lack a common theoretical framework allowing to trade off utility and risk in aconsistent way. We explore in this paper the use of information-theoretic measures based onthe notion of mutual information.,Proceedings of the 2009 EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2009,23
Disclosure risk assessment in statistical data protection,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract Statistical data protection; also known as statistical disclosure control; is aboutmethods that try to prevent published statistical information (tables; individual information)from disclosing the contribution of specific respondents; who may be individuals orenterprises. In addition to keeping disclosure risk acceptably low; methods used forstatistical data protection should not significantly damage the utility of the data beingprotected. This paper surveys different ways to assess the risk of disclosure in the protectionof both individual data (called microdata) and tabular data. A noteworthy result alsopresented is that the most widely used rule for assessing disclosure risk in tabular dataprotection is flawed.,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,2004,23
Invertible spread-spectrum watermarking for image authentication and multilevel access to precision-critical watermarked images,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebe,Invertible watermarking has been introduced in the literature for the purpose of imageauthentication. We present a spread-spectrum invertible watermarking system which can beused to authenticate images in any lossless format; ie establish their integrity. A secondapplication of invertible watermarking is multilevel access to watermarked images:depending on her clearance; the image user can" clean" the marks of more or less parts ofthe image; so as to gain in precision. Both applications make sense for precision-criticalimages (eg military; satellite; medical; quality control; reverse engineering images) whosecopyright should still be protected to some extent.,Information Technology: Coding and Computing; 2002.

Privacy-preserving vehicular communication authentication with hierarchical aggregation and fast response,Lei Zhang; Chuanyan Hu; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Bo Qin,Existing secure and privacy-preserving schemes for vehicular communications in vehicularad hoc networks face some challenges; eg; reducing the dependence on ideal tamper-proofdevices; building efficient member revocation mechanisms and avoiding computation andcommunication bottlenecks. To cope with those challenges; we propose a highly efficientsecure and privacy-preserving scheme based on identity-based aggregate signatures. Ourscheme enables hierarchical aggregation and batch verification. The individual identity-based signatures generated by different vehicles can be aggregated and verified in a batch.The aggregated signatures can be re-aggregated by a message collector (eg; trafficmanagement authority). With our hierarchical aggregation technique; we significantly reducethe transmission/storage overhead of the vehicles and other parties. Furthermore; existing …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2016,22
Co-utility,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract Peer-to-peer scenarios are increasingly important in globalized informationsocieties. To guide the interaction between (rational) agents in these P2P settings; self-enforcing collaborative protocols are desirable; so that agents have no motivation to deviatefrom them. Moreover; to increase social welfare and ensure the success of protocols; itwould be desirable to make the collaboration between agents mutually beneficial. In thispaper; we present the notion of co-utility; which refers to protocols in which mutual help isthe best rational option to take; even for purely selfish agents. This concept is illustratedthrough several P2P scenarios; framed both in the information society and in the physicalworld; for which we present and discuss co-utile self-enforcing protocols.,Progress in Artificial Intelligence,2016,22
Improving the utility of differentially private data releases via k-anonymity,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; Sergio Martínez,A common view in some data anonymization literature is to oppose the" old''k-anonymitymodel to the" new''differential privacy model; which offers more robust privacy guarantees.However; the utility of the masked results provided by differential privacy is usually limited;due to the amount of noise that needs to be added to the output; or because utility can onlybe guaranteed for a restricted type of queries. This is in contrast with the general-purposeanonymized data resulting from k-anonymity mechanisms; which also focus on preservingdata utility. In this paper; we show that a synergy between differential privacy and k-anonymity can be found when the objective is to release anonymized data: k-anonymity canhelp improving the utility of the differentially private release. Specifically; we show that theamount of noise required to fulfill ε-differential privacy can be reduced if noise is added to …,Trust; Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom); 2013 12th IEEE International Conference on,2013,22
A measure of variance for hierarchical nominal attributes,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Agusti Solanas,Abstract The need for measuring the dispersion of nominal categorical attributes appears inseveral applications; like clustering or data anonymization. For a nominal attribute whosecategories can be hierarchically classified; a measure of the variance of a sample drawnfrom that attribute is proposed which takes the attribute's hierarchy into account. The newmeasure is the reciprocal of “consanguinity”: the less related the nominal categories in thesample; the higher the measured variance. For non-hierarchical nominal attributes; theproposed measure yields results consistent with previous diversity indicators. Applications ofthe new nominal variance measure to economic diversity measurement and dataanonymization are also discussed.,Information Sciences,2008,22
Peer-to-peer private information retrieval,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Maria Bras-Amorós,Abstract Private information retrieval (PIR) is normally modeled as a game between twoplayers: a user and a database. The user wants to retrieve some item from the databasewithout the latter learning which item. Most current PIR protocols are ill-suited to provide PIRfrom a search engine or large database: i) their computational complexity is linear in the sizeof the database; ii) they assume active cooperation by the database server in the PIRprotocol. If the database cannot be assumed to cooperate; a peer-to-peer user community isa natural alternative to achieve some query anonymity: a user submits a query on behalf ofanother user in the community. A peer-to-peer PIR system is described in this paper whichrelies on an underlying combinatorial structure to reduce the required key material andincrease availability.,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2008,22
Fuzzy microaggregation for microdata protection,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,In this work we describe a microdata protection method based on the use of fuzzy clusteringand; more specifically; using fuzzy c-means. Microaggregation is a well-known maskingmethod for microdata protection used by National Statistical Offices. Given a set of objectsdescribed in terms of a set of variables; this method consists on building a partition of theobjects and then replace the original evaluation for each variable by the aggregates of eachpartition. This is; the values in a given cluster are aggregated—fused—and used instead ofthe original ones. As the problem of finding the best partition for microdata protection is anNP problem; heuristic methods are considered in the literature. Our approach uses fuzzy c-means for building a fuzzy partition; instead of a crisp one.,Journal of Advanced Computational Intelligence Vol,2003,22

Utility-preserving differentially private data releases via individual ranking microaggregation,David Sánchez; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Sergio Martínez; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract Being able to release and exploit open data gathered in information systems iscrucial for researchers; enterprises and the overall society. Yet; these data must beanonymized before release to protect the privacy of the subjects to whom the records relate.Differential privacy is a privacy model for anonymization that offers more robust privacyguarantees than previous models; such as k-anonymity and its extensions. However; it isoften disregarded that the utility of differentially private outputs is quite limited; eitherbecause of the amount of noise that needs to be added to obtain them or because utility isonly preserved for a restricted type and/or a limited number of queries. On the contrary; k-anonymity-like data releases make no assumptions on the uses of the protected data and;thus; do not restrict the number and type of doable analyses.

A 2/sup d/-tree-based blocking method for microaggregating very large data sets,Agusti Solanas; A Martmez-Balleste; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep Maria Mateo-Sanz,Blocking is a well-known technique used to partition a set of records into several subsets ofmanageable size. The standard approach to blocking is to split the records according to thevalues of one or several attributes (called blocking attributes). This paper presents a newblocking method based on 2/sup d/-trees for intelligently partitioning very large data sets formicro aggregation. A number of experiments has been carried out in order to compare ourmethod with the most typical univariate one.,Availability; Reliability and Security; 2006. ARES 2006.

Distributed aggregate privacy-preserving authentication in VANETs,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Bo Qin; Chuanyan Hu,Existing secure and privacy-preserving vehicular communication protocols in vehicular adhoc networks face the challenges of being fast and not depending on ideal tamper-proofdevices (TPDs) embedded in vehicles. To address these challenges; we propose avehicular authentication protocol referred to as distributedaggregate privacy-preservingauthentication. The proposed protocol is based on our new multiple trusted authority one-time identity-based aggregate signature technique. With this technique a vehicle can verifymany messages simultaneously and their signatures can be compressed into a single onethat greatly reduces the storage space needed by a vehicle or a data collector (eg; the trafficmanagement authority). Instead of ideal TPDs; our protocol only requires realistic TPDs andhence is more practical.,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017,19
APPA: Aggregate privacy-preserving authentication in vehicular ad hoc networks,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Most security-and privacy-preserving protocols in vehicular ad hoc networks(VANETs) heavily rely on time-consuming cryptographic operations which produce a hugevolume of cryptographic data. These data are usually employed for many kinds of decisions;which poses the challenge of processing the received cryptographic data fast enough toavoid unaffordable reaction delay. To meet that challenge; we propose a vehicularauthentication protocol referred to as APPA. It guarantees trustworthiness of vehicularcommunications and privacy of vehicles; and enables vehicles to react to vehicular reportscontaining cryptographic data within a very short delay. Moreover; using our protocol; theseemingly random cryptographic data can be securely and substantially compressed so thatthe storage space of a vehicle can be greatly saved. Finally; our protocol does not heavily …,International Conference on Information Security,2011,19
Privacy in data mining,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,The widespread computerization and; especially; the booming use of Internet have enabledin the last years an unprecedented level of automated data collection. Parallel to this; datamining has emerged as an important discipline providing powerful tools for data analysis.Beyond the positive consequences of higher information accuracy; a negative point is anOrwellian feeling of dwindling privacy for individual persons (or companies; for that matter).Privacy in administrative; statistical and other databases is about finding tradeoffs betweenthe societal right to know and the individual right to private life.

Statistical offices are faced with the problem of multiple-database data mining atleast for two reasons. On one side; there is a trend to avoid direct collection of data fromrespondents and use instead administrative data sources to build statistical data; suchadministrative sources are typically diverses and scattered across several administrationlevel. On the other side; intruders may attempt disclosure of confidential statistical data byusing the same approach; ie by linking whatever databases they can obtain. This paperdiscusses issues related to multipledatabase data mining; with a special focus on a methodfor linking records across databases which do not share any variables.,Third Joint UN/ECE-Eurostat Work Session on Statistical Data Confidentiality; Eurostat.

Practical mental poker without a TTP based on homomorphic encryption,Jordi Castella-Roca; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Andreu Riera; Joan Borrell,Abstract A solution for obtaining impartial random values in on-line gambling is presented inthis paper. Unlike most previous proposals; our method does not require any TTP andallows e-gambling to reach standards of fairness; security an auditability similar to thosecommon in physical gambling. Although our solution is detailed here for the particular caseof games with reversed cards (eg poker); it can be easily adapted for games with open cards(eg blackjack) and for random draw games (eg keno). Thanks to the use of permutations ofhomomorphically encrypted cards; the protocols described have moderate computationalrequirements.,International Conference on Cryptology in India,2003,19
An implementable scheme for secure delegation of computing and data,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Ricardo X Sánchez del Castillo,Abstract The need for delegating information arises when the data owner wants to have herdata handled by an external party. If the external party is untrusted and data are confidential;delegation should be performed in a way that preserves security. Uses of delegation rangefrom public administration to smart cards. In this paper; correctness and securityrequirements as well as protocols are specified for delegation of computing and data. Acryptographic solution to the secure delegation problem is described which provides dataconfidentiality and computation verifiability. Finally; an implementation allowing securedelegation of information over the Internet is briefly discussed.,International Conference on Information and Communications Security,1997,19
New directions in anonymization: permutation paradigm; verifiability by subjects and intruders; transparency to users,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Krishnamurty Muralidhar,Abstract There are currently two approaches to anonymization:“utility first”(use ananonymization method with suitable utility features; then empirically evaluate the disclosurerisk and; if necessary; reduce the risk by possibly sacrificing some utility) or “privacyfirst”(enforce a target privacy level via a privacy model; eg; k-anonymity or ε-differentialprivacy; without regard to utility). To get formal privacy guarantees; the second approachmust be followed; but then data releases with no utility guarantees are obtained. Also; ingeneral it is unclear how verifiable is anonymization by the data subject (how safelyreleased is the record she has contributed?); what type of intruder is being considered (whatdoes he know and want?) and how transparent is anonymization towards the data user(what is the user told about methods and parameters used?). We show that; using a …,Information Sciences,2016,18
Database anonymization: privacy models; data utility; and microaggregation-based inter-model connections,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract The current social and economic context increasingly demands open data toimprove scientific research and decision making. However; when published data refer toindividual respondents; disclosure risk limitation techniques must be implemented toanonymize the data and guarantee by design the fundamental right to privacy of the subjectsthe data refer to. Disclosure risk limitation has a long record in the statistical and computerscience research communities; who have developed a variety of privacy-preservingsolutions for data releases. This Synthesis Lecture provides a comprehensive overview ofthe fundamentals of privacy in data releases focusing on the computer science perspective.Specifically; we detail the privacy models; anonymization methods; and utility and riskmetrics that have been proposed so far in the literature.

Flexible attribute-based encryption applicable to secure e-healthcare records,Bo Qin; Hua Deng; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Naccache; Yunya Zhou,Abstract In e-healthcare record systems (EHRS); attribute-based encryption (ABE) appearsas a natural way to achieve fine-grained access control on health records. Some proposalsexploit key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) to protect privacy in such a way that all users areassociated with specific access policies and only the ciphertexts matching the users' accesspolicies can be decrypted. An issue with KP-ABE is that it requires an a priori formulation ofaccess policies during key generation; which is not always practicable in EHRS because thepolicies to access health records are sometimes determined after key generation. In thispaper; we revisit KP-ABE and propose a dynamic ABE paradigm; referred to as accesspolicy redefinable ABE (APR-ABE). To address the above issue; APR-ABE allows users toredefine their access policies and delegate keys for the redefined ones; hence; a priori …,International Journal of Information Security,2015,18
Tracing and revoking leaked credentials: accountability in leaking sensitive outsourced data,Hua Deng; Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Sherman SM Chow; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Wenchang Shi,Abstract Most existing proposals for access control over outsourced data mainly aim atguaranteeing that the data are only accessible to authorized requestors who have theaccess credentials. This paper proposes TRLAC; an a posteriori approach for tracing andrevoking leaked credentials; to complement existing a priori solutions. The tracing procedureof TRLAC can trace; in a black-box manner; at least one traitor who illegally distributed acredential; without any help from the cloud service provider. Once the dishonest users havebeen found; a revocation mechanism can be called to deprive them of access rights. Weformally prove the security of TRLAC; and empirically shows that the introduction of thetracing feature incurs little costs to outsourcing.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM symposium on Information; computer and communications security,2014,18
Optimal data-independent noise for differential privacy,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract ε-Differential privacy is a property that seeks to characterize privacy in data sets. It isformulated as a query-response method; and computationally achieved by outputperturbation. Several noise-addition methods to implement such output perturbation havebeen proposed in the literature. We focus on data-independent noise; that is; noise whosedistribution is constant across data sets. Our goal is to find the optimal data-independentnoise distribution to achieve ε-differential privacy. We propose a general optimality criterionbased on the concentration of the probability mass of the noise distribution around zero; andwe show that any noise optimal under this criterion must be optimal under any othersensible criterion. We also show that the Laplace distribution; commonly used for noise in ε-differential privacy; is not optimal; and we build the optimal data-independent noise …,Information Sciences,2013,18
Coprivacy: an introduction to the theory and applications of co-operative privacy,Josep Domingo Ferrer,Abstract We introduce the novel concept of coprivacy or co-operative privacy to makeprivacy preservation attractive. A protocol is coprivate if the best option for a player topreserve her privacy is to help another player in preserving his privacy. Coprivacy makes anindividual's privacy preservation a goal that rationally interests other individuals: it is a matterof helping oneself by helping someone else. We formally define coprivacy in terms of Nashequilibria. We then extend the concept to: i) general coprivacy; where a helping player'sutility (ie interest) may include earning functionality and security in addition to privacy; ii)mixed coprivacy; where mixed strategies and mixed Nash equilibria are allowed with somerestrictions; iii) correlated coprivacy; in which Nash equilibria are replaced by correlatedequilibria. Coprivacy can be applied to any peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol. We illustrate …,SORT-Statistics and Operations Research Transactions,2011,18
A genetic approach to multivariate microaggregation for database privacy,Antoni Martinez-Balleste; Agusti Solanas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep M Mateo-Sanz,Microaggregation is a technique used to protect privacy in databases and location-basedservices. We propose a new hybrid technique for multivariate microaggregation. Ourtechnique combines a heuristic yielding fixed-size groups and a genetic algorithm yieldingvariable-sized groups. Fixed-size heuristics are fast and able to deal with large data sets; butthey sometimes are far from optimal in terms of the information loss inflicted. On the otherhand; the genetic algorithm obtains very good results (ie optimal or near optimal); but it canonly cope with very small data sets. Our technique leverages the advantages of both types ofheuristics and avoids their shortcomings. First; it partitions the data set into a number ofgroups by using a fixed-size heuristic. Then. it optimizes the partitions by means of thegenetic algorithm. As an outcome of this mixture of heuristics; we obtain a technique that …,Data Engineering Workshop; 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,18
Distance-based and probabilistic record linkage for re-identification of records with categorical variables,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract Record linkage methods are methods for identifying the presence of the sameindividual in different data files (re-identification). This paper studies and compares the twomain existing approaches for record linkage: probabilistic and distance-based. Theperformance of both approaches is compared when data are categorical. To that end; adistance over ordinal and nominal scales is defined. The paper shows that; for categoricaldata; distance-based and probabilistic-based record linkage lead to similar results. This isparallel to comparisons in the literature for numerical data; which also showed a similarbehaviour between both record-linkage approaches. As a consequence; the distanceproposed for ordinal and nominal scales is implicitly validated.,Butlletí de lACIA; Associació Catalana dIntelligència Artificial,2002,18
TPP: Traceable privacy-preserving communication and precise reward for vehicle-to-grid networks in smart grids,Huaqun Wang; Bo Qin; Qianhong Wu; Li Xu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,In vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks; service providers are battery-powered vehicles; and theservice consumer is the power grid. Security and privacy concerns are major obstacles forV2G networks to be extensively deployed. In 2011; Yang et al. proposed a very interestingprivacy-preserving communication and precise reward architecture for V2G networks insmart grids. In this paper; we enhance Yang et al.'s framework with the formal definitions ofunforgeability and restrictiveness. Then; we propose a new traceable privacy-preservingcommunication and precise reward scheme with available cryptographic primitives. Theproposed scheme is formally proven secure with well-established assumptions in therandom oracle model. Thorough theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that ourscheme is efficient and practical for secure V2G networks in smart grids.,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2015,17
Provably secure threshold public-key encryption with adaptive security and short ciphertexts,Bo Qin; Qianhong Wu; Lei Zhang; Oriol Farras; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Threshold public-key encryption is a cryptographic primitive allowing decryptioncontrol in group-oriented encryption applications. Existing TPKE schemes suffer from longciphertexts with size linear in the number of authorized users or can only achieve non-adaptive security; which is too weak to capture the capacity of the attackers in the real world.In this paper; we propose an efficient TPKE scheme with constant-size ciphertexts andadaptive security. Security is proven under the decision Bilinear Diffie–HellmanExponentiation assumption in the standard model. Then we extend our basic constructionwith efficient trade-offs between the key size and the ciphertext size. Finally; we illustrateimprovements to transmit multiple secret session keys in one session with almost no extracost.,Information Sciences,2012,17
Recent progress in database privacy,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Yücel Saygın,Abstract Database privacy can be conceptually described in terms of three dimensions; eachof which refers to the privacy of a different subject and is pursued by a different discipline:respondent privacy; addressed by statistical disclosure control (SDC); owner privacy;addressed by privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM); and user privacy; pursued by privateinformation retrieval (PIR). This special issue contains papers reporting recent advances ineach of those three dimensions.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2009,17
Noise-robust watermarking for numerical datasets,Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Agustí Solanas,Abstract Watermarking has been used on multimedia for a variety of applications; amongwhich intellectual property protection stands out. However; and in spite of a growing need;very few attempts have been made at using watermarking to protect the intellectual propertyof alphanumerical databases. We present in this paper a watermarking system for numericaldatabases; which is the first one of its kind to preserve means and variances of attributes inthe database. Given a watermarked dataset and a candidate watermark; the recoveryalgorithm makes a decision whether the candidate watermark is embedded or not in thedataset. The probabilities of false positive and false negative can be made arbitrarily smallby proper choice of a security parameter. We give an analytical expression for theinformation or data utility loss caused by watermark embedding.

Aggregation methods to evaluate multiple protected versions of the same confidential data set,Aïda Valls; Vicenç Torra; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract This work is about disclosure risk for national statistical offices and; moreparticularly; for the case of releasing multiple protected versions of the same micro-data files.This is; several copies of a single original data file are released to several data users. Eachuser receives a protected copy; and the masking method for each copy is selected accordingto the research interests of the user: the selected masking method is such that it minimizesthe information loss for his/her particular research. Nevertheless; multiple releases of thesame data increase the disclosure risk. This is so; because coalitions of data users canreconstruct original data and; thus; find the original (non-masked) information. In this workwe propose a tool for evaluating this reconstruction.,*,2002,17
Mobile agent route protection through hash-based mechanisms,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract One approach to secure mobile agent execution is restricting the agent route totrusted environments. A necessary condition for this approach to be practical is that theagent route be protected. Previous proposals for agent route protection either offer lowsecurity or suffer from high computational costs due to cryptographic operations. We presenttwo fast; hash-based mechanisms for agent route protection. The first solution relies on hashcollisions and focuses on minimizing the computational cost of route verification by hostsalong the route; the cost is shifted to the stage of route protection by the agent owner. Thesecond solution uses Merkle trees and minimizes the cost of route protection by the agentowner; so that a single digital signature suffices to protect the whole route; for hosts alongthe route; the verification cost is similar to the cost of previous schemes in the literature …,International Conference on Cryptology in India,2001,17
Co-utile P2P ridesharing via decentralization and reputation management,David Sánchez; Sergio Martínez; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Ridesharing has the potential to bring a wealth of benefits both to the actors directlyinvolved in the shared trip (eg; shared travel costs or access to high-occupancy vehiclefacilities) and also to the society in general (eg; reduced traffic congestion and CO 2emissions). However; even though ridesharing is based on a win-win collaboration andmodern mobile communication technologies have significantly eased discovering andmanaging ride matches; the adoption of ridesharing has paradoxically decreased during thelast years. In this respect; recent studies have highlighted how privacy concerns and the lackof trust among peers are crucial issues that hamper the success of ridesharing. In this paper;we tackle both of these issues by means of (i) a fully decentralized P2P ridesharingmanagement network that avoids centralized ride-matching agencies (and hence private …,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2016,16
Co-utility: self-enforcing protocols without coordination mechanisms,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Soria-Comas; Oana Ciobotaru,Performing some task among a set of agents requires the use of some protocol thatregulates the interactions between them. If those agents are rational; they may try to subvertthe protocol for their own benefit; in an attempt to reach an outcome that provides greaterutility. We revisit the traditional notion of self-enforcing protocols implemented using existinggame-theoretic solution concepts; we describe its shortcomings in real-world applications;and we propose a new notion of self-enforcing protocols; namely co-utile protocols. Thelatter represent a solution concept that can be implemented without a coordinationmechanism in situations when traditional self-enforcing protocols need a coordinationmechanism. Co-utile protocols are preferable in decentralized systems of rational agentsbecause of their efficiency and fairness. We illustrate the application of co-utile protocols …,Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM); 2015 International Conference on,2015,16
Self-enforcing protocols via co-utile reputation management,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Oriol Farràs; Sergio Martínez; David Sánchez; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract Well-designed protocols should be self-enforcing; that is; be such that rationalparticipating agents have no motivation to deviate from them. In addition; protocols can haveother interesting properties; such as promoting collaboration between agents in a search fora better outcome. We proposed the notion of co-utility [8; 9]; which characterizes a situationin which mutual help is the best rational option to take even for purely selfish agents; inparticular; if a protocol is co-utile; it is self-enforcing. However; guaranteeing self-enforcement; let alone co-utility; for any type of agent behavior is not possible. To tackle thisissue; in this paper we study how reputation mechanisms can be incorporated into existingprotocols in order to make them self-enforcing (and optionally co-utile). Moreover; we adaptand extend the well-known EigenTrust reputation calculation mechanism so that: i) it can …,Information Sciences,2016,15
Co-utile collaborative anonymization of microdata,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract In surveys collecting individual data (microdata); each respondent is usuallyrequired to report values for a set of attributes. If some of these attributes contain sensitiveinformation; the respondent must trust the collector not to make any inappropriate use of thedata and; in case any data are to be publicly released; to properly anonymize them to avoiddisclosing sensitive information. If the respondent does not trust the data collector; she mayreport inaccurately or report nothing at all. The reduce the need for trust; local anonymizationis an alternative whereby each respondent anonymizes her data prior to sending them to thedata collector. However; local anonymization by each respondent without seeing otherrespondents' data makes it hard to find a good trade-off minimizing information loss anddisclosure risk. We propose a distributed anonymization approach where users …,Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2015,15
Simultaneous authentication and secrecy in identity-based data upload to cloud,Bo Qin; Huaqun Wang; Qianhong Wu; Jianwei Liu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Most existing works to secure cloud devote to remote integrity check; search andcomputing on encrypted data. In this paper; we deal with simultaneous authentication andsecrecy when data are uploaded to cloud. Observing that cloud is most interesting tocompanies in which multiple authorized employees are allowed to upload data; we proposea general framework for secure data upload in an identity-based setting. We present andemploy identity-based signcryption (IBSC) to meet this goal. As it is shown that it ischallenging to construct IBSC scheme in the standard model and most IBSC schemes arerealized in the random oracle model which is regarded weak to capture the realisticadversaries; we propose a new IBSC scheme simultaneously performing encryption andsignature with cost less than the signature-then-encryption approach.

On intuitionistic fuzzy clustering for its application to privacy,Vicenç Torra; Sadaaki Miyamoto; Yasunori Endo; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Motivated by our research on specific information loss measures (in privacy preserving datamining) and our need to compare fuzzy clusters; we proposed in a recent paper a definitionfor intuitionistic fuzzy partitions. We showed how to define them in the framework of fuzzyclustering. That is; we introduced a method to define intuitionistic fuzzy partitions from theresults of fuzzy clustering. In this paper we further study such intuitionistic fuzzy partitionsand we extend our previous results with other types of fuzzy clustering algorithms.,Fuzzy Systems; 2008.

Collusion-secure and cost-effective detection of unlawful multimedia redistribution,Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Intellectual property protection of multimedia content is essential to the successfuldeployment of Internet content delivery platforms. There are two general approaches tomultimedia copy protection: copy prevention and copy detection. Past experience shows thatonly copy detection based on mark embedding techniques looks promising. Multimediafingerprinting means embedding a different buyer-identifying mark in each copy of themultimedia content being sold. Fingerprinting is subject to collusion attacks: a coalition ofbuyers collude and follow some strategy to mix their copies with the aim of obtaining amixture from which none of their identifying marks can be retrieved; if their strategy issuccessful; the colluders can redistribute the mixture with impunity. A construction ispresented in this paper to obtain fingerprinting codes for copyright protection which …,IEEE Transactions on Systems; Man; and Cybernetics; Part C (Applications and Reviews),2003,15

Co-utility: self-enforcing protocols for the mutual benefit of participants,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Sergio Martínez; David Sánchez; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract Protocols govern the interactions between agents; both in the information societyand in the society at large. Protocols based on mutually beneficial cooperation areespecially interesting because they improve the societal welfare and no central authority isneeded to enforce them (which eliminates a single point of failure and possible bottlenecks).In order to guide the design of such protocols; we introduce co-utility as a framework forcooperation between rational agents such that the best strategy for each agent is to helpanother agent achieve her best outcome. Specifically; in this work we study and characterizeself-enforcing protocols in game-theoretic terms. Then; we use this characterization todevelop the concept of co-utile protocol and study under which circumstances co-utilityarises. Furthermore; we give a detailed study of co-utile protocol design in the case of …,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2017,14

Current research focuses on Privacy Preserving CollaborativeFiltering (PPCF); whose aim is to solve the privacy issues raised by the systematic collectionof private information. In this paper; we propose a new micro aggregation-based PPCFmethod that distorts data to provide k-anonymity; whilst simultaneously making accuraterecommendations.

Decapitation of networks with and without weights and direction: The economics of iterated attack and defense,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Úrsula González-Nicolás,Abstract Vulnerability of networks against one-shot decapitation attacks has been addressedseveral times in the literature. A first study on how a network can best defend itself byreplenishing nodes and rewiring edges after decapitation was made by Nagaraja andAnderson. We extend the work of those authors on iterated attack and defense by:(i)considering weighted and directed networks;(ii) taking into account the economic aspects ofthe attack and defense strategies; namely the cost of node destruction/replenishment and asubtler cost such as the average path length increase. Extensive empirical work is reportedwhich; among other things; shows the importance of obfuscating the network topology.,Computer Networks,2011,14
Threshold public-key encryption with adaptive security and short ciphertexts,Bo Qin; Qianhong Wu; Lei Zhang; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Threshold public-key encryption (TPKE) allows a set of users to decrypt a ciphertextif a given threshold of authorized users cooperate. Existing TPKE schemes suffer from eitherlong ciphertexts with size linear in the number of authorized users or can only achieve non-adaptive security. A non-adaptive attacker is assumed to disclose her target attacking set ofusers even before the system parameters are published. The notion of non-adaptive securityis too weak to capture the capacity of the attackers in the real world. In this paper; we bridgethese gaps by proposing an efficient TPKE scheme with constant-size ciphertexts andadaptive security. Security is proven under the decision Bilinear Diffie-HellmanExponentiation (BDHE) assumption in the standard model. This implies that our proposalpreserves security even if the attacker adaptively corrupts all the users outside the …,International Conference on Information and Communications Security,2010,14
A posteriori disclosure risk measure for tabular data based on conditional entropy,Anna Oganian; Josep Domingo Ferrer,Statistical database protection; also known as Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC); is a partof information security which tries to prevent published statistical information (tables;individual records) from disclosing the contribution of specific respondents. This paper dealswith the assessment of the disclosure risk associated to the release of tabular data. So-called sensitivity rules are currently being used to measure the disclosure risk for tables.These rules operate on an a priori basis: the data are examined and the rules are used todecide whether the data can be released as they stand or should rather be protected. In thispaper; we propose to complement a priori risk assessment with a posteriori risk assessmentin order to achieve a higher level of security; that is; we propose to take the protectedinformation into account when measuring the disclosure risk.

Extending microaggregation procedures using defuzzification methods for categorical variables,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Defuzzification is one of the fundamental steps in the development of fuzzy knowledgebased systems. Given a fuzzy set/spl mu/over the reference set X; defuzzification appliedto/spl mu/returns an element of X. While a large number of methods exist for the case of Xbeing a numerical scale; only few methods are applicable when X corresponds to acategorical scale. Aggregation procedures have been extensively used in defuzzification innumerical scales. This is so because defuzzification has been studied as equivalent to thecomputation of an expected value. In this work we present the reversal approach; we studydefuzzification procedures for their application to aggregation. We focus on the developmentof defuzzification methods for the case of X being an ordinal scale. This is; X is a set of finitevalues in which a total order is defined. Our ultimate goal is to apply these methods to …,Intelligent Systems; 2002. Proceedings. 2002 First International IEEE Symposium,2002,14
Current directions in statistical data protection,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep Maria Mateo-Sanz,Abstract Statistical data protection can be viewed as a heir of the work that was started onstatistical database protection in the 70s and 80s. Massive production of computerizedstatistics by government agencies combined with an increasing social importance ofindividual privacy has led to a renewed interest in this topic. This paper summarizes recentactivity in statistical data protection; then outlines the current areas of work and finally listssome issues which are likely to deserve the attention of researchers and practitioners in thenear future.,Research in Official Statistics,1998,14
Cloud Cryptography: Theory; Practice and Future Research Directions.,Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Lei Zhang,Cloud computing; a convenient way of accessing services; resources and applications overthe Internet; shifts the focus of industries and organizations away from the deployment andday-to-day running of their IT facilities by providing an on-demand; self-service; and pay-asyou-go business model. It is; therefore; unsurprising that cloud computing has continuedto increase in popularity in recent times. While cloud computing provides various benefits tousers; there are underlying security and privacy risks. For example; multi-tenancy; resourcepooling and shareability features can be exploited by cybercriminals and anyone with amalicious intent; to the detriment of both cloud users and cloud service providers. It isunsurprising; then; that cloud computing has emerged as a salient area of inquiry for securityresearchers.

Contributory broadcast encryption with efficient encryption and short ciphertexts,Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Lei Zhang; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Oriol Farras; Jesus A Manjon,Broadcast encryption (BE) schemes allow a sender to securely broadcast to any subset ofmembers but require a trusted party to distribute decryption keys. Group key agreement(GKA) protocols enable a group of members to negotiate a common encryption key via opennetworks so that only the group members can decrypt the ciphertexts encrypted under theshared encryption key; but a sender cannot exclude any particular member from decryptingthe ciphertexts. In this paper; we bridge these two notions with a hybrid primitive referred toas contributory broadcast encryption (ConBE). In this new primitive; a group of membersnegotiate a common public encryption key while each member holds a decryption key. Asender seeing the public group encryption key can limit the decryption to a subset ofmembers of his choice. Following this model; we propose a ConBE scheme with short …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2016,13
Privacy by design in big data: an overview of privacy enhancing technologies in the era of big data analytics,Giuseppe D'Acquisto; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Panayiotis Kikiras; Vicenç Torra; Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye; Athena Bourka,Abstract: The extensive collection and processing of personal information in big dataanalytics has given rise to serious privacy concerns; related to wide scale electronicsurveillance; profiling; and disclosure of private data. To reap the benefits of analyticswithout invading the individuals' private sphere; it is essential to draw the limits of big dataprocessing and integrate data protection safeguards in the analytics value chain. ENISA;with the current report; supports this approach and the position that the challenges oftechnology (for big data) should be addressed by the opportunities of technology (forprivacy). We first explain the need to shift from" big data versus privacy" to" big data withprivacy". In this respect; the concept of privacy by design is key to identify the privacyrequirements early in the big data analytics value chain and in subsequently …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.06000,2015,13
Direct and indirect discrimination prevention methods,Sara Hajian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Along with privacy; discrimination is a very important issue when considering thelegal and ethical aspects of data mining. It is more than obvious that most people do notwant to be discriminated because of their gender; religion; nationality; age and so on;especially when those attributes are used for making decisions about them like giving thema job; loan; insurance; etc. Discovering such potential biases and eliminating them from thetraining data without harming their decision-making utility is therefore highly desirable. Forthis reason; anti-discrimination techniques including discrimination discovery andprevention have been introduced in data mining. Discrimination prevention consists ofinducing patterns that do not lead to discriminatory decisions even if the original trainingdatasets are inherently biased. In this chapter; by focusing on the discrimination …,*,2013,13
Predictive protocol for the scalable identification of RFID tags through collaborative readers,Rolando Trujillo-Rasua; Agusti Solanas; Pablo A Pérez-Martínez; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology aimed at efficiently identifyingproducts that has greatly influenced the manufacturing businesses in recent years. Althoughthe RFID technology has been widely accepted by the manufacturing and retailing sectors;there are still many issues regarding its scalability; security and privacy. With regard toprivacy; the sharing of identification information amongst multiple parties is also an issue(especially after the massive outsourcing that is taking place in our global market). Securelyand efficiently sharing identification information with multiple parties is a tough problem thatmust be considered so as to avert the undesired disclosure of confidential information.Specially in the context of supply chain management. In this article; we propose a privateand scalable protocol for RFID collaborative readers to securely identify RFID tags. We …,Computers in Industry,2012,13
Motor current signature analysis and negative sequence current based stator winding short fault detection in an induction motor,Silvia Oviedo; Jabid Quiroga; Carlos Borras,ABSTRACT: In this paper; negative sequence analysis and motor current signature analysis(MCSA) based approaches are applied to perform short fault detection of a single phasewinding in an induction motor. The fault detection is carried out using the negative sequenceanalysis and spectral analysis of current signals. An experimental analysis is presented;showing the advantages and drawbacks for each method implemented. Tests are performedin a 2 Hp induction motor dedicated to this type of study. Experimental results showvariations in the fault indicator in both methods when the motor is running under differentload conditions. Although the negative sequence current method demands simultaneousthree phase current sensing; it presents better performance for short fault detection andprovides a fault severity level estimation.,Dyna,2011,13
An anonymity model achievable via microaggregation,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé; Agusti Solanas,Abstract k-Anonymity is a privacy model requiring that all combinations of key attributes in adatabase be repeated at least for k records. It has been shown that k-anonymity alone doesnot always ensure privacy. A number of sophistications of k-anonymity have been proposed;like p-sensitive k-anonymity; l-diversity and t-closeness. We identify some shortcomings ofthose models and propose a new model called (k; p; q; r)-anonymity. Also; we propose acomputational procedure to achieve this new model that relies on microaggregation.,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2008,13

Round-efficient and sender-unrestricted dynamic group key agreement protocol for secure group communications,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Bo Qin; Zheming Dong,Modern collaborative and group-oriented applications typically involve communications overopen networks. Given the openness of today's networks; communications among groupmembers must be secure and; at the same time; efficient. Group key agreement (GKA) iswidely employed for secure group communications in modern collaborative and group-oriented applications. This paper studies the problem of GKA in identity-basedcryptosystems with an emphasis on round-efficient; sender-unrestricted; member-dynamic;and provably secure key escrow freeness. The problem is resolved by proposing a one-round dynamic asymmetric GKA protocol which allows a group of members to dynamicallyestablish a public group encryption key; while each member has a different secretdecryption key in an identity-based cryptosystem. Knowing the group encryption key; any …,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2015,12
Generating searchable public-key ciphertexts with hidden structures for fast keyword search,Peng Xu; Qianhong Wu; Wei Wang; Willy Susilo; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Hai Jin,Existing semantically secure public-key searchable encryption schemes take search timelinear with the total number of the ciphertexts. This makes retrieval from large-scaledatabases prohibitive. To alleviate this problem; this paper proposes searchable public-keyciphertexts with hidden structures (SPCHS) for keyword search as fast as possible withoutsacrificing semantic security of the encrypted keywords. In SPCHS; all keyword-searchableciphertexts are structured by hidden relations; and with the search trapdoor corresponding toa keyword; the minimum information of the relations is disclosed to a search algorithm as theguidance to find all matching ciphertexts efficiently. We construct an SPCHS scheme fromscratch in which the ciphertexts have a hidden star-like structure. We prove our scheme tobe semantically secure in the random oracle (RO) model.

A study on the impact of data anonymization on anti-discrimination,Sara Hajian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,In last years; data mining has raised some concerns related to privacy invasion of theindividuals and potential discrimination based on the extracted patterns and profiles. Effortsat fighting against these risks have led to developing privacy preserving data mining (PPDM)techniques and anti-discrimination techniques in data mining. However; there is an evidentgap between the large body of research in data privacy technologies and the recent earlyresults on anti-discrimination technologies. This context presents a study on the relationbetween data anonymization from privacy technologies literature and anti-discrimination.We discuss how different data anonymization techniques have impact on discriminatorybiased datasets.,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,12
Rational privacy disclosure in social networks,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Social networking web sites or social networks for short (SNs) have become animportant web service with a broad range of applications. In an SN; a user publishes andshares information and services. We propose a utility function to measure the rational benefitderived by a user from her participation in an SN; in terms of information acquired vsinformation provided. We show that independently and selfishly maximizing this utility leadsusers to “free-riding”; ie getting information about other users and offering no informationabout themselves. This results in SN shutdown (no functionality). We then propose protocolsto achieve a correlated equilibrium between users; in which they coordinate theirdisclosures in view of jointly maximizing their utilities. The proposed protocol can be used toassist an SN user in making rational decisions regarding which of her attributes she …,International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2010,12
Scalability and security in biased many-to-one communication,Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract In multicast communication; a source transmits the same content to a set ofreceivers. Current protocols for multicast follow a tree communication model which makesthem scalable. This allows the set of receivers to be arbitrarily large. A large set of receivers(leaves) poses scalability problems when the multicast source (root) needs to collect datafrom the receivers. The literature on this subject is rather scarce. For a reverse multicastcommunication system to be scalable; it is necessary that intermediate multicast routers inthe tree collect messages from their child nodes; aggregate them and send them back totheir parent node. In this way; the root finally obtains a single message containing all data.Scalability also requires that aggregation of messages does not result in a size growth of theaggregated message. We focus on this problem with the extra requirements that leaf-to …,Computer Networks,2007,12
Oblivious image watermarking robust against scaling and geometric distortions,Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Watermarking stays the main technical safeguard of electronic copyright. This paperpresents the first public-domain oblivious watermarking scheme for images which survivesscaling and geometric distortion attacks. Previous proposals are either proprietary; non-oblivious or require scaling or geometric distortion to be undone prior to mark recovery;which may not be practical in oblivious watermarking. The new scheme uses a tile-basedembedding technique that allows mark recovery from a scaled or geometrically distortedwatermarked image. Other properties of the scheme presented here are that it operates onthe spatial domain; supports multiple marking and does not require previous knowledge ofthe embedded copyright sequence. The latter property makes the proposed watermarkingsuitable for fingerprinting purposes.,International Conference on Information Security,2001,12
Dike: a prototype for secure delegation of statistical data,Josep Domingo-ferrer; Ricardo X Sánchez DelCastillo; Javier Castilla,Abstract The need for delegating statistical data arises when the data owner (eg statisticaloce) wants to have its data handled by an external party. If the external party is untrustedand data are condential; delegation should be performed in a way that preserves security. Acryptographic solution to the secure delegation problem is outlined which provides datasecrecy and computation veriability.,in Proceedings of SDP'98,1998,12
Software run-time protection: A cryptographic issue,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract A new method is featured which solves the software integrity problem by properlycoding rather than enciphering. Adopting the lengthy and expensive solution which consistsof having the whole program signed/encrypted by an authority would require full decryptionand secure storage for the whole program before execution; whereas one signed instruction;pipe-lined decoding-executing; and secure recording of a few of the last read instructionssuffice in our case.

Asymmetric homomorphisms for secure aggregation in heterogeneous scenarios,Alexandre Viejo; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract In multicast communication; a single source transmits the same content to a largeamount of receivers. This kind of communication is usually represented following a treemodel where the root of the tree is the multicast source and the leaves are the receivers.Scalability problems arise when the root needs to collect data (sensor information; meteringdata; etc.) from the leaves. This results in a many-to-one (leaf-to-root) communication. Thematter is further complicated if there are security requirements on the leaf-to-root traffic. Inthis paper we present a method for secure and scalable many-to-one lossy transmissionbased on asymmetric homomorphisms which enables the root of the tree to compute anymathematical function (eg minimum; maximum; average;…) on the data sent by the leaves.Our proposal preserves the confidentiality of those data.

Selecting potentially relevant records using re-identification methods,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract This work proposes re-identification algorithms to select records that are interestingfrom the point of view of giving new information. Instead of focusing on re-identifiedelements; we focus on non re-identified records (non linked records) as they are the onesthat potentially supply new and relevant information. Moreover; these relevantcharacteristics can correspond to chances for improving the knowledge of a system. Toevaluate our approach; we have applied it to a example using publicly available data fromthe UCI repository. We have used the data of the ionosphere data base to build a re-identification problem for 35 non-common variables. We show that the use of a simpleheuristic rule base can effectively select potentially interesting records.,New Generation Computing,2004,11

A co-utility approach to the mesh economy: the crowd-based business model,Abeba Nigussie Turi; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; Dritan Osmani,Abstract We explore the mesh economy applications of co-utility; a new concept describingself-enforcing and mutually beneficial interactions among self-interested agents. We showthat the crowdsourcing market is naturally co-utile (without additional incentives).Furthermore; we analyze the investment crowdfunding industry and propose solutions thatcan neutralize the fear and mistrust effects underlying its market in order to make it strictly co-utile. Up on our analysis under the co-utility framework; we corroborate that collaboration isalways rationally sustainable; as long as the system is co-utile and that all co-utile outcomesare Pareto-optimal; but not all Pareto-optimal outcomes are co-utile. In addition; reciprocityand hybridity equilibrium are compatible with co-utility in specific cases at which theyprovide Pareto-optimal outcomes.

Semantic variance: an intuitive measure for ontology accuracy evaluation,David Sánchez; Montserrat Batet; Sergio Martínez; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Ontology evaluation is a relevant issue in the field of knowledge representation. Itaims at quantifying the quality of ontologies; so that potential users can have an idea of theiraccuracy and thereby select the most appropriate ontology for a specific application. Many ofthe ontology evaluation methods and frameworks available in the literature assess thequality of ontologies according to their structural features; even though most of thesemethods propose ad hoc aggregations of such features that lack a theoretical basis. Inspiredby recent empirical studies showing that some structural features are better suited to predictthe semantic accuracy of ontologies; we present in this paper the notion of semanticvariance of an ontology. Semantic variance is an intuitive and inherently semantic measureto evaluate the accuracy of ontologies. Unlike ad hoc methods; our proposal is a …,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2015,10
Improving the utility of differential privacy via univariate microaggregation,David Sánchez; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Sergio Martínez,Abstract Differential privacy is a privacy model for anonymization that offers more robustprivacy guarantees than previous models; such as k-anonymity and its extensions. However;it is often disregarded that the utility of differentially private outputs is quite limited; eitherbecause of the amount of noise that needs to be added to obtain them or because utility isonly preserved for a restricted type of queries. On the contrary; k-anonymity-likeanonymization offers general purpose data releases that make no assumption on the usesof the protected data. This paper proposes a mechanism to offer general purposedifferentially private data releases with a specific focus on the preservation of the utility of theprotected data. Our proposal relies on univariate microaggregation to reduce the amount ofnoise needed to satisfy differential privacy. The theoretical benefits of the proposal are …,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2014,10
Signatures in hierarchical certificateless cryptography: Efficient constructions and provable security,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Bo Qin; Peng Zeng,Abstract Many efforts have been devoted in recent years to constructing secure schemes incertificateless cryptography. The aim is to eliminate the key escrow problem of identity-based cryptography. However; most of the work takes place in traditional certificatelesscryptography; which suffers from the single-point problem. Hierarchical cryptographyexploits a practical security model to mirror the organizational hierarchy in the real world andhence can eliminate the single-point problem. To incorporate the advantages of both typesof cryptosystems; in this paper we instantiate hierarchical certificateless cryptography byformalizing the notion of hierarchical certificateless signatures. A concrete hierarchicalcertificateless signature scheme is also proposed. The security of our scheme is provenunder the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. As to efficiency; our scheme has …,Information Sciences,2014,10
DNA-inspired anonymous fingerprinting for efficient peer-to-peer content distribution,David Megías; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,When selling electronic content; the merchant would like each buyer to receive a differentcopy of the content fingerprinted with a serial number; in order to be able to traceredistributors should illegal redistribution happen. On the other hand; the merchant wouldlike content distribution to be as scalable as possible; in order for mass transactions to bepossible. Multicast content distribution fails to satisfy the first requirement: all receivers getexactly the same copy of the content; which makes it difficult to trace illegal redistributors.Unicast distribution of fingerprinted content; on the other hand; fails to satisfy the secondrequirement: for each buyer; the merchant needs to compute a fingerprint and establish aconnection.

On reliability indices of communication networks,Juan Alberto Rodríguez-Velázquez; Aida Kamišalić; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract The aim of this paper is to study the global reliability of communication networks.We assume that; in a communication network; the weights of the edges quantify the volumeor the quality of the information transmitted by the nodes. In such a case; the strength of apath (resp. walk); called the reliability of the path (resp. walk) can be calculated as theproduct of the weights of the edges belonging to the paths (resp. walks). We introduce threeindices to compute the reliability of a digraph (resp. graph). The first one is a version ofWiener index where we consider only the most reliable path between each pair of nodes.The second notion of reliability index considers reliability of all walks between each pair ofnodes instead of taking into account only the most reliable path. The last one is ageneralization of the functional centralization to the case of weighted networks. In this …,Computers & Mathematics with Applications,2009,10
Optimal multivariate 2-microaggregation for microdata protection: a 2-approximation,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé,Abstract Microaggregation is a special clustering problem where the goal is to cluster a setof points into groups of at least k points in such a way that groups are as homogeneous aspossible. Microaggregation arises in connection with anonymization of statistical databasesfor privacy protection (k-anonymity); where points are assimilated to database records. Ausual group homogeneity criterion is within-groups sum of squares minimization SSE. Formultivariate points; optimal microaggregation; ie with minimum SSE; has been shown to beNP-hard. Recently; a polynomial-time O (k 3)-approximation heuristic has been proposed(previous heuristics in the literature offered no approximation bounds). The special case k=2 (2-microaggregation) is interesting in privacy protection scenarios with neither internalintruders nor outliers; because information loss is lower: smaller groups imply smaller …,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2006,10

Secure reverse communication in a multicast tree,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Antoni Martínez-Ballesté; Francesc Sebé,Abstract Multicast content delivery can be expected to become a major source of revenuewith the increase of private broadband fixed and mobile communications. Several multicastapplications require the receivers to securely send some real-time information back to thesource; which leads to a many-to-one communication scenario. Using unicast connectionsto send this reverse traffic results in a data implosion which may swamp the source withincoming communication. In order to avoid this problem; a method for aggregating theinformation as it is being sent back to the source is presented in this paper.

We propose a solution to digital forgetting based onanonymously fingerprinting expiration dates. In our solution; people who learn informationabout an individual are rationally interested in helping the individual enforce her oblivionpolicy.

Marginality: a numerical mapping for enhanced exploitation of taxonomic attributes,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Hierarchical attributes appear in taxonomic or ontology-based data (eg NACEeconomic activities; ICD-classified diseases; animal/plant species; etc.). Such taxonomicdata are often exploited as if they were flat nominal data without hierarchy; which implieslosing substantial information and analytical power. We introduce marginality; a numericalmapping for taxonomic data that allows using on those data many of the algorithms andanalytical techniques designed for numerical data. We show how to compute descriptivestatistics like the mean; the variance and the covariance on marginality-mapped data. Also;we define a mathematical distance between records including hierarchical attributes that isbased on marginality-based variances. Such a distance paves the way to re-using ontaxonomic data clustering and anonymization techniques designed for numerical data.,International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2012,8

We then address thefundamental issue of achieving these conflicting properties in a unified solution; havingobserved that separate efforts cannot fulfill the VANET design objectives.

Especially forwireless multicast delivery; it is important that payment collection be fine-grain: the customershould pay only for the content that she actually consumes. This can be achieved by usingpay-per-view based on micropayments. This paper proposes the first method for enablingpay-as-you-watch services in a multicast content delivery environment. On the customer'sside; micropayment generation is implemented in a smart card which can be plugged intothe customer's receiving device (computer; digital video receiver; PDA; mobile phone; etc.).Micropayment collection and verification are distributed among multicast routers; whichavoids bottlenecks inherent to many-to-one payment transmission.,CARDIS,2002,8

Anonymous and secure aggregation scheme in fog-based public cloud computing,Huaqun Wang; Zhiwei Wang; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract By using fog computing; cloud computing can be extended to the edge of thenetwork. Generally; in the public cloud; fog computing comprises three components: terminaldevice; fog node and public cloud server (PCS). In this paper; we propose the concept ofanonymous and secure aggregation scheme (ASAS) in fog-based public cloud computing.In the ASAS model; a fog node aggregates the data from terminal nodes and forwards theaggregated data to the public cloud server. By using the ASAS scheme; the fog node canhelp terminal devices upload their data to PCS. By using the data aggregation technique;our ASAS scheme can save bandwidth between the fog node and PCS. At the same time;our ASAS scheme not only protects the identities of terminal devices by using pseudonymsbut it also guarantees data secrecy via a homomorphic encryption technique.

Disclosure risk assessment via record linkage by a maximum-knowledge attacker,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Sara Ricci; Jordi Soria-Comas,Before releasing an anonymized data set; the data protector must know how safe the dataset is; that is; how much disclosure risk is incurred by the release. If no privacy model is usedto select specific privacy guarantees prior to anonymization; posterior disclosure riskassessment must be performed based on the anonymized data set and; if the result is notsatisfactory; anonymization must be repeated with stricter privacy parameters. Even if aprivacy model is used; it may still be advisable to empirically evaluate disclosure on theanonymized data set; especially if the privacy model parameters have been relaxed toimprove data utility.

Rational behavior in peer-to-peer profile obfuscation for anonymous keyword search: the multi-hop scenario,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Úrsula González-Nicolás,Abstract Web search engines (WSEs) have become an essential tool for searching the hugeamount of information stored in the World Wide Web. WSEs try to build query profiles of theirusers; in order to increase the accuracy of the results provided to users and also to fine-tuneadvertising. Profiling the query interests of users clearly encroaches on their privacy. Thereare several anti-profiling approaches in web search; among which those relying on peer-to-peer profile obfuscation stand out. In this paper; we analyze the multi-hop peer-to-peerprofile obfuscation game; in which a peer forwards her query to a second peer; who maysubmit it on behalf of the first peer or just forward it to a third peer; and so on. We describeseveral privacy utility functions for peers (query-level entropy; category-level entropy;hierarchical variance; privacy for location-based queries) and a rational protocol in terms …,Information Sciences,2012,7

Spending programs: A tool for flexible micropayments,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Herrera-Joancomartí,Abstract Micropayments are electronic payments of small amount. Given their low value; thecost of the corresponding electronic transactions should also be kept low. Currentmicropayment schemes allow a regular amount of money withdrawn from a bank to be splitinto fixed-value coupons; each of which is used for one micropayment. A more flexiblemechanism is proposed in this paper; whereby coupons of variable value can be generatedby a spending program without increasing the transaction cost. Moreover; the spendingprogram allows one of several alternative ways of splitting the amount withdrawn into re-usable coupons to be selected in real-time.,International Workshop on Information Security,1999,7
Privacy-preserving loyalty programs,Alberto Blanco-Justicia; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Loyalty programs are promoted by vendors to incentivize loyalty in buyers. Althoughsuch programs have become widespread; they have been criticized by business expertsand consumer associations: loyalty results in profiling and hence in loss of privacy ofconsumers. We propose a protocol for privacy-preserving loyalty programs that allowsvendors and consumers to enjoy the benefits of loyalty (returning customers and discounts;respectively); while allowing consumers to stay anonymous and empowering them to decidehow much of their profile they reveal to the vendor. The vendor must offer additional rewardif he wants to learn more details on the consumer's profile. Our protocol is based on partiallyblind signatures and generalization techniques; and provides anonymity to consumers andtheir purchases; while still allowing negotiated consumer profiling.,*,2015,6

The functionality-security-privacy game,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Privacy preservation in the information society is in many respects parallel toenvironment preservation in the physical world. In this way;“green ICT services” are thoseachieving functionality and security with minimum invasion of the privacy of individuals;where such an invasion can be regarded as a kind of pollution as harmful in the long run totheir moral welfare as physical pollution is to their physical welfare. Depending on the typeof service; individuals can be users; data owners or respondents having supplied data. Weshow that the conflict between functionality; security and privacy can be viewed as a gamebetween several players whose interests differ. If the game is properly formulated; itsequilibria can lead to protocols conciliating the functionality; security and privacy interests ofall players.,International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2009,6

Statistical disclosure control in Catalonia and the CRISES group,Josep Domingo Ferrer,STATISTICAL DISCILOSURE CONTROL; IN CATALONIA AND THE CRISES (3 ROUP JosepDomingo IDepartament d'Enginycria Química; Estadística i IO ETSE Universitat Rovira i VirgiliStatistical Offices release two kinds of data through their statistical databases: tabular data andmicrOdata sets (individual respondent rccords).

Individual differential privacy: A utility-preserving formulation of differential privacy guarantees,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; David Megías,Differential privacy is a popular privacy model within the research community because of thestrong privacy guarantee it offers; namely that the presence or absence of any individual in adata set does not significantly influence the results of analyses on the data set. However;enforcing this strict guarantee in practice significantly distorts data and/or limits data uses;thus diminishing the analytical utility of the differentially private results. In an attempt toaddress this shortcoming; several relaxations of differential privacy have been proposed thattrade off privacy guarantees for improved data utility. In this paper; we argue that thestandard formalization of differential privacy is stricter than required by the intuitive privacyguarantee it seeks. In particular; the standard formalization requires indistinguishability ofresults between any pair of neighbor data sets; while indistinguishability between the …,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2017,5
Rank-based record linkage for re-identification risk assessment,Krishnamurty Muralidhar; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract There is a tradition of data administrators using record linkage to assess the re-identification risk before releasing anonymized microdata sets. In this paper we describe arecord linkage procedure based on ranks; and we compare the performance of this rank-based record linkage against the more usual distance-based record linkage to re-identifyrecords masked using several different masking methods.

Filtering P2P loans based on co-utile reputation,Abeba Nigussie Turi; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez,ABSTRACT Peer-to-peer loans suffer from a mistrust effect; which is amplified by theinformation asymmetry underlying the P2P online lending market. In this work; we assumethat a reputation capital can act as a trust-building intangible collateral in such a market. Weleverage a distributed reputation protocol based on the co-utility principle; whereby peerinteractions should be mutually beneficial and hence self-enforcing. In this co-utile protocol;rational peers cooperate to compute each other's reputation scores. Reputation scores ofborrowers are computed based on the outcome of direct transactions. Then; the reputationmechanism helps filter credible borrowers based on their respective reputation scores. Byusing an experiment on a simulated platform with a randomly selected sample of loans fromLendingClub; we show that this protocol can improve the efficiency of the P2P online …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Applied Computing; AC,2016,5
Privacy-preserving trust management mechanisms from private matching schemes,Oriol Farras; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Alberto Blanco-Justicia,Abstract Cryptographic primitives are essential for constructing privacy-preservingcommunication mechanisms. There are situations when two parties that do not know eachother need to exchange sensitive information over the Internet. Trust managementmechanisms make use of digital credentials in order to establish trust among thesestrangers. We present a method to reach an agreement on the credentials to be exchangedin which the parties can control the disclosure of their credential preferences. Our method isbased on secure two-party computation protocols for set intersection.,*,2014,5
Sensitivity-independent differential privacy via prior knowledge refinement,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,We propose a new mechanism to implement differential privacy. Unlike the usualmechanism based on adding a noise whose magnitude is proportional to the sensitivity ofthe query function; our proposal is based on the refinement of the user's prior knowledgeabout the response. Our mechanism is shown to have several advantages over noiseaddition: it does not require complex computations; and thus it can be easily automated; itlets the user exploit her prior knowledge about the response to achieve better data quality;and it is independent of the sensitivity of the query function (although this can be adisadvantage if the sensitivity is small). Furthermore; we give a general algorithm forknowledge refinement and we show some compounding properties of our mechanism forthe case of multiple queries; also; we build an interactive mechanism on top of knowledge …,International Journal of Uncertainty; Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems,2012,5
A new identity based signcryption scheme in the standard model,Bo Qin; Huaqun Wang; Qianhong Wu; Jianwei Liu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Signcryption is a useful cryptographic primitive which simultaneously performs encryptionand signature with cost less than the signature-then-encryption approach. Identity-basedsigncryption (IBSC) eliminates the complicated management of certificates in signcryptionschemes in the traditional public-key infrastructure (PKI) setting. Most IBSC schemes areconstructed in the random oracle model; while it is unknown how to instantiate a really"random" oracle in the real world. By exploiting Boneh et al.'s strongly unforgeable signatureand Paterson et al.'s identity-based signature; this paper proposes a new IBSC scheme inthe standard model. It is proven that our IBSC scheme satisfies semantic security and strongunforgeability under the bilinear decision Diffie-Hellman (BDDH) assumption. The proofs donot rely on random oracles. Performance analysis shows that our scheme is also efficient …,Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCoS); 2012 4th International Conference on,2012,5
Watermarking numerical data in the presence of noise,Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Castella-Roca,Data mining aims at extracting knowledge from data. Sometimes this requires the dataowner to make data available to the data analyst. Unless the analyst is trusted by the dataowner; the latter may wish to have his intellectual property rights protected. Watermarking isa way to provide some protection; not only for multimedia data; but also for numerical data. Itconsists of imperceptibly embedding a secret mark into the data to be protected. The markcan later be used to resolve any subsequent disputes on data ownership. This paperpresents a watermarking method that embeds a watermark into each attribute of amultivariate continuous numerical dataset. This watermarking method is shown to be robustagainst random noise addition attacks. Data quality is assured to the extent that thewatermarked data nearly preserve the attribute means and the covariance matrix from the …,International Journal of Uncertainty; Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems,2006,5
On the security of a repaired mental poker protocol,Jordi Castella-Roca; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé,In 2003; Zhao; Varadharajan and Mu proposed a mental poker protocol whose security wasshown to be flawed in 2004: any player (or any outsider knowing the deck coding) is able todecrypt encrypted cards without knowing the encryption key. In 2005; the first two authorspublished a repaired version of this TTP-free mental poker protocol. We show here that thissecond version is also flawed: the first player can find all cleartexts of the final encryptedshuffled deck of cards. Both protocols are similar to Shamir-Rivest-Adleman's mental poker;but they replace an exponential commutative cipher with an ElGamal-like commutativecipher. We conclude that changing the underlying commutative cipher is the reason of theirweakness,Information Technology: New Generations; 2006. ITNG 2006. Third International Conference on,2006,5
Microaggregation: achieving k-anonymity with quasi-optimal data quality,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,♣ Several types of attributes can be distinguished in a set of microdata (recordscorresponding to individuals or companies):• Identifiers. These unambiguously identify therespondent to whom the record corresponds. Identifiers are usually suppressed in microdatasets released by NSIs.• Key attributes. Those are attributes that; in combination; can belinked with external information to re-identify (some of) the respondents corresponding to(some of) the records.,European Conference on Quality in Survey Statistics,2006,5
Asynchronous large-scale certification based on certificate verification trees,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Marc Alba; Francesc Sebé,Abstract Good public-key infrastructures (PKIs) are essential to make electronic commercesecure. Quite recently; certificate verification trees (CVTs) have been introduced as a tool forimplementation of large-scale certification authorities (CAs). In most aspects; the CVTapproach outperforms previous approaches like X. 509 and certificate revocation lists;SDSI/SPKI; certificate revocation trees; etc. However; there is a tradeoff betweenmanageability for the CA and response time for the user: CVT-based certification as initiallyproposed is synchronous; ie. certificates are only issued and revoked at the end of a CVTupdate period (typically once a day). Assuming that the user is represented by a smart card;we present here solutions that preserve all advantages of CVTs while relaxing theaforementioned synchronization requirement.

Privacy homomorphisms for statistical confidentiality,Josep Domingo Ferrer,When publishing contingency tables which contain official statistics; a need to preservestatistical confidentiality arises. Statistical disclosure of individual units must be prevented.There is a wide choice of techniques to achieve this anonymization: cell supression; cellperturbation; etc. In this paper; we tackle the problem of using anonymized data to computeexact statistics; our approach is based on privacy homomorphisms; which are encryptiontransformations such that the decryption of a function of cyphers is a (possibly different)function of the corresponding clear messages. A new privacy homomorphism is presentedand combined with some anonymization techniques; in order for a classified level to retrieveexact statistics from statistics computed on disclosure-protected data at an unclassified level.,*,1996,5
Anonymization in the time of big data,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract In this work we explore how viable is anonymization to prevent disclosure instructured big data. For the sake of concreteness; we focus on k-anonymity; which is the best-known privacy model based on anonymization. We identify two main challenges to use k-anonymity in big data. First; confidential attributes can also be quasi-identifier attributes;which increases the number of quasi-identifier attributes and may lead to a large informationloss to attain k-anonymity. Second; in big data there is an unlimited number of datacontrollers; who may publish independent k-anonymous releases on overlappingpopulations of subjects; the k-anonymity guarantee does not longer hold if an observerpools such independent releases. We propose solutions to deal with the above twochallenges. Our conclusion is that; with the proposed adjustments; k-anonymity is still …,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2016,4
On the compatibility of big data driven research and informed consent: The example of the Human Brain Project,Markus Christen; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Bogdan Draganski; Tade Spranger; Henrik Walter,Abstract Big Data research is usually explorative; meaning that not all possible hypothesesare known that one may wish to test when data is made available. For the case ofbiomedical data this poses a significant challenge; as the originators of the data–patients orresearch participants–have to provide informed consent for using their data. The typicallyobtained “closed” or “narrow consent”; ie consenting to use the data in a well-definedresearch project; is conceptually incompatible with the explorative nature of Big Data drivenresearch. Therefore;“open” or “broad consent” is proposed as an alternative. Nevertheless;open consent cannot justify any type of data use; but requires an “information framework”that separates legitimate from illegitimate Big Data research. For example; consent is givenassociated with established disease categories: a patient diagnosed with early-onset …,*,2016,4

Distance computation between two private preference functions,Alberto Blanco; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Oriol Farras; David Sánchez,Abstract We consider the following problem: two parties have each a private function; forexample one that outputs the party's preferences on a set of alternatives; they wish tocompute the distance between their functions without any of the parties revealing its functionto the other. The above problem is extremely important in the context of social; political orbusiness networks; whenever one wishes to find friends or partners with similar interestswithout having to disclose one's interests to everyone. We provide protocols that solve theabove problem for several types of functions.

On the Security of a Privacy-Preserving Key Management Scheme for Location Based Services in VANETs,Bao Liu; Lei Zhang; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Location based services (LBSs) are promising value-added services in vehicular adhoc networks (VANETs); which can yield substantial economic profits. To extensively deployLBSs in VANETs; it is essential to establish an efficient privacy-preserving key managementscheme. In this paper; we point out a privacy weakness in a recent key managementscheme based on group signatures for LBSs in VANETs; then we propose a secure andprivacy-enhanced version. In our scheme; roadside units (RSUs) act as group managers.Vehicles are distributed into groups maintained by these RSUs. If a vehicle's member key iscompromised; one just needs to update the group public key corresponding to its groupmanager. With this method; the member revocation and privacy leakage problems inschemes based on group signatures are solved effectively. As a result; a vehicle may …,*,2014,4
On the connection between t-closeness and differential privacy for data releases,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,t-Closeness was introduced as an improvement of the well-known k-anonymity privacymodel for data release. On the other hand; e-differential privacy was originally proposed asa privacy property for answers to on-line database queries and it has been very welcome inacademic circles. In spite of their quite diverse origins and motivations; we show in thispaper that t-closeness and e-differential privacy actually provide related privacy guaranteeswhen applied to off-line data release. Specifically; k-anonymity for the quasi-identifierscombined with differential privacy for the confidential attributes yields t-closeness inexpectation.,Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT); 2013 International Conference on,2013,4

Risk-utility paradigms for statistical disclosure limitation: How to think; but not how to act-discussion: A science of statistical disclosure limitation,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,The final question raised in Cox et al.(2011)“Can there be a science of data confidentiality?”is an extremely honest and intriguing one; especially coming from authors who have longcontributed to this discipline. It is evocative of Socrates's “I know that I know nothing”. Thehistory of data confidentiality; aka statistical disclosure limitation (SDL); statistical disclosurecontrol (SDC) or statistical database privacy; started back in 1977 with the seminal paper bythe Swedish statistician Tore Dalenius (Dalenius; 1977).

To cater for suchapplications; we propose a new primitive referred to as ad hoc broadcast encryption (AHBE);in which each user possesses a public key and; upon seeing the public keys of the users; asender can securely broadcast to any subset of them; so that only the intended users candecrypt. We implement a concrete AHBE scheme proven secure under the decision BilinearDiffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption. The resulting scheme has sub-linearcomplexity; comparable to up-to-date broadcast systems which have also sub-linearcomplexity but require a fully trusted dealer.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2010,4

Secure and scalable many-to-one symbol transmission for sensor networks,Alexandre Viejo; Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract In secure many-to-one communications; a set of nodes transmit data to the samereceiver. Research in this area focuses on increasing scalability by minimizing the amount ofdata reaching the receiver. Current proposals for secure many-to-one transmission usecostly cryptographic operations.

Secure many-to-one symbol transmission for implementation on smart cards,Francesc Sebé; Alexandre Viejo; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Multicast communication is arguably the most promising paradigm to enable massInternet transmission of live events; or any other content sent on the network from a singlesource to a large community of receivers. A tree model is normally used to represent thistype of communication. Scalability problems arise when communication is many-to-one (leaf-to-root) rather than one-to-many (root-to-leaf): this is the case when the root collects data(sensor information; usage data; micropayments in real-time pay-per-view; etc.) from theleaves. The matter is further complicated if there are confidentiality and authenticityrequirements on the leaf-to-root traffic. We present here a new method offering security andscalability in many-to-one communication which outperforms previous proposals in theliterature: it is more general; it saves more bandwidth and it is computationally simpler.

Microaggregation heuristics for p-sensitive k-anonymity,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé; Agusti Solanas,Abstract. p-Sensitive k-anonymity is a sophistication of k-anonymity requiring that there be atleast p different values for each confidential attribute within the records sharing acombination of key attributes. Like for k-anonymity; the computational approach originallyproposed to achieve this property is based on generalization and suppression; this hasseveral data utility problems; such as turning numerical key attributes into categorical;injecting new categories; injecting missing data; etc. We present and evaluate two heuristicsfor p-sensitive k-anonymity which; being based on microaggregation; overcome most ofsuch drawbacks; while offering a smooth information loss increase as p and k grow.,Proceedings of Joint UNECE/Eurostat work session on statistical data confidentiality,2007,4

Enhancing watermark robustness through mixture of watermarked digital objects,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé,After the failure of copy prevention methods; watermarking stays the main technicalsafeguard of electronic copyright. There are many properties that a watermarking schemeshould offer such as imperceptibility and robustness. The robustness property measures theresistance of the watermark against some attacks; which attempt to remove it partially orcompletely. Nowadays; many watermarking schemes exist each of them robust against acertain list of attacks but vulnerable to many others. It is not always easy to obtain newschemes that resist more and more attacks. This paper proposes general mixture techniquesto combine the properties of several watermarking methods so as to obtain watermarkedobjects robust against most of the attacks survived by the combined methods.,Information Technology: Coding and Computing; 2002.

Achieving rights untransferability with client-independent servers,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract This article presents a scheme for enforcing access rights untransferability in aclient-server scenario. Assumptions include a central authority and servers which are trustedand hold no access information about clients. For a client sharing none of her rights;usurpation of a right seems as hard as the discrete logarithm. Also; rights sharing betweenclients does not compromise their non-shared rights when a sound public-key cryptosystemis used. Transferring rights between clients without the authority's contribution cannot bedone if a sound public-key cryptosystem is used. However; only control on partial rightstransfers is addressed in this paper; which does not deal with total identity transfer oralienation.,Designs; Codes and Cryptography,1996,4

Denoting by “principal” any ofthe parties involved in a protocol-smart cards; teller machines; workstations; file servers; etc.-; a probabilistic extension of BAN logic is introduced that accomodates authenticationscenarios where no principal trusts each other completely on any statement.

However; the multi-cloud is semi-honest; that is; it follows the protocols but is not authorized to learn thesensitive data. Hence; the data must be stored and computed on by the multi-cloud in aprivacy-preserving format; which we choose to be vertical splitting among the variousclouds. We give a comparison of our proposals; based on the secure scalar product; againsta benchmark protocol consisting of downloading plus local computation.,Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2016,3
Privacy in spatio-temporal databases: a microaggregation-based approach,Rolando Trujillo-Rasua; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Technologies able to track moving objects such as GPS; GSM; and RFID; havebeen well-adopted worldwide since the end of the 20th century. As a result; companies andgovernments manage and control huge spatio-temporal databases; whose publication couldlead to previously unknown knowledge such as human behaviour patterns or new roadtraffic trends (eg; through Data Mining). Aimed at properly balancing data utility with users'privacy rights; several microaggregation-based methods for publishing movement data havebeen proposed. These methods are reviewed in this book chapter. We highlight challengesin the three stages of the microaggregation process namely; clustering; obfuscation; andprivacy and utility evaluation. We also address some of these challenges by presenting yetanother microaggregation-based method for privacy-preserving publication of spatio …,*,2015,3
Fair pattern discovery,Sara Hajian; Anna Monreale; Dino Pedreschi; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Fosca Giannotti,Abstract Data mining is gaining societal momentum due to the ever increasing availability oflarge amounts of human data; easily collected by a variety of sensing technologies. We areassisting to unprecedented opportunities of understanding human and society behavior thatunfortunately is darkened by several risks for human rights: one of this is the unfairdiscrimination based on the extracted patterns and profiles. Consider the case when a set ofpatterns extracted from the personal data of a population of individual persons is releasedfor subsequent use in a decision making process; such as; eg; granting or denying credit.Decision rules based on such patterns may lead to unfair discrimination; depending on whatis represented in the training cases. In this context; we address the discrimination risksresulting from publishing frequent patterns. We present a set of pattern sanitization …,Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2014,3
Secure one-to-group communications escrow-free ID-based asymmetric group key agreement,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Bo Qin; Sherman SM Chow; Wenchang Shi,Abstract Group key agreement (GKA) is widely employed for secure group communications.Yet there is an increasing demand for secure one-to-group communications in distributedcomputing applications. Asymmetric group key agreement (AGKA) is a handy tool to answerthis need. In AGKA; a group of members can establish a group public key while eachmember has a different secret key. Any sender can encrypt under this group key such thatany of the members who hold the secret key can decrypt. This paper proposes an identity-based AGKA protocol which is secure against active attackers; with an emphasis on optimalround efficiency; sender dynamics; and escrow freeness. The last feature offers security ofthe previously established ciphertexts even when either all the involved participants or thekey generation center of the identity-based cryptosystem are compromised.

Improving data utility in differential privacy and k-anonymity,Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract: We focus on two mainstream privacy models: k-anonymity and differential privacy.Once a privacy model has been selected; the goal is to enforce it while preserving as muchdata utility as possible. The main objective of this thesis is to improve the data utility in k-anonymous and differentially private data releases. k-Anonymity has several drawbacks. Onthe disclosure limitation side; there is a lack of protection against attribute disclosure andagainst informed intruders. On the data utility side; dealing with a large number of quasi-identifier attributes is problematic. We propose a relaxation of k-anonymity that deals withthese issues. Differential privacy limits disclosure risk through noise addition. The Laplacedistribution is commonly used for the random noise. We show that the Laplace distribution isnot optimal: the same disclosure limitation guarantee can be attained by adding less …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1307.0966,2013,3
Transactions on Large-Scale Data-and Knowledge-Centered Systems VIII: Special Issue on Advances in Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,Abdelkader Hameurlain; Josef Küng; Roland Wagner; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Umeshwar Dayal,Data warehousing and knowledge discovery is an extremely active research area where anumber of methodologies and paradigms converge; with coverage of both theoretical issuesand practical solutions. The area of data warehousing and knowledge discovery has beenwidely accepted as a key technology for enterprises and organizations; as it allows them toimprove their abilities in data analysis; decision support; and the automatic extraction ofknowledge from data. With the exponentially growing amount of information to be includedin the decision-making process; the data to be considered are becoming more and morecomplex in both structure and semantics. As a consequence; novel developments; both atthe methodological level; eg; complex analytics over data; and at the infrastructural level; eg;cloud computing architectures; are necessary.

An improved binary authentication tree algorithm for vehicular networks,Huaqun Wang; Bo Qin; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Vehicular networks are gaining popularity because vehicular communications are able tohelp minimize accidents; improve traffic conditions; etc. To avoid malicious attacks andpotential abuse; employing digital signatures is widely recognized as the most efficientapproach for vehicular networks. However; when the number of signatures received by aroadside unit (RSU) becomes large; a scalability problem emerges immediately: it can bedifficult for the RSU to sequentially verify every received signature within 100-300ms asrequired by the current Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) broadcastprotocol. Jiang et al. proposed a robust and efficient signature scheme for vehicular-to-infrastructure communications; called binary authentication tree. In this paper; we show thattheir binary authentication algorithm is insecure to at least two attacks. The first attack …,Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCoS); 2012 4th International Conference on,2012,3
Differential privacy through knowledge refinement,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,We introduce a novel mechanism to attain differential privacy. Contrary to the commonmechanism based on the addition of a noise whose magnitude is proportional to thesensitivity of the query function; our proposal is based on the refinement of the user's priorknowledge about the response. We show that our mechanism has several advantages overnoise addition: it does not require complex computations; and thus it can be easilyautomated; it lets the user exploit her prior knowledge about the response to achieve betterdata quality; and it is independent of the sensitivity of the query function (although this canbe a disadvantage if the sensitivity is small). We also show some compounding properties ofour mechanism for the case of multiple queries.,Privacy; Security; Risk and Trust (PASSAT); 2012 International Conference on and 2012 International Confernece on Social Computing (SocialCom),2012,3
Microdata,Anco Hundepool; Josep Domingo‐Ferrer; Luisa Franconi; Sarah Giessing; Eric Schulte Nordholt; Keith Spicer; Peter‐Paul de Wolf,Summary The purpose of statistical disclosure control (SDC) for microdata is to preventconfidential information from being linked to specific respondents when releasing amicrodata file. The chapter starts by viewing the whole process of production of microdata forthe users according to the five stages approach to SDC. It deals with the risk-assessmentphase; and provides various definitions of disclosure; the relationships of these withprotection methods are also outlined. The chapter describes methods that limit the risk ofdisclosure without perturbing the original data. Perturbative methods are outlined; and theapproach to SDC based on the production of synthetic data is discussed. The chapterdescribes the ways to analyse information loss due to the application of SDC procedures. Ashort presentation of the software dedicated to SDC for microdata is given. Finally; it …,Statistical Disclosure Control,2012,3
Disclosure Control by Computer Scientists: An Overview and an Application of Microaggregation to Mobility Data Anonymization,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Michal Sramka,Privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) is a subdiscipline of computer science which inmany respects is parallel to statistical disclosure control (SDC) within statistics. See [12] for asurvey of recent developments in PPDM. We focus here on the connections between k-anonymity; a concept arisen in the PPDM community; and microaggregation; a family ofmethods developed within SDC. This is discussed at a conceptual level in Section 2. Wethen move to anonymization of mobility data; ie trajectories; a very dynamic area in PPDMand a completely neglected one in SDC. In Section 3 we apply the microaggregationapproach to k-anonymize real-world trajectories. We present a new distance measure forspatio-temporal data that facilitates the microaggregation process. The measure naturallyconsiders both spatial and temporal aspects and can be fine-tuned for specific …,*,2011,3
Hierarchical certificateless signatures,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Bo Qin,Certificateless cryptography eliminates the key escrow problem in identity-basedcryptography. Hierarchical cryptography exploits a practical security model to mirror theorganizational hierarchy in the real world. In this paper; to incorporate the advantages ofboth types of cryptosystems; we instantiate hierarchical certificate less cryptography byformalizing the notion of hierarchical certificate less signatures. Furthermore; we propose anHCLS scheme which; under the hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH)problem; is proven to be existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message attacksin the random oracle model. As to efficiency; our scheme has constant complexity;regardless of the depth of the hierarchy. Hence; the proposal is secure and scalable forpractical applications.,Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC); 2010 IEEE/IFIP 8th International Conference on,2010,3
Non-Perturbative Masking Methods,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,The simplest way to incorporate unknown values into the relational model; is to allowvariables; in addition to constants; as entries in the columns of relations. Such constructs arecalled tables; instead of relations. A table is an incomplete database; and represents a set ofcomplete databases; each obtained by substituting all variables with constants. Differentoccurrences of the same variable (marked null) are substituted with the same constant. Thesubstitution is thus a function from the variables and constants; to the constants; such thatthe function is identity on the constants. A table T then represents the set of relations;denoted rep (T); defined as {v (T): v is a valuation}. Then the certain answer to a query q on atable T; denoted sure (q; T) is the set of tuples that occur in every answer obtained byapplying the query to every database in rep (T). In other words; the certain answer to q on …,*,2009,3

We address the problem of counting the number of points in theinteger grid in which two digitized straight lines overlap each other in the particular casewhen the crossing point of the non-digitized version of the lines has integer coordinates andthe slopes belong to the set< em>{a/b: a∈{-(N-1);..;(N-1)}; b∈{1;..;(N-1)}}</em>; that is; allthe possible slopes of the segments between two different points in the< em> N× N</em>grid.,Transactions on Data Privacy,2008,3
Information loss in continuous hybrid microdata: Subdomain-level probabilistic measures,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep Maria Mateo-Sanz; Francesc Sebé,Summary The goal of privacy protection in statistical databases is to balance the social rightto know and the individual right to privacy. When microdata (ie data on individualrespondents) are released; they should stay analytically useful but should be protected sothat it cannot be decided whether a published record matches a specific individual.However; there is some uncertainty in the assessment of data utility; since the specific datauses of the released data cannot always be anticipated by the data protector. Also; there isuncertainty in assessing disclosure risk; because the data protector cannot foresee what willbe the information context of potential intruders. Generating synthetic microdata is analternative to the usual approach based on distorting the original data. The main advantageis that no original data are released; so no disclosure can happen. However; subdomains …,*,2006,3

Distributed user identification by zero-knowledge access rights proving,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract A scheme for identifying the rights of users to access files in a computer networkwith many servers is presented. Users are granted rights by an authority; and servers needonly a certified list of available access rights in order to perform access control. A serverstores no information about the users; neither access matrix nor passwords—user portability—; which enables the authority to perform user registration; rights granting and rightsrevocation independently of servers; moreover; the latter two are public operations in theclear. The number of rights shared by more than one user throughout the network is a lowerbound for the number of secret pieces held by each user; but his unshared rights can beincreased indefinitely without changing or increasing his secret information. Rightspossession proofs are zero-knowledge and simultaneous.,Information processing letters,1991,3

Co-utility for digital content protection and digital forgetting,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Megías,Tracing the flow of content on the Internet is a difficult problem; due to the distributed natureof transactions and the lack of a common legal framework. In order to address two relatedproblems; digital content protection and digital forgetting; we introduce the co-utility concept.A protocol is said to be co-utile if helping the other peers that participate in the protocol toincrease their utilities is the way to increase one's own utility. We then present peer-to-peerprotocols that leverage co-utility to provide rationally sustainable solutions for the two above-mentioned problems.,Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net); 2016 Mediterranean,2016,2
Flexible and robust privacy-preserving implicit authentication,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Qianhong Wu; Alberto Blanco-Justicia,Abstract Implicit authentication consists of a server authenticating a user based on the user'susage profile; instead of/in addition to relying on something the user explicitly knows(passwords; private keys; etc.). While implicit authentication makes identity theft by thirdparties more difficult; it requires the server to learn and store the user's usage profile.Recently; the first privacy-preserving implicit authentication system was presented; in whichthe server does not learn the user's profile. It uses an ad hoc two-party computation protocolto compare the user's fresh sampled features against an encrypted stored user's profile. Theprotocol requires storing the usage profile and comparing against it using two differentcryptosystems; one of them order-preserving; furthermore; features must be numerical.

Group discounts compatible with buyer privacy,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Alberto Blanco-Justicia,Abstract We show how group discounts can be offered without forcing buyers to surrendertheir anonymity; as long as buyers can use their own computing devices (eg smartphone;tablet or computer) to perform a purchase. Specifically; we present a protocol for privacy-preserving group discounts. The protocol allows a group of buyers to prove how many theyare without disclosing their identities. Coupled with an anonymous payment system; thismakes group discounts compatible with buyer privacy (that is; buyer anonymity).,*,2015,2

Anonymization methods for taxonomic microdata,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Krish Muralidhar; Guillem Rufian-Torrell,Abstract Often microdata sets contain attributes which are neither numerical nor ordinal; buttake nominal values from a taxonomy; ontology or classification (eg diagnosis in a medicaldata set about patients; economic activity in an economic data set; etc.). Such data sets mustbe anonymized if transferred outside the data collector's premises (eg hospital or nationalstatistical office); say; for research purposes. The literature on microdata anonymizationmethods is relatively limited for nominal data. Multiple imputation is a usual choice for suchdata; but it has computational problems when nominal attributes can take many possibledifferent values. In this paper; we provide anonymization methods for data sets whichinclude nominal taxonomic attributes with many possible different values. We show how toadapt to the case of taxonomic attributes two anonymization methods; data shuffling and …,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2012,2
Hybrid microdata via model-based clustering,Anna Oganian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract In this paper we propose a new scheme for statistical disclosure limitation whichcan be classified as a hybrid method of protection; that is; a method that combines propertiesof perturbative and synthetic methods. This approach is based on model-based clusteringwith the subsequent synthesis of the records within each cluster. The novelty is that theclustering and synthesis methods have been carefully chosen to fit each other in view ofreducing information loss. The model-based clustering tries to obtain clusters such that thewithin-cluster data distribution is approximately normal; then we can use a multivariatenormal synthesizer for the local synthesis of data. In this way; some of the non-normalcharacteristics of the data are captured by the clustering; so that a simple synthesizer fornormal data can be used within each cluster. Our method is shown to be effective when …,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2012,2
Anonymization of trajectory data,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Rolando Trujillo-Rasua,Abstract. Trajectories of mobile objects; are automatically collected in huge quantities.Publishing and exploiting such data is essential to improve planning; but it threatens theprivacy of individuals: re-identification of the individual behind a trajectory is easy unlessprecautions are taken. We present two heuristics for privacy-preserving publication oftrajectories. Both of them publish only true locations. The first heuristic is based on trajectorymicroaggregation and on location permutation; it effectively achieves trajectory k-anonymity.The second heuristic is based only on location permutation; it gives up trajectory k-anonymity and aims at a different property named location k-diversity. The advantage of thesecond heuristic is that it takes into account reachability constraints when computinganonymized trajectories.,Advanced Research in Data Privacy,2011,2
Fully distributed broadcast encryption,Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Lei Zhang; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Broadcast encryption schemes rely on a centralized authority to generatedecryption keys for each user. It is observed that; when a broadcast encryption scheme isdeployed for secret escrows; a dishonest dealer can read the escrowed secrets withoutleaving any witnesses. We present a new broadcast encryption paradigm referred to as fullydistributed broadcast encryption (FDBE) without suffering from this vulnerability. In the newparadigm; there are multiple dealers; and by contacting a number of them equal to athreshold or more; any user can join the system; then the secrets can be encrypted to anysubset of users and only the intended receivers can decrypt; while an attacker cannot getany information about the encrypted message even if the attacker controls all the usersoutside the receiver set and corrupts some dealers; provided that the number of corrupted …,International Conference on Provable Security,2011,2

Secure compression of privacy-preserving witnesses in vehicular ad hoc networks,Bo Qin; Qianhong Wu; Lei Zhang; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are designed to improve traffic safety and efficiency.To this end; the traffic communication must be authenticated to guarantee trustworthiness forguiding drivers and establishing liability in case of traffic accident investigation.Cryptographic authentication techniques have been extensively exploited to secureVANETs. Applying cryptographic authentication techniques such as digital signatures raiseschallenges to efficiently store signatures on messages growing with time. To alleviate theconflict between traffic liability investigation and limited storage capacity in vehicles; thispaper proposes to aggregate signatures in VANETs.

An anonymous electronic commerce scheme with an off-line authority and untrusted agents,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Herrera-Joancomarti,Abstract In the last years; the exponential growth of computer networks has created anincredibly large offer of products and services in the net. Such a huge amount of informationmakes it impossible for a single person to analyze all existing offers of a product on the netand decide which of them fits better her requirements. This problem is solved with theintelligent trade agents (ITA); which are programs that have the ability to roam a network;collect business-related data and use them to make decisions to buy goods on their owners'behalf. Known ITA systems do not provide anonymity in transactions; require an on-linetrusted third party and implicitly assume that the user trusts the ITA. We present a newscheme for an intelligent untrusted trade agent system allowing anonymous electronictransactions with an off-line trusted third party.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,2

Usurping a right with no information at all aboutother clients is for a client as hard as the discrete logarithm; and rights sharing betweenclients does not compromise their non-shared rights as long as RSA confidentiality holds.Transferring rights between clients without the authority's contribution cannot be doneunless RSA confidentiality is broken; however; only control on partial rights transfers isaddressed in this paper; which does not deal with total identity transfer or alienation.,Workshop on the Theory and Application of of Cryptographic Techniques,1993,2

Beyond Informed Consent—Investigating Ethical Justifications for Disclosing; Donating or Sharing Personal Data in Research,Markus Christen; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Dominik Herrmann; Jeroen van den Hoven,Abstract In the last two decades; we have experienced a tremendous growth of the digitalinfrastructure; leading to an emerging web ecosystem that involves a variety of new types ofservices. A characteristic element of this web ecosystem is the massive increase of theamount; availability and interpretability of digitalized information—a development for whichthe buzzword “big data” has been coined. For research; this offers opportunities that just 20years ago were believed to be impossible. Researchers now can access large participantpools directly using services like Amazon Mechanical Turk; they can collaborate withcompanies like Facebook to analyze their massive data sets; they can create own researchinfrastructures by; eg; providing data-collecting Apps for smartphones; or they can enter newtypes of collaborations with citizens that donate personal data.

Intrusion detection and attack tolerance for cloud environments: the CLARUS approach,Georges Ouffoué; Antonio M Ortiz; Ana R Cavalli; Wissam Mallouli; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; Fatiha Zaidi,The cloud has become an established and widespread paradigm. This success is due to thegain of flexibility and savings provided by this technology. However; the main obstacle to fullcloud adoption is security. The cloud; as many other systems taking advantage of theInternet; is also facing threats that compromise data confidentiality and availability. Inaddition; new cloud-specific attacks have emerged and current intrusion detection andprevention mechanisms are not enough to protect the complex infrastructure of the cloudfrom these vulnerabilities. Furthermore; one of the promises of the cloud is the Quality ofService (QoS) by continuous delivery; which must be ensured even in case of intrusion. Thiswork presents an overview of the main cloud vulnerabilities; along with the solutionsproposed in the context of the H2020 CLARUS project in terms of monitoring techniques …,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW); 2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on,2016,1
Privacy-aware loyalty programs,Alberto Blanco-Justicia; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Vendors use loyalty programs as a mechanism to incentivize returning customers;whose repeated transactions provide sustained profit and information on the customers'preferences. Such programs have become widespread; but they are facing criticism bybusiness experts and consumer associations: since they facilitate profiling; a loss ofconsumer privacy ensues. We propose a protocol for privacy-aware loyalty programs thatallows vendors and consumers to enjoy the benefits of loyalty (returning customers for thevendor and rewards for the consumers; respectively); while allowing consumers to stayanonymous and empowering them to decide how much of their profile they reveal to thevendor. The vendor must offer additional reward if he wants to learn more details on theconsumer's profile. Our protocol is based on partially blind signatures and generalization …,Computer Communications,2016,1

On the security of privacy-preserving vehicular communication authentication with hierarchical aggregation and fast response,Lei Zhang; Chuanyan Hu; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Bo Qin,Abstract: In [3]; the authors proposed a highly efficient secure and privacy-preservingscheme for secure vehicular communications. The proposed scheme consists of fourprotocols: system setup; protocol for STP and STK distribution; protocol for common stringsynchronization; and protocol for vehicular communications. Here we define the securitymodels for the protocol for STP and STK distribution; and the protocol for vehicularcommunications; respectively. We then prove that these two protocols are secure in ourmodels. Subjects: Cryptography and Security (cs. CR) Cite as: arXiv: 1508.01575 [cs. CR](orarXiv: 1508.01575 v1 [cs.

Data anonymization,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract Database privacy means different things depending on the context. Here we dealwith protecting the privacy of data subjects/respondents by anonymizing their data records:the scenario is a data collector who wants to release useful information while preserving theprivacy of data subjects/respondents. We consider the various types of data releases;analyze their privacy implications and review the statistical disclosure control techniques inuse.,International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems,2014,1
A provably secure ring signature scheme with bounded leakage resilience,Huaqun Wang; Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Futai Zhang; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Conventionally; the unforgeability of ring signature schemes is defined in an idealenvironment where the attackers cannot access any information about the secret keys of thesigners. This assumption is too strong to be satisfied in the real world since thecryptographic operations involves the secret key information leakage in various ways due topower/time consumption difference in operations on the 0/1 bits of the secret key. Anattacker can obtain this information both passively by collecting power consumptioninformation or actively by injecting faults during the signing operations. Thus; provablysecure ring signature in the conventional security definition may be insecure in the realworld due to the key information leakage. To address this problem; we formalize the firstbounded leakage resilience definition for ring signature.

A generic construction of proxy signatures from certificateless signatures,Lei Zhang; Qianhong Wu; Bo Qin; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Peng Zeng; Jianwei Liu; Ruiying Du,The primitive of proxy signatures allows the original signer to delegate proxy signers to signon messages on behalf of the original signer. It has found numerous applications indistributed computing scenarios where delegation of signing rights is common. Certificateless public key cryptography eliminates the complicated certificates in traditional public keycryptosystems without suffering from the key escrow problem in identity-based public keycryptography. In this paper; we reveal the relationship between the two important primitivesof proxy signatures and certificate less signatures and present a generic conversion from thelatter to the former. Following the generic transformation; we propose an efficient proxysignature scheme with a recent certificate less signature scheme.,Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA); 2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2013,1
Robust distributed privacy-preserving secure aggregation in vehicular communication,Bo Qin; Qianhong Wu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Willy Susilo,Abstract Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs); formed by computers embedded in vehiclesand the traffic infrastructure; are expected to develop in the near future to improve trafficsafety and efficiency. To this end; VANETs should be designed to be resistant againstvarious abuses and attacks. In this paper; we first review the existing proposals to providesecurity; privacy; and data aggregation in vehicle-to-vehicle communication. We thenaddress the fundamental issue of achieving these conflicting properties in a unified solution;having observed that separate efforts cannot fulfill the VANET design objectives. A set ofnew mechanisms are suggested for efficiently managing identities and securelycompressing cryptographic witnesses; which are among the major obstacles to thedeployment of strong security mechanisms in VANETs. Finally; we employ the standard …,*,2012,1

Information loss measures,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,An example of index oriented towards human navigation is the web directory. In such anindex; links to sites are organized into hierarchical categories; according to the sites'contents. In web directories; normally the tasks of collecting and categorizing pages arecarried out under supervision of human editors. An example of index not oriented to humansis a hidden list of metadata. Metadata are data about data. As a mean of assisting a searchengine to locate content or an information entity; they can be used to describe that content orentity. While not visible to humans; this information can provide contextual clues to automaticalgorithms used by search engines.,*,2009,1

On partial anonymity in secret sharing,Vanesa Daza; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Anonymous secret sharing schemes allow a secret to be recovered from sharesregardless of the identity of shareholders. Besides being interesting in its own right; thisproperty is especially appealing to guarantee the anonymity of participants when secretsharing is used as a building block of more general distributed protocols (eg to anonymouslyshare the secret key corresponding to a public key). However; current constructions ofanonymous secret sharing schemes are not very efficient (because of the number of sharesthat every participant must hold) and existing bounds do not leave much room for optimism.In this paper we propose to weaken the anonymity condition to partial anonymity; where bypartial anonymity we mean that the identity of the participant is not made public; but he isknown to belong to some subset. That is; the search for a participant narrows down to one …,European Public Key Infrastructure Workshop,2007,1
Internet voting,JBI Esteve; J Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Internet voting denotes electronic voting (e-voting) systems that allow votes to becast using the Internet. There are; however; other types of e-voting; like those based onoptical ballots; those using computers without remote connection or those sent by phone(Kersting; 2004; Tula; 2005). All these systems can be used in political elections or privateones (binding examples of Internet voting: the 2000 Democratic primary in Arizona or anelection in a chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in 1997). SinceInternet voting will be applied to a democratic framework; it should offer the same conditionsrequired in traditional elections (Cranor; 1997; Gritzalis; 2003; Prosser; 2004; Trechsel;2005). Therefore; the suffrage must be at least universal; free; equal; and anonymous(Mitrou; 2002). Universal voting means that any person entitled to take part in an election …,*,2007,1
Establishing a benchmark for re-identification methods and its validation using fuzzy clustering,Vicenç Torra; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Privacy preserving data mining and statistical disclosure control are related fields withincreasing importance nowadays. They aim is to allow the publication of sensible datawithout compromising the privacy of data respondents. To that end; masking methods havebeen designed so that data are distorted in a way that preserves confidentiality and datautility. Alternatively; methods have been constructed to generate synthetic data that haveproperties similar to the ones of the original data. At the same time; recent research in re-identification methods (record and variable matching) has been pushed forward due to thecurrent interest on security issues and the huge amount of data stored in databases.However; there is no standard methodology for comparing alternative re-identificationmethods. In this paper we propose the use of masking methods and synthetic data …,Fuzzy Systems; 2006 IEEE International Conference on,2006,1

On multicast fingerprinting and collusion security,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé; Antoni Martinez-Balleste,Intellectual property protection of multimedia is a thorny and largely unsolved problem.Despite its practical limitations; copy detection is an excellent complement to copyprevention. Fingerprinting techniques make redistributor tracing possible by relying oninvisible watermarks embedded in the content sold which are unique for each particularbuyer. That uniqueness of fingerprints is not easy to achieve in multicast transmission. Weargue in this paper that encryption-based solutions are the most realistic option to fingerprintmulticast transmission. However; the few existing encryption-based methods in the literatureare vulnerable to buyer collusions. We propose an encryption-based algorithm whichprovides collusion security at the cost of transmitting the content twice.,Automated Production of Cross Media Content for Multi-Channel Distribution; 2005.

On the synergy between certificate verification trees and PayTree-like micropayments,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract A substantial number of micropayment schemes in the literature are based ondistributing the cost of a digital signature over several successive micropayments (egPayword). Thus; a stable relationship between user and merchant is assumed: themicropayments validated by the same signature must take place between the same userand merchant. This stability is ill-suited for surfing on the web; a situation in whichsuccessive micropayments are made to different merchants. Thus coin-basedmicropayments; in which successive micropayments can be unrelated to one another; arefar more interesting. One practical coin-based micropayment system is PayTree; which isamazingly similar to PKIs based on certificate verification trees (CVTs). We propose in thispaper a synthesis of a CVT-based PKI with a PayTree-like micropayment system. The …,European Public Key Infrastructure Workshop,2004,1
A nonrepudiable bitstring commitment scheme based on a public-key cryptosystem,Jordi Castella-Roca; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Commitment schemes are building blocks for guaranteeing fairness in higher-levelcryptographic protocols such as mental poker protocols and others. A party Alice commits toa value v (a bit or a bitstring) without revealing it. Alice should not be able to cheat byopening the commitment as v'/spl ne/v nor to deny having committed at all. Most commitmentschemes in the literature rely on hash functions; which should be strongly collision-free forthe scheme to be secure. Yet collision-freeness can only be empirically checked and cannotbe met with total certainty. We present a commitment scheme which avoids hash functionsby using a public-key cryptosystem instead.,Information Technology: Coding and Computing; 2004. Proceedings. ITCC 2004.

This special issue illustrates that inference control largely draws on soft computing andartificial intelligence techniques.,*,2002,1
Approximating fuzzy measures by hierarchically decomposable ones,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Choquet and Sugeno integrals are powerful data fusion operators for numerical data as theygeneralize some well known aggregation operators as arithmetic means; weighted means;order statistics; OWA operators; medians; and so on. However; real applications of theseoperators require the definition of the so-called fuzzy measure. Difficulties for defining thesemeasures arise because the number of values to be determined in a fuzzy measure is/sup2/N; being N the number of values to be aggregated. On the one hand human experts arenot usually able to supply the large amount of required values and on the other hand it isdifficult to interpret fuzzy measures when learned from examples. To solve this problem;fuzzy measures of reduced complexity have been proposed in the literature. In this work wepropose a method to approximate a general fuzzy measure by a Hierarchically …,Information Fusion; 2002. Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on,2002,1
Watermarking for multilevel access to statistical databases,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Josep Maria Mateo-Sanz; Francesc Sebé,Increased corporate; government and academic demand has prompted official statistics torelease individual respondent data (microdata) in addition to the traditional tabular data.Microdata must be masked by a statistical disclosure control (SDC) method before beingpublished; because otherwise the statistical confidentiality of respondents would becompromised. A novel application of watermarking is discussed in this paper which allowsmultilevel access to numerical microdata: depending on her clearance; the data user canremove more or less of the masking. Non-privileged users just see the published data; butas the clearance of a user increases she can get a data set which is closer and closer to theoriginal one.,Information Technology: Coding and Computing; 2001.

Privacy Homomorphisms For Subcontracting Statistical Computation,Josep Domingo i Ferrer,Abstract When publishing data containing official statistics; a need to preserve statisticalconfidentiality arises. Statistical disclosure of individuals' data must be prevented. There is awide choice of techniques to achieve this anonymization: data perturbation; datasuppression; etc. In this paper; we tackle the problem of using anonymized data to computeexact statistics; the goal is for a classified level (statistical institute) to be able to retrievestatistics computed by an unclassified level (external contractor) on disclosure-protectedmacrodata. Our approach is based on privacy homomorphisms; especially on a recent one.,*,1996,1
A cryptographic mechanism for non-iterative algorithm enforcing,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Llorenç Huguet-Rotger,Ensuring proper algorithm operation has always been a major concern of securitymanagers. The usual trends rely on software verification [6][12]; being thereafter assumed thatno further integrity threats will compromise the programs; and on secure information flow (eithercompile-time or run-time); ie secure dissemination of information among objects in the system[1]. On the other hand; if some protective measure is adopted for subjects (programs); it consistsgenerally of controlling the access to them; but there is no actual efficient means available bywhich software may be self-protected. This leaves a very broad path open for computer virusesto replicate; for example. In this paper; a new method is featured which solves the above problemby properly coding rather than encrypting; that is without adopting the lengthy and expensivesolution which consists of having the whole program signed/encrypted by an authority [9] …,*,1991,1

Connecting Randomized Response; Post-Randomization; Differential Privacy and t-Closeness via Deniability and Permutation,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract: We explore some novel connections between the main privacy models in use andwe recall a few known ones. We show these models to be more related than commonlyunderstood; around two main principles: deniability and permutation. In particular;randomized response turns out to be very modern in spite of it having been introduced over50 years ago: it is a local anonymization method and it allows understanding the protectionoffered by $\epsilon $-differential privacy when $\epsilon $ is increased to improve utility. Asimilar understanding on the effect of large $\epsilon $ in terms of deniability is obtainedfrom the connection between $\epsilon $-differential privacy and t-closeness. Finally; thepost-randomization method (PRAM) is shown to be viewable as permutation and to beconnected with randomized response and differential privacy.

Co-utile Disclosure of Private Data in Social Networks,David Sánchez; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Sergio Martínez,Abstract Social networks (SNs) have become the mainstream web service by which userspublish and share information. However; since much of that information is personal andsensitive; disclosing it in an uncontrolled way entails serious privacy risks. Paradoxically;most SNs assume that their users are willing to disclose sensitive data to others (evenstrangers) with little to no control. In this paper; we formalize the utility that rational usersderive from participating in SNs; and argue that the current information exchange model ishardly sustainable from a rational viewpoint; actually; it goes against the interests of privacy-aware users. To tackle this issue; we propose several co-utile protocols for exchanging(sensitive) information among SN users. An interaction is said to be co-utile if the best wayfor a participant to increase her own utility is to help other participants increase theirs; …,Information Sciences,2018,*
Co-utile P2P Anonymous Keyword Search,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Sergio Martínez; David Sánchez; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract Web search engines have become an essential tool to find online resources.However; their use can reveal very detailed information about the interests of their users. Inthis chapter; we detail co-utile protocols for exchanging queries between users in ananonymous way. Specifically; by exchanging queries with other users; the query profileassociated to each user is masked and approximates the average group interests. However;the query exchange protocol has a cost. To thwart free-riders (who take advantage of theprotocol to mask their profile but are reluctant to help others) we employ a co-utile reputationmanagement system. The theoretical analysis is complemented with empirical resultsobtained from an implementation in a simulated multi-agent environment; which illustrateshow co-utility can make cooperation self-enforcing and improve the agents' welfare.,*,2018,*
Incentive-Based Co-utility: Co-utile Reputation Management,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Oriol Farràs; David Sánchez,Abstract Well-designed protocols should be self-enforcing; that is; be such that rationalparticipating agents have no motivation to deviate from them. In addition; protocols can haveother interesting properties; such as promoting collaboration between agents in a search fora better outcome. In [7; 8]; we proposed the notion of co-utility; which characterizes asituation in which mutual help is the best rational option to take even for purely selfishagents; in particular; if a protocol is co-utile; it is self-enforcing. However; guaranteeing self-enforcement; let alone co-utility; for any type of agent behavior is not possible. To tackle thisissue; in this chapter we detail how reputation mechanisms can be incorporated into existingprotocols in order to make them self-enforcing (and optionally co-utile). Moreover; we showhow to adapt and extend the well-known EigenTrust reputation calculation mechanism so …,*,2018,*
Self-enforcing Collaborative Anonymization via Co-utility,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract In surveys collecting individual data (microdata); each respondent is usuallyrequired to report values for a set of attributes. If some of these attributes contain sensitiveinformation; the respondent must trust the collector not to make any inappropriate use of thedata and; in case any data are to be publicly released; to properly anonymize them to avoiddisclosing sensitive information. If the respondent does not trust the data collector; she mayreport inaccurately or report nothing at all. The reduce the need for trust; local anonymizationis an alternative whereby each respondent anonymizes her data prior to sending them to thedata collector. However; local anonymization by each respondent without seeing otherrespondents' data makes it hard to find a good trade-off minimizing information loss anddisclosure risk.

Problems in the Undertakings of the Collaborative Economy: Co-utile Solutions,Abeba Nigussie Turi; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez,Abstract In the current era of the digital economy; the collaborative economic system; beinga successor of the capitalist system; has led to a greater wave of sharing of scarce resourcesand to the creation of interdependent networks of rational beings. In spite of its promisingfeatures of abundant liquidity and efficient utilization of the underutilized scarce economicresources; the system is still in its early stages of development and suffers from someserious problems that hamper its deployment. In order to unlock the potential of thiseconomic system; there is a need for conciliating the individual freedom of economic agentsand the common good of the information society encompassing it. In this chapter; we tacklethis issue by relying on the recently minted concept of co-utility; which refers to a self-enforcing and mutually beneficial interaction among self-interested agents.

Co-utile Enforcement of Digital Oblivion,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Digital storage in the information society allows perfect and unlimited remembering.Yet; the right of an individual to enforce oblivion for pieces of information about her is part ofher fundamental right to privacy. In this chapter; we detail a co-utile solution to digitalforgetting based on anonymously fingerprinting expiration dates. Due to co-utility; peoplewho learn information about an individual are rationally interested in helping the individualenforce her oblivion policy. Thanks to this rational involvement; even services for contentspreading like Facebook or YouTube would be interested in fingerprinting downloads;thereby effectively enforcing the right of content owners to canceling content.,*,2018,*
Co-utility: Designing Self-enforcing and Mutually Beneficial Protocols,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; David Sánchez; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract Protocols govern the interactions between agents; both in the information societyand in the society at large. Protocols based on mutually beneficial cooperation areespecially interesting because they improve the societal welfare and no central authority isneeded to enforce them (which eliminates a single point of failure and possible bottlenecks).In order to guide the design of such protocols; we introduce co-utility as a framework forcooperation between rational agents such that the best strategy for each agent is to helpanother agent achieve her best outcome. Specifically; in this chapter we study andcharacterize self-enforcing protocols in game-theoretic terms. Then; we use thischaracterization to develop the concept of co-utile protocol and study under whichcircumstances co-utility arises.,*,2018,*
Co-utile Ridesharing,David Sánchez; Sergio Martínez; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Ridesharing has the potential to bring a wealth of benefits both to the actors directlyinvolved in the shared trip (eg; shared travel costs or access to high-occupancy vehiclefacilities) and also to the society in general (eg; reduced traffic congestion and CO\(_ {2}\)emissions). However; even though ridesharing is based on a win-win collaboration andmodern mobile communication technologies have significantly eased discovering andmanaging ride matches; the adoption of ridesharing has paradoxically decreased during thelast years. In this respect; recent studies have highlighted how privacy concerns and the lackof trust among peers are crucial issues that hamper the success of ridesharing. In thischapter; we tackle both of these issues by means of (i) a fully decentralized P2P ridesharingmanagement network that avoids centralized ride-matching agencies (and hence private …,*,2018,*
Co-utile Privacy-Aware P2P Content Distribution,David Megías; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Multicast distribution of content is not suited to content-based electronic commercebecause all buyers obtain exactly the same copy of the content; in such a way that unlawfulredistributors cannot be traced. Unicast distribution has the shortcoming of requiring oneconnection with each buyer; but it allows the merchant to embed a different serial number inthe copy obtained by each buyer; which enables redistributor tracing. Peer-to-peer (P2P)distribution is a third option which may combine some of the advantages of multicast andunicast: on the one hand; the merchant only needs unicast connections with a few seedbuyers; who take over the task of further spreading the content; on the other hand; if a properfingerprinting mechanism is used; unlawful redistributors of the P2P distributed content canstill be traced. In this chapter; we describe a co-utile fingerprinting mechanism for P2P …,*,2018,*

Steered Microaggregation: A Unified Primitive for Anonymization of Data Sets and Data Streams,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Soria-Comas,The data anonymization landscape has become quite complex in the last decades. On themethodology side; the statistical disclosure control methods designed in official statisticshave been supplemented by a number of privacy models proposed by computer scientists.On the data side; static data sets now coexist with big data; and particularly data streams. Inthe quest for a unified and conceptually simple anonymization approach; we present here aprimitive called steered microaggregation that can be tailored to enforce various privacymodels both on static data sets and also on data streams. This type of microaggregationrelies on adding artificial attributes that are properly initialized and weighted in order to steerthe microaggregation process into meeting certain desired constraints. Although not limitedto these; we demonstrate the potential of steered microaggregation by showing how it can …,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2017 IEEE International Conference on,2017,*
Factor Analysis for Anonymization,Aida Calvino; Palmira Aldeguer; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract—In this paper we propose a new method to anonymize (share relevant anddetailed information while not naming names) and protect data sets (minimize the utility loss)based on Factor Analysis. The method basically consists of obtaining the factors; which areuncorrelated; protecting them and undoing the transformation in order to get interpretableprotected variables. We first show how to proceed when all variables in the data set needprotection and; then; we focus on the case where only a subset of variables has to beprotected. Finally; we perform a simulation study to compare the proposed method with twoalternative techniques: Microaggregation plus noise addition (which has been recognizedas a very powerful method) and one anonymization method recently proposed based onPrincipal Components Analysis.,2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW),2017,*
A Methodology to Compare Anonymization Methods Regarding Their Risk-Utility Trade-off,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Sara Ricci; Jordi Soria-Comas,Abstract We present here a methodology to compare statistical disclosure control methodsfor microdata in terms of how they perform regarding the risk-utility trade-off. Previouscomparative studies (eg [3]) usually start by selecting some parameter values for a set ofSDC methods and evaluate the disclosure risk and the information loss yielded by themethods for those parameterizations. In contrast; here we start by setting a certain risk level(resp. utility preservation level) and then we find which parameter values are needed toattain that risk (resp. utility) under different SDC methods; finally; once we have achieved anequivalent risk (resp. utility) level across methods; we evaluate the utility (resp. the risk)provided by each method; in order to rank methods according to their utility preservation(resp. disclosure protection); given a certain level of risk (resp. utility) and a certain …,Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2017,*
Differentially Private Data Sets Based on Microaggregation and Record Perturbation,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract We present an approach to generate differentially private data sets that consists inadding noise to a microaggregated version of the original data set. While this idea hasalready been proposed in the literature to reduce the data sensitivity and hence the noiserequired to reach differential privacy; the novelty of our approach is that we focus on themicroaggregated data set as the target of protection; rather than focusing on the originaldata set and viewing the microaggregated data set as a mere intermediate step. As a result;we avoid the complexities inherent to the insensitive microaggregation used in previouscontributions and we significantly improve the utility of the data. This claim is supported bytheoretical and empirical utility comparisons between our approach and existingapproaches.,Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2017,*
A Non-Parametric Model for Accurate and Provably Private Synthetic Data Sets,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Generating synthetic data is a well-known option to limit disclosure risk in sensitivedata releases. The usual approach is to build a model for the population and then generatea synthetic data set solely based on the model. We argue that building an accuratepopulation model is difficult and we propose instead to approximate the original data asclosely as privacy constraints permit. To enforce an ex ante privacy level when generatingsynthetic data; we introduce a new privacy model called &epsi; synthetic privacy. Then; wedescribe a synthetic data generation method that satisfies &epsi;-synthetic privacy. Finally;we evaluate the utility of the synthetic data generated with our method.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Availability; Reliability and Security,2017,*

Local synthesis for disclosure limitation that satisfies probabilistic k-anonymity criterion.,Anna Oganian; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract. Before releasing databases which contain sensitive information about individuals;data publishers must apply Statistical Disclosure Limitation (SDL) methods to them; in orderto avoid disclosure of sensitive information on any identifiable data subject. SDL methodsoften consist of masking or synthesizing the original data records in such a way as tominimize the risk of disclosure of the sensitive information while providing data users withaccurate information about the population of interest. In this paper we propose a newscheme for disclosure limitation; based on the idea of local synthesis of data. Our approachis predicated on model-based clustering. The proposed method satisfies the requirements ofk-anonymity; in particular we use a variant of the k-anonymity privacy model; namelyprobabilistic k-anonymity; by incorporating constraints on cluster cardinality.

Dynamic group size accreditation and group discounts preserving anonymity,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Alberto Blanco-Justicia; Carla Ràfols,Abstract Group discounts are used by vendors and authorities to encourage certainbehaviors. For example; group discounts can be applied to highway tolls to encourage ridesharing; or by museum managers to ensure a minimum number of visitors and plan guidedtours more efficiently. We show how group discounts can be offered without forcingcustomers to surrender their anonymity; as long as customers are equipped with some formof autonomous computing device (eg smartphone; tablet or computer). Specifically; wepresent a protocol suite for privacy-aware group discounts that allows a group of customersto prove how many they are without disclosing their identities.

Our goal is to utilize its scale anddiversity to estimate location more robustly; than solutions based on smartphones alone;and stop adversaries from using compromised user credentials (eg; stolen keys; passwords;etc.); when sufficient evidence physically locates them elsewhere. To locate users; weleverage the increasing number of IoT devices carried and used by them and the smartenvironments that observe these devices.

Privacy in RFID and mobile objects,Rolando Trujillo-Rasua,Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology aimed at eficiently identifyingand tracking goods and assets. Such identification may be performed without requiring line-of-sight alignment or physical contact between the RFID tag and the RFID reader; whilsttracking is naturally achieved due to the short interrogation field of RFID readers. That is whythe reduction in price of the RFID tags has been accompanied with an increasing attentionpaid to this technology. However; since tags are resource-constrained devices sendingidentification data wirelessly; designing secure and private RFID identification protocols is achallenging task. This scenario is even more complex when scalability must be met by thoseprotocols.

Marginality: a numerical mapping for enhanced treatment of nominal and hierarchical attributes,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract: The purpose of statistical disclosure control (SDC) of microdata; aka dataanonymization or privacy-preserving data mining; is to publish data sets containing theanswers of individual respondents in such a way that the respondents corresponding to thereleased records cannot be re-identified and the released data are analytically useful. SDCmethods are either based on masking the original data; generating synthetic versions ofthem or creating hybrid versions by combining original and synthetic data. The choice ofSDC methods for categorical data; especially nominal data; is much smaller than the choiceof methods for numerical data. We mitigate this problem by introducing a numerical mappingfor hierarchical nominal data which allows computing means; variances and covariances onthem.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.6009,2012,*

They can release data sets to the public if they canguarantee that the dissemination will not harm the privacy of any survey respondent or theycan allow external researchers on-site access to the data in research data centers (RDC) ordata enclaves. Since most data have to be altered in some way to allow data dissemination;many researchers prefer the direct access to the unaltered data at the RDC; especially if thedata dissemination requires perturbation of the microdata. For this reason more and moreagencies deposit their data at data enclaves or set up their own research data centers.However; the use of these facilities comes at a high price both for,*,2011,*

The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,*
Synthetic Microdata,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,*

Secure many-to-one communications in wireless sensor networks,Alexandre Viejo Galicia; Josep Domingo i Ferrer; Francesc Sebé Feixas; Jordi Castellà Roca,Abstract Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are formed by nodes with limited computationaland power resources. WSNs are finding an increasing number of applications; both civilianand military; most of which require security for the sensed data being collected by the basestation from remote sensor nodes. In addition; when many sensor nodes transmit to the basestation; the implosion problem arises. Providing security measures and implosion-resistancein a resource-limited environment is a real challenge. This article reviews the aggregationstrategies proposed in the literature to handle the bandwidth and security problems relatedto many-to-one transmission in WSNs. Recent contributions to secure lossless many-to-onecommunication developed by the authors in the context of several Spanish-funded projectsare surveyed. Ongoing work on the secure lossy many-to-one communication is also …,Sensors; 2009; vol. 9; núm. 7; p. 5324-5338,2009,*

PRAM,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,P/FDM [5–7] integrated a functional data model with the logic programming language Prologfor general-purpose computation. The data model can be seen as an Entity-Relationshipdiagram with sub-types; much like a UML Class Diagram. The idea was for the user to beable to define a computation over objects in the diagram; instead of just using it as a schemadesign aid. Later versions of P/FDM included a graphic interface [2; 4] to build queries inDAPLEX syntax by clicking on the diagram and filling in values from menus.,*,2009,*
Noise Addition,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,The simplest way to incorporate unknown values into the relational model; is to allowvariables; in addition to constants; as entries in the columns of relations. Such constructs arecalled tables; instead of relations. A table is an incomplete database; and represents a set ofcomplete databases; each obtained by substituting all variables with constants. Differentoccurrences of the same variable (marked null) are substituted with the same constant. Thesubstitution is thus a function from the variables and constants; to the constants; such thatthe function is identity on the constants. A table T then represents the set of relations;denoted rep (T); defined as {v (T): v is a valuation}. Then the certain answer to a query q on atable T; denoted sure (q; T) is the set of tuples that occur in every answer obtained byapplying the query to every database in rep (T). In other words; the certain answer to q on …,*,2009,*

Record Matching,Arvind Arasu; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Many organizations; eg; government statistical offices and search engine companies; collectpotentially sensitive information regarding individuals either to publish this data for research;or in return for useful services. While some data collection organizations; like the census; arelegally required not to breach the privacy of the individuals; other data collectionorganizations may not be trusted to uphold privacy.

k-Anonymity,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,If; for a given k; k-anonymity is assumed to be sufficient protection; one can concentrate onminimizing information loss with the only constraint that k-anonymity should be satisfied.This is a clean way of solving the tension between data protection and data utility. Since k-anonymity is usually achieved via generalization (equivalent to global recoding; as saidabove) and local suppression; minimizing information loss usually translates to reducing thenumber and/or the magnitude of suppressions. k-Anonymity bears some resemblance to theunderlying principle of microaggregation and is a useful concept because quasi-identifiersare usually categorical or can be categorized; ie; they take values in a finite (and ideallyreduced) range. However; re-identification is not necessarily based on categorical keyattributes: sometimes; numerical outcome attributes (which are continuous and often …,*,2009,*

ESSNET-SDC Deliverable Blocking Methods for Microdata Protection,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Blocking is a well-known technique used to partition a set of records into severalsubsets of manageable size. The standard approach to blocking is to split the recordsaccording to the values of one or several attributes (called blocking attributes). This reportpresents a new blocking method based on 2d-trees for intelligently partitioning very largedata sets. Blocking makes sense whenever the treatment to be used on the data set is ofcomplexity higher than linear. We take here microaggregation (which has quadraticcomplexity) as a treatment; but other superlinear treatments can benefit from the blockingmethod described (like record linkage; also of quadratic complexity).,*,2008,*

Large-scale pay-as-you-watch for unicast and multicast communications,Antoni Martínez-Ballesté; Francesc Sebé; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of pay-as-you-watch services over unicast andmulticast communications. For each communication model; we present two solutions; non-verifiable and verifiable; depending on the existence or non-existence of trust between thesource and the receiver (s). In verifiable schemes; the source obtains a proof of correctreception by the receiver (s); in non-verifiable schemes; receiver non-repudiation is notguaranteed; so there must be a trust relationship between source and receiver (s). Whilesolutions for unicast pay-as-you-watch can be based on existing technologies; novelalgorithms based on aggregation and multisignatures are needed and presented here toovercome implosion in multicast pay-as-you-watch.,International Conference on Trust; Privacy and Security in Digital Business,2004,*
Object positioning based on partial preferences,Josep M Mateo-Sanz; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,Abstract In several situations; a set of objects must be positioned based on the preferencesof a set of individuals. Sometimes; each individual can/does only include a limited subset ofobjects in his preferences (partial preferences). We present an approach whereby a matrixof distances between objects can be derived based on the partial preferences expressed byindividuals on those objects. In this way; the similarities and differences between the variousobjects can subsequently be analyzed. A graphical representation of objects can also beobtained from the distance matrix using classical multivariate techniques such ashierarchical classification and multidimensional scaling.,International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence,2004,*

Untransferable Rights in a Client-Independent,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Travessera de les Corts,Abstract. A scheme for ensuring access rights untransferability in a client-server scenariowith a central authority and where servers hold no access information about clients ispresented in this paper; an extension to a multi-authority scenario is conceivable; sinceservers are also author-ity independent. Usurping a right with no information at all aboutother clients is for a client as hard as the discrete logarithm; and rights sharing betweenclients does not compromise their non-shared rights as long as RSA confidentiality holds.Transferring rights between clients without the authority's contribution cannot be doneunless RSA confidentiality is broken; however; only control on partial rights transfers isaddressed in this paper; which does not deal with total identity transfer or alienation.,Advances in Cryptology—EUROCRYPT’93: Workshop on the Theory and Application of Cryptographic Techniques Lofthus; Norway; May 23–27; 1993 Proceedings,2003,*

A Scheme for Anonymous Electronic Commerce Using Secure Intelligent Trade Agents,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Jordi Herrera Joancomart,Abstract In the last years; the exponential growth of computer networks has created anincredibly large o er of products and services in the net. Such a huge amount of informationmakes it impossible for a single person to analyze all the existing o ers of a product on thenet and decide which of them ts better her requirements. This problem is solved with theintelligent trade agents (ITA); which are programs that have the ability to roam a network;collect business-related data and use them to make decisions to buy goods on their owners'behalf. Known ITA systems do not provide anonymity in transactions and require an on-linetrusted third party. We present a new scheme for an intelligent trade agent system allowinganonymous electronic transactions with an o-line trusted third party.,*,1998,*

How to Avoid Reidentification with Proper Anonymization,David Sánchez; Sergio Martínez; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Materials and Methods. The dataset. To conduct our study; we first asked dM to share theraw financial data they used to evaluate their “unicity”-based reidentification risk; whichconsist of credit card transactions of 1.1 million users during 3 months; detailing the shop;time and price of each transaction. However; as they already warned in their article; theauthors confirmed they could not share their dataset for contractual and privacy reasons.This contradicts the journal's data availability policy and makes it impossible to reproducetheir claimed successful attack; let alone evaluate it against sound anonymizationmechanisms. Hence; we were forced to look for a transaction dataset with similar structureand “unicity”/reidentification risk properties.

On the Connections between Privacy Models Used in Statistical Disclosure Control,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Conclusions The k-anonymity; t-closeness and differential privacy models are connected.Using a prior kanonymization step based on insensitive microaggregation allows achievingdifferential privacy in data set releases with less utility loss. Also; exp (ε)-closeness implies ε-differential privacy for uninformed intruders in data releases. Finally; k-Anonymity for quasi-identifiers combined with ε-differential privacy for confidential attributes yields t-closeness inexpectation; with t= f (k; ε).,*,*,*
Multi-Application Smart Cards and Encrypted Data Processing,Josep Domingo i Ferrer,Abstract. Some existing approaches to multi-application smart card design rely on the cardcontaining data and importing the code of functions (methods) to be performed on data. Acomplementary solution is proposed in this paper to relax the requirement—or ratherbottleneck—that all confidential data and processing be supported by the card. Ourapproach is based on running some applications outside the card using encrypted dataprocessing; specifically privacy homomorphisms. Examples of privacy homomorphisms aregiven; one of which is very recent and allows full arithmetic on encrypted data whileremaining secure against known-cleartext attacks.,*,*,*

ON THE SECURITY OF CELL SUPPRESSION IN CONTINGENCY TABLES WITH QUANTITATIVE FACTORS,Josep Domingo i Ferrer; Josep M Mateo Sanz; Catalonia Tarragona,Abstract We show in this paper how to break the security of cell suppression methods whenthese are used to anonymize contingency tables with at least one quantitative factor. Theprocedure combines distribution fitting and linear programming and may obtain intervalestimates for the suppressed cells which are narrower than the disclosure interval chosen inthe suppression method.,*,*,*
Rational Behavior in Peer-to-Peer Profile Obfuscation for Anonymous Keyword Search,Josep Domingo-Ferrer andUrsula González-Nicolás,Abstract User profiling in web search has the advantage of enabling personalized websearch: the quality of the results offered by the search engine to the user is increased bytaking the user's interests into account when presenting those results. The negative side isthat the interests and the query history of users may contain information considered asprivate; hence; technology should be provided for users to avoid profiling if they wish so.There are several anti-profiling approaches in web search; from basic levelcountermeasures to private information retrieval and including profile obfuscation. Exceptprivate information retrieval (PIR); which hides the retrieved item from the database; the restof approaches focus on anonymizing the user's identity and fall into the category ofanonymous keyword search (also named sometimes user-private information retrieval) …,*,*,*
Decapitation of Networks With and Without Weights and Direction: The Economics of Iterated Attack and Defense,Josep Domingo-Ferrer andUrsula González-Nicolás,Abstract Vulnerability of networks against one-shot decapitation attacks has been addressedseveral times in the literature. A first study on how a network can best defend itself byreplenishing nodes and rewiring edges after decapitation was made by Nagaraja andAnderson. We extend the work of those authors on iterated attack and defense by: i)considering weighted and directed networks; ii) taking into account the economic aspects ofthe attack and defense strategies; namely the cost of node destruction/replenishment and asubtler cost such as the average path length increase. Extensive empirical work is reportedwhich; among other things; shows the importance of obfuscating the network topology.,*,*,*
Privacy in Statistical Databases,Josep Domingo-Ferrer Yücel Saygın,Privacy in statistical databases is a discipline whose purpose is to provide solutions to thetension between the increasing social; political and economical demand of accurateinformation; and the legal and ethical obligation to protect the privacy of the various partiesinvolved. Those parties are the respondents (the individuals and enterprises to which thedatabase records refer); the data owners (those organizations spending money in datacollection) and the users (the ones querying the database; who would like their queries tostay confidential). Beyond law and ethics; there are also practical reasons for data collectingagencies to invest in respondent privacy: if individual respondents feel their privacyguaranteed; they are likely to provide more accurate responses. Data owner privacy isprimarily motivated by practical considerations: if an enterprise collects data at its own …,*,*,*
A Bibliometric Index Based on the Collaboration Distance between Cited and Citing Authors,Maria Bras-Amorósa Josep Domingo-Ferrera; Vicenç Torrab,Abstract The popular h-index used to measure scientific output can be described in terms ofa pool of evaluated objects (the papers); a quality function on the evaluated objects (thenumber of citations received by each paper) and a sentencing line crossing the origin;whose intersection with the graph of the quality function yields the index value (in the h-index this is a line with slope 1). Based on this abstraction; we present a new index; the c-index; in which the evaluated objects are the citations received by an author; a group ofauthors; a journal; etc.; the quality function of a citation is the collaboration distance betweenthe authors of the cited and the citing papers; and the sentencing line can take slopesbetween 0 and∞. As a result; the new index counts only those citations which are significantenough; where significance is proportional to collaboration distance. Several advantages …,*,*,*

PRIVACY HOMOMORPHISMS FOR STATISTICAL CONFIDENTIALITW,JOSEP DOMINGO,When publishing contingency tables which contain oﬂicial statistics; a ne—ed to preservestatistical conﬁdentiality arises. Statistical disclosure of individual units must be prevented.There is a wide choice of techniques to achieve this anonymization: cell suppression; cellperturbation; etc. In this paper; we tackle the problem of using anonymized data to computeexact statistics; our approach is based on privacy homomorphisms; which are encryptiontransformations such that the decryption of a function of ciphers is a (possibly diﬂerent)function of the corresponding clear messa-ges. A new privacy homomorphism is presentedand combined with some anonymization techniques; in order for a classiﬁed level to retrieveexact statistics from statistics computed on disclosure-protected data at an unclassiﬁed level.,*,*,*
Connecting privacy models: synergies between k-anonymity; t-closeness and differential privacy,Jordi Soria-Comas; Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract. The usual approach to generate k-anonymous data sets; based on generalizationof the quasi-identifier attributes; does not provide any control on the variability of theconfidential attributes within the k-anonymous groups. If the latter variability is too small;privacy is not sufficiently protected; while; for large variabilities; data utility is substantiallydamaged. Some refinements to the basic k-anonymity privacy model; like ldiversity and t-closeness; seek to prevent the variability of the confidential attributes within a k-anonymousgroup from being too small. However; upper-bounding the variability of the confidentialattributes to improve utility has not yet been considered. We propose a method to attain k-anonymity; based on microaggregation of the confidential data; that seeks the lowestpossible variability for the confidential attributes; thereby maximizing utility. Our proposal …,*,*,*
TRENDS IN AGGREGATION AND SECURITY ASSESSMENT FOR INFERENCE CONTROL IN STATISTICAL DATABASES,JOSEP DOMINGO-FERRER,As e-commerce and Internet-based data handling become pervasive; companies andstatistical agencies have the need to exploit the data they accumulate without violatingcitizens' privacy. Inference control is a discipline whose goal is to preventpublished/exchanged data from being linked with the individual respondents they originatedfrom. This special issue illustrates that inference control largely draws on soft computing andartificial intelligence techniques.,*,*,*

Magnitude Tabular Data,Anco Hundepool; Josep Domingo‐Ferrer; Luisa Franconi; Sarah Giessing; Eric Schulte Nordholt; Keith Spicer; Peter‐Paul de Wolf,Summary This chapter introduces the main concepts and terminology of 'tabular data'andthe more complex case of hierarchical and linked tables. It discusses the main disclosurerisk concepts; protection methods and information loss concepts. After introducing thesebasic concepts; the chapter addresses more practical issues; like software and how to use itefficiently. It begins by presenting global recoding of categorical variables in the microdataas a non-perturbative pre-tabular method. There are two different purposes for informationloss measures in magnitude tabular data protection. The chapter presents an overview ofsoftware for the methods and algorithms for risk assessment and protection. It provides someguidance on how to model in a systematic way; a set of tables planned to be released; as astarting point for a disclosure control discussion. Finally; the chapter provides suggestions …,Statistical Disclosure Control,*,*
Ethics; Principles; Guidelines and Regulations–A General Background,Anco Hundepool; Josep Domingo‐Ferrer; Luisa Franconi; Sarah Giessing; Eric Schulte Nordholt; Keith Spicer; Peter‐Paul de Wolf,Summary The task of statistical offices is to produce and publish statistical information aboutsociety. The Statistical Disclosure Control theory is used to solve the problem of how topublish and release as much detail in data as possible without disclosing individualinformation. This chapter describes the ethical codes; UNECE principles and guidelines andlaws. An internationally recognised ethical code is the declaration on professional ethics bythe International Statistical Institute (ISI). The chapter gives some background by discussinga few European laws that are relevant for Statistical Disclosure Control.,Statistical Disclosure Control,*,*
Frequency Tables,Anco Hundepool; Josep Domingo‐Ferrer; Luisa Franconi; Sarah Giessing; Eric Schulte Nordholt; Keith Spicer; Peter‐Paul de Wolf,Summary This chapter discusses disclosure control for frequency tables; which are tables ofcounts where each cell value represents the number of respondents in that cell. It outlinesthe common types of disclosure risk and how the consideration of these risks leads to thedefinition of unsafe cells in frequency tables. The chapter describes a range of different SDCmethods and focuses on different information loss measures that are used to evaluate theimpact that different disclosure control methods have on the utility of frequency tables. Itprovides information on the software package t-argus and how it can be used to protectfrequency tables. Finally; the chapter presents some case studies from different countries onthe different approaches to protecting tables constructed from census data.,Statistical Disclosure Control,*,*

Fingerprinting Schemes for the Protection of Multimedia Distribution Rights,Marcel Fernández-Muñoz; Miquel Soriano-Ibañez; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Francesc Sebé-Feixas,It is a broadly accepted opinion that selling digital contents through computer networks isone of the most natural applications of electronic commerce; e-Commerce; because evendistribution can be done in real time over the network at the moment of purchase.Nonetheless; current turnover in e-Commerce is lower than had been anticipated a fewyears ago. One of the problems that is hampering market development is the difficulty ofadequately protecting the distribution rights of contents being sold. Fingerprinting is the mostusual solution; and consists of uniquely marking the object before its distribution. Onepossible attack against fingerprinting schemes is through collusion of several dishonestusers; who try to fabricate a copy that does not reveal their identities when redistributed.Several kinds of codes exist that provide redistributor tracing in case of collusion attacks …,EUropean Certification of Informatics Professionals,*,*

Disclosure Limitation Methods 111 Use Results of a Survey,Latanya Sweeney; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Viceng Terra; George T Duncan; Stephen E Fienberg; Ramayya Krishnan; Rema Padman; Stephen F Roehrig,As described in Chapter 5; there is a plethora of statistical disclosure control (SDC) methodsto protect microdata. This chapter provides guidance in choosing a particular SDC methodby comparing some of the methods discussed in Chapter 5 on the basis of both informationloss and disclosure risk. Information loss can be readily quantiﬁed using analyticalmeasures (either generic or data-use-speciﬁc). It is far more diflicult to assess disclosure riskin a way that is both analytical and ap~ plicable to all methods. For this reason; ourapproach to disclosure risk evaluation is empirical; based on reidentiﬁcation experimentscarried out using record-linkage algorithms.,*,*,*
Un homomor smo de privacidad entre cuerpos basado en fracciones de Farey,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract Privacy homomorphisms (PHs) are encryption transformations that allow directcomputation on encrypted data. Known secure PHs allow addition and multiplication to becarried out on encrypted data; but not do not allow computation of inverses. We present inthis paper a PH based on Farey fractions which allows addition; multiplication andmultiplicative inverse computation to be performed on encrypted data. An additive PH can atmost be secure against a known-cleartext attack; unfortunately; in its current state the newproposal is only secure against ciphertext-only attacks. Using two or more rounds of theproposed PH looks a promising way to resist known-cleartext attacks.,*,*,*
Dike: A Prototype for Secure Delegation of Statistical Data,Javier Castilla; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Ricardo X Sánchez del Castillo,Abstract The need for delegating statistical data arises when the data owner (eg statisticaloffice) wants to have its data handled by an external party. If the external party is untrustedand data are confidential; delegation should be performed in a way that preserves security.A cryptographic solution to the secure delegation problem is outlined which provides datasecrecy and computation verifiability. Also; the design principles of Dike—an implementationallowing secure delegation of information over the Internet—are discussed in some detail.,*,*,*

Using Mahalanobis Distance-Based Record Linkage for Disclosure Risk,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; John M Abowd; Vicenc Torra; Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenc Torra; JM Mateo-Sanz,The gold standard file (GSF) integrates data elements from seven SIPP panels (1990; 1991;1992; 1993; 1996; 2001; and 2004) with SSA-provided administrative data from theSummary Earnings Records (SER); the Detailed Earnings Records (DER); the MasterBeneficiary Record (MBR); the Supplemental Security Record (SSR); the 831 Disability File(F831); and the Payment History Update System (PHUS). We then use regression-basedmultiple imputation to fill in the missing data of the GSF to create four completed data setsthat are identical in structure and all non-missing values to the GSF but contain independentdraws from a probability distribution replacing the missing values. We refer to these fourdatasets as the completed data. We then use the same modeling techniques to create 16synthetic datasets (4 synthetic implicates are created from each of the 4 completed …,Privacy in Statistical Databases,*,*

inch blank space for Publisher) TRENDS IN AGGREGATION AND SECURITY ASSESSMENT FOR INFERENCE CONTROL IN STATISTICAL DATABASES,VICENÇ TORRA; JOSEP DOMINGO-FERRER,As e-commerce and Internet-based data handling become pervasive; companies andstatistical agencies have the need to exploit the data they accumulate without violatingcitizens' privacy. Inference control is a discipline whose goal is to preventpublished/exchanged data from being linked with the individual respondents they originatedfrom. This special issue illustrates that inference control largely draws on soft computing andartificial intelligence techniques.,*,*,*
Microaggregation-Based Numerical Hybrid Data,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,Abstract. In statistical disclosure control of microdata; the usual approach is to either mask(ie perturb) the original data or generate synthetic (ie simulated) data preserving some pre-selected statistics of the original data. Masked data may approximately preserve a broadrange of distributional characteristics; although very few of them (if any) are exactlypreserved; on the other hand; synthetic data exactly preserve the pre-selected statistics andmay seem less disclosive than masked data; but they do not preserve at all any statisticsother than those pre-selected. Hybrid data mixing the original data and synthetic data havebeen proposed in the literature to combine the strengths of masked and synthetic data. Weshow how to easily obtain numerical hybrid data exactly preserving means and covariancesby combining microaggregation with the IPSO synthetic generator. Furthermore; our …,*,*,*

Statistical Disclosure Control for Microdata vs Artificial Intelligence1,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra,This work highlights and characterizes some relationships between the way StatisticalDisclosure Control (SDC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) deal with individual data. We showthat; although the goals in both areas are completely different; similar techniques arealready being applied. The objective of this paper is to stimulate interaction and increasesynergy between researchers in both fields. The production of official statistics by NationalStatistical Offices (NSOs) can be regarded as a process with three main steps: datacollection; data processing and data dissemination. The data dissemination step shouldpreserve the informational content of collected and processed data as much as possiblewhilst guaranteeing that particular individuals cannot be re-identified. The usual approach toprotecting the released data is to distort them in some way before publication. The …,*,*,*

Re-Identification and Synthetic Data Generators: A Case Study,Josep Domingo-Ferrer; Vicenç Torra; Josep M Mateo-Sanz; Francesc Sebé,Abstract Synthetic generators are increasingly used to replace sensitive data with artificialdata preserving to a predetermined extent the utility of the original data. When usingsynthetic data generators; re-identification analysis is usually disregarded on the groundsthat; the released data being artificial; no real re-identification is possible. While this may bereasonable if synthetic generation is performed on the confidential outcome attributes; it isan unrealistic assumption if synthetic data generation is performed on the quasi-identifierattributes. In the latter case; reidentification can indeed happen if a snooper is able to link anexternal identified data source with some record in the released dataset using the quasi-identifier attributes: coming up with a correct pair (identifier; confidential attributes) is indeeda re-identification. This paper is a case study of re-identification risk for three synthetic …,*,*,*
