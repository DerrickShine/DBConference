uFLIP: Understanding flash IO patterns,Luc Bouganim; Björn Jónsson; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract: Does the advent of flash devices constitute a radical change for secondarystorage? How should database systems adapt to this new form of secondary storage?Before we can answer these questions; we need to fully understand the performancecharacteristics of flash devices. More specifically; we want to establish what kind of IOsshould be favored (or avoided) when designing algorithms and architectures for flash-basedsystems. In this paper; we focus on flash IO patterns; that capture relevant distribution of IOsin time and space; and our goal is to quantify their performance. We define uFLIP; abenchmark for measuring the response time of flash IO patterns. We also present abenchmarking methodology which takes into account the particular characteristics of flashdevices. Finally; we present the results obtained by measuring eleven flash devices; and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1780,2009,210
Chip-secured data access: Confidential data on untrusted servers,Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral,The rapid growth of ubiquitous computing impels mobile users to store personal data on theWeb to increase its availability. In the same way; corporate databases are made increasinglyaccessible to authorized employees over the Internet. Small businesses are prompted todelegate part of their information system to Web-hosting companies or database serviceproviders (DSP) that guarantee data resiliency; consistency; and high availability.Confidential data threatened by attackers is manifold: information related to the private life ofindividuals (for example; agenda; address book; bookmarks; medical records; householdexpenses); credit card numbers; patents; business strategies; diplomatic; or military secrets.Even ordinary data may become sensitive once grouped and well organized in databases.Customers have no other choice than trusting DSP's argument that their systems are fully …,*,2002,184
PicoDBMS: Scaling down database techniques for the smartcard,Christophe Bobineau; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract Smartcards are the most secure portable computing device today. They have beenused successfully in applications involving money; proprietary and personal data (such asbanking; healthcare; insurance; etc.). As smartcards get more powerful (with 32 bit CPU andmore than 1 MB of stable memory in the next versions) and become multi-application; theneed for database management arises. However; smartcards have severe hardwarelimitations (very slow write; very little RAM; constrained stable memory; no autonomy; etc.)which make traditional database technology irrelevant. The major problem is scaling downdatabase techniques so they perform well under these limitations. In this paper; we give anin-depth analysis of this problem and propose a PicoDBMS solution based on highlycompact data structures and query execution without RAM.

Client-based access control management for XML documents,Luc Bouganim; François Dang Ngoc; Philippe Pucheral,Abstract The erosion of trust put in traditional database servers and in Database ServiceProviders; the growing interest for different forms of data dissemination and the concern forprotecting children from suspicious Internet content are different factors that lead to move theaccess control from servers to clients. Several encryption schemes can be used to serve thispurpose but all suffer from a static way of sharing data. With the emergence of hardware andsoftware security elements on client devices; more dynamic client-based access controlschemes can be devised. This paper proposes an efficient client-based evaluator of accesscontrol rules for regulating access to XML documents. This evaluator takes benefit from adedicated index to quickly converge towards the authorized parts of a-potentially streaming-document. Additional security mecanisms guarantee that prohibited data can never be …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,130
Dynamic load balancing in hierarchical parallel database systems,Luc Bouganim; Daniela Florescu; Patrick Valduriez,We consider the execution of multi-join queries in a hierarchical parallel system; ie; a shared-nothing system whose nodes are shared-memory multiprocessors. In this context; loadbalancing must be addressed at two levels; locally among the processors of each shared-memory node and globally among all nodes. In this paper; we propose a dynamic executionmodel that maximizes local load balancing within shared-memory nodes and minimizes theneed for load sharing across nodes. This is obtained by allowing each processor to executeany operator that can be processed locally; thereby taking full advantage of inter-and intra-operator parallelism. We conducted a performance evaluation using an implementation on a72-processo-r KSR1 computer. The experiments with many queries and large relationsshow very good speedup results; even with highly skewed data. We show that; in shared …,*,1996,111

Dynamic query scheduling in data integration systems,Luc Bouganim; Françoise Fabret; Chandrasekaran Mohan; Patrick Valduriez,Execution plans produced by traditional query optimizers for data integration queries mayyield poor performance for several reasons. The cost estimates may be inaccurate; thememory available at run-time may be insufficient; or data delivery rate can be unpredictable.We address the problem of unpredictable data arrival rate. We propose to dynamicallyschedule queries in order to deal with irregular data delivery rate and gracefully adapt to theavailable memory. Our approach performs careful step-by-step scheduling of several queryfragments and processes these fragments based on data arrivals. We describe aperformance evaluation that shows important performance gains in several configurations.,Data Engineering; 2000. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2000,80
Secure personal data servers: a vision paper,Tristan Allard; Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Yanli Guo; Lionel Le Folgoc; Benjamin Nguyen; Philippe Pucheral; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Shaoyi Yin,Abstract An increasing amount of personal data is automatically gathered and stored onservers by administrations; hospitals; insurance companies; etc. Citizen themselves oftencount on internet companies to store their data and make them reliable and highly availablethrough the internet. However; these benefits must be weighed against privacy risks incurredby centralization. This paper suggests a radically different way of considering themanagement of personal data. It builds upon the emergence of new portable and securedevices combining the security of smart cards and the storage capacity of NAND Flashchips. By embedding a full-fledged Personal Data Server in such devices; user control ofhow her sensitive data is shared by others (by whom; for how long; according to which rule;for which purpose) can be fully reestablished and convincingly enforced.

A dynamic query processing architecture for data integration systems,Luc Bouganim; Françoise Fabret; C Mohan; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract Execution plans produced by traditional query optimizers for data integrationqueries may yield poor performance for several reasons. The cost estimates may beinaccurate; the memory available at run-time may be insufficient; or the data delivery ratecan be unpredictable. All these problems have led database researchers and implementorsto resort to dynamic strategies to correct or adapt the static QEP. In this paper; we identify thedifferent basic techniques that must be integrated in a dynamic query engine. Following onour recent work [6] on the problem of unpredictable data arrival rates; we propose a dynamicquery processing architecture which includes three dynamic layers: the dynamic queryoptimizer; the scheduler and the query evaluator. Having a three-layer dynamic architectureallows reducing significantly the overheads of the dynamic strategies.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2000,50

GhostDB: querying visible and hidden data without leaks,Nicolas Anciaux; Mehdi Benzine; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral; Dennis Shasha,Abstract Imagine that you have been entrusted with private data; such as corporate productinformation; sensitive government information; or symptom and treatment information abouthospital patients. You may want to issue queries whose result will combine private andpublic data; but private data must not be revealed. GhostDB is an architecture and system toachieve this. You carry private data in a smart USB key (a large Flash persistent storecombined with a tamper and snoop-resistant CPU and small RAM). When the key is pluggedin; you can issue queries that link private and public data and be sure that the onlyinformation revealed to a potential spy is which queries you pose. Queries linking public andprivate data entail novel distributed processing techniques on extremely unequal devices(standard computer and smart USB key).

Memory-adaptive scheduling for large query execution,Luc Bouganim; Olga Kapitskaia; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract The execution time of a large query depends mainly on the memory utilizationwhich should avoid disk accesses for intermediate results. Poor memory management canhurt performance and even lead to system thrashing because of paging. However; memorymanagement optimization is hard to incorporate in a query optimizer because of costestimate errors. In this paper; we address the problem of efficient memory management forlarge query execution. We propose a static memory allocation scheme applied at start-uptime; and a more efficient dynamic execution model which performs memory-adaptivescheduling of the query. Our execution model handles graciously memory overflow and isrobust to cost estimate errors. We describe a performance evaluation using a prototypeimplementation.

Your personal data has become a prime asset for many companies aroundthe Internet; but can you avoid--or even detect--abusive usage? Today; there is a wideconsensus that individuals should have increased control on how their personal data iscollected; managed and shared.

Database encryption,Luc Bouganim; Yanli Guo,Background The Data Encryption Standard (DES)[] has been around for more thanyears. During this time; the standard was revised three times: as FIPS-- in; asFIPS-- in; and as FIPS-- in.

PicoDBMS: validation and experience,Nicolas Anciaux; Christophe Bobineau; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral; Patrick Valduriez,The PicoDBMS exploits a combination of &; dfe gfhhijl k pr qsdpk t and u vwhxz y. By storingthe attribute values embedded in the tuples; FS is adequate when the attribute does notpresent value redundancy. DS precludes any duplicate value to occur by grouping values indomains and by using references in place of the attribute values. RS addresses indexcompactness. RS links together all tuples sharing the same attribute value through a circularchain of pointer headed by this value. This chain of pointer is stored again in place of theattribute values; providing a similar and compact implementation of both select and joinindices. Traditional query processing uses main memory or disk for storing intermediateresults. The RAM and write rules preclude the use of these algorithms in our context.

Data degradation: Making private data less sensitive over time,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Harold Van Heerde; Philippe Pucheral; Peter MG Apers,Abstract Trail disclosure is the leakage of privacy sensitive data; resulting from negligence;attack or abusive scrutinization or usage of personal digital trails. To prevent trail disclosure;data degradation is proposed as an alternative to the limited retention principle. Datadegradation is based on the assumption that long lasting purposes can often be satisfiedwith a less accurate; and therefore less sensi-tive; version of the data. Data will beprogressively degraded such that it still serves application purposes; while decreasingaccuracy and thus privacy sensitivity.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,29
Memory requirements for query execution in highly constrained devices,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral,Abstract Pervasive computing introduces data management requirements that must betackled in a growing variety of lightweight computing devices. Personal folders on chip;networks of sensors and data hosted by autonomous mobile computers are differentillustrations of the need for evaluating queries confined in hardware constrained computingdevices. RAM is the most limiting factor in this context. This paper gives a thorough analysisof the RAM consumption problem and makes the following contributions. First; it proposes aquery execution model that reaches a lower bound in terms of RAM consumption. Second; itdevises a new form of optimization; called iteration filter; that drastically reduces theprohibitive cost incurred by the preceding model; without hurting the RAM lower bound.Third; it analyses how the preceding techniques can benefit from an incremental growth …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,29
Processing queries with expensive functions and large objects in distributed mediator systems,Luc Bouganim; Françoise Fabret; Fabio Porto; Patrick Valduriez,LeSelect is a mediator system which allows scientists to publish their resources (data andprograms) so they can be transparently accessed. The scientists can typically issue querieswhich access distributed published data and involve the execution of expensive functions(corresponding to programs). Furthermore; the queries can involve large objects; such asimages (eg archived meteorological satellite data). In this context; the costs of transmittinglarge objects and invoking expensive functions are the dominant factors of execution time. Inthis paper; we first propose three query execution techniques which minimize these costs bytaking full advantage of the distributed architecture of mediator systems like LeSelect. Thenwe devise parallel processing strategies for queries including expensive functions. Basedon experimentation; we show that it is hard to predict the optimal execution order when …,Data Engineering; 2001. Proceedings. 17th International Conference on,2001,28
MILo-DB: a personal; secure and portable database machine,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral; Yanli Guo; Lionel Le Folgoc; Shaoyi Yin,Abstract Mass-storage secure portable tokens are emerging and provide a realbreakthrough in the management of sensitive data. They can embed personal data and/ormetadata referencing documents stored encrypted in the Cloud and can manage themunder holder's control. Mass on-board storage requires efficient embedded databasetechniques. These techniques are however very challenging to design due to a combinationof conflicting NAND Flash constraints and scarce RAM constraint; disqualifying known stateof the art solutions. To tackle this challenge; we proposes a log-only based storageorganization and an appropriate indexing scheme; which (1) produce only sequential writescompatible with the Flash constraints and (2) consume a tiny amount of RAM; independentof the database size. We show the effectiveness of this approach through a …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2014,22

Efficient querying of distributed resources in mediator systems,Ioana Manolescu; Luc Bouganim; Françoise Fabret; Eric Simon,Abstract This work investigates the integration of heterogeneous resources; such as dataand programs; in a fully distributed peer-to-peer mediation architecture. The challenge inmaking such a system succeed at a large scale is twofold. First; we need a simple conceptfor modeling resources. Second; we need efficient operators for distributed query execution;capable of handling well costly computations and large data transfers. To modelheterogeneous resources; we use the model of table with binding patterns. To exploit aresource with restricted binding patterns; we propose an efficient BindJoin operator;optimized for minimizing large data transfers and costly computations. Furthermore; theproposed BindJoin operator delivers most of its output in the early stages of the execution;which is an important asset in a system meant for human interaction.

Flash device support for database management,Philippe Bonnet; Luc Bouganim,ABSTRACT While disks have offered a stable behavior for decadesthus guaranteeing thetimelessness of many database design decisions; flash devices keep on mutating. Theirbehavior varies across models and across firmware updates for the same model. Manyresearchers have proposed to adapt database algorithms for existing flash devices; othershave tried to capture the performance characteristics of flash devices. However; today; weneither have a reference DBMS design nor a performance model for flash devices: databaseresearchers are running after flash memory technology. In this paper; we take the reverseapproach and we define how flash devices should support database management. Weadvocate that flash devices should provide DBMS with more control over IO behavior withoutsacrificing correctness or robustness.

Inthis demonstration; we share the lessons we learnt developing the uFlip benchmark andconducting experiments with a wide range of flash devices. We illustrate the problems thatare actual obstacles to sound performance and energy measurements; and we show how tomitigate the effects of these problems. We also present the uFlip web site and its on-linevisualization tool that should help the research community investigate flash device behavior.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,19
-Chip-Secured Data Access: Reconciling Access Rights with Data Encryption,Luc Bouganim; François Dang Nogc; Philippe Pucheral; Lilan Wu,The democratization of ubiquitous computing; the increasing connection of corporatedatabases to the Internet and the today's natural resort to Web hosting companies andDatabase Service Providers strongly emphasize the need for data confidentiality. Thechapter proposes a solution called chip-secured data access (C-SDA); which allowsquerying encrypted data while controlling personal privileges. C-SDA is a client-basedsecurity component acting as an incorruptible mediator between a client and an encrypteddatabase. This component is embedded into a smartcard to prevent any tampering to occuron the client side. This cooperation of hardware and software security componentsconstitutes a strong guarantee against attacks and allows re-establishing the orthogonalitybetween access right management and data encryption.

Load balancing for parallel query execution on NUMA multiprocessors,Luc Bouganim; Daniela Florescu; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract To scale up to high-end configurations; shared-memory multiprocessors areevolving towards Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures. In this paper; weaddress the central problem of load balancing during parallel query execution in NUMAmultiprocessors. We first show that an execution model for NUMA should not use datapartitioning (as shared-nothing systems do) but should strive to exploit efficient shared-memory strategies like Synchronous Pipelining (SP). However; SP has problems in NUMA;especially with skewed data. Thus; we propose a new execution strategy which solves theseproblems. The basic idea is to allow partial materialization of intermediate results and tomake them progressivly public; ie; able to be processed by any processor; as needed toavoid processor idle times. Hence; we call this strategy Progressive Sharing (PS). We …,*,1999,19
EagleTree: exploring the design space of SSD-based algorithms,Niv Dayan; Martin Kjær Svendsen; Matias Bjørling; Philippe Bonnet; Luc Bouganim,Abstract Solid State Drives (SSDs) are a moving target for system designers: they are blackboxes; their internals are undocumented; and their performance characteristics vary acrossmodels. There is no appropriate analytical model and experimenting with commercial SSDsis cumbersome; as it requires a careful experimental methodology to ensure repeatability.Worse; performance results obtained on a given SSD cannot be generalized. Overall; it isimpossible to explore how a given algorithm; say a hash join or LSM-tree insertions;leverages the intrinsic parallelism of a modern SSD; or how a slight change in the internalsof an SSD would impact its overall performance.

Unfortunately; even the most well defended servers are subject to attacks andhowever much one trusts a hosting organism/company; such trust does not last forever.

Dynamic access-control policies on XML encrypted data,Luc Bouganim; François Dang Ngoc; Philippe Pucheral,Abstract The erosion of trust put in traditional database servers and in Database ServiceProviders and the growing interest for different forms of selective data dissemination aredifferent factors that lead to move the access-control from servers to clients. Different dataencryption and key dissemination schemes have been proposed to serve this purpose. Bycompiling the access-control rules into the encryption process; all these methods suffer froma static way of sharing data. With the emergence of hardware security elements on clientdevices; more dynamic client-based access-control schemes can be devised.

Adaptive parallel query execution in DBS3,Luc Bouganim; Benoît Dageville; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract The barriers to parallel query execution are start-up time of parallel operations;interference and poor load balancing among the processors due to skewed data distribution.In this paper; we have described how these problems are addressed in DBS3; a shared-memory database system implemented on a 72-node KSR1 multiprocessor. Our solutioncombines the advantages of static and dynamic partitioning. We use static partitioning ofrelations to reduce interference and dynamic allocation of processors to operations toreduce start-up time and improve load balancing. A major advantage of this solution is to beable to deal efficiently with skew by allowing each thread to dynamically choose whichoperation's instance it will execute.

The Necessary Death of the Block Device Interface.,Matias Bjørling; Philippe Bonnet; Luc Bouganim; Niv Dayan,ABSTRACT Solid State Drives (SSDs) are replacing magnetic disks as secondary storagefor database management; as they offer orders of magnitude improvement in terms ofbandwidth and latency. In terms of system design; the advent of SSDs raises considerablechallenges. First; the storage chips; which are the basic component of a SSD; have widelydifferent characteristics–eg; copy-onwrite; erase-before-write and page-addressability forflash chips vs. in-place update and byte-addressability for PCM chips. Second; SSDs are nolonger a bottleneck in terms of I/O latency forcing streamlined execution throughout the I/Ostack. Finally; SSDs provide a high degree of parallelism that must be leveraged to reachnominal bandwidth. This evolution puts database system researchers at a crossroad.

Pluggable personal data servers,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Yanli Guo; Philippe Pucheral; Jean-Jacques Vandewalle; Shaoyi Yin,Abstract An increasing amount of personal data is automatically gathered on servers byadministrations; hospitals and private companies while several security surveys highlight thefailure of database servers to keep confidential data really private. The advent of powerfulsecure tokens; combining the security of smart card microcontrollers with the storagecapacity of NAND Flash chips; introduces a credible alternative to the systematiccentralization of personal data. By embedding a full-fledged database server in such device;an individual can now store her personal data in her own secure token; kept under hercontrol; and never disclose in clear her private data to the outside untrusted world.

Restoring the patient control over her medical history,Nicolas Anciaux; Mehdi Benzine; Luc Bouganim; Kévin Jacquemin; Philippe Pucheral; Shaoyi Yin,Paper-based folders have been widely used to coordinate cares in medical-social networks;but they introduce some burning issues (eg privacy protection; remote access to the folder).Replacing the paper-based folder system by a traditional Electronic Healthcare Record(EHR) introduces new drawbacks: forcing of the patient consent; unbounded data retention;no security guarantee outside the server domain and no disconnected access to the folder.To solve these problems; this paper proposes an experimental platform which combines anEHR system with medical-social folders embedded in a new hardware portable device. Theobjectives pursued are (1) to re-establish a natural and powerful way of protecting andsharing highly sensitive information among trusted parties and (2) to build a shared medical-social folder providing the highest degree of availability; whatever the mode of operation …,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2008.

Future trends in secure chip data managemen,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral,Secure chips; eg present in smart cards; TPM; USB dongles are now ubiquitous inapplications with strong security requirements. Secure chips host personal data that must becarefully managed and protected; thus requiring embedded data management techniques.However; secure chips have severe hardware constraints which make traditional databasetechniques irrelevant. We previously addressed the problem of scaling down databasetechniques for the smart card and proposed the design of a DBMS kernel called PicoDBMS.This paper summarizes the learning obtained during an extensive performance analysis ofPicoDBMS. Then it studies to which extent secure chips hardware evolution should impactthe design of embedded data management techniques.

uflip: Understanding the energy consumption of flash devices,Matias Bjorling; Philippe Bonnet; Luc Bouganim; Björn Pór Jónsson,Understanding the energy consumption of flash devices is important for two reasons. First;energy is emerging as a key metric for data management systems. It is thus important tounderstand how we can reason about the energy consumption of flash devices beyond theirapproximate aggregate consumption (low power consumption in idle mode; average Wattconsumption from the data sheets). Second; when measured at a sufficiently fine granularity;the energy consumption of a given device might complement the performancecharacteristics derived from its response time profile. Indeed; background work which is notdirectly observable with a response time profile appears clearly when energy is used as ametric. In this paper; we discuss the results from the uFLIP benchmark applied to fourdifferent SSD devices using both response time and energy as metric.,IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin,2010,13

Data confidentiality: to which extent cryptography and secured hardware can help,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral,Abstract Data confidentiality has become a major concern for individuals as well as forcompanies and administrations. In a classical client-server setting; the access controlmanagement is performed on the server; relying on the assumption that the server is atrusted party.

System co-design and data management for flash devices,Philippe Bonnet; Luc Bouganim; Ioannis Koltsidas; Stratis D Viglas,ABSTRACT Flash devices are emerging as a replacement for disks. How does this evolutionimpact the design of data management systems? While flash devices have been availablefor years; this question is still open. In this tutorial; we share two views on the development ofdata management systems for flash devices. The first view considers that flash devicesintroduce so much complexity that it is necessary to reconsider the strictly layered approachbetween storage system; operating system and data management system. The second viewconsiders that data management systems should recognize the complexity of flash devicesand leverage the characteristics of different classes of devices for different usage patterns.Throughout the tutorial; we will cover the data management stack: from the fundamentals offlash technology; through storage for database systems and the manipulation of flash …,Proc.

Safe data sharing and data dissemination on smart devices,Luc Bouganim; Cosmin Cremarenco; François Dang Ngoc; Nicolas Dieu; Philippe Pucheral,Abstract The erosion of trust put in traditional database servers and in Database ServiceProviders (DSP); the growing interest for different forms of data dissemination and theconcern for protecting children from suspicious Internet content are different factors that leadto move the access control from servers to clients. Due to the intrinsic untrustworthiness ofclient devices; client-based access control solutions rely on data encryption. The data arekept encrypted at the server and a client is granted access to subparts of them according tothe decryption keys in its possession. Several variations of this basic model have beenproposed (eg;[1; 6]) but they have in common to minimize the trust required on the client atthe cost of a static way of sharing data. Indeed; whatever the granularity of sharing; thedataset is split in subsets reflecting a current sharing situation; each encrypted with a …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,11

Revelation on demand,Nicolas Anciaux; Mehdi Benzine; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral; Dennis Shasha,Abstract Private data sometimes must be made public. A corporation may keep its customersales data secret; but reveals totals by sector for marketing reasons. A hospital keepsindividual patient data secret; but might reveal outcome information about the treatment ofparticular illnesses over time to support epidemiological studies. In these and many othersituations; aggregate data or partial data is revealed; but other data remains private.Moreover; the aggregate data may depend not only on private data but on public data aswell; eg commodity prices; general health statistics. Our GhostDB platform allows queriesthat combine private and public data; produce aggregates to data warehouses for OLAPpurposes; and reveal exactly what is desired; neither more nor less. We call this functionality“revelation on demand”.,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2009,7
On finding a memory lower bound for query evaluation in lightweight devices,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral,Abstract Pervasive computing introduces data management requirements that must betackled in a growing variety of lightweight computing devices. Personal folders on chip (eg;healthcare folders on smartcards); networks of sensors (eg; pollution sensors) and datahosted by autonomous mobile computers (eg; tourist information downloaded on a carcomputer) are different illustrations of the need for evaluating queries confined in hardwareconstrained computing devices.

Database Components on Chip,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral,As a first step in this research agenda; we are conducting a comprehensive analysis of theRAM consumption problem. We try to answer three important questions. First; does amemory lower bound exist whatever the volume of the queried data? Second; how can aquery be optimised without hurting this lower bound? Third; how does an incrementalgrowth of RAM impact the techniques devised in a lower bound context? This study provideshelpful guidelines to calibrate the RAM resource of a hardware platform according to a givenapplication's requirements; as well as to adapt an application to an existing hardwareplatform.

DiSC: Benchmarking Secure Chip DBMS,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral; Patrick Valduriez,Secure chips; eg present in smart cards; USB dongles; i-buttons; are now ubiquitous inapplications with strong security requirements. And they require embedded datamanagement techniques. However; secure chips have severe hardware constraints whichmake traditional database techniques irrelevant. The main problem faced by secure chipDBMS designers is to be able to assess various design choices and trade-offs for differentapplications. Our solution is to use a benchmark for secure chip DBMS in order to (1)compare different database techniques;(2) predict the limits of on-chip applications; and (3)provide co-design hints. In this paper; we propose DiSC (Data management in SecureChip); a benchmark which matches these three objectives.

Efficient data and program integration using binding patterns,Ioana Manolescu; Luc Bouganim; Françoise Fabret; Eric Simon,In this work; we investigate data and program integration in a fully distribut-ed peer-to-peermediation architecture. The challenge in making such a system succeed at a large scale istwofold. First; sharing a resource should be easy; therefore; we need a simple concept formodeling resources. Second; we need an efficient architecture for distributed queryexecution; capable of handling well costly computations and large data transfers. To modelheterogeneous resources; we propose using the unified abstraction of table with bindingpatterns; simple yet powerful enough to capture data and programs. To exploit a resourcewith restricted binding patterns; we propose an efficient BindJoin operator; following theclassical iterator model; in which we build optimization techniques for minimizing large datatransfers and costly computations; and maximizing parallelism.

Skew handling in the dbs3 parallel database system,Luc Bouganim; Daniela Florescu; Benoît Dageville,Abstract The gains of parallel query execution can be limited because of high start-up time;interference between execution entities; and poor load balancing. In this paper; we presenta solution which reduces these limitations in DBS3; a shared-memory parallel databasesystem. This solution combines static data partitioning and dynamic processor allocation toadapt to the execution context. It makes DBS3 almost insensitive to data skew and allowsdecoupling the degree of parallelism from the degree of data partitioning. To address theproblem of load balancing in the presence of data skew; we analyze three important factorsthat influence the behavior of our parallel execution model: skew factor; degree ofparallelism and degree of partitioning. We report on experiments varying these threeparameters with the DBS3 prototype on a 72-node KSR1 multiprocessor.

Fairness concerns in digital right management models,Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral,Digital piracy is threatening the global multimedia content industry and blindly appliedcoercive Digital Right Management (DRM) policies do nothing but legitimise this piracy. Thispaper presents new software and hardware infrastructure aimed at reconciling the contentproviders' and consumers' points of view by giving the ability to develop fair businessmodels (ie; that preserve the interest of both parties). The solution is based on the use oftamper-resistant devices (smart cards) to securely store sensitive data (eg; personalconsumer data or data expressing the terms of a B2C contract or licence) and to perform thecomputation required by a contract/licence activation. In other words; smart cards can beseen as tamper-resistant Service Level Agreement (SLA) enablers.,International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management,2006,3

DatShA: A Data Sharing Algebra for access control plans,Luc Bouganim; Athanasia Katsouraki; Benjamin Nguyen,Online social networks (OSN) are one of the most successful applications that have beencreated this last decade. Central to these applications is the problem of sharing data; suchas texts; photos; geolocation; etc. In most cases; this data is private; and thus is only sharedwith “friends”; a loose concept. Some OSN; such as Google+ let you define circles in order tocategorize your friends: friends; close friends; acquaintances; etc. Data can then be sharedon finer grain using these circles. However; there is no automatic way to control thesimultaneous sharing of data to several circles; with different data precision granularities;such as in the following scenario: Alice wants to share a set of photos with her family; photoswith no metadata with her close friends; photos without faces (and without metadata) in areduced definition with her acquaintances; and does not want to share anything with …,19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT 2016),2016,2

Dynamic scheduling of complex distributed queries,Luc Bouganim; Françoise Fabret; C Mohan; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract: Datahase queries over distributed data sources have become increasinglycomplex. Execution plans produced by traditional query optimizers for such queries mayyield poor performance for several reasons: the cost estimates may be inaccurate; thememory available at run-time may be insufficient; and remote data may not be rapidly orpredictably accessible. In this paper; vie address the memory limitation and dataaccessibility problems. We propose to dynamically schedule complex distributed queries inorder to gracefully adapt to the available memory and to deal with irregular data delivery.Our approach is both proactive by the careful step-by-step scheduling of several queryfragments and reactive by the processing of these fragments based oh data arrivals.

Dynamic Memory allocation for large Query execution,Luc Bouganim; Olga Kapitskaia; Patrick Valduriez,ABSTRACT. The execution time of a large query depends mainly on the memory utilizationwhich should avoid disk accesses for intermediate results. Poor memory management canhurt performance and even lead to system thrashing because of paging. However; memorymanagement optimization is hard to incorporate in a query optimizer because of costestimate errors. In this paper; we address the problem of efficient memory management forlarge query execution. We propose a static memory allocation scheme applied at start-uptime; and a more efficient dynamic execution model which performs memory-adaptivescheduling of the query. Our execution model handles graciously memory overflow bychoosing dynamically the best scheduling among several possible using a simple costmodel. The model is robust to cost estimate errors.

Modelling and managing ssd write-amplification,Niv Dayan; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Bonnet,Abstract: How stable is the performance of your flash-based Solid State Drives (SSDs)? Thisquestion is central for database designers and administrators; cloud service providers; andSSD constructors. The answer depends on write-amplification; ie; garbage collectionoverhead. More specifically; the answer depends on how write-amplification evolves in time.How then can one model and manage write-amplification; especially when applicationworkloads change? This is the focus of this paper. Managing write-amplification boils downto managing the surplus physical space; called over-provisioned space. Modern SSDsessentially separate the physical space into several partitions; based on the updatefrequency of the pages they contain; and divide the over-provisioned space among thegroups so as to minimize write-amplification.

In this paper; we propose a new ITarchitecture for diabetes follow-up and introduce the bases of a new distributed computationprotocol for this architecture. Our approach does not require any preexisting supportcommunication infrastructure; can be deployed at low cost; and provides strong privacy andsecurity guarantees. This work envisions an experiment in the field we plan to conduct underthe authority of the Cameroonian National Center for Diabetes and Hypertension; with apotential for generalization to other diseases.,International Conference on e-Infrastructure and e-Services for Developing Countries,2015,*

Secure Portable Tokens for Sensitive Questionnaires Surveys,Athanasia Katsouraki; Luc Bouganim; Benjamin Nguyen; Paul Tran-Van,Nowadays; surveys and questionnaires are frequently used by scientists and researcherssuch as social scientists; economists; computer scientists to gather data about differenthuman aspects; perceptions; behaviors and attitudes [1]. However; when people are askedonline questions considering their income; activities; and marital status; in the majority of thecases; such sensitive questions cause discomfort [2; 3; 4] leading to either untruthful or lackof respond. Moreover; in some cases the participants change the previously providedinformation in order to either prevent an unwanted and shameful exposure; or to avoid anyrepercussions. This behavior is triggered by the lack of awareness considering accesscontrol management and utilization of the provided information.

Annexe D.,Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Philippe Pucheral; Yanli Guo; Lionel Le Folgoc; Shaoyi Yin,Abstract Mass-storage secure portable tokens are emerging and provide a realbreakthrough in the management of sensitive data. They can embed personal data and/ormetadata referencing documents stored encrypted in the Cloud and can manage themunder holder's control. Mass on-board storage requires efficient embedded databasetechniques. These techniques are however very challenging to design due to a combinationof conflicting NAND Flash constraints and scarce RAM constraint; disqualifying known stateof the art solutions. To tackle this challenge; we proposes a log-only based storageorganization and an appropriate indexing scheme; which (1) produce only sequential writescompatible with the Flash constraints and (2) consume a tiny amount of RAM; independentof the database size.

Playing Attack and Defense with Trusted Storage,Javier González; Philippe Bonnet; Luc Luc Bouganim-Luc,Abstract It is often convenient to assume in a data management platform that one or severalcomputing devices are trusted; specially when the goal is to provide privacy guarantees overpersonal data. But what does it take for a computing device to be trusted? More specifically;how can a personal device provide trusted storage? This is the question we tackle in thisdemonstration. We describe how secure devices; equipped with a trusted executionenvironment; differ from general purpose devices. We illustrate with our demonstrationscenario; that it is much more difficult to attack a storage service running on a secure device;than to attack the same service running on a general purpose device.,Itus Skriftserie,2014,*

A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data.

Query load balancing in parallel database systems,Luc Bouganim,In general; the term Quadtree refers to a class of representations of geometric entities (suchas points; line segments; polygons; regions) in a space of two (or more) dimensions; thatrecursively decompose the space containing these entities into blocks until the data in eachblock satisfy some condition (with respect; for example; to the block size; the number of blockentities; the characteristics of the block entities; etc.). In a more restricted sense; the termQuadtree (Octree) refers to a tree data-structure in which each internal node has four (eight)children and is used for the representation of geometric entities in a two (three) dimensionalspace. The root of the tree represents the whole space/region. Each child of a noderepresents a subregion of the subregion of its parent. The subregions of the siblingsconstitute a partition of the parent's regions. Several variations of quadtrees are possible …,*,2009,*

URL to Code,LUC BOUGANIM,Definition The goal of parallel query execution is minimizing query response time using inter-and intra-operator parallelism. Inter-operator parallelism assigns different operators of aquery execution plan to distinct (sets of) processors while intra-operator parallelism usesseveral processors for the execution of a single operator thanks to data partitioning.Conceptually; parallelizing a query amounts to divide the query work in small pieces or tasksassigned to different processors. The response time of a set of parallel tasks being that of thelongest one; the main difficulty is to produce and execute these tasks such that the queryload is evenly balanced within the processors. This is made more complex by the existenceof dependencies between tasks (eg; pipeline parallelism) and synchronizations points.Query load balancing relates to static and/or dynamic techniques and algorithms to …,Theoretical Computer Science,1995,*
