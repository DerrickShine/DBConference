Balancing energy efficiency and quality of aggregate data in sensor networks,Mohamed A Sharaf; Jonathan Beaver; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract. In-network aggregation has been proposed as one method for reducing energyconsumption in sensor networks. In this paper; we explore two ideas related to furtherreducing energy consumption in the context of in-network aggregation. The first is byinfluencing the construction of the routing trees for sensor networks with the goal of reducingthe size of transmitted data. To this end; we propose a group-aware network configurationmethod that “clusters” along the same path sensor nodes that belong to the same group. Thesecond idea involves imposing a hierarchy of output filters on the sensor network with thegoal of both reducing the size of transmitted data and minimizing the number of transmittedmessages. More specifically; we propose a framework to use temporal coherency tolerancesin conjunction with in-network aggregation to save energy at the sensor nodes while …,The VLDB journal,2004,319
TiNA: a scheme for temporal coherency-aware in-network aggregation,Mohamed A Sharaf; Jonathan Beaver; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract This paper presents TiNA; a scheme for minimizing energy consumption in sensornetworks by exploiting end-user tolerance to temporal coherency. TiNA utilizes temporalcoherency tolerances to both reduce the amount of information transmitted by individualnodes (communication cost dominates power usage in sensor networks); and to improvequality of data when not all sensor readings can be propagated up the network within agiven time constraint. TiNA was evaluated against a traditional in-network aggregationscheme with respect to power savings as well as the quality of data for aggregate queries.Preliminary results show that TiNA can reduce power consumption by up to 50% without anyloss in the quality of data.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2003,312
Algorithms and metrics for processing multiple heterogeneous continuous queries,Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Kirk Pruhs,Abstract The emergence of monitoring applications has precipitated the need for DataStream Management Systems (DSMSs); which constantly monitor incoming data feeds(through registered continuous queries); in order to detect events of interest. In this article;we examine the problem of how to schedule multiple Continuous Queries (CQs) in a DSMSto optimize different Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. We show that; unlike traditional onlinesystems; scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will bedifferent from policies that optimize for average slowdown; which is a more appropriatemetric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. Towards this; we proposepolicies to optimize for the average-case performance for both metrics. Additionally; wepropose a hybrid scheduling policy that strikes a fine balance between performance and …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2008,66
Location-aware routing for data aggregation in sensor networks,Jonathan Beaver; M Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis; P Chrysanthis,ABSTRACT In-network aggregation has been proposed as one method for reducing energyconsumption in networked sensors. In this paper; we explore the idea of influencing theconstruction of the routing trees for sensor networks with the goal of reducing the size oftransmitted data for networks with in-network aggregation involving Group By queries.Toward this; we propose a group-aware network configuration method and present twoalgorithms; that “cluster” along the same path sensor nodes which belong to the samegroup.

Power-aware in-network query processing for sensor data,Jonathan Beaver; Mohamed A Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Minimizing energy consumption has been a major objective at all levels in sensornetworks. In this paper; we present TiNA; an in-network aggregation scheme that maintainsthe user-specified quality of data requirement while significantly reducing the overall energyconsumption. Specifically; since communication dominates power usage in sensornetworks; TiNA exploits end-user temporal coherency tolerances to reduce the amount ofinformation transmitted by individual nodes. Further; we show that TiNa; by using temporalcoherency tolerances; can allow for better quality of data when the time given to performreadings is too short for all data to be propagated up through the network. We compare ourproposed scheme against an existing in-network aggregation scheme with a local sensorcache. We present experimental results measuring both power savings and also the …,Proc. of the 2nd Hellenic Data Management Symposium,2003,46
Emerging event detection in social networks with location sensitivity,Sayan Unankard; Xue Li; Mohamed A Sharaf,Abstract With the increasing number of real-world events that are originated and discussedover social networks; event detection is becoming a compelling research issue. However;the traditional approaches to event detection on large text streams are not designed to dealwith a large number of short and noisy messages. This paper proposes an approach for theearly detection of emerging hotspot events in social networks with location sensitivity. Weconsider the message-mentioned locations for identifying the locations of events. In ourapproach; we identify strong correlations between user locations and event locations indetecting the emerging events. We evaluate our approach based on a real-world Twitterdataset. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can effectively detect emergingevents with respect to user locations that have different granularities.,World Wide Web,2015,43
Efficient scheduling of heterogeneous continuous queries,Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Kirk Pruhs,Abstract Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) typically host multiple ContinuousQueries (CQ) that process streams of data. In this paper; we examine the problem of how toschedule CQs in a DSMS to optimize for average QoS. We show that unlike standard on-linesystems; scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will bedifferent than policies that optimize for average slowdown which is more appropriate metricto use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. We also propose a hybrid schedulingpolicy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness.We further discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploitsharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs. Finally; we experimentallyshow using real data that our policies outperform currently used ones.,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,39

Adaptive scheduling of web transactions,Shenoda Guirguis; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Kirk Pruhs,In highly interactive dynamic web database systems; user satisfaction determines theirsuccess. In such systems; user requested web pages are dynamically created by executinga number of database queries or web transactions. In this paper; we model the interrelatedtransactions generating a web page as workflows and quantify the user satisfaction byassociating dynamic web pages with soft-deadlines. Further; we model the importance oftransactions in generating a page by associating different weights to transactions. Using thisframework; system success is measured in terms of minimizing the deviation from thedeadline (ie; tardiness) and also minimizing the weighted such deviation (ie; weightedtardiness).

Preemptive rate-based operator scheduling in a data stream management system,Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Summary form only given. Data stream management systems are being developed toprocess continuous queries over multiple data streams. These continuous queries aretypically used for monitoring purposes where the detection of an event might trigger asequence of actions or the execution of a set of specified tasks. Such events are identified bytuples produced by a query and hence; it is important to produce the available portions of aquery result as early as possible. A core element for improving the interactive performanceof a continuous query is the operator scheduler. An operator scheduler is particularlyimportant when the processing requirements and the productivity of different streams arehighly skewed. The need for an operator scheduler becomes even more crucial when tuplesfrom different streams arrive asynchronously. To meet these needs; we are proposing a …,Computer Systems and Applications; 2005. The 3rd ACS/IEEE International Conference on,2005,32
Dynamic partitioning of the cache hierarchy in shared data centers,Gokul Soundararajan; Jin Chen; Mohamed A Sharaf; Cristiana Amza,Abstract Due to the imperative need to reduce the management costs of large data centers;operators multiplex several concurrent database applications on a server farm connected toshared network attached storage. Determining and enforcing per-application resourcequotas in the resulting cache hierarchy; on the fly; poses a complex resource allocationproblem spanning the database server and the storage server tiers. This problem is furthercomplicated by the need to provide strict Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to hostedapplications. In this paper; we design and implement a novel coordinated partitioningtechnique of the database buffer pool and storage cache between applications for any givencache replacement policy and per-application access pattern.

Freshness-Aware Scheduling of Continuous Queries in the Dynamic Web.,Mohamed A Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs,ABSTRACT The dynamics of the Web and the demand for new; active services are imposingnew requirements on Web servers. One such new service is the processing of continuousqueries whose output data stream can be used to support the personalization of individualuser's web pages. In this paper; we are proposing a new scheduling policy for continuousqueries with the objective of maximizing the freshness of the output data stream and hencethe QoD of such new services. The proposed Freshness-Aware Scheduling of MultipleContinuous Queries (FAS-MCQ) policy decides the execution order of continuous queriesbased on each query's properties (ie; cost and selectivity) as well the properties of the inputupdate streams (ie; variability of updates). Our experimental results have shown that FAS-MCQ can increase freshness by up to 50% compared to existing scheduling policies used …,WebDB,2005,27

Optimized processing of multiple aggregate continuous queries,Shenoda Guirguis; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Data Streams Management Systems are designed to support monitoringapplications; which require the processing of hundreds of Aggregate Continuous Queries(ACQs). These ACQs typically have different time granularities; with possibly differentselection predicates and group-by attributes. In order to achieve scalability in the presenceof heavy workloads; in this paper; we introduce the concept of'Weaveability'as an indicator ofthe potential gains of sharing the processing of ACQs. We then propose Weave Share; acost-based optimizer that exploits weaveability to optimize the shared processing of ACQs.Our experimental analysis shows that Weave Share outperforms the alternative sharingschemes generating up to four orders of magnitude better quality plans. Finally; we describea practical implementation of the Weave Share optimizer.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,24
Three-level processing of multiple aggregate continuous queries,Shenoda Guirguis; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Aggregate Continuous Queries (ACQs) are both a very popular class of Continuous Queries(CQs) and also have a potentially high execution cost. As such; optimizing the processing ofACQs is imperative for Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) to reach their fullpotential in supporting (critical) monitoring applications. For multiple ACQs that vary inwindow specifications and pre-aggregation filters; existing multiple ACQs optimizationschemes assume a processing model where each ACQ is computed as a final-aggregationof a sub-aggregation. In this paper; we propose a novel processing model for ACQs; calledTri Ops; with the goal of minimizing the repetition of operator execution at the sub-aggregation level. We also propose Tri Weave; a Tri Ops-aware multi-query optimizer.

In this paper; we are addressing the issue of efficientdelivery of business-critical data in the form of summary tables to wireless clients equippedwith OLAP front-end tools. Towards this; we propose a new heuristic; on-demand schedulingalgorithm; called STOBS-a; that aggregates requests and broadcasts the results only once toall clients. STOBS-a exploits the structural dependencies among summary tables tomaximize data sharing based on aggregation and does not assume fixed length or uniformbroadcasts. The effectiveness of our proposed heuristic was evaluated experimentally usingsimulation with respect to both access time and fairness; as well as power consumption in …,Proceedings of the 1st Hellenic Conference on the Management of Data,2002,20

A framework for data quality aware query systems,Naiem K Yeganeh; Shazia Sadiq; Mohamed A Sharaf,Abstract The issue of data quality is increasingly important as individuals as well ascorporations are relying on multiple; often external sources of data to make decisions.Traditional query systems do not factor in data quality considerations in their response.Further; studies into the diverse interpretations of data quality indicate that fitness for use is afundamental criterion in the evaluation of data quality. In this paper we address the issue ofdata quality aware query systems by developing a query answering framework thatconsiders user data quality preferences over a collaborative information systemsarchitecture. Our work is motivated by an extensive study of data quality literature thatrevealed a lack of holistic solutions that encompass both business and technologicalaspects of data quality management.

Returning relevant yet diverse results tosuch queries provides users with quick insights into a rather large data space.

Core: A context-aware relation extraction method for relation completion,Zhixu Li; Mohamed A Sharaf; Laurianne Sitbon; Xiaoyong Du; Xiaofang Zhou,We identify relation completion (RC) as one recurring problem that is central to the successof novel big data applications such as Entity Reconstruction and Data Enrichment. Given asemantic relation ℜ; RC attempts at linking entity pairs between two entity lists under therelation ℜ. To accomplish the RC goals; we propose to formulate search queries for eachquery entity α based on some auxiliary information; so that to detect its target entity β fromthe set of retrieved documents. For instance; a pattern-based method (PaRE) uses extractedpatterns as the auxiliary information in formulating search queries. However; high-qualitypatterns may decrease the probability of finding suitable target entities. As an alternative; wepropose CoRE method that uses context terms learned surrounding the expression of arelation as the auxiliary information in formulating queries.

An optimized multicast-based data dissemination middleware: A demonstration,Wei Li; Wenhui Zhang; Vincenzo Liberatore; Vince Penkrot; Jonathan Beaver; Mohamed A Sharaf; Siddhartha Roychowdhury; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs,A major problem on the Internet is the scalable dissemination of information. This problem isparticularly acute exactly at the time when the scalability of data delivery is most important.One proposed solution to this scalability problem is to use multicast communication.However; allowing multicast communication introduces many nontrivial data managementproblems; such as caching; consistency; and scheduling. We have built a middleware thatunifies and extends state-of-the-art data management methods and algorithms into onesoftware distribution. Its flexible and extensible architecture is built from individualcomponents that can be selected or replaced depending on the underlying multicasttransport mechanism or on the application needs.

Optimizing i/o-intensive transactions in highly interactive applications,Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Cristiana Amza,Abstract The performance provided by an interactive online database system is typicallymeasured in terms of meeting certain pre-specified Service Level Agreements (SLAs); withexpected transaction latency being the most commonly used type of SLA. This form of SLAacts as a soft deadline for each transaction; and user satisfaction can be measured in termsof minimizing tardiness; that is; the deviation from SLA. This objective is further complicatedfor I/O-intensive transactions; where the storage system becomes the performancebottleneck. Moreover; common I/O scheduling policies employed by the Operating Systemwith a goal of improving I/O throughput or average latency may run counter to optimizing per-transaction performance since the Operating System is typically oblivious to the applicationhigh-level SLA specifications. In this paper; we propose a new SLA-aware policy for …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,14

Class-based continuous query scheduling for data streams,Lory Al Moakar; Thao N Pham; Panayiotis Neophytou; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Mohamed Sharaf,Abstract Wireless sensor networks link the physical and digital worlds enabling bothsurveillance as well as scientific exploration. In both cases; on-line detection of interestingevents can be accomplished with continuous queries (CQs) in a Data Stream ManagementSystem (DSMS). However; the quality-of-service requirements of detecting these events aredifferent for different monitoring applications. The CQs for detecting anomalous events (eg;fire; flood) have stricter response time requirements over CQs which are for logging andkeeping statistical information of physical phenomena. In this work; we are proposing theContinuous Query Class (CQC) scheduler; a new scheduling policy which employs two-level scheduling that is able to handle different ranks of CQ classes.

Poster session: ASETS: A self-managing transaction scheduler,Mohamed A Sharaf; Shenoda Guirguis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Kirk Pruhs; Panos K Chrysanthis,User satisfaction determines the success of web-database applications. User satisfactioncan be expressed in terms of expected response time or expected delay. Given the burstyand unpredictable behavior of web user populations; we model user requests astransactions with soft-deadlines. For such a model of user requests with soft-deadlines; thehit ratio is not the most expressive metric. Instead; the average tardiness is a better measurein such cases. In this paper; we propose and evaluate an adaptive self-managing algorithmcalled ASETS; which optimizes for the average tardiness. ASETS prioritize resources asneeded in order to keep users satisfied under varying workloads. Our performanceevaluation shows ASETS to outperform both EDF and SRPT which are known to be optimalfor the under and over utilization system conditions respectively.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008.

Mining personal health index from annual geriatric medical examinations,Ling Chen; Xue Li; Sen Wang; Hsiao-Yun Hu; Nicole Huang; Quan Z Sheng; Mohamed Sharaf,People take regular medical examinations mostly not for discovering diseases but for havinga peace of mind regarding their health status. Therefore; it is important to give them anoverall feedback with respect to all the health indicators that have been ranked against thewhole population. In this paper; we propose a framework of mining Personal Health Index(PHI) from a large and comprehensive geriatric medical examination (GME) dataset. Wedefine PHI as an overall score of personal health status based on a complement probabilityof health risks. The health risks are calculated using the information from the cause of death(COD) dataset that is linked to the GME dataset.

Scheduling with freshness and performance guarantees for web applications in the cloud,Yingying Zhu; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Highly distributed data management platforms (eg; PNUTS; Dynamo; Cassandra;and BigTable) are rapidly becoming the favorite choice for hosting modern web applicationsin the cloud. Among other features; these platforms rely on data partitioning; replication andrelaxed consistency to achieve high levels of performance and scalability. However; thesedesign choices often exhibit a trade-off between performance and data freshness. In thispaper; in addition to performance SLAs; we also perceive an application tolerance to datastaleness as another requirement determining the end-user satisfaction and our goal is tostrike a fine balance between both the quality of service (QoS) and quality of data (QoD)perceived by the end-user. Towards that; we propose scheduling policies and mechanismsfor efficiently allocating the recourses at each replica node so that to meet the conflicting …,Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Australasian Database Conference-Volume 115,2011,7
MuVE: Efficient multi-objective view recommendation for visual data exploration,Humaira Ehsan; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis,To support effective data exploration; there is a well-recognized need for solutions that canautomatically recommend interesting visualizations; which reveal useful insights into theanalyzed data. However; such visualizations come at the expense of high data processingcosts; where a large number of views are generated to evaluate their usefulness. Thosecosts are further escalated in the presence of numerical dimensional attributes; due to thepotentially large number of possible binning aggregations; which lead to a drastic increasein the number of possible visualizations.

Progressive diversification for column-based data exploration platforms,Hina A Khan; Mohamed A Sharaf,In Data Exploration platforms; diversification has become an essential method for extractingrepresentative data; which provide users with a concise and meaningful view of the resultsto their queries. However; the benefits of diversification are achieved at the expense of anadditional cost for the post-processing of query results. For high dimensional large resultsets; the cost of diversification is further escalated due to massive distance computationsrequired to evaluate the similarity between results. To address that challenge; in this paperwe propose the Progressive Data Diversification (pDiverse) scheme. The main ideaunderlying pDiverse is to utilize partial distance computation to reduce the amount ofprocessed data.

Efficient buffer management for piecewise linear representation of multiple data streams,Qing Xie; Jia Zhu; Mohamed A Sharaf; Chaoyi Pang,Abstract Piecewise Linear Representation (PLR) has been a widely used method forapproximating data streams in the form of compact line segments. The buffer-basedapproach to PLR enables a semi-global approximation which relies on the aggregatedprocessing of batches of streamed data so that to adjust and improve the approximationresults. However; one challenge towards applying the buffer-based approach is allocatingthe necessary memory resources for stream buffering. This challenge is further complicatedin a multi-stream environment where multiple data streams are competing for the availablememory resources; especially in resource-constrained systems such as sensors and mobiledevices.

Efficient retrieval of top-k most similar users from travel smart card data,Bolong Zheng; Kai Zheng; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Understanding the dynamics of human daily mobility patterns is essential for themanagement and planning of urban facilities and services. Travel smart cards; which recordusers' public transporting histories; capture rich information of users' mobility pattern. Thisprovides the opportunity to discover valuable knowledge from these transaction records. Inrecent years; research on measuring user similarity for behavior analysis has attracted a lotof attention in applications such as recommendation systems; crowd behavior analysisapplications; and numerous data mining tasks. In this paper; our goal is to estimate thesimilarity between users' travel patterns according to their travel smart card data. The core ofour proposal is a novel user similarity measurement; namely; Travel Spatial-TemporalSimilarity (TST); which measures the spatial range and temporal similarity between users …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,5
Finding the silver lining for data freshness on the cloud,Mohamed A Sharaf; Chen Xu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Emerging NoSQL key-value data stores rely on data partitioning and replication toachieve higher levels of availability and scalability. Such design choices typically exhibit atradeoff in which data freshness is sacrificed in favor of reduced access latencies. In thiswork; we argue that the same tradeoff is further manifested at a local-level (ie; replica-level)and is primarily shaped by the resource allocation strategies deployed for managing theprocessing of user queries and replica updates. To this end; we study several strategies forefficiently allocating such recourses so that to strike a fine balance between both the qualityof service (QoS) and quality of data (QoD) perceived by the end-user.,Proceedings of the fourth international workshop on Cloud data management,2012,5

Typically; such event detection is carried out by a data stream management serverexecuting continuous queries; previously submitted by the users. In this paper; we considerthe situation where the end-users submit queries from hand-held devices and the results ofthe continuous queries; which are in the form of individual data streams; are disseminated tothe users over a shared broadcast medium.

Saqr: An efficient scheme for similarity-aware query refinement,Abdullah Albarrak; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Query refinement techniques enable database systems to automatically adjust asubmitted query so that its result satisfies some specified constraints. While currenttechniques are fairly successful in generating refined queries based on cardinalityconstraints; they are rather oblivious to the (dis) similarity between the input query and itscorresponding refined version. Meanwhile; enforcing a similarity-aware query refinement isa rather challenging task as it would require an exhaustive examination of the large space ofpossible query refinements. To address this challenge; we propose a novel scheme forefficient Similarity-aware Query Refinement (SAQR). SAQR aims to balance the tradeoffbetween satisfying the cardinality and similarity constraints imposed on the refined query sothat to maximize its overall benefit to the user. To achieve that goal; SAQR implements …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,4
Adaptive query scheduling in key-value data stores,Chen Xu; Mohamed A Sharaf; Minqi Zhou; Aoying Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Large-scale distributed systems such as Dynamo at Amazon; PNUTS at Yahoo!;and Cassandra at Facebook; are rapidly becoming the data management platform of choicefor most web applications. Those key-value data stores rely on data partitioning andreplication to achieve higher levels of availability and scalability. Such design choicestypically exhibit a trade-off in which data freshness is sacrificed in favor of reduced accesslatencies. Hence; it is indispensable to optimize resource allocation in order to minimize: 1)query tardiness; ie; maximize Quality of Service (QoS); and 2) data staleness; ie; maximizeQuality of Data (QoD). That trade-off between QoS and QoD is further manifested at the local-level (ie; replica-level) and is primarily shaped by the resource allocation strategiesdeployed for managing the processing of foreground user queries and background …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,4
On the Prediction of Re-tweeting Activities in Social Networks–A Report on WISE 2012 Challenge,Sayan Unankard; Ling Chen; Peng Li; Sen Wang; Zi Huang; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xue Li,Abstract This paper reports on our participation in the Data Mining track of the WISE 2012Challenge. The challenge is to predict the volume of future re-tweets and possible views for33 given original short messages (tweets). Towards this; we compare and contrast fourdifferent methods and highlight our methods of choice for accomplishing this challenge. Thefirst method is a naïve approach that discovers a regression function based on the popularityof messages and network connectivity. The second approach is to build a classifier thatlearns a classification model based on the user's preferences in different categories oftopics. The third approach focuses on a network simulation that leverages a Monte Carlomethod to simulate re-tweeting paths starting from a root message.

Tuning qod in stream processing engines,Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Data (QoD) are the two major dimensions forevaluating any query processing system. In the context of data stream management systems(DSMSs); multi-query scheduling has been exploited to improve QoS. In this paper; we areproposing to exploit query scheduling to improve QoD in DSMSs. Specifically; we arepresenting a new policy for scheduling multiple continuous queries with the objective ofmaximizing the freshness of the output data streams and hence the QoD of such outputs.The proposed Freshness-Aware Scheduling of Multiple Continuous Queries (FAS-MCQ)policy decides the execution order of continuous queries based on each query's properties(ie; cost and selectivity) as well the properties of the input update streams (ie; variability ofupdates).

Sla-aware adaptive on-demand data broadcasting in wireless environments,Adrian Daniel Popescu; Mohamed A Sharaf; Cristiana Amza,In mobile and wireless networks; data broadcasting for popular data items enables theefficient utilization of the limited wireless bandwidth. However; efficient data schedulingschemes are needed to fully exploit the benefits of data broadcasting. This motivated theproposal of several broadcast scheduling policies; which have mostly focused on eitherminimizing response time; or drop rate when requests are associated with hard deadlines.The inherent inaccuracy of hard deadlines in a dynamic mobile environment motivated us touse Service Level Agreements (SLAs) where a user specifies the utility of data as a functionof its arrival time. Moreover; SLAs provide the mobile user with an already familiar quality ofservice specification from wired environments. Hence; in this paper; we propose SAABwhich is an SLA-aware adaptive data broadcast scheduling policy for maximizing the …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09.

Potential-driven load distribution for distributed data stream processing,Weihan Wang; Mohamed A Sharaf; Shimin Guo; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract A large class of applications require real-time processing of continuous stream dataresulting in the development of data stream management systems (DSMS). Since many ofthese applications are distributed; distributed DSMSs are starting to receive attention. In thispaper; we focus on an important issue in distributed DSMS operation; namely loaddistribution to minimize end-to-end latency. We identify the often conflicting requirements ofload distribution; and propose a" potential-driven" load distribution approach to mimic themovements of objects in the physical world. Our approach also takes into accountheterogeneous machines; different network conditions; and resource constraints.

Report on the second international workshop on exploratory search in databases and the web (exploredb 2015),Georgia Koutrika; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Mirek Riedewald; Mohamed A Sharaf; Kostas Stefanidis,To make Big Data that is growing in both size and diversity widely accessible; datamanagement and analysis systems have to provide appropriate exploration services. Ananalysis might include structured (relations; tables); semi-structured (XML); and“unstructured”(text) data; linked together through relationships encoded as a graph. Some ofthe data can be precise; others might be probabilistic [15]; eg; due to measurement error orbecause it was generated by a statistical model. At the same time; the community of potentialusers is becoming more diverse as well; ranging from database experts and domainscientists to citizen scientists.

Diversifying with few regrets; but too few to mention,Zaeem Hussain; Hina A Khan; Mohamed A Sharaf,Abstract Representative data provide users with a concise overview of their potentially largequery results. Recently; diversity maximization has been adopted as one technique togenerate representative data with high coverage and low redundancy. Orthogonally; regretminimization has emerged as another technique to generate representative data with highutility that satisfy the user's preference. In reality; however; users typically have some pre-specified preferences over some dimensions of the data; while expecting good coverageover the other dimensions. Motivated by that need; in this work we propose a novel schemecalled ReDi; which aims to generate representative data that balance the tradeoff betweenregret minimization and diversity maximization. ReDi is based on a hybrid objective functionthat combines both regret and diversity. Additionally; it employs several algorithms that …,Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Exploratory Search in Databases and the Web,2015,2
AQUAS: A quality-aware scheduler for NoSQL data stores,Chen Xu; Fan Xia; Mohamed A Sharaf; Minqi Zhou; Aoying Zhou,NoSQL key-value data stores provide an attractive solution for big data management. Withthe help of data partitioning and replication; those data stores achieve higher levels ofavailability; scalability and reliability.

Interactive Exploration of Correlated Time Series,Daniel Petrov; Rakan Alseghayer; Mohamed Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract The rapid growth of monitoring applications has led to unprecedented amounts ofgenerated time series data. Data analysts typically explore such large volumes of time seriesdata looking for valuable insights. One such insight is finding pairs of time series; in whichsubsequences of values exhibit certain levels of correlation. However; since exploratoryqueries tend to be initially vague and imprecise; an analyst will typically use the results ofone query as a springboard to formulating a new one; in which the correlation specificationsare further refined. As such; it is essential to provide analysts with quick initial results to theirexploratory queries; which allows for speeding up the refinement process. This goal ischallenging when exploring the correlation in a large search space that consists of a bignumber of long time series. In this work we propose search algorithms that address …,Proceedings of the ExploreDB'17,2017,1

REQUEST: A scalable framework for interactive construction of exploratory queries,Xiaoyu Ge; Yanbing Xue; Zhipeng Luo; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis,Exploration over large datasets is a key first step in data analysis; as users may beunfamiliar with the underlying database schema and unable to construct precise queries thatrepresent their interests. Such data exploration task usually involves executing numerous ad-hoc queries; which requires a considerable amount of time and human effort. In this paper;we present REQUEST; a novel framework that is designed to minimize the human effort andenable both effective and efficient data exploration. REQUEST supports the query-from-examples style of data exploration by integrating two key components: 1) Data Reduction;and 2) Query Selection.

Orange: Objective-aware range query refinement,Abdullah Albarrak; Tatiana Noboa; Hina A Khan; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,In this demo paper we present Orange; a system prototype for objective-aware range queryrefinement. Orange essentially refines a range query to meet a pre-specified cardinalityconstraint while taking into account the (dis) similarity between the initial query and itscorresponding refined version. To achieve this goal; Orange employes the novel schemeSAQR for efficient similarity-aware query refinement. The main idea underlying SAQR is toutilize the pre-defined constraints on cardinality and similarity in order to bound the searchspace and quickly find a refined query; which meets the user's expectations. We showcaseOrange in a web-based application which aims to guide planners in allocating service zonesfor police patrol units using real and historical dataset of crime incidents.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,1
Efficient profiling for estimation of query result quality,Naiem K Yeganeh; Shazia Sadiq; Mohamed A Sharaf; Ken Deng,Abstract: The issue of Data Quality (DQ) is of increasing importance as individuals as well ascorporations are relying on multiple; often external sources of data to make decisions. Dataquality profiles consist of statistical measurements about the quality of data sets. Querysystems can use DQ profiles as a form of metadata to estimate the quality of a query resultset. Traditional DQ profiling provides an estimate on the overall quality of a data set or datasource; but quality of a query result can be remarkably different from the overall quality of thedata set because conditions within the query typically select a subset of the data. In thispaper we propose an efficient conditional DQ profiling method which can estimate thequality of a result set for a given query with guaranteed user definable level of accuracy.,Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Information Quality; ICIQ,2011,1
Efficient schemes for similarity-aware refinement of aggregation queries,Abdullah M Albarrak; Mohamed A Sharaf,Abstract Interactive data exploration platforms in Web; business and scientific domains arebecoming increasingly popular. Typically; users without prior knowledge of data interact withthese platforms in an exploratory manner hoping they might retrieve the results they arelooking for. One way to explore large-volume data is by posing aggregate queries whichgroup values of multiple rows by an aggregate operator to form a single value: anaggregated value. Though; when a query fails; ie; returns undesired aggregated value;users will have to undertake a frustrating trial-and-error process to refine their queries; until adesired result is attained. This data exploration process; however; is growing rather difficultas the underlying data is typically of large-volume and high-dimensionality. While heuristic-based techniques are fairly successful in generating refined queries that meet specified …,World Wide Web,2017,*
Efficient Recommendation of Aggregate Data Visualizations,Humaira Ehsan; Mohamed Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis,Data visualization is a common and effective technique for data exploration. However; forcomplex data; it is infeasible for an analyst to manually generate and browse all possiblevisualizations for insights. That motivated the need for automated solutions that caneffectively recommend such visualizations. The main idea underlying those solutions is toevaluate the utility of all possible visualizations and then recommend the top-kvisualizations. This process incurs high data-processing cost; that is further aggravated bythe presence of numerical dimensional attributes. To address that challenge; we proposenovel view recommendation schemes that are based on numerical dimensions. Theseschemes incorporate a hybrid multi-objective utility function; which captures the impact ofnumerical dimension attributes.

Query Refinement for Correlation-Based Time Series Exploration,Abdullah M Albarrak; Mohamed A Sharaf,Abstract In this paper; we focus on the problem of exploring sequential data to discover timesub-intervals that satisfy certain pairwise correlation constraints. Differently than mostexisting works; we use the deviation from targeted pairwise correlation constraints as anobjective to minimize in our problem. Moreover; we include users preferences as anobjective in the form of maximizing similarity to users' initial sub-intervals. The combinationof these two objectives are prevalent in applications where users explore time series data tolocate time sub-intervals in which targeted patterns exist. Discovering these sub-intervalsamong time series data is extremely useful in various application areas such as network andenvironment monitoring.,Australasian Database Conference,2017,*
Detection of Highly Correlated Live Data Streams,Rakan Alseghayer; Daniel Petrov; Panos K Chrysanthis; Mohamed Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract More and more organizations (commercial; health; government and security)currently base their decisions on real-time analysis of fast arriving; large volumes of datastreams. For such analysis to lead to actionable information in real-time and at the right time;the most recent data needs to be processed within a specified delay target. Effectivesolutions for analysis of such data streams rely on two techniques;(1) incremental sliding-window computation of aggregates; to avoid unnecessary recomputations and (2) intelligentscheduling of computational steps and operations. In this paper; we propose a solution thatcombines both of these techniques to find highly correlated data streams in real-time; usingthe Pearson Correlation Coefficient as a correlation metric for two windows of data streams.Specifically; we propose to partition a set of data streams into micro-batches that capture …,Proceedings of the International Workshop on Real-Time Business Intelligence and Analytics,2017,*
Model-Based Diversification for Sequential Exploratory Queries,Hina A Khan; Mohamed A Sharaf,Abstract Today; data exploration platforms are widely used to assist users in locatinginteresting objects within large volumes of scientific and business data. In those platforms;users try to make sense of the underlying data space by iteratively posing numerous queriesover large databases. While diversification of query results; like other data summarizationtechniques; provides users with quick insights into the huge query answer space; it addsadditional complexity to an already computationally expensive data exploration task. Toaddress this challenge; in this paper we propose a diversification scheme that targets theproblem of efficiently diversifying the results of multiple queries within and across differentdata exploratory sessions. Our proposed scheme relies on a model-based diversificationmethod and an ordered cache. In particular; we employ an adaptive regression model to …,Data Science and Engineering,2017,*
Incorporating biometrics into veiled certificates: preventing unauthorized use of anonymous certificates,John H Gerdes; Chin-Tser Huang; Mohamed A Sharaf,Abstract A leading cause of Identity Theft is that attackers get access to the victim's personalcredentials. We are warned to protect our personal identifiers but we need to share ourcredentials with various organizations in order to obtain services from them. As a result thesafety of our credentials is dependent on both the ability and diligence of the variousorganizations with which we interact. However; recent data breach incidents are clear proofthat existing approaches are insufficient to protect the privacy of our credentials. Using aDesign Science methodology; we propose a new technology; veiled certificates; whichincludes features that prevent fraudulent use of user's credentials and provides a degree ofuser anonymity. We also incorporate biometric authentication so that service providers knowthat they are dealing with the owner of the credentials.

Inthis demonstration; we focus on the case where users with mobile devices submitcontinuous queries (for event detection) to a data stream management server whichdisseminates the results to the users over a shared broadcast medium. In order to minimizethe overall energy consumption of the mobile devices (clients); we have proposed operatorplacement algorithms that split the processing of each continuous query between thecentralized server and the requesting mobile clients; thus trading off energy consumption forcommunication energy consumption for computation.

Scheduling Strategies for Data Stream Processing,Mohamed Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

In thispaper; we study LEACH routing protocol and its performance and propose an extension to it;MA-LEACH. We introduce a mobile aggregator (MA) which is a gadget adopted to mitigatethe overhead on the cluster heads (CHs). In addition; we optimize the trajectory usingparticle swarm optimization (PSO). Hence; we adapt the TSP problem to our protocol todetermine the optimal trajectory that a mobile aggregator could travel to visit every clusterhead in the network.

Scheduling Multiple Continuous Queries to Improve QoD,Mohamed A Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs,ABSTRACT Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Data (QoD) are the two majordimensions for evaluating any query processing system. In the context of the new datastream management stystems (DSMSs); multi-query scheduling has been exploited toimprove QoS. In this paper; we are proposing to exploit scheduling to improve QoD.Specifically; we are presenting a new policy for scheduling multiple continuous queries withthe objective of maximizing the freshness of the output data streams and hence the QoD ofsuch outputs. The proposed Freshness-Aware Scheduling of Multiple Continuous Queries(FAS-MCQ) policy decides the execution order of continuous queries based on each query'sproperties (ie; cost and selectivity) as well the properties of the input update streams (ie;variability of updates). Our experimental results have shown that FAS-MCQ can increase …,*,*,*
Query Result Quality: Efficient Profiling and Estimation,Naiem Yeganeh; Shazia Sadiq; Mohamed A Sharaf; Ke Deng,Abstract The issue of Data Quality (DQ) is gaining importance as individuals as well ascorporations are increasingly relying on multiple; often external sources of data to makedecisions. Data quality profiles consist of statistical measurements about the quality of datasets. Query systems can use DQ profiles as a form of metadata to estimates the quality of aquery result set. Traditional DQ profiling provides estimate about the overall quality of a dataset or data source; but quality of a query result can be remarkably different from the overallquality of the data set because conditions within the query typically select a sub set of thedata. In this paper we propose a conditional DQ profiling method and which can estimate thequality of a result set for a given query with guaranteed user definable level of accuracy.,*,*,*
