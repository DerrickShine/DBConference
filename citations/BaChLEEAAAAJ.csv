Efficient unknown tag identification protocols in large-scale RFID systems,Xiulong Liu; Keqiu Li; Geyong Min; Kai Lin; Bin Xiao; Yanming Shen; Wenyu Qu,Owing to its attractive features such as fast identification and relatively long interrogatingrange over the classical barcode systems; radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologypossesses a promising prospect in many practical applications such as inventory controland supply chain management. However; unknown tags appear in RFID systems when thetagged objects are misplaced or unregistered tagged objects are moved in; which oftencauses huge economic losses. This paper addresses an important and challenging problemof unknown tag identification in large-scale RFID systems. The existing protocols leveragethe Aloha-like schemes to distinguish the unknown tags from known tags at the slot level;which are of low time-efficiency; and thus can hardly satisfy the delay-sensitive applications.To fill in this gap; two filtering-based protocols (at the bit level) are proposed in this paper …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2014,36

However; the existing protocolsare ineffective in terms of execution time and can hardly satisfy the requirements of real-timeapplications. In this paper; a Multi-hashing based Missing Tag Identification (MMTI) protocolis proposed; which achieves better time efficiency by improving the utilization of the timeframe used for identification.

RFID cardinality estimation with blocker tags,Xiulong Liu; Bin Xiao; Keqiu Li; Jie Wu; Alex X Liu; Heng Qi; Xin Xie,The widely used RFID tags impose serious privacy concerns as a tag responds to queriesfrom readers no matter they are authorized or not. The common solution is to use acommercially available blocker tag which behaves as if a set of tags with known blocking IDsare present. The use of blocker tags makes RFID estimation much more challenging assome genuine tag IDs are covered by the blocker tag and some are not. In this paper; wepropose REB; the first RFID estimation scheme with the presence of blocker tags. REB usesthe framed slotted Aloha protocol specified in the C1G2 standard.

Fast counting the key tags in anonymous RFID systems,Xiulong Liu; Keqiu Li; Heng Qi; Bin Xiao; Xin Xie,In RFID-enabled applications; we may pay more attention to key tags instead of all tags. Thispaper studies the problem of key tag counting; which aims at estimating how many key tagsin a given set exist in the current RFID system. Previous work is slow to solve this newproblem because of the serious interference replies from the large number of ordinary (ie;Nonkey) tags. However; time-efficiency is an important metric for the fast tag cardinalityestimation in a large-scale RFID system. In this paper; we propose a singleton slot-basedestimator; which is time-efficient because the RFID reader only needs to observe the statuschange of expected singleton slots of key tags instead of the whole time frame. In practice;the ratio of key tags to all current tags is small for" key" members should be rare.

Top-k queries for multi-category RFID systems,Xiulong Liu; Keqiu Li; Jie Wu; Alex X Liu; Xin Xie; Chunsheng Zhu; Weilian Xue,This paper studies the practically important problem of top-k queries; which is to find the topk largest categories and their corresponding sizes. In this paper; we propose a Top-k Query(TKQ) protocol and a technique that we call Segmented Perfect Hashing (SPH) foroptimizing TKQ. Specifically; TKQ is based on the framed slotted Aloha protocol. Each tagresponds to the reader with a Single-One Geometric (SOG) string using the ON-OFF Keyingmodulation. TKQ leverages the length of continuous leading 1s in the combined signal toestimate the corresponding category size. TKQ can quickly eliminate the sufficiently smallcategories; and only needs to focus on a limited number of large-size categories that requiremore accurate estimation.

Multi-category RFID estimation,Xiulong Liu; Keqiu Li; Alex X Liu; Song Guo; Muhammad Shahzad; Ann L Wang; Jie Wu,This paper concerns the practically important problem of multi-category radio frequencyidentification (RFID) estimation: given a set of RFID tags; we want to quickly and accuratelyestimate the number of tags in each category. However; almost all the existing RFIDestimation protocols are dedicated to the estimation problem on a single set; regardless oftag categories. A feasible solution is to separately execute the existing estimation protocolson each category. The execution time of such a serial solution is proportional to the numberof categories; and cannot satisfy the delay-stringent application scenarios. SimultaneousRIFD estimation over multiple categories is desirable; and hence; this paper proposes anapproach called simultaneous estimation for multi-category RFID systems (SEM).

Fast tracking the population of key tags in large-scale anonymous RFID systems,Xiulong Liu; Xin Xie; Keqiu Li; Bin Xiao; Jie Wu; Heng Qi; Dawei Lu,Abstract In large-scale radio frequency identification RFID-enabled applications; wesometimes only pay attention to a small set of key tags; instead of all. This paper studies theproblem of key tag population tracking; which aims at estimating how many key tags in agiven set exist in the current RFID system and how many of them are absent. Previous workis slow to solve this problem due to the serious interference replies from a large number ofordinary ie; non-key tags.

Efficient detection of cloned attacks for large-scale RFID systems,Xiulong Liu; Heng Qi; Keqiu Li; Jie Wu; Weilian Xue; Geyong Min; Bin Xiao,Abstract This paper studies a practically important problem of cloned tag detection in large-scale RFID systems where an attacker compromises genuine tags and produces theirreplicas; namely cloned tags; to threaten RFID applications. Although many efforts havebeen made to address this problem; the existing work can hardly satisfy the stringent real-time requirement; and thus cannot catch cloning attacks in a time-efficient way. Moreover;the existing work does not consider energy-efficiency; which is very critical when battery-powered active tags are used. To fill these gaps; this paper proposes a Location Polling-based Cloned tag Detection (LP-CTD) protocol by taking both time-efficiency and energy-efficiency into consideration. LP-CTD reports the existence of cloned tags when the readerfinds an expected singleton slot appearing as collision one.

It iscritical to efficiently identify the unknown tags because these tags can appear when newtagged objects are moved in or wrongly placed. The state-of-the-art Basic Unknown tagIdentification Protocol-with Collision-Fresh slot paring (BUIP-CF) protocol can first deactivateall the known tags and then collect all the unknown tags.

From prior researches in this area; one of the pending problem involves processingredundant time frames due to unknown tag collisions. In this paper; we propose a time-efficient unknown tag identification protocol based on coded filtering vector technique. Thisvector is able to efficiently separate unknown tags from known tags. It reduces the unknown-known tag collisions as well as the required time frame length. The proposed protocol canachieve the minimal execution time theoretically.

Dynamic scheming the duty cycle in the opportunistic routing sensor network,Bingxin Niu; Heng Qi; Keqiu Li; Xiulong Liu; Weilian Xue,Summary In wireless sensor networks; a lot of applications need the sensed information betransmitted to the sink node within a predefined time threshold. So end-to-end delay is animportant performance metric in wireless sensor networks. Opportunistic routing protocolshave been proposed to reduce the waiting delay. In the duty cycle networks; increasing theduty cycle ratio can also reduce the end-to-end delay. However; this method will consumemore energy. It is obvious that there exists a trade-off between delay and energyconsumption. So adjusting the duty cycle ratio of each node can investigate this trade-off. Tothe best of our knowledge; no existing work takes both of end-to-end delay and energyefficiency into consideration in the opportunistic routing networks.

D2CS: dynamic duty cycle scheme in an opportunistic routing sensor network,Bingxin Niu; Heng Qi; Keqiu Li; Xiulong Liu; Weilian Xue,In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs); end-to-end delay is an important metric because thesensed information is necessary to be transmitted to the sink node within a predefined timethreshold. Therefore; opportunistic routing protocols are proposed to reduce the end-to-enddelay. As a matter of fact; increasing the number of wake-up slots will certainly reduce thetransmission delay; however; also consumes more energy. Hence; it is interesting to controlthe number of wake-up slots to investigate the trade-off between the end-to-end delay andthe energy-efficiency. To the best of our knowledge; no existing work takes both of end-to-end delay and energy-efficiency into consideration in the opportunistic routing networks.Therefore; this paper studies how to minimize the energy-consumption while guaranteeingthat the expected end-to-end delay is below a given threshold.

Fast Identification of Blocked RFID Tags,Xiulong Liu; Xin Xie; Xibin Zhao; Keqiu Li; Alex X Liu; Song Guo; Jie Wu,The widely used RFID systems are vulnerable to the denial-of-service (DoS) attackslaunched by malicious blocker tags. This paper studies how to quickly and completelyidentify the valid RFID tags that are blocked. The existing work that can seemingly addressthis problem suffers from either low time-efficiency or serious false positives. This paperproposes a hybrid approach that consists of two complementary component protocols;namely Aloha Filtering (AF) and Poll&Listen (PL). AF is fast but inaccurate; while PL isaccurate but slow. Taking the merit of each protocol; our hybrid approach is to first repeat thefast AF for multiple rounds to quickly filter out the target tags that are definitely not blocked.Then; on the size-reduced remaining set that just contains a small number of suspicioustags; we invoke the accurate PL to verify the intactness of each suspicious tag with 100 …,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2018,*

Minimal Perfect Hashing-Based Information Collection Protocol for RFID Systems,Xin Xie; Xiulong Liu; Keqiu Li; Bin Xiao; Heng Qi,For large-scale RFID systems; this paper studies the practically important problem of targettag information collection; which aims at collecting information from a specific set of targettags instead of all. However; the existing solutions are of low time-efficiency because of tworeasons. First; the serious collisions among tags due to hashing randomness seriouslyreduce the frame utilization; whose upper bound is just 36.8 percent. Second; they cannotefficiently distinguish the target tags from the non-target tags and thus inevitably collect a lotof irrelevant information on non-target tags; which further deteriorates the effective utilizationof the time frame.

The existingsolutions need to execute unknown and missing tag identification protocols separately;which are of low time-efficiency because the unknown tags disturb the identification ofmissing tags and vice versa. To this end; we design a Fast Continuous Scanning (FCS)protocol based on the proposed multiple categories filter which can detect unknown tagsand skip the empty and collision slots for improving the efficiency of missing tagidentification. FCS is faster than the prior methods because the proposed filter is helpful todecreasing the interference between unknown and missing tags.

Existing datacollection protocols require each tag to transmit the sensor data to the reader through a low-rate channel. However; in large-scale RFID system; they take too long time and block othertime-sensitive operations. By exploring the correlation of sensor data; our Sampling-basedInformation Collection (SIC) protocol significantly reduces the number of responding tags.Specifically; SIC obtains an error bound based on the estimation model by using somerandomly-sampled data. The error bound is expected to maximize the number of data withinit. These data can be seen as a cluster and be approximated by one value within the errorbound.
