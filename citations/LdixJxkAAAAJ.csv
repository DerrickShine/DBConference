Hyracks: A flexible and extensible foundation for data-intensive computing,Vinayak Borkar; Michael Carey; Raman Grover; Nicola Onose; Rares Vernica,Hyracks is a new partitioned-parallel software platform designed to run data-intensivecomputations on large shared-nothing clusters of computers. Hyracks allows users toexpress a computation as a DAG of data operators and connectors. Operators operate onpartitions of input data and produce partitions of output data; while connectors repartitionoperators' outputs to make the newly produced partitions available at the consumingoperators. We describe the Hyracks end user model; for authors of dataflow jobs; and theextension model for users who wish to augment Hyracks' built-in library with new operatorand/or connector types. We also describe our initial Hyracks implementation. Since Hyracksis in roughly the same space as the open source Hadoop platform; we compare Hyrackswith Hadoop experimentally for several different kinds of use cases. The initial results …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,271

Its features make it well-suited to applications like web data warehousing; socialdata storage and analysis; and other use cases related to Big Data. AsterixDB has a flexibleNoSQL style data model; a query language that supports a wide range of queries; a scalableruntime; partitioned; LSM-based data storage and indexing (including B+-tree; R-tree; andtext indexes); support for external as well as natively stored data; a rich set of built-in types;support for fuzzy; spatial; and temporal types and queries; a built-in notion of data feeds foringestion of data; and transaction support akin to that of a NoSQL store. Development ofAsterixDB began in 2009 and led to a mid-2013 initial open source release. This paper is …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,84
Extending map-reduce for efficient predicate-based sampling,Raman Grover; Michael J Carey,In this paper we address the problem of using MapReduce to sample a massive data set inorder to produce a fixed-size sample whose contents satisfy a given predicate. While it issimple to express this computation using MapReduce; its default Hadoop execution isdependent on the input size and is wasteful of cluster resources. This is unfortunate; assampling queries are fairly common (eg; for exploratory data analysis at Facebook); and theresulting waste can significantly impact the performance of a shared cluster. To addresssuch use cases; we present the design; implementation and evaluation of a Hadoopexecution model extension that supports incremental job expansion. Under this model; a jobconsumes input as required and can dynamically govern its resource consumption whileproducing the required results. The proposed mechanism is able to support a variety of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,47
ASTERIX: an open source system for big data management and analysis,Sattam Alsubaiee; Yasser Altowim; Hotham Altwaijry; Alexander Behm; Vinayak Borkar; Yingyi Bu; Michael Carey; Raman Grover; Zachary Heilbron; Young-Seok Kim; Chen Li; Nicola Onose; Pouria Pirzadeh; Rares Vernica; Jian Wen,Abstract At UC Irvine; we are building a next generation parallel database system; calledASTERIX; as our approach to addressing today's" Big Data" management challenges.ASTERIX aims to combine time-tested principles from parallel database systems with thoseof the Web-scale computing community; such as fault tolerance for long running jobs. In thisdemo; we present a whirlwind tour of ASTERIX; highlighting a few of its key features. We willdemonstrate examples of our data definition language to model semi-structured data; andexamples of interesting queries using our declarative query language. In particular; we willshow the capabilities of ASTERIX for answering geo-spatial queries and fuzzy queries; aswell as ASTERIX'data feed construct for continuously ingesting data.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,30
Data Ingestion in AsterixDB.,Raman Grover; Michael J Carey,ABSTRACT In this paper we describe the support for data ingestion in AsterixDB; an open-source Big Data Management System (BDMS) that provides a platform for storage andanalysis of large volumes of semi-structured data. Data feeds are a new mechanism forhaving continuous data arrive into a BDMS from external sources and incrementallypopulate a persisted dataset and associated indexes. We add a new BDMS architecturalcomponent; called a data feed; that makes a Big Data system the caretaker for functionalitythat used to live outside; and we show how it improves users' lives and system performance.We show how to build the data feed component; architecturally; and how an enhanced usermodel can enable sharing of ingested data. We describe how to make this component fault-tolerant so the system manages input in the presence of failures. We also show how to …,EDBT,2015,22
Asterix: scalable warehouse-style web data integration,Sattam Alsubaiee; Alexander Behm; Raman Grover; Rares Vernica; Vinayak Borkar; Michael J Carey; Chen Li,Abstract A growing wealth of digital information is being generated on a daily basis in socialnetworks; blogs; online communities; etc. Organizations and researchers in a wide variety ofdomains recognize that there is tremendous value and insight to be gained by warehousingthis emerging data and making it available for querying; analysis; and other purposes. Thisnew breed of" Big Data" applications poses challenging requirements against datamanagement platforms in terms of scalability; flexibility; manageability; and analysiscapabilities. At UC Irvine; we are building a next-generation database system; calledASTERIX; in response to these trends. We present ongoing work that approaches thefollowing questions: How does data get into the system? What primitives should we provideto better cope with dirty/noisy data? How can we support efficient data analysis on spatial …,Proceedings of the Ninth International Workshop on Information Integration on the Web,2012,20
External data access and indexing in asterixdb,Abdullah A Alamoudi; Raman Grover; Michael J Carey; Vinayak Borkar,Abstract Traditional database systems offer rich query interfaces (SQL) and efficient queryexecution for data that they store. Recent years have seen the rise of Big Data analyticsplatforms offering query-based access to" raw" external data; eg; file-resident data (often inHDFS). In this paper; we describe techniques to achieve the qualities offered by DBMSswhen accessing external data. This work has been built into Apache AsterixDB; an opensource Big Data Management System. We describe how we build distributed indexes overexternal data; partition external indexes; provide query consistency across access paths;and manage external indexes amidst concurrent activities. We compare the performance ofthis new AsterixDB capability to an external-only solution (Hive) and to its internallymanaged data and indexes.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,7
Scalable Fault-Tolerant Data Feeds in AsterixDB,Raman Grover; Michael J Carey,Abstract: In this paper we describe the support for data feed ingestion in AsterixDB; an open-source Big Data Management System (BDMS) that provides a platform for storage andanalysis of large volumes of semi-structured data. Data feeds are a mechanism for havingcontinuous data arrive into a BDMS from external sources and incrementally populate apersisted dataset and associated indexes. The need to persist and index" fast-flowing" high-velocity data (and support ad hoc analytical queries) is ubiquitous. However; the state of theart today involves' gluing'together different systems. AsterixDB is different in being a unifiedsystem with" native support" for data feed ingestion. We discuss the challenges and presentthe design and implementation of the concepts involved in modeling and managing datafeeds in AsterixDB. AsterixDB allows the runtime behavior; allocation of resources and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.1705,2014,4
