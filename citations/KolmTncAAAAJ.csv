RQL: a declarative query language for RDF,Gregory Karvounarakis; Sofia Alexaki; Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Plexousakis; Michel Scholl,Abstract Real-scale Semantic Web applications; such as Knowledge Portals and E-Marketplaces; require the management of large volumes of metadata; ie; informationdescribing the available Web content and services. Better knowledge about their meaning;usage; accessibility or quality will considerably facilitate an automated processing of Webresources. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) enables the creation and exchangeof metadata as normal Web data. Although voluminous RDF descriptions are alreadyappearing; sufficiently expressive declarative languages for querying both RDF descriptionsand schemas are still missing. In this paper; we propose a new RDF query language calledRQL. It is a typed functional language (a la OQL) and relies on a formal model for directedlabeled graphs permitting the interpretation of superimposed resource descriptions by …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on World Wide Web,2002,709
From structured documents to novel query facilities,Vassilis Christophides; Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Michel Scholl,Abstract Structured documents (eg; SGML) can benefit a lot from database support and morespecifically from object-oriented database (OODB) management systems. This paperdescribes a natural mapping from SGML documents into OODB's and a formal extension oftwo OODB query languages (one SQL-like and the other calculus) in order to deal withSGML document retrieval. Although motivated by structured documents; the extensions ofquery languages that we present are general and useful for a variety of other OODBapplications. A key element is the introduction of paths as first class citizens. The newfeatures allow to query data (and to some extent schema) without exact knowledge of theschema in a simple and homogeneous fashion.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1994,496
The ICS-FORTH RDFSuite: Managing Voluminous RDF Description Bases.,Sofia Alexaki; Vassilis Christophides; Gregory Karvounarakis; Dimitris Plexousakis; Karsten Tolle,ABSTRACT Metadata are widely used in order to fully exploit information resourcesavailable on corporate intranets or the Internet. The Resource Description Framework (RDF)aims at facilitating the creation and exchange of metadata as any other Web data. Thegrowing number of available information resources and the proliferation of descriptionservices in various user communities; lead nowadays to large volumes of RDF metadata.Managing such RDF resource descriptions and schemas with existing low-level APIs andfile-based implementations does not ensure fast deployment and easy maintenance of real-scale RDF applications. In this paper; we advocate the use of database technology tosupport declarative access; as well as; logical and physical independence for voluminousRDF description bases. We present RDFSuite; a suite of tools for RDF validation; storage …,SemWeb,2001,364
E-services: a look behind the curtain,Richard Hull; Michael Benedikt; Vassilis Christophides; Jianwen Su,Abstract The emerging paradigm of electronic services promises to bring to distributedcomputation and services the flexibility that the web has brought to the sharing ofdocuments. An understanding of fundamental properties of e-service composition isrequired in order to take full advantage of the paradigm. This paper examines proposals andstandards for e-services from the perspectives of XML; data management; workflow; andprocess models. Key areas for study are identified; including behavioral service signatures;verification and synthesis techniques for composite services; analysis of service datamanipulation commands; and XML analysis applied to service specifications. We give asample of the relevant results and techniques in each of these areas.,Proceedings of the twenty-second ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2003,316
On wrapping query languages and efficient XML integration,Vassilis Christophides; Sophie Cluet; Jérǒme Simèon,Abstract Modern applications (Web portals; digital libraries; etc.) require integrated access tovarious information sources (from traditional DBMS to semistructured Web repositories); fastdeployment and low maintenance cost in a rapidly evolving environment. Because of itsflexibility; there is an increasing interest in using XML as a middleware model for suchapplications. XML enables fast wrapping and declarative integration. However; queryprocessing in XML-based integration systems is still penalized by the lack of an algebra withadequate optimization properties and the difficulty to understand source query capabilities.In this paper; we propose an algebraic approach to support efficient XML query evaluation.We define a general purpose algebra suitable for semistructured on XML query languages.We show how this algebra can be used; with appropriate type information; to also wrap …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2000,257
Querying documents in object databases,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Vassilis Christophides; Tova Milo; Guido Moerkotte; Jérôme Siméon,structuring schemas that consist in grammars annotated with database programs. To querydocuments; we introduce an extension of OQL; the ODMG standard query language forobject databases. Our extension (named OQL-doc) allows us to query documents without aprecise knowledge of their structure using in particular generalized path expressions andpattern matching. This allows us to introduce in a declarative language (in the style of SQLor OQL); navigational and information retrieval styles of accessing data. Query processing inthe context of documents and path expressions leads to challenging implementation issues.We extend an object algebra with new operators to deal with generalized path expressions.We then consider two essential complementary optimization techniques. We show thatalmost standard database optimization techniques can be used to answer queries without …,International Journal on Digital Libraries,1997,223
Benchmarking database representations of RDF/S stores,Yannis Theoharis; Vassilis Christophides; Grigoris Karvounarakis,Abstract In this paper we benchmark three popular database representations of RDF/Sschemata and data:(a) a schema-aware (ie; one table per RDF/S class or property) withexplicit (ISA) or implicit (NOISA) storage of subsumption relationships;(b) a schema-oblivious (ie; a single table with triples of the form); using (ID) or not (URI) identifiers torepresent resources and (c) a hybrid of the schema-aware and schema-obliviousrepresentations (ie; one table per RDF/S meta-class by distinguishing also the range type ofproperties). Furthermore; we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomicqueries either on-the-fly (ISA; NOISA; Hybrid); or by precomputing the transitive closure ofsubsumption relationships (MatView; URI; ID). The main conclusion drawn from ourexperiments is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over RDF/S …,International Semantic Web Conference,2005,147
Evaluating queries with generalized path expressions,Vassilis Christophides; Sophie Cluet; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract In the past few years; query languages featuring generalized path expressionshave been proposed. These languages allow the interrogation of both data and structure.They are powerful and essential for a number of applications. However; until now; theirevaluation has relied on a rather naive and inefficient algorithm. In this paper; we extend anobject algebra with two new operators and present some interesting rewriting techniques forqueries featuring generalized path expressions. We also show how a query optimizer canintegrate the new techniques.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1996,140
On labeling schemes for the semantic web,Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Plexousakis; Michel Scholl; Sotirios Tourtounis,Abstract This paper focuses on the optimization of the navigation through voluminoussubsumption hierarchies of topics employed by Portal Catalogs like Netscape OpenDirectory (ODP). We advocate for the use of labeling schemes for modeling thesehierarchies in order to efficiently answer queries such as subsumption check; descendants;ancestors or nearest common ancestor; which usually require costly transitive closurecomputations. We first give a qualitative comparison of three main families of schemes;namely bit vector; prefix and interval based schemes. We then show that two labelingschemes are good candidates for an efficient implementation of label querying usingstandard relational DBMS; namely; the Dewey Prefix scheme [6] and an Interval scheme byAgrawal; Borgida and Jagadish [1].

Generating on the fly queries for the semantic web: The ics-forth graphical rql interface (grql),Nikos Athanasis; Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Kotzinos,Abstract Building user-friendly GUIs for browsing and filtering RDF/S description bases whileexploiting in a transparent way the expressiveness of declarative query/view languages isvital for various Semantic Web applications (eg; e-learning; e-science). In this paper wepresent a novel interface; called GRQL; which relies on the full power of the RDF/S datamodel for constructing on the fly queries expressed in RQL. More precisely; a user cannavigate graphically through the individual RDF/S class and property definitions andgenerate transparently the RQL path expressions required to access the resources ofinterest. These expressions capture accurately the meaning of its navigation steps throughthe class (or property) subsumption and/or associations.

Viewing the semantic web through RVL lenses,Aimilia Magkanaraki; Val Tannen; Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Plexousakis,Abstract Personalized access and content syndication involving diverse conceptualrepresentations of information resources are two of the key challenges of real-scaleSemantic Web (SW) applications; such as e-Commerce; e-Learning or e-Science portals.RDF/S represents nowadays the core SW language for creating and exchanging resourcedescriptions worldwide. Unfortunately; full-fledged view definition languages for the RDF/Sdata model are still missing. We propose RVL; a view definition language capable ofcreating not only virtual resource descriptions; but also virtual RDF/S schemas from (meta)classes; properties; as well as; resource descriptions available on the Semantic Web. RVLexploits the functional nature and type system of the RQL query language in order tonavigate; filter and restructure complex RDF/S schema and resource description graphs.,International Semantic Web Conference,2003,90
Benchmarking rdf schemas for the semantic web,Aimilia Magkanaraki; Sofia Alexaki; Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Plexousakis,Abstract Describing web resources using formal knowledge (ie; creating metadata accordingto a formal representation of a domain of discourse) is the essence of the next evolution stepof the Web; termed the Semantic Web. The W3C's RDF/S (Resource DescriptionFramework/Schema Language) enables the creation and exchange of resource metadataas normal web data. In this paper; we investigate the use of RDFS schemas as a means ofknowledge representation and exchange in diverse application domains. In order to reasonabout the quality of existing RDF schemas; a benchmark serves as the basis of a statisticalanalysis performed with the aid of VRP; the Validating RDF Parser.

Heuristics-based query optimisation for SPARQL,Petros Tsialiamanis; Lefteris Sidirourgos; Irini Fundulaki; Vassilis Christophides; Peter Boncz,Abstract Query optimization in RDF Stores is a challenging problem as SPARQL queriestypically contain many more joins than equivalent relational plans; and hence lead to a largejoin order search space. In such cases; cost-based query optimization often is not possible.One practical reason for this is that statistics typically are missing in web scale setting suchas the Linked Open Datasets (LOD). The more profound reason is that due to the absence ofschematic structure in RDF; join-hit ratio estimation requires complicated forms of correlatedjoin statistics; and currently there are no methods to identify the relevant correlationsbeforehand. For this reason; the use of good heuristics is essential in SPARQL queryoptimization; even in the case that are partially used with cost-based statistics (ie; hybridquery optimization). In this paper we describe a set of useful heuristics for SPARQL query …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,77
Containment and minimization of RDF/S query patterns,Giorgos Serfiotis; Ioanna Koffina; Vassilis Christophides; Val Tannen,Abstract Semantic query optimization (SQO) has been proved to be quite useful in variousapplications (eg; data integration; graphical query generators; caching; etc.) and has beenextensively studied for relational; deductive; object; and XML databases. However; lessattention to SQO has been devoted in the context of the Semantic Web. In this paper; wepresent sound and complete algorithms for the containment and minimization of RDF/Squery patterns. More precisely; we consider two widely used RDF/S query fragmentssupporting pattern matching at the data; but also; at the schema level. To this end; weadvocate a logic framework for capturing the RDF/S data model and semantics and weemploy well-established techniques proposed in the relational context; in particular; theChase and Backchase algorithms.,International Semantic Web Conference,2005,71
Semantic query routing and processing in P2P database systems: The ICS-FORTH SQPeer middleware,George Kokkinidis; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing is currently attracting enormous attention. In P2Psystems a very large number of autonomous computing nodes (the peers) pool togethertheir resources and rely on each other for data and services. More and more P2P datamanagement systems rely nowadays on intensional (ie schema) information for integratingand querying peer bases. Such information can be easily captured by emerging SemanticWeb languages such as RDF/S. However; a fully-fledged framework for evaluating semanticqueries over peer RDF/S bases (materialized or virtual) is missing. In this paper we presentthe ICS-FORTH SQPeer middleware for routing and processing RQL queries and RVLviews. The novelty of SQPeer lies on the use of intensional active schemas for determiningrelevant peer bases; as well as; constructing distributed query plans.

Moreover;our analysis revealed some emerging conceptual modeling practices of SW schemadevelopers:(1) each schema has a few focal classes that have been analyzed in detail (thatis; they have numerous properties and subclasses); which are further connected with focalclasses defined in other schemas;(2) class subsumption hierarchies are mostly unbalanced(that is; some branches are deep and heavy; while others are shallow and light);(3) mostproperties have as domain/range classes that are located high at the class subsumption …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,68
On the foundations of computing deltas between RDF models,Dimitris Zeginis; Yannis Tzitzikas; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract The ability to compute the differences that exist between two RDF models is animportant step to cope with the evolving nature of the Semantic Web (SW). In particular; RDFDeltas can be employed to reduce the amount of data that need to be exchanged andmanaged over the network and hence build advanced SW synchronization and versioningservices. By considering Deltas as sets of change operations; in this paper we study variousRDF comparison functions in conjunction with the semantics of the underlying changeoperations and formally analyze their possible combinations in terms of correctness;minimality; semantic identity and redundancy properties.,*,2007,68
On detecting high-level changes in RDF/S KBs,Vicky Papavassiliou; Giorgos Flouris; Irini Fundulaki; Dimitris Kotzinos; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract An increasing number of scientific communities rely on Semantic Web ontologies toshare and interpret data within and across research domains. These common knowledgerepresentation resources are usually developed and maintained manually and essentiallyco-evolve along with experimental evidence produced by scientists worldwide. Detectingautomatically the differences between (two) versions of the same ontology in order to storeor visualize their deltas is a challenging task for e-science. In this paper; we focus onlanguages allowing the formulation of concise and intuitive deltas; which are expressiveenough to describe unambiguously any possible change and that can be effectively andefficiently detected.

RUL: A declarative update language for RDF,Matoula Magiridou; Stavros Sahtouris; Vassilis Christophides; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We propose a declarative update language for RDF graphs which is based on theparadigms of query and view languages RQL and RVL. Our language; called RUL; ensuresthat the execution of the update primitives on nodes and arcs neither violates the semanticsof the RDF model nor the semantics of the given RDFS schema. In addition; RUL supportsfine-grained updates at the class and property instance level; set-oriented updates with adeterministic semantics and takes benefit of the full expressive power of RQL for restrictingthe range of variables to nodes and arcs of RDF graphs.,International Semantic Web Conference,2005,66
Coloring RDF triples to capture provenance,Giorgos Flouris; Irini Fundulaki; Panagiotis Pediaditis; Yannis Theoharis; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract Recently; the W3C Linking Open Data effort has boosted the publication and inter-linkage of large amounts of RDF datasets on the Semantic Web. Various ontologies andknowledge bases with millions of RDF triples from Wikipedia and other sources; mostly in e-science; have been created and are publicly available. Recording provenance informationof RDF triples aggregated from different heterogeneous sources is crucial in order toeffectively support trust mechanisms; digital rights and privacy policies. Managingprovenance becomes even more important when we consider not only explicitly stated butalso implicit triples (through RDFS inference rules) in conjunction with declarativelanguages for querying and updating RDF graphs.

The syntactic Web: Syntax and semantics on the Web,Jonathan Robie; Lars Marius Garshol; Steve Newcomb; M Fuchs; L Miller; D Brickley; V Christophides; G Karvounarakis,Abstract XQuery is a query language designed to allow queries across the many kinds ofinformation that are represented in XML. Although topic maps and RDF can also berepresented in XML; many have held that their many possible syntactic forms make themextremely difficult to query using an XML query language; and that they can only be queriedusing special-purpose query languages with built-in knowledge of their semantics; includingthe ability to exploit RDF schema information. This talk shows that XQuery can; in fact; beused to solve the kinds of queries for which RDF and topic map query languages weredesigned; though with a loss of type safety.,Markup Languages: Theory and Practice,2001,58
RQL: A functional query language for RDF,Gregory Karvounarakis; Aimilia Magkanaraki; Sophia Alexaki; Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Plexousakis; Michel Scholl; Karsten Tolle,Summary Although real-scale Semantic Web applications; such as Knowledge Portals andE-Marketplaces; require the management of voluminous resource metadata; sufficientlyexpressive declarative languages for metadata created according to the W3C RDF/Sstandard 1 are still missing. In answer to this need; we have designed a typed; functionalquery language; called RQL; whose novelty lies in its ability to smoothly combine schemaand data querying. The purpose of this chapter is to present RQL's formal data model andtype system and illustrate its expressiveness by means of exemplary queries. RQL's formalfoundations capture the RDF/S modeling primitives and provide a well-founded semanticsfor a declarative query language involving recursion and functional composition overcomplex description graphs.,*,2004,54
Beyond discrete e-services: Composing session-oriented services in telecommunications,Vassilis Christophides; Richard Hull; Gregory Karvounarakis; Akhil Kumar; Geliang Tong; Ming Xiong,Abstract We distinguish between two broad categories of e-services: discrete services (eg;add item to shopping cart; charge a credit card); and session-oriented ones (teleconference;collaborative text chat; streaming video; c-commerce interactions). Discrete services typicallyhave short duration; and cannot respond to external asynchronous events. Session-orientedservices have longer duration (perhaps hours); and typically can respond to asynchronousevents (eg; the ability to add a new participant to a teleconference). When composingdiscrete e-services it usually suffices to use a process model and engine that composes thee-services as relatively independent tasks. But when composing session-oriented e-services; the engine must be able to receive asynchronous events and determine how andwhether to impact the active sessions. For example; if a teleconference participant loses …,International Workshop on Technologies for E-Services,2001,49

The ResourceDescription Framework (RDF) aims at facilitating the creation and exchange of metadata; asdirected labeled graphs serialized in XML. In particular; the definition of schemavocabularies enables the interpretation of semistructured RDF descriptions usingtaxonomies of node and edge labels. In this paper; we propose (i) a formal model capturingRDF schema constructs;(ii) a declarative query language featuring generalized pathexpressions for taxonomies of labels (iii) a metadata management architecture for efficientstorage and querying of RDF descriptions and schemas.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2000,49

Previous work exploitsthis complementarity for building better document processors; browsers and editing tools;but not for building sophisticated querying mechanisms. Querying in hypertext has been arequirement since [19] and has already been elaborated in many hypertext systems; but hasnot yet been used for hypertext systems superimposed on an underlying hierarchical logicalstructure. In this paper we use the model and the SQL-like query language of [10] in order tomanage structured documents with hypertext links. The model represents a structureddocuments with hypertext links. The model represents a structured document with typedlinks as a complex object; and uses paths through the document structure; as first class …,Proceedings of the 1994 ACM European conference on Hypermedia technology,1994,48

A Formal Approach for RDF/S Ontology Evolution.,George Konstantinidis; Giorgos Flouris; Grigoris Antoniou; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract. In this paper; we consider the problem of ontology evolution in the face of a changeoperation. We devise a general-purpose algorithm for determining the effects and side-effects of a requested elementary or complex change operation. Our work is inspired bybelief revision principles (ie; validity; success and minimal change) and allows us to handleany change operation in a provably rational and consistent manner. To the best of ourknowledge; this is the first approach overcoming the limitations of existing solutions; whichdeal with each change operation on a per-case basis. Additionally; we rely on our generalchange handling algorithm to implement specialized versions of it; one per desired changeoperation; in order to compute the equivalent set of effects and side-effects. 2,ECAI,2008,46
High-level change detection in RDF (S) KBs,Vicky Papavasileiou; Giorgos Flouris; Irini Fundulaki; Dimitris Kotzinos; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract With the increasing use of Web 2.0 to create; disseminate; and consume largevolumes of data; more and more information is published and becomes available forpotential data consumers; that is; applications/services; individual users and communities;outside their production site. The most representative example of this trend is Linked OpenData (LOD); a set of interlinked data and knowledge bases. The main challenge in thiscontext is data governance within loosely coordinated organizations that are publishingadded-value interlinked data on the Web; bringing together issues related to datamanagement and data quality; in order to support the full lifecycle of data production;consumption; and management.

On provenance of queries on semantic web data,Yannis Theoharis; Irini Fundulaki; Grigoris Karvounarakis; Vassilis Christophides,Capturing trustworthiness; reputation; and reliability of Semantic Web data manipulated bySPARQL requires researchers to represent adequate provenance information; usuallymodeled as source data annotations and propagated to query results along with a queryevaluation. Alternatively; abstract provenance models can capture the relationship betweenquery results and source data by taking into account the employed query operators. Theauthors argue the benefits of the latter for settings in which query results are materialized inseveral repositories and analyzed by multiple users. They also investigate how relationalprovenance models can be leveraged for SPARQL queries; and advocate for newprovenance models.,IEEE Internet Computing,2011,44
On computing deltas of RDF/S knowledge bases,Dimitris Zeginis; Yannis Tzitzikas; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract The ability to compute the differences that exist between two RDF/S KnowledgeBases (KB) is an important step to cope with the evolving nature of the Semantic Web (SW).In particular; RDF/S deltas can be employed to reduce the amount of data that need to beexchanged and managed over the network in order to build SW synchronization andversioning services. By considering deltas as sets of change operations; in this article weintroduce various RDF/S differential functions which take into account inferred knowledgefrom an RDF/S knowledge base. We first study their correctness in transforming a source toa target RDF/S knowledge base in conjunction with the semantics of the employed changeoperations (ie; with or without side-effects on inferred knowledge). Then we formally analyzedesired properties of RDF/S deltas such as size minimality; semantic identity; redundancy …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2011,43
Algebraic structures for capturing the provenance of SPARQL queries,Floris Geerts; Thomas Unger; Grigoris Karvounarakis; Irini Fundulaki; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract The evaluation of SPARQL algebra queries on various kinds of annotated RDFgraphs can be seen as a particular case of the evaluation of these queries on RDF graphsannotated with elements of so-called spm-semirings. Spm-semirings extend semirings; usedfor representing the provenance of positive relational algebra queries on annotatedrelational data; with a new operator to capture the semantics of the non-monotone SPARQLoperators. Furthermore; spm-semiring-based annotations ensure that desired SPARQLquery equivalences hold when querying annotated RDF. In this work; in addition tointroducing spm-semirings; we study their properties and provide an alternativecharacterization of these structures in terms of semirings with an embedded booleanalgebra (or seba-structure for short). This characterization allows us to construct spm …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2016,40
Entity resolution in the web of data,Vassilis Christophides; Vasilis Efthymiou; Kostas Stefanidis,Abstract In recent years; several knowledge bases have been built to enable large-scaleknowledge sharing; but also an entity-centric Web search; mixing both structured data andtext querying. These knowledge bases offer machine-readable descriptions of real-worldentities; eg; persons; places; published on the Web as Linked Data.

Viewing the semantic web through RVL lenses,Aimilia Magkanaraki; Val Tannen; Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Plexousakis,Abstract Personalized access and content syndication involving diverse conceptualrepresentations of information resources are two of the key challenges of Semantic Web(SW) applications. In this paper; we investigate how these goals can be achieved using viewdefinition primitives over RDF/S bases. We introduce a full-fledged view definition language;RVL; for creating virtual RDF/S resource descriptions and schemas from (meta) classes;properties; and resource descriptions; and we illustrate how RVL views can be composedwith structured RDF/S queries expressed in a query language like RQL; by means of aninternal logical framework capturing the semantics of the RDF/S model; RQL queries andRVL views.,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2004,39
Workflow mediation using VorteXML.,Vassilis Christophides; Richard Hull; Akhil Kumar; Jerome Simeon,The Internet and Web are revolutionizing the way companies interact with their suppliers;partners; and clients; by enabling substantial automation of the full spectrum of theirbusiness activities. In the 21st century economy; the primary form of automation will be B2Be-commerce; in which enterprises interact with each other through entirely automatedmeans. As an example; consider an electronic market place in a vertical industry segment; inwhich suppliers and buyers tie into a common IT infrastructure to exchange goods andservices. This forms a supply chain in which buyers investigate possible suppliers;(b) checkthe terms and conditions under which suppliers can do business;(c) interoperate with thesuppliers' enterprise support systems; ie; workflows; and (d) monitor ordering/purchasing forpossible delays; unexpected events; react to such events; etc. This paper presents a new …,IEEE Data Eng.

Querying and splicing of XML workflows,Vassilis Christophides; Richard Hull; Akhil Kumar,Abstract In both industry and the research community it is now common to representworkflow schemas and enactments using XML. As a matter of fact; more and more enterpriseapplication integration platforms (eg; Excelon; Bea; iPlanet; etc.) are using XML to representworkflows within or across enterprise boundaries. In this paper we explore the ability ofmodern XML query languages (specifically; the W3C XML Algebra underlying theforthcoming XQuery) to query and manipulate workflow schemas and enactmentsrepresented as XML data. The paper focuses on a simple; yet expressive; model calledWorkflow Query Model (WQM) offering four primary constructs: sequence; choice; parallel;and loop. Then three classes of queries are considered against WQM workflows: simple (eg;to check the status of enactments); traversal (eg; to check the relationship between tasks …,International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems,2001,30
Querying Semistructured (Meta) data and Schemas on the Web: The case of RDF & RDFS,Greg Karvounarakis; Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Plexousakis,Abstract The need for descriptive information; ie; metadata; about Web resources has beenrecognized in several application contexts (eg; digital libraries; infomediaries; portals; etc.).The Resource Description Framework (RDF) aims at facilitating the creation and exchangeof metadata; as any other Web data.

Online curriculum on the semantic Web: the CSD-UoC portal for peer-to-peer e-learning,Dimitris Kotzinos; Sofia Pediaditaki; Apostolos Apostolidis; Nikolaos Athanasis; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract Online Curriculum Portals aim to support networks of instructors and learners byproviding a space of convergence for enhancing peer-to-peer learning interactions amongindividuals of an educational institution. To this end; effective; open and scalable e-learningsystems are required to acquire; store; and share knowledge under the form of learningobjects (LO). In this paper; we are interested in exploiting the semantic relationships thatcharacterize these LOs (eg; prerequisite; part-of or see-also) in order to capture and accessindividual and group knowledge in conjunction with the learning processes supported byeducational institutions. To achieve this functionality; Semantic Web (eg; RDF/s) anddeclarative query languages (eg; RQL) are employed to represent LOs and theirrelationships (eg; LOM); as well as; to support navigation at the conceptual e-learning …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,27
Ontology-driven integration of scientific repositories,Vassilis Christophides; Catherine Houstis; Spyros Lalis; Hariklia Tsalapata,Abstract There is an increasing need to provide scientists and researchers as well as policymakers and the general public with valueadded services integrating information spread overdistributed heterogeneous repositories. In order to incorporate available data sets andscientific programs into a powerful information and computational system it is mandatory toidentify and exploit their semantic relationship. For this purpose; we advocate an ontologicalframework that captures these relations and allows the inference of valid combinations ofscientific resources for the production of new data. We show how a knowledge base thatcommits to an ontology can be used to generate workflows on demand for the multiplicity ofresources known to the system. To validate our ideas; we are currently developing aprototype for the area of Coastal Zone Management.,International Workshop on Next Generation Information Technologies and Systems,1999,27
Query processing in RDF/S-based P2P database systems,George Kokkinidis; Lefteris Sidirourgos; Vassilis Christophides,Summary In Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems a very large number of autonomous computingnodes (the peers) pool together their resources and rely on each other for data and services.More and more P2P data management systems rely nowadays on intensional (ie; schema)information for integrating and querying peer bases. Such information can be easilycaptured by emerging Semantic Web languages such as RDF/S. In this chapter; we presentthe SQPeer middleware for processing RQL queries over peer RDF/S bases (materialized orvirtual); which are advertised using adequate RVL views. The novelty of SQPeer lies on theinterleaved execution of the query routing and planning phases using intensionaladvertisements of peer bases under the form of RDF/S schema fragments (ie; views). Moreprecisely; routing is responsible for discovering peer views relevant to a specific query …,*,2006,26
On Explicit Provenance Management in RDF/S Graphs.,Panagiotis Pediaditis; Giorgos Flouris; Irini Fundulaki; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract The notion of RDF Named Graphs has been proposed in order to assignprovenance information to data described using RDF triples. In this paper; we argue thatnamed graphs alone cannot capture provenance information in the presence of RDFSreasoning and updates. In order to address this problem; we introduce the notion of RDF/SGraphsets: a graphset is associated with a set of RDF named graphs and contain the triplesthat are jointly owned by the named graphs that constitute the graphset. We formalize thenotions of RDF named graphs and RDF/S graphsets and propose query and updatelanguages that can be used to handle provenance information for RDF/S graphs taking intoaccount RDFS semantics.,Workshop on the Theory and Practice of Provenance,2009,25
Characterizing web syndication behavior and content,Zeinab Hmedeh; Nelly Vouzoukidou; Nicolas Travers; Vassilis Christophides; Cedric Du Mouza; Michel Scholl,Abstract We are witnessing a widespread of web syndication technologies such as RSS orAtom for a timely delivery of frequently updated Web content. Almost every personal weblog;news portal; or discussion forum employs nowadays RSS/Atom feeds for enhancing pull-oriented searching and browsing of web pages with push-oriented protocols of web content.Social media applications such as Twitter or Facebook also employ RSS for notifying usersabout the newly available posts of their preferred friends. Unfortunately; previous works onRSS/Atom statistical characteristics do not provide a precise and updated characterization offeeds' behavior and content; characterization which can be used to successfully benchmarkeffectiveness and efficiency of various RSS processing/analysis techniques.

A semantic channel is actually a view of one or more Portal catalogs. offerspowerful primitives for filtering and restructuring available thematic topics and classifiedresources. A user can connect to a Portal infomediary in order to register; browse; or queryhis/her semantic channel.

Formal foundations for RDF/S KB evolution,Giorgos Flouris; George Konstantinidis; Grigoris Antoniou; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract There are ongoing efforts to provide declarative formalisms of integrity constraintsover RDF/S data. In this context; addressing the evolution of RDF/S knowledge bases whilerespecting associated constraints is a challenging issue; yet to receive a formal treatment.We provide a theoretical framework for dealing with both schema and data change requests.We define the notion of a rational change operator as one that satisfies the belief revisionprinciples of Success; Validity and Minimal Change. The semantics of such an operator aresubject to customization; by tuning the properties that a rational change should adhere to.We prove some interesting theoretical results and propose a general-purpose algorithm forimplementing rational change operators in knowledge bases with integrity constraints; whichallows us to handle uniformly any possible change request in a provably rational and …,Knowledge and information systems,2013,20

Ontology evolution: A framework and its application to rdf,George Konstantinidis; Giorgos Flouris; Grigoris Antoniou; Vassilis Christophides,ABSTRACT The algorithms dealing with the incorporation of new knowledge in an ontologyoften share a rather standard process of dealing with changes. This process consists of thedetermination of the allowed change operations; the identification of the inconsistencies thatcould be caused by each such operation as well as the various alternatives to deal witheach such inconsistency; and; finally; some (manual or automatic) selection mechanism thatallows the determination of the “best” of these alternatives. Unfortunately; most ontologyevolution algorithms implement these steps using a case-based; ad-hoc methodology;which is cumbersome and error-prone. In this paper we propose a general framework forontology change management that generalizes the methodology employed by existing tools.The introduction of this framework allows us to devise a whole class of ontology evolution …,Proceedings of the Joint ODBIS & SWDB Workshop on Semantic Web; Ontologies; Databases (SWDB-ODBIS-07),2007,16

However; the proliferation of distributed; interconnected linked data sourceson the Web poses significant new challenges for consistently managing the vast number ofpotentially large datasets and their interdependencies. In this article we focus on the keyproblem of preserving evolving structured interlinked data. We argue that a number ofissues; which hinder applications and users; are related to the temporal aspect that isintrinsic in Linked Data.

Subscription indexes for web syndication systems,Zeinab Hmedeh; Harris Kourdounakis; Vassilis Christophides; Cédric Du Mouza; Michel Scholl; Nicolas Travers,Abstract The explosion of published information on the Web leads to the emergence of aWeb syndication paradigm; which transforms the passive reader into an active informationcollector. Information consumers subscribe to RSS/Atom feeds and are notified whenever apiece of news (item) is published. The success of this Web syndication now offered on Websites; blogs; and social media; however raises scalability issues. There is a vital need forefficient real-time filtering methods across feeds; to allow users to follow effectivelypersonally interesting information.

The ICS-FORTH Semantic Web Integration Middleware (SWIM).,Vassilis Christophides; Gregory Karvounarakis; Aimilia Magkanaraki; Dimitris Plexousakis; Val Tannen,A cornerstone issue in the realization of the Semantic Web (SW) vision is the achievement ofsemantic interoperability among legacy data sources spread worldwide. In order to captureinformation semantics in a machine processable way; various ontology-based formalismshave been recently proposed (eg; RDF/S [20; 5]; DAML+ OIL [27]; OWL [10]). However; thevast majority of existing legacy data is not yet in RDF/S or any other SW language [23; 25].As a matter of fact; most of the data is physically stored in relational database (RDB) systemsand actually published on the Web or corporate intranets as virtual XML. SW applications;however; require to view data as virtual RDF; valid instance of a domain or applicationspecific RDF/S schema; and to be able to manipulate them with high-level query languages;such as RQL [18] or RVL [24].

Declarative repairing policies for curated KBs,Yannis Roussakis; Giorgos Flouris; Vassilis Christophides,ABSTRACT Curated ontologies and semantic annotations are increasingly being used in e-science to reflect the current terminology and conceptualization of scientific domains. Suchcurated Knowledge Bases (KBs) are usually backended by relational databases usingadequate schemas (generic or application/domain specific) and may satisfy a wide range ofintegrity constraints. As curated KBs continuously evolve; such constraints are often violatedand thus KBs need to be frequently repaired. Motivated by the fact that consistency is mostlyenforced manually by the scientists acting as curators; we propose a generic andpersonalized repairing framework for assisting them in this arduous task.

A service infrastructure for e-Science: the case of the ARION system,Catherine Houstis; Spyros Lalis; Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Plexousakis; Manolis Vavalis; Marios Pitikakis; Antonis Smardas,Abstract The ARION system provides basic e-services of search and retrieval of objects inscientific collections; such as; data sets; simulation models and tools necessary for statisticaland/or visualization processing. These collections may represent application software ofscientific areas; they reside in geographically disperse organizations and constitute thesystem content. The user; as part of the retrieval mechanism; may dynamically invoke on-line computations of scientific data sets when the latter are not found into the system. Thus;ARION provides the basic infrastructure for accessing and producing scientific information inan open; distributed and federated system. More advanced e-services; which depend on thescientific content of the system; can be built upon this infrastructure; such as decision makingand/or policy support using various information brokering techniques.,International Workshop on Web Services; E-Business; and the Semantic Web,2002,13

Querying with preferences in a digital library,Nicolas Spyratos; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract We consider a collection of federated sources on the Web; and a community ofusers who are interested in documents residing in one or more of those federated sources.The search for documents of interest is supported by a mediator that we call a digital library.The library simply indexes all documents that are made available to users by the federatedsources. When a user addresses a query to the library; the library returns the URLs ofdocuments satisfying the query. In such a context; one of the factors influencing usersatisfaction is the size of the answer set; in particular when it is too small (few or nodocuments) or too large (several hundreds or thousands of documents).

Indexing views to route queries in a PDMS,Lefteris Sidirourgos; George Kokkinidis; Theodore Dalamagas; Vassilis Christophides; Timos Sellis,Abstract P2P computing gains increasing attention lately; since it provides the means forrealizing computing systems that scale to very large numbers of participating peers; whileensuring high autonomy and fault-tolerance. Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) havebeen proposed to support sophisticated facilities in exchanging; querying and integrating(semi-) structured data hosted by peers. In this paper; we are interested in routing graphqueries in a very large PDMS; where peers advertise their local bases using fragments ofcommunity RDF/S schemes (ie; views). We introduce an original encoding for thesefragments; in order to efficiently check whether a peer view is subsumed by a query. We relyon this encoding to design an RDF/S view lookup service featuring a statefull and a statelessexecution over a DHT-based P2P infrastructure.

Big data entity resolution: From highly to somehow similar entity descriptions in the Web,Vasilis Efthymiou; Kostas Stefanidis; Vassilis Christophides,In the Web of data; entities are described by interlinked data rather than documents on theWeb. In this work; we focus on entity resolution in the Web of data; ie; identifying descriptionsthat refer to the same real-world entity. To reduce the required number of pairwisecomparisons; methods for entity resolution perform blocking as a pre-processing step. Ablocking technique places similar entity descriptions into blocks and executes comparisonsonly between descriptions within the same block. We experimentally evaluate blockingtechniques proposed for the Web of data and present dataset characteristics that determinethe effectiveness and efficiency of such methods. Furthermore; we analyze thecharacteristics of the missed matching entity descriptions and examine different types oflinks that blocking techniques can potentially identify.,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,10

PoweRGen: A power-law based generator of RDFS schemas,Yannis Theoharis; George Georgakopoulos; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract As the amount of RDF datasets available on the Web has grown significantly overthe last years; scalability and performance of Semantic Web (SW) systems are gainingimportance. Current RDF benchmarking efforts either consider schema-less RDF datasets orrely on fixed RDFS schemas. In this paper; we present the first RDFS schema generator;termed PoweRGen; which takes into account the features exhibited by real SW schemas. Itconsiders the power-law functions involved in (a) the combined in-and out-degreedistribution of the property graph (which captures the domains and ranges of the propertiesdefined in a schema) and (b) the out-degree distribution of the transitive closure (TC) of thesubsumption graph (which essentially captures the class hierarchy). The synthetic schemasgenerated by PoweRGen respect the power-law functions given as input with an …,Information Systems,2012,6

Semantics and Pragmatics of Preference Queries in Digital Libraries,N Spyratos; V Christophides; P Georgiadis; M Nguer,Abstract. As information becomes available in increasing amounts; and to growing numbersof users; the shift towards a more user-centered; or personalized access to informationbecomes crucial. In this paper we consider the semantics and pragmatics of preferencequeries over tables containing information objects described through a set of attributes. Inparticular; we address two basic issues:–how to define a preference query and its answer(semantics)–how to evaluate a preference query (pragmatics) With respect to existing work;our main contributions are (a) the proposal of an expressive language for declaringqualitative preferences;(b) a unified framework for expressing and evaluating bothquantitative and qualitative preference queries and (c) rewriting algorithms for processingsuch queries. Although our main motivation originates in digital libraries; our proposal is …,Knowledge Media Science Workshop; October,2006,6

A self e-learning network consists of web-based learningobjects that have been made available to the network by its users; along with metadatadescriptions of these learning objects and of the network's users. The architecture of thenetwork is distributed and service-oriented. The personalisation facilities include: queryinglearning object descriptions to return results tailored towards users' individual goals andpreferences; the ability to define views over the learning object metadata; facilities fordefining new composite learning objects; and facilities for subscribing to personalised eventand change notification services.,1st International ELeGI Conference on Advanced Technology for Enhanced Learning,2005,6
A semantic network approach to semi-structured documents repositories,Vassilis Christophides; Martin Dörr; Irene Fundulaki,Abstract Using database technology for the administration of digital libraries offers manyadvantages in a multi-user and distributed environment. However; conventional DBMS arenot particularly suited to manage semi-structured data with heterogeneous; irregular;evolving structures as in the case of SGML documents found in digital libraries. To overcomethe difficulties imposed by the rigid schema of conventional systems; several schema-lessapproaches have been proposed. Using instead unconstrained; extensible schemataoffered by object-oriented semantic network systems; we are able both to map documentspecific structures as database classes; and to model the associated constraint informationas integrated schema annotations. In this paper we present the benefits of this approach tocreate; access and process heterogeneous SGML documents; and in particular to exploit …,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,1997,6
HyperPATH/O2: Integrating hypermedia systems with object-oriented database systems,Bernd Amann; Vassilis Christophides; Michel Scholl,Abstract We describe an integration of the hypermedia system Hyper PATH with the object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS) O 2. Providing persistence to a hypertext system was the firstmotivation of this work. More generally; we were interested in a better understanding of theconnection of hypertext systems with OODBMS. One of our goals was to define an abstractinterface between HyperPATH and a variety of OODBMS's. The solution adopted shows thatopening HyperPATH to different OODBMS's is not possible without major rewriting ofexisting C++ code.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1993,6
Characterizing home device usage from wireless traffic time series,Katsiaryna Mirylenka; Vassilis Christophides; Themis Palpanas; Ioannis Pefkianakis; Martin May,The analysis of temporal behavioral patterns of home network users can reveal importantinformation to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and help them to optimize their networks andoffer new services (eg; remote software upgrades; troubleshooting; energy savings). Thisstudy uses time series analysis of continuous traffic data from wireless home networks; toextract traffic patterns recurring within; or across homes; and assess the impact of differentdevice types (fixed or portable) on home traffic. Traditional techniques for time seriesanalysis are not suited in this respect; due to the limited stationary and evolving distributionproperties of wireless home traffic data. We propose a novel framework that relies on acorrelation-based similarity measure of time series; as well as a notion of strong stationarityto define motifs and dominant devices.

Extensive work on similar applications forrelational data and queries has shown that data provenance can be used in order tocompute trustworthiness; reputation and reliability of query results; based on the source dataand query operators involved in their derivation. In particular; abstract provenance modelscan be employed to record information about source data and query operators during queryevaluation; and later be used eg; to assess trust for individual query results. In this paper; weinvestigate the extent to which relational provenance models can be leveraged for capturingthe provenance of SPARQL queries over linked data; and identify their limitations.

The objective of interoperability is to share digital library sources andservices. Interoperability occurs at different levels of abstraction. We identify these levels fora digital library environment; and we point out open questions corresponding to the differentlevels. Referring to this perspective as' vertical view'; we also come up with a'horizontalview'; which essentially is a reference architecture for digital libraries. We have classified thevarious research issues related to digital libraries; namely; the information model to be usedfor the global interoperability layer; aspects of coordination and control of the underlyingdata sources; transparent distributed information access; and appropriate implementationmechanisms; in terms of this reference architecture.,road map report from the DELOS project,1998,5

Benchmarking blocking algorithms for web entities,Vasilis Efthymiou; Kostas Stefanidis; Vassilis Christophides,An increasing number of entities are described by interlinked data rather than documents onthe Web. Entity Resolution (ER) aims to identify descriptions of the same real-world entitywithin one or across knowledge bases in the Web of data. To reduce the required number ofpairwise comparisons among descriptions; ER methods typically perform a pre-processingstep; called blocking; which places similar entity descriptions into blocks and thus onlycompare descriptions within the same block. We experimentally evaluate several blockingmethods proposed for the Web of data using real datasets; whose characteristicssignificantly impact their effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed experimental evaluationframework allows us to better understand the characteristics of the missed matching entitydescriptions and contrast them with ground truth obtained from different kinds of …,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,2016,4

Report on the first international workshop on Database Preservation (PresDB'07),Vassilis Christophides; Peter Buneman,Abstract The need to preserve scientific; scholarly and cultural data has long beenrecognized. These data sets are valuable and many of them are either impossible toreproduce (eg climate and demographic data) or can only be recovered at enormous costs(eg data from high energy physics experiments). While substantial investment has beenmade in archiving and preserving conventional forms of these objects; such as documents;images and numerical data in some file format; the need to preserve entire databases hasonly recently emerged. Databases differ from fixed digital objects studied in the past; in thatthey change over time; they have internal structure; and they include schemas and integrityconstraints; which are basic for the current and future interpretation of the data. Increasingly;database technology is being used in the storage of large numerical scientific data sets.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2007,4

This paper investigates the peer-to-peer (P2P) resource-sharing paradigm forhighly distributed Digital Libraries (DL). The objective is to support decentralized sharing ofdata and services in a network of autonomous and heterogeneous DL nodes. P2P DLs canoperate without a central coordination and offer important advantages such as a verydynamic environment where peers can join and leave the network at any time; while thenetwork can scale up to a large number of peers. The advanced structuring and retrievalfunctionality of peers poses new challenges in query routing and processing overautonomous; distributed and dynamic networks of DL.

On Z39. 50 wrapping and description logics,Yannis Velegrakis; Vassilis Christophides; Panos Constantopoulos,Abstract. Z39. 50 is a client/server protocol widely used in digital libraries and museums forsearching and retrieving information spread over a number of heterogeneous sources. Toovercome semantic and schematic discrepancies among the various data sources theprotocol relies on a world view of information as a flat list of fields; called Access Points (AP).One of the major issues for building Z39. 50 wrappers is to map this unstructured list of APsto the underlying source data structure and semantics. For highly structured sources (eg;database management systems; knowledge base systems) this mapping is quite complexand considerably affects the quality of the retrieved data. Unfortunately; existing Z39. 50wrappers have been developed from scratch and they do not provide high-level mappinglanguages with verifiable properties.

of Proceedings: Advances in Database Technology-EDBT 2006: 10th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,Abstract/Description: Relevance Feedback is an important way to enhance retrieval qualityby integrating relevance information provided by a user. In XML retrieval; feedback enginesusually generate an expanded query from the content of elements marked as relevant ornonrelevant. This approach that is inspired by text-based IR completely ignores thesemistructured nature of XML. This paper makes the important step from content-based tostructural feedback. It presents an integrated solution for expanding keyword queries withnew content; path; and document constraints. An extensible framework evaluates suchquery conditions with existing keyword-based XML search engines while allowing to easilyintegrate new dimensions of feedback. Extensive experiments with the established INEXbenchmark show the feasibility of our approach.,*,2006,3

In this paper; we adopt aquery-based approach to drift detection. Our approach relies on a drift index; a structure thatcaptures drift at different time granularities and enables flexible drift queries. We formalizedifferent drift queries that represent real-world scenarios and develop query evaluationalgorithms that use different materializations of the drift index as well as strategies for onlineindex maintenance.

Inorder to identify and link meaningful and relevant information; clustering algorithms havebeen used to partition the user generated content. We have identified though that thesealgorithms exhibit various shortcomings when they have to deal with social media textualinformation; which is dynamic and streaming in nature. Thus we explore the idea to estimatethe algorithms' parameters based on observations on the clusters' properties'(like thecentroid; shape and density) evolution. By experimenting with the clusters' properties; wepropose a methodological framework that detects the evolution of the clusters' centroid;shape and density and explores their role in parameters' estimation.,International Workshop on Information Search; Integration; and Personalization,2012,2

WP2 deliverable 2.1: E-learning standards,Miltos Stratakis; Vassilis Christophides; Kevin Keenoy; Aimilia Magkanaraki,Abstract Learning objects are increasingly seen as key to a technology-based revolution ineducation and training; even to an emerging global knowledge economy. An internationaleffort is underway to formulate standards that will enable Learning Object (LO) reuse andexchange among multiple educational settings; instructors; courses and institutions. Thescope of this deliverable is to appropriately define the notion of learning content available oncorporate networks or the Internet; as well as; to provide the core information modelingconstructs of e-Learning applications. Hence; we survey several e-Learning standards andconsider the feasibility of expressing them using Semantic Web languages; like RDF/S. Weconclude our deliverable with the most important pedagogical limitations of existingstandards; which are crucial for deploying a full-fledged Self e-Learning Network.,*,2003,1

Simplifying Entity Resolution on Web Data with Schema-agnostic; Non-iterative Matching,Vasilis Efthymiou; George Papadakis; Kostas Stefanidis; Vassilis Christophides,Entity Resolution (ER) aims to identify different descriptions in various Knowledge Bases(KBs) that refer to the same entity. ER is challenged by the Variety; Volume and Veracity ofdescriptions published in the Web of Data. To address them; we propose the MinoanERframework that fulfills full automation and support of highly heterogeneous entities.MinoanER leverages a token-based similarity of entities to define a new metric that derivesthe similarity of neighboring entities from the most important relations; indicated only bystatistics. For high efficiency; similarities are computed from a set of schema-agnostic blocksand processed in a non-iterative way that involves four threshold-free heuristics. Wedemonstrate that the effectiveness of MinoanER is comparable to existing ER tools over realKBs exhibiting low heterogeneity in terms of entity types and content.

Totackle the challenges of Big Data FS PFBP partitions the data matrix both in terms of rows(samples; training examples) as well as columns (features). By employing the concepts of $p $-values of conditional independence tests and meta-analysis techniques PFBP managesto rely only on computations local to a partition while minimizing communication costs. Then;it employs powerful and safe (asymptotically sound) heuristics to make early; approximatedecisions; such as Early Dropping of features from consideration in subsequent iterations;Early Stopping of consideration of features within the same iteration; or Early Return of thewinner in each iteration.

Although real-scale Semantic Web applications; such as Knowledge Portals andE-Marketplaces; require the management of voluminous resource metadata; sufficientlyexpressive declarative languages for metadata created according to the W3C RDF/Sstandard" are still missing. In an-swer to this need; we have designed a typed; functionalquery language; called RQL; whose novelty lies in its ability to smoothly combine schemaand data querying. The purpose of this chapter is to present RQL's formal data model andtype system and illustrate its expressiveness by means of exemplary queries. RQL's formalfoundations capture the RDF/S model-ing primitives and provide a well-founded semanticsfor a declarative query language involving recursion and functional composition overcomplex description graphs.,The Functional Approach to Data Management: Modeling; Analyzing and Integrating Heterogeneous Data,2013,*

RoSeS is basedon a data-centric approach; using a combination of standard database concepts likedeclarative query languages; views and multi-query optimization. Users create personalizedfeeds by defining and composing content-based filtering and aggregation queries oncollections of RSS feeds. Publishing these queries corresponds to defining views which canthen be used for building new queries/feeds. This naturally reflects the publish-subscribenature of RSS applications.

The RQL v1. 5 Technical Specification,Grigoris Karvounarakis; Vassilis Christophides; Dimitris Plexousakis,RQL is a functional language for processing RDF resource descriptions and schemas: it isdefined by a set of basic queries (first order functions) and iterators (second order functions)which can be used to build new ones through functional composition. It relies on the designof the ODMG OQL Query Interpreter 3]. RQL queries are represented internally using asemantic representation with the following characteristics:,*,2002,*

Querying Documents in Object Databases* Serge Abiteboul1**; Sophie Cluet1; Vassilis Christophides1; Tova Milo2; Guido Moerkotte3; and J er ome Sim eon1 1 IN...,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Vassilis Christophides; Tova Milo; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract. We consider the problem of storing and accessing documents (SGML and HTML;in particular) using database technology. To specify the database image of documents; weuse structuring schemas that consist in grammars annotated with database programs. Toquery documents; we introduce an extension of OQL; the ODMG standard query languagefor object databases. Our extension (named OQL-doc) allows to query documents without aprecise knowledge of their structure using in particular generalized path expressions andpattern matching. This allows us to introduce in a declarative language (in the style of SQLor OQL); navigational and information retrieval styles of accessing data. Query processing inthe context of documents and path expressions leads to challenging implementation issues.We extend an object algebra with new operators to deal with generalized path …,*,1996,*

A Services Framework for Using Social Web as Social Sensor Web,D Kotzinos; S Kleisarxaki; L Theodoridou; V Christophides; N Petalidis; G Kariotis,Abstract—Online social networking sites carry a lot of information organized around thepeople who actually submit it. They rely a lot on the interconnections between the actors ofthe network and they relate the generated information in terms of connections or ties amongthose actors. On the other hand; social networks carry a lot of information in real time oralmost real time since people “report” information as they see it unfolding before their eyes.We are targeting this information and we try to understand when this information can berelated to refer to a single event; which has both a spatial and a temporal dimension. Thesesocial sensors can alert us on what is happening in the society when it happens and byaggregating the different reports from people who are on the scene. In order to achieve thatwe suggest and describe a set of services that can be used for collection of the …,*,*,*

This deliverable studies the problem of provenancemanagement under different settings; and theoretically evaluates the use of abstract modelsfor this purpose; with emphasis in the case of dynamic datasets which support inference (asis the case with RDFS datasets). Additionally; abstract models are applied to study theproblem of representing the provenance that is needed for annotating the results of SPARQLqueries; as well as for determining the provenance of triples that were added to the datasetduring SPARQL Update operations.,*,*,*

Preference-Based Queries for Course Sequencing,Periklis Georgiadis; Vassilis Christophides; Nicolas Spyratos,Higher education curricula are characterized nowadays by their continuous evolution aswell as by the mobility of students across them. Consequently; students are striving forsupport in choosing an appropriate course sequence that leads to a set of desired skills.Here; by “skill” we mean the ability (usually learned) to perform actions. In this paper we areinterested in providing a student with a course sequence that (a) leads to the acquisition ofthe desired skills and (b) respects preferences expressed by the student as well as possibleinstitutional restrictions (eg prerequisites). In the context of our work; a skill describes thedistinct effects of a course on the cognitive and technical level of the student. A skill can beeither atomic or compound. An atomic skill is acquired by following a single course; althougha single course might lead to one or more atomic skills. A compound skill is a combination …,*,*,*
On Provenance of Queries on Linked Web Data,Yannis Theoharis; Irini Fundulaki; Grigoris Karvounarakis; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract Assessing the quality of information published on the Web according to the LinkedData paradigm emerges as a crucial need of various applications. Capturingtrustworthiness; reputation and reliability of Linked Web Data manipulated by SPARQL;requires representing adequate provenance information to capture the relationship betweenquery results and the source data. This relationship can either be materialized along with thequery result or lost after the query evaluation. In the former case; query result provenanceconsists of abstract expressions on provenance tokens that uniquely identify source dataitems; while in the latter; it consists of annotations that are computed based on source dataannotations along with query evaluation. We argue about the benefits of the former; forsettings in which the query results are materialized in several repositories and analyzed …,*,*,*

An increasing number of scientific communities rely on Semantic Web ontologies toshare and interpret data within and across research domains. These common knowledgerepresentation resources are usually developed and maintained manually and essentiallyco-evolve along with experimental evidence produced by scientists worldwide. Detectingautomatically the differences between (two) versions of the same ontology in order to storeor visualize their deltas is a challenging task for e-science. In this paper; we focus onlanguages allowing the formulation of concise and intuitive deltas; which are expressiveenough to describe unambiguously any possible change and that can be effectively andefficiently detected.
