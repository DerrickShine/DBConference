Understanding replication in databases and distributed systems,Matthias Wiesmann; Fernando Pedone; André Schiper; Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Replication is an area of interest to both distributed systems and databases. The solutionsdeveloped from these two perspectives are conceptually similar but differ in many aspects:model; assumptions; mechanisms; guarantees provided; and implementation. In this paper;we provide an abstract and" neutral" framework to compare replication techniques from bothcommunities. The framework has been designed to emphasize the role played by differentmechanisms and to facilitate comparisons. The paper describes the replication techniquesused in both communities; compares them; and points out ways in which they can beintegrated to arrive to better; more robust replication protocols.,Distributed Computing Systems; 2000.

Don't be lazy; be consistent: Postgres-r; a new way to implement database replication,Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Database designers often point out that eager; update everywhere replication suers from high deadlock rates; message overhead and poor response times. In this paper; weshow that these limitations can be circumvented by using a combination of known and noveltechniques. Moreover; we show how the proposed solution can be incorporated into a realdatabase system. The paper discusses the new protocols and their implementation inPostgreSQL. It also provides experimental results proving that many of the dangers andlimitations of replication can be avoided by using the appropriate techniques.,VLDB,2000,371
A new approach to developing and implementing eager database replication protocols,Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Database replication is traditionally seen as a way to increase the availability andperformance of distributed databases. Although a large number of protocols providing dataconsistency and fault-tolerance have been proposed; few of these ideas have ever beenused in commercial products due to their complexity and performance implications. Instead;current products allow inconsistencies and often resort to centralized approaches whicheliminates some of the advantages of replication. As an alternative; we propose a suite ofreplication protocols that addresses the main problems related to database replication. Onthe one hand; our protocols maintain data consistency and the same transactionalsemantics found in centralized systems. On the other hand; they provide flexibility andreasonable performance. To do so; our protocols take advantage of the rich semantics of …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2000,329
Middleware based data replication providing snapshot isolation,Yi Lin; Bettina Kemme; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris,Abstract Many cluster based replication solutions have been proposed providing scalabilityand fault-tolerance. Many of these solutions perform replica control in a middleware on topof the database replicas. In such a setting concurrency control is a challenge and is oftenperformed on a table basis. Additionally; some systems put severe requirements ontransaction programs (eg; to declare all objects to be accessed in advance). This paperaddresses these issues and presents a middleware-based replication scheme whichprovides the popular snapshot isolation level at the same tuple-level granularity as databasesystems like PostgreSQL and Oracle; without any need to declare transaction properties inadvance. Both read-only and update transactions can be executed at any replica whileproviding data consistency at all times. Our approach provides what we call" 1-copy …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,304
Database replication techniques: A three parameter classification,Matthias Wiesmann; Fernando Pedone; André Schiper; Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Data replication is an increasingly important topic as databases are more and moredeployed over clusters of workstations. One of the challenges in database replication is tointroduce replication without severely affecting performance. Because of this difficulty;current database products use lazy replication; which is very efficient but can compromiseconsistency. As an alternative; eager replication guarantees consistency but most existingprotocols have a prohibitive cost. In order to clarify the current state of the art and open upnew avenues for research; this paper analyses existing eager techniques using three keyparameters (server architecture; server interaction and transaction termination). In ouranalysis; we distinguish eight classes of eager replication protocols and; for each category;discuss its requirements; capabilities and cost. The contribution lies in showing when …,Reliable Distributed Systems; 2000. SRDS-2000. Proceedings The 19th IEEE Symposium on,2000,273
MIDDLE-R: Consistent database replication at the middleware level,Marta Patiño-Martinez; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract The widespread use of clusters and Web farms has increased the importance ofdata replication. In this article; we show how to implement consistent and scalable datareplication at the middleware level. We do this by combining transactional concurrencycontrol with group communication primitives. The article presents different replicationprotocols; argues their correctness; describes their implementation as part of a genericmiddleware; Middle-R; and proves their feasibility with an extensive performance evaluation.The solution proposed is well suited for a variety of applications including Web farms anddistributed object platforms.,ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS),2005,223
A suite of database replication protocols based on group communication primitives,Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,This paper proposes a family of replication protocols based on group communication inorder to address some of the concerns expressed by database designers regarding existingreplication solutions. Due to these concerns; current database systems allowinconsistencies and often resort to centralized approaches; thereby reducing some of thekey advantages provided by replication. The protocols presented in this paper takeadvantage of the semantics of group communication and use related isolation guarantees toeliminate the possibility of deadlocks; reduce the message overhead; and increaseperformance. A simulation study shows the feasibility of the approach and the flexibility withwhich different types of bottlenecks can be circumvented.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1998.

Postgres-R (SI): Combining replica control with concurrency control based on snapshot isolation,Shuqing Wu; Bettina Kemme,Replicating data over a cluster of workstations is a powerful tool to increase performance;and provide fault-tolerance for demanding database applications. The big challenge in suchsystems is to combine replica control (keeping the copies consistent) with concurrencycontrol. Most of the research so far has focused on providing the traditional correctnesscriteria serializability. However; more and more database systems; eg; Oracle andPostgreSQL; use multi-version concurrency control providing the isolation level snapshotisolation. In this paper; we present Postgres-R (SI); an extension of PostgreSQL offeringtransparent replication. Our replication tool is designed to work smoothly with PostgreSQL'sconcurrency control providing snapshot isolation for the entire replicated system. We presenta detailed description of the replica control algorithm; and how it is combined with …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,178
Are quorums an alternative for data replication?,Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Gustavo Alonso; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Data replication is playing an increasingly important role in the design of parallelinformation systems. In particular; the widespread use of cluster architectures often requiresto replicate data for performance and availability reasons. However; maintaining theconsistency of the different replicas is known to cause severe scalability problems. Toaddress this limitation; quorums are often suggested as a way to reduce the overalloverhead of replication. In this article; we analyze several quorum types in order to betterunderstand their behavior in practice. The results obtained challenge many of theassumptions behind quorum based replication. Our evaluation indicates that theconventional read-one/write-all-available approach is the best choice for a large range ofapplications requiring data replication. We believe this is an important result for anybody …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2003,157
Scalable replication in database clusters,Marta Patiño-Martínez; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract In this paper; we explore data replication pro-tocols that pro-vide both faulttolerance and good performance without compromising consistency. We do this bycombining transactional concurrency control with group communication primitives. In ourapproach; transactions are executed at only one site so that not all nodes incur in theoverhead of producing results. To further reduce latency; we use an optimistic multicasttechnique that overlaps transaction execution with total order message delivery. Theprotocols we present in the paper provide correct executions while minimizing overhead andproviding higher scalability.,International Symposium on Distributed Computing,2000,137
Online reconfiguration in replicated databases based on group communication,Bettina Kemme; Alberto Bartoli; Ozalp Babaoglu,Over the last years; many replica control protocols have been developed that takeadvantage of the ordering and reliability semantics of group communication primitives tosimplify database system design and to improve performance. Although current solutionsare able to mask site failures effectively; many of them are unable to cope with recovery offailed sites; merging of partitions; or joining of new sites. This paper addresses this importantissue. It proposes efficient solutions for online system reconfiguration providing new siteswith a current state of the database without interrupting transaction processing in the rest ofthe system. Furthermore; the paper analyzes the impact of cascading reconfigurations; andargues that they call be handled in an elegant way by extended forms of groupcommunication.,Dependable Systems and Networks; 2001.

Using optimistic atomic broadcast in transaction processing systems,Bettina Kemme; Fernando Pedone; Gustavo Alonso; André Schiper; Matthias Wiesmann,Atomic broadcast primitives are often proposed as a mechanism to allow fault-tolerantcooperation between sites in a distributed system. Unfortunately; the delay incurred before amessage can be delivered makes it difficult to implement high performance; scalableapplications on top of atomic broadcast primitives. Recently; a new approach has beenproposed for atomic broadcast which; based on optimistic assumptions about thecommunication system; reduces the average delay for message delivery to the application.We develop this idea further and show how applications can take even more advantage ofthe optimistic assumption by overlapping the coordination phase of the atomic broadcastalgorithm with the processing of delivered messages. In particular; we present a replicateddatabase architecture that employs the new atomic broadcast primitive in such a way that …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,120
Improving the scalability of fault-tolerant database clusters,Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Replication has become a central element in modem information systems playing a dualrole: increase availability and enhance scalability. Unfortunately; most existing protocolsincrease availability at the cost of scalability; This paper presents architecture;implementation and performance of a middleware based replication tool that provides bothavailability and better scalability than existing systems. Main characteristics are the usage ofspecialized broadcast primitives and efficient data propagation.,Distributed Computing Systems; 2002. Proceedings. 22nd International Conference on,2002,119

Boosting database replication scalability through partial replication and 1-copy-snapshot-isolation,Damián Serrano; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Bettina Kemme,Databases have become a crucial component in modern information systems. At the sametime; they have become the main bottleneck in most systems. Database replication protocolshave been proposed to solve the scalability problem by scaling out in a cluster of sites.Current techniques have attained some degree of scalability; however there are two mainlimitations to existing approaches. Firstly; most solutions adopt a full replication model whereall sites store a full copy of the database. The coordination overhead imposed by keeping allreplicas consistent allows such approaches to achieve only medium scalability. Secondly;most replication protocols rely on the traditional consistency criterion; 1-copy-serializability;which limits concurrency; and thus scalability of the system. In this paper; we first analyzeanalytically the performance gains that can be achieved by various partial replication …,Dependable Computing; 2007.

Peer-to-peer architectures for massively multiplayer online games: A survey,Amir Yahyavi; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Scalability; fast response time; and low cost are of utmost importance in designing asuccessful massively multiplayer online game. The underlying architecture plays animportant role in meeting these conditions. Peer-to-peer architectures; due to theirdistributed and collaborative nature; have low infrastructure costs and can achieve highscalability. They can also achieve fast response times by creating direct connectionsbetween players. However; these architectures face many challenges. Distributing a gameamong peers makes maintaining control over the game more complex. Peer-to-peerarchitectures also tend to be vulnerable to churn and cheating. Moreover; different genres ofgames have different requirements that should be met by the underlying architecture;rendering the task of designing a general-purpose architecture harder.

Adaptive middleware for data replication,Jesús M Milan-Franco; Ricardo Jimenez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Dynamically adaptive systems sense their environment and adjust themselves toaccommodate to changes in order to maximize performance. Depending on the type ofchange (eg; modifications of the load; the type of workload; the available resources; theclient distribution; etc.); different adjustments have to be made. Coordinating them is alreadydifficult in a centralized system. Doing so in the currently prevalent component-baseddistributed systems is even more challenging. In this paper; we present an adaptivedistributed middleware for data replication that is able to adjust to changes in the amount ofload submitted to the different replicas and to the type of workload submitted. Its novelty liesin combining load-balancing techniques with feedback driven adjustments ofmultiprogramming levels (number of transactions that are allowed to execute concurrently …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2004,83
Snapshot isolation and integrity constraints in replicated databases,Yi Lin; Bettina Kemme; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; José Enrique Armendáriz-Iñigo,Abstract Database replication is widely used for fault tolerance and performance. However; itrequires replica control to keep data copies consistent despite updates. The traditionalcorrectness criterion for the concurrent execution of transactions in a replicated database is1-copy-serializability. It is based on serializability; the strongest isolation level in anonreplicated system. In recent years; however; Snapshot Isolation (SI); a slightly weakerisolation level; has become popular in commercial database systems. There exist alreadyseveral replica control protocols that provide SI in a replicated system. However; most of thecorrectness reasoning for these protocols has been rather informal. Additionally; most of thework so far ignores the issue of integrity constraints. In this article; we provide a formaldefinition of 1-copy-SI using and extending a well-established definition of SI in a …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,76
Flower-CDN: a hybrid P2P overlay for efficient query processing in CDN,Manal El Dick; Esther Pacitti; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Many websites with a large user base; eg; websites of nonprofit organizations; donot have the financial means to install large web-servers or use specialized contentdistribution networks such as Akamai. For those websites; we have developed Flower-CDN;a locality-aware P2P based content-distribution network (CDN) in which the users that areinterested in a website support the distribution of its content. The idea is that peers keep thecontent they retrieve and later serve it to other peers that are close to them in locality. Ourarchitecture is a hybrid between structured and unstructured networks. When a new clientrequests some content from a website; a locality-aware DHT quickly finds a peer in itsneighborhood that has the content available. Additionally; all peers in a given locality thatmaintain content of a particular website build an unstructured content overlay.

Database replication,Bettina Kemme; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez,Abstract Database replication is widely used for fault-tolerance; scalability and performance.The failure of one database replica does not stop the system from working as availablereplicas can take over the tasks of the failed replica. Scalability can be achieved bydistributing the load across all replicas; and adding new replicas should the load increase.Finally; database replication can provide fast local access; even if clients are geographicallydistributed clients; if data copies are located close to clients. Despite its advantages;replication is not a straightforward technique to apply; and there are many hurdles toovercome. At the forefront is replica control: assuring that data copies remain consistentwhen updates occur. There exist many alternatives in regard to where updates can occurand when changes are propagated to data copies; how changes are applied; where the …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2010,52
How to select a replication protocol according to scalability; availability and communication overhead,Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Gustavo Alonso; B Kernme,Data replication is playing an increasingly important role in the design of parallel informationsystems. In particular; the widespread use of cluster architectures in high-performancecomputing has created many opportunities for applying data replication techniques in newareas. For instance; as part of work related to cluster computing in bioinformatics; we havebeen confronted with the problem of having to choose an optimal replication strategy interms of scalability; availability and communication overhead. Thus; we have evaluatedseveral representative replication protocols in order to better understand their behavior inpractice.

Database replication: a tale of research across communities,Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Replication is a key mechanism to achieve scalability and fault-tolerance indatabases. Its importance has recently been further increased because of the role it plays inachieving elasticity at the database layer. In database replication; the biggest challenge liesin the trade-off between performance and consistency. A decade ago; performance couldonly be achieved through lazy replication at the expense of transactional guarantees. Thestrong consistency of eager approaches came with a high cost in terms of reducedperformance and limited scalability. Postgres-R combined results from distributed systemsand databases to develop a replication solution that provided both scalability and strongconsistency.

pSense-Maintaining a dynamic localized peer-to-peer structure for position based multicast in games,Arne Schmieg; Michael Stieler; Sebastian Jeckel; Patric Kabus; Bettina Kemme; Alejandro Buchmann,This paper presents an algorithm for creating and maintaining a dynamic localized peer-to-peer overlay network with its main application to massively multiplayer games. In thesegames; players reside in a large game world with many thousands of players but eachplayer has typically a limited vision range. In our solution; players join the network as peersand mainly connect to neighbor peers that are close to them in the virtual game world. Asplayers move in the game they change their neighbors dynamically with very little overhead.Peers can multicast messages that are received by peers in their locality very fast (oftenfaster than in client-server solutions) while players that are further away receive them later ornot at all. Not receiving messages from remote players is important in order to not cause theload on each peer to grow with the number of players in the game. Our performance …,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2008.

Consistent and scalable cache replication for multi-tier J2EE applications,Francisco Perez-Sorrosal; Marta Patiño-Martinez; Ricardo Jimenez-Peris; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Data centers are the most critical infrastructure of companies demanding higherand higher levels of quality of service (QoS) in terms of availability and scalability. At thecore of data centers are multi-tier architectures providing service to applications. Replicationis heavily used in this infrastructure for either availability or scalability but typically not forboth combined. Additionally; most approaches replicate a single tier; making the non-replicated tiers potential bottlenecks and single points of failure. In this paper; we present anovel approach that provides both availability and scalability for multi-tier applications. Theapproach uses a replicated cache that takes into account both the application server tier(middle-tier) and the database (back-end). The underlying replicated cache protocol fullyembeds the replication logic in the application server. The protocol exhibits good …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2007,41
How consistent is your cloud application?,Kamal Zellag; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Current cloud datastores usually trade consistency for performance and availability.However; it is often not clear how an application is affected when it runs under a low level ofconsistency. In fact; current application designers have basically no tools that would helpthem to get a feeling of which and how many inconsistencies actually occur for theirparticular application. In this paper; we propose a generalized approach for detectingconsistency anomalies for arbitrary cloud applications accessing various types of clouddatastores in transactional or non-transactional contexts. We do not require any knowledgeon the business logic of the studied application nor on its selected consistency guarantees.We experimentally verify the effectiveness of our approach by using the Google App Engineand Cassandra datastores.,Proceedings of the Third ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2012,38
Enhancing edge computing with database replication,Yi Lin; Bettina Kemme; Marta Patino-Martinez; Ricardo Jimenez-Peris,As the use of the Internet continues to grow explosively; edge computing has emerged as animportant technique for delivering Web content over the Internet. Edge computing movesdata and computation closer to end-users for fast local access and better load distribution.Current approaches use caching; which does not work well with highly dynamic data. In thispaper; we propose a different approach to enhance edge computing. Our approach lies in awide area data replication protocol that enables the delivery of dynamic content with fullconsistency guarantees and with all the benefits of edge computing; such as low latency andhigh scalability. What is more; the proposed solution is fully transparent to the applicationsthat are brought to the edge. Our extensive evaluations in a real wide area network usingTPC-W show promising results.,Reliable Distributed Systems; 2007. SRDS 2007. 26th IEEE International Symposium on,2007,33
Eager replication for stateful J2EE servers,Huaigu Wu; Bettina Kemme; Vance Maverick,Abstract Replication has been widely used in J2EE servers for reliability and scalability.There are two properties which are important for a stateful J2EE application server. Firstly;the state of the server and the state of the backend databases should always be consistent.Secondly; each request from a client should be executed exactly once. In this paper; wepropose a replication algorithm that provides both properties. We use passive replicationwhere a primary server executes a request; and all state changed within the applicationserver by this request is sent to the backup replicas at the end of the execution. Anagreement protocol guarantees the consistency between the state of all replicas and thedatabase. A client side communication stub automatically resubmits requests in case offailures; and unnecessary resubmissions are detected by the server replicas.

Persistence in massively multiplayer online games,Kaiwen Zhang; Bettina Kemme; Alexandre Denault,Abstract The most important asset of a Massively Multiplayer Online Game is its world state;as it represents the combined efforts and progress of all its participants. Thus; it is extremelyimportant that this state is not lost in case of server failures. Survival of the world state istypically achieved by making it persistent; eg; by storing it in a relational database. The mainchallenge of this approach is to track the large volume of modifications applied to the worldin real time. This paper compares a variety of strategies to persist changes of the gameworld. While critical events must be written synchronously to the persistent storage; a set ofapproximation strategies are discussed and compared that are suitable for events with lowconsistency requirements; such as player movements. An analysis to better understand thepossible limitations and bottlenecks of these strategies is presented using experimental …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Network and System Support for Games,2008,31
Lightweight reflection for middleware-based database replication,Jorge Salas; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Bettina Kemme,Middleware-based database replication approaches have emerged in the last few years asan alternative to traditional database replication implemented within the database kernel. Amiddleware approach enables third party vendors to provide high availability solutions; agrowing practice nowadays in the software industry. However; middleware solutions oftenlack scalability and exhibit a number of consistency and performance issues. The reason isthat in most cases the middleware has to handle the database as a black box; and hence;cannot take advantage of the many optimizations implemented in the database kernel. Thus;middleware solutions often reimplement key functionality but cannot achieve the sameefficiency as a kernel implementation. Reflection has been proposed during the last decadeas a fruitful paradigm to separate non-functional aspects from functional ones; simplifying …,Reliable Distributed Systems; 2006.

Consistent data replication: Is it feasible in wans?,Yi Lin; Bettina Kemme; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris,Abstract Recent proposals have shown that database replication providing 1-copy-serializability can have excellent performance in LAN environments by using powerfulmulticast primitives. In this paper; we evaluate whether a similar approach is feasible inWAN environments. We identify the most crucial bottlenecks of the existing protocols; andpropose optimizations that alleviate the identified problems. Our experiments show thatperformance remains acceptable even for medium sized systems; and data replicationguaranteeing 1-copy-serializability is a serious alternative to weaker approaches in WANenvironments.,European Conference on Parallel Processing,2005,31

An autonomic approach for replication of internet-based services,Damián Serrano; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Bettina Kemme,As more and more applications are deployed asInternet-based services; they have to beavailable anytimeanywhere in a seamless manner. This requires theunderlyinginfrastructure to provide scalability; faulttoleranceand fast response times. While replicatingtheservices and the data they access across sites that arelocated in different geographicregions is a promisingmeans to achieve these requirements; data consistencyis challengingif data continuously changes and queriesare dynamic by nature; as is typical for e-commerce applications. Thus; current WAN replication solutions eithertrade performance fordata consistency or are notable to scale in wide-area settings.

Fault-tolerance for stateful application servers in the presence of advanced transactions patterns,Huaigu Wu; Bettina Kemme,Replication is widely used in application server products to tolerate faults. An importantchallenge is to correctly coordinate replication and transaction execution for statefulapplication servers. Many current solutions assume that a single client request generatesexactly one transaction at the server. However; it is quite common that several clientrequests are encapsulated within one server transaction or that a single client request caninitiate several server transactions. In this paper; we propose a replication tool that is able tohandle these variations in request/transaction association. We have integrated our approachinto the J2EE application server JBoss. Our evaluation using the ECPerf benchmark showsa low overhead of the approach.,Reliable Distributed Systems; 2005. SRDS 2005. 24th IEEE Symposium on,2005,28
Comparison of UDDI registry replication strategies,Chenliang Sun; Yi Lin; Bettina Kemme,UDDI registries are intended to become the world-wide lookup mechanism for Web-services. As such; the registry has to provide high throughput; low response times; highavailability; and access to accurate data. Replication is often used to satisfy suchrequirements. Various replication strategies exist; favoring different subsets of the aboveperformance metrics. In this paper we have a closer look at two very different replicationstrategies. One strategy follows the UDDI specification; the second uses a middlewarebased replication tool. In this paper; we provide a comparison of these two approachesfocusing on performance and ease of integration with an existing UDDI implementation.,Web Services; 2004. Proceedings.

Maintaining replicas in unstructured P2P systems,Christof Leng; Wesley W Terpstra; Bettina Kemme; Wilhelm Stannat; Alejandro P Buchmann,Abstract Replication is widely used in unstructured peer-to-peer systems to improve searchor achieve availability. We identify and solve a subclass of replication problems where eachobject is associated with a maintainer node; and its replicas should only be available aslong as its maintainer is part of the network. Such requirement can be found in variousapplications; eg; when objects are directory lists; service lists; or subscriptions of apublish/subscribe system. We provide maintainers with proven guarantees on the number ofreplicas; in spite of network churn and crash failures. We also tackle the related problems ofchanging the number of replicas; updating replicas; balancing storage load in aheterogeneous network; and eliminating replicas left by crashing maintainers. Our algorithmis based on probabilistic methods and is simple to implement. We show by simulation and …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM CoNEXT Conference,2008,26

Building a peer-to-peer content distribution network with high performance; scalability and robustness,Manal El Dick; Esther Pacitti; Reza Akbarinia; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Content distribution networks (CDN) are fundamental; yet expensive technologiesfor distributing the content of web-servers to large audiences. The P2P model is a perfectmatch to build a low-cost and scalable CDN infrastructure for popular websites by exploitingthe underutilized resources of their user communities. However; building a P2P-based CDNis not a straightforward endeavor. In contrast to traditional CDNs; peers are autonomous andvolunteer participants with their own heterogeneous interests that should be taken intoaccount in the design of the P2P system. Moreover; churn rate is much higher than indedicated CDN infrastructures; which can easily destabilize the system and severelydegrade the performance. Finally and foremostly; while many P2P systems abstract anytopological information about the underlying network; a top priority of a CDN is to …,*,2011,22
Data mining using relational database management systems,Beibei Zou; Xuesong Ma; Bettina Kemme; Glen Newton; Doina Precup,Abstract Software packages providing a whole set of data mining and machine learningalgorithms are attractive because they allow experimentation with many kinds of algorithmsin an easy setup. However; these packages are often based on main-memory datastructures; limiting the amount of data they can handle. In this paper we use a relationaldatabase as secondary storage in order to eliminate this limitation. Unlike existingapproaches; which often focus on optimizing a single algorithm to work with a databasebackend; we propose a general approach; which provides a database interface for severalalgorithms at once. We have taken a popular machine learning software package; Weka;and added a relational storage manager as back-tier to the system. The extension istransparent to the algorithms implemented in Weka; since it is hidden behind Weka's …,Pacific-asia conference on knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,22
Dynamoth: A scalable pub/sub middleware for latency-constrained applications in the cloud,Julien Gascon-Samson; Franz-Philippe Garcia; Bettina Kemme; Jörg Kienzle,This paper presents Dynamoth; a dynamic; scalable; channel-based pub/sub middlewaretargeted at large scale; distributed and latency constrained systems. Our approach providesa software layer that balances the load generated by a high number of publishers;subscribers and messages across multiple; standard pub/sub servers that can be deployedin the Cloud. In order to optimize Cloud infrastructure usage; pub/sub servers can be addedor removed as needed. Balancing takes into account the live characteristics of each channeland is done in an hierarchical manner across channels (macro) as well as within individualchannels (micro) to maintain acceptable performance and low latencies despite highlyvarying conditions.

Triangle-based obstacle-aware load balancing for massively multiplayer games,Alexandre Denault; César Cañas; Jörg Kienzle; Bettina Kemme,Massively multiplayer games run on large server farms in order to handle the huge load thatis caused by the thousands of players that play these games concurrently. Current systemsuse very simple load-balancing mechanisms restricting the semantics of the game. In thispaper; we present a dynamic load balancing mechanism that considers both the loadassociated with performing game actions as well as the load incurred through interestmanagement. As clients join; they can take on load due to game actions and updatenotifications. When players flock to some part of the world; our system is able to dynamicallyredistribute the imbalanced interest management load among servers. This hybridmechanism is integrated into the Mammoth multiplayer gaming environment and our real-world experiments show how equal load distribution is maintained under changing …,Network and Systems Support for Games (NetGames); 2011 10th Annual Workshop on,2011,21
P2Prec: a P2P recommendation system for large-scale data sharing,Fady Draidi; Esther Pacitti; Bettina Kemme,Abstract This paper proposes P2Prec; a P2P recommendation overlay that facilitatesdocument sharing for on-line communities. Given a query; the goal of P2PRec is to findrelevant peers that can recommend documents that are relevant for the query and are ofhigh quality. A document is relevant to a query if it covers the same topics. It is of high qualityif relevant peers have rated it highly. P2PRec finds relevant peers through a variety ofmechanisms including advanced content-based and collaborative filtering. The topics eachpeer is interested in are automatically calculated by analyzing the documents the peerholds. Peers become relevant for a topic if they hold a certain number of highly rateddocuments on this topic. To efficiently disseminate information about peers' topics andrelevant peers; we propose new semantic-based gossip protocols. In addition; we …,*,2011,21
Publish/subscribe network designs for multiplayer games,César Cañas; Kaiwen Zhang; Bettina Kemme; Jörg Kienzle; Hans-Arno Jacobsen,Abstract Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs); which are typically supported bylarge distributed systems; require a scalable; low latency messaging middleware thatsupports the location-based semantics and the loosely coupled interaction of multiplayergames components. In this paper; we present three different pub/sub-driven designs for aMMOG networking engine that account for the highly interactive and massive nature of thesegames. Each design uses not only different pub/sub approaches (from topic-based tocontent-based) but also serves varying degrees of responsibilities. In particular; some ofthem integrate game functionality; such as interest management; into the network engine.We implement; evaluate; and compare our proposed designs in the MMOG prototypeMammoth.

Online recovery in cluster databases,WeiBin Liang; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Cluster based replication solutions are an attractive mechanism to provide bothhigh-availability and scalability for the database backend within the multi-tier informationsystems of service-oriented businesses. An important issue that has not yet receivedsufficient attention is how database replicas that have failed can be reintegrated into thesystem or how completely new replicas can be added in order to increase the capacity of thesystem. Ideally; recovery takes place online; ie; while transaction processing continues atthe replicas that are already running. In this paper we present a complete online recoverysolution for database clusters. One important issue is to find an efficient way to transfer thedata the joining replica needs. In this paper; we present two data transfer strategies.

Exactly once interaction in a multi-tier architecture,Bettina Kemme; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patino-Martınez; Jorge Salas,Abstract Multi-tier architectures are now the standard for advanced information systems.Replication is used to provide high-availability in such architectures. Most existingapproaches have focused on replication within a single tier. For example there exist variousapproaches to replicate CORBA or J2EE based middle-tiers; or the database tier. However;in order to provide a high-available solution for the entire system; all tiers must be replicated.In this paper we analyze what is needed to couple two replicated tiers. Our focus is toanalyze how to use independent replication solutions; one for each tier; and adjust them aslittle as possible to provide a global solution.,Implementation; and Deployment of Database Replication,2005,19
Don’t be a pessimist: Use snapshot based concurrency control for XML,Zeeshan Sardar; Bettina Kemme,As native XML database systems (eg;[3; 7; 8]) get increasingly popular; fine-granularityconcurrency control becomes imperative in order to allow different clients to concurrentlyaccess the same documents. Existing concurrency control approaches for XML are mainlybased on locking [2; 3; 4; 6; 5]. However; the experiments of [5] have shown that the lockingoverhead; especially for read operations; can be tremendous. In this paper; we present twosnapshot based concurrency control mechanisms that avoid locking. Instead; transactionsaccess a committed snapshot of the data.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Compaction management in distributed key-value datastores,Muhammad Yousuf Ahmad; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Compactions are a vital maintenance mechanism used by datastores based on thelog-structured merge-tree to counter the continuous buildup of data files under update-intensive workloads. While compactions help keep read latencies in check over the long run;this comes at the cost of significantly degraded read performance over the course of thecompaction itself. In this paper; we offer an in-depth analysis of compaction-relatedperformance overheads and propose techniques for their mitigation. We offload large;expensive compactions to a dedicated compaction server to allow the datastore server tobetter utilize its resources towards serving the actual workload. Moreover; since the newlycompacted data is already cached in the compaction server's main memory; we fetch thisdata over the network directly into the datastore server's local cache; thereby avoiding the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,16
Fine-granularity access control in 3-tier laboratory information systems,Xueli Li; Nomair A Naeem; Bettina Kemme,Laboratory information systems (LIMS) are used in life science research to manage complexexperiments. Since LIMS systems are often shared by different research groups; powerfulaccess control is needed to allow different access rights to different records of the sametable. Traditional access control models that define a permission as the right of a user/role toperform a specific operation on a specific object cannot handle the enormous amount ofobjects and user/roles. In this paper; we propose an enhancement to role-based accesscontrol by introducing conditions that can be added to the traditional concept of permissionsin order to keep the number of permissions small. Furthermore; we present animplementation of our access control model at the application programming level.

This can reveal very challenging; given the highly dynamic and autonomousparticipation of peers. Indeed; the P2P-CDN should adapt to increasing numbers ofparticipants and provide robust algorithms under churn because these issues have a keyimpact on performance. Also; the distribution of tasks and content over peers should takeinto account their interests in order to give them proper incentives to cooperate. Finally; therouting of queries should aim peers close in locality and serve content from close-byproviders to reduce network overload and achieve scalability.

Consistency anomalies in multi-tier architectures: automatic detection and prevention,Kamal Zellag; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Modern transaction systems; consisting of an application server tier and a databasetier; offer several levels of isolation providing a trade-off between performance andconsistency. While it is fairly well known how to identify qualitatively the anomalies that arepossible under a certain isolation level; it is much more difficult to detect and quantify suchanomalies during run-time of a given application. In this paper; we present a new approachto detect and quantify consistency anomalies for arbitrary multi-tier application runningunder any isolation levels ensuring at least read committed. In fact; the application can runeven under a mixture of isolation levels.

They are often connected to a wireless local areanetwork (IEEE 802.11 WLANs) and rely on encryption protocols to maintain their securityand privacy. In this paper; we show that even in presence of encryption; an attacker withoutaccess to encryption keys is able to determine the users' behavior; in particular; their appusage. We perform this attack using packet-level traffic analysis in which we use side-channel information leaks to identify specific patterns in packets regardless of whether theyare encrypted or not. We show that just by collecting and analyzing small amounts ofwireless traffic; one can determine what apps each individual smartphone user in the vicinityis using.

Interest modeling in games: the case of dead reckoning,Amir Yahyavi; Kévin Huguenin; Bettina Kemme,Abstract In games; the goals and interests of players are key factors in their behavior.However; techniques used by networked games to cope with infrequent updates andmessage loss; such as dead reckoning; estimate a player's movements based mainly onprevious observations. The estimations are typically made by using dynamics of motion;taking only inertia and some external factors (eg; gravity; wind) into account whilecompletely ignoring the player's goals (eg; chasing other players or collecting objects). Thispaper proposes AntReckoning: a dead reckoning algorithm; inspired from ant colonies;which models the players' interests to predict their movements. AntReckoning incorporates aplayer's interest in specific locations; objects; and avatars in the equations of motion in theform of attraction forces. In practice; these points of interest generate pheromones; which …,Multimedia systems,2013,12
Transaction models for massively multiplayer online games,Kaiwen Zhang; Bettina Kemme,Massively Multiplayer Online Games are considered large distributed systems where thegame state is partially replicated across the server and thousands of clients. Given the scale;game engines typically offer only relaxed consistency without well-defined guarantees. Inthis paper; we leverage the concept of transactions to define consistency models that aresuitable for gaming environments. We define game specific levels of consistency that differin the degree of isolation and atomicity they provide; and demonstrate the costs associatedwith their execution. Each action type within a game can then be assigned the appropriateconsistency level; choosing the right trade-off between consistency and performance. Theissue of durability and fault-tolerance of game actions is also discussed.,Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS); 2011 30th IEEE Symposium on,2011,12

A recovery protocol for middleware replicated databases providing GSI,JE Armendáriz; FD Munoz-Esco; JR Juárez; José Ramón González de Mendivil; Bettina Kemme,Middleware database replication is a way to increase availability and afford site failures fordynamic content Websites. There are several replication protocols that ensure dataconsistency for these systems. The most attractive ones are those providing generalizedsnapshot isolation (GSI); as read operations never block. These replication protocols arebased on the certification process; however; up to our knowledge; they do not cope with therecovery of a replica. In this paper we propose a recovery protocol that ensures GSI (weprovide an outline of its correctness) that does not interfere with user transactions andpermits the execution of transactions in the recovering node; even though the recoveryprocess has not finished,Availability; Reliability and Security; 2007.

Applying database replication to multi-player online games,Yi Lin; Bettina Kemme; Marta Patino-Martinez; Ricardo Jimenez-Peris,Abstract Multi-player Online Games (MOGs) have emerged as popular data intensiveapplications in recent years. Being used by many players simultaneously; they require ahigh degree of fault tolerance; scalability and performance. In this paper we analyze howdatabase replication can be used in MOGs to achieve these goals. In data replication; clientscan read data from any database replica while updates have to be executed at all availablereplicas. Thus; reads can be distributed among the replicas leading to reduced responsetime and scalability. Furthermore; the system is fault-tolerant as long as a replica isavailable. However; we are not aware of any previous study on the application of databasereplication to MOG. In this paper; we present a system; MiddleSIR; which provides databasereplication support. We illustrate different replication protocols implemented in the system …,Proceedings of 5th ACM SIGCOMM workshop on Network and system support for games,2006,11
Graps: A graph publish/subscribe middleware,César Cañas; Eduardo Pacheco; Bettina Kemme; Jörg Kienzle; Hans-Arno Jacobsen,Abstract Pub/sub is an elegant paradigm for disseminating information efficiently andanonymously among producers (publishers) and consumers (subscribers). However; withcurrent topic and content-based pub/sub approaches it is difficult to formulate subscriptionsthat adequately and accurately express the interest of the consumers in a semanticinformation domain. In this paper we introduce GraPS; a pub/sub middleware that provides apublication model based on graphs. Points of interest in the information domain are mappedto nodes; and relationships between points of interest are mapped to edges. Consumers caneffectively express their interest in publications by means of graph subscriptions that exploitthe properties of nodes and the semantics of the edge relationships. Graph subscriptions donot require complete knowledge of the graph and can be updated whenever the …,Proceedings of the 16th Annual Middleware Conference,2015,10
A unified framework for load distribution and fault-tolerance of application servers,Huaigu Wu; Bettina Kemme,Abstract This paper proposes a novel replication architecture for stateful application serversthat offers an integrated solution for fault-tolerance and load-distribution. Each applicationserver replica is able to execute client requests and at the same time serves as backup forother replicas. We propose an effective load balancing mechanism that is only load-aware ifa server is close to become overloaded. Furthermore; we present transparentreconfiguration algorithms that guarantee that each replica has the same number of backupsin a dynamic environment where replicas can join or leave at any time. Our evaluationshows that our approach scales and distributes load across all servers even inheterogeneous environments while keeping the overhead for fault-tolerance and load-balancing small.,European Conference on Parallel Processing,2009,10
A System of Architectural Patterns for Scalable; Consistent and Highly Available Multi-Tier Service-Oriented Infrastructures,Ricardo Jimenez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martinez; Bettina Kemme; Francisco Perez-Sorrosal; Damian Serrano,Abstract Service-oriented architectures have become prevalent in enterprise informationsystems. The underlying infrastructure is typically architected with multiple tiers in order toseparate the different concerns such as interface; business logic and data. Moderninformation systems have strict availability and scalability requirements. The main techniqueto attain these properties is replication. However; system architects are confronted with acomplex environment in which they have to decide which tier (s) to replicate and how. Thearchitectural choice can have great implications for the degree of scalability and availabilitythat can actually be achieved. Furthermore; maintaining consistency is affected by the waythe system is replicated. In this chapter; we survey the state of the art in this area and digestit in the form of a system of architectural patterns that will guide system architects and …,*,2009,10
Real-time quantification and classification of consistency anomalies in multi-tier architectures,Kamal Zellag; Bettina Kemme,While online transaction processing applications heavily rely on the transactional propertiesprovided by the underlying infrastructure; they often choose to not use the highest isolationlevel; ie; serializability; because of the potential performance implications of costly strict two-phase locking concurrency control. Instead; modern transaction systems; consisting of anapplication server tier and a database tier; offer several levels of isolation providing a trade-off between performance and consistency. While it is fairly well known how to identify theanomalies that are possible under a certain level of isolation; it is much more difficult toquantify the amount of anomalies that occur during run-time of a given application.

Watchmen: Scalable cheat-resistant support for distributed multi-player online games,Amir Yahyavi; Kévin Huguenin; Julien Gascon-Samson; Jorg Kienzle; Bettina Kemme,Multi-player online games are inherently distributed applications; and a wide range ofdistributed architectures have been proposed. However; only few successful commercialsystems follow such approaches; even given their benefits; due to one main hurdle: theeasiness with which cheaters can disrupt the game state computation and dissemination;perform illegal actions; or unduly gain access to sensitive information. The challenge is thatany measures used to address cheating must meet the heavy scalability and tight latencyrequirements of fast paced games. We propose Watchmen; the first distributed scalableprotocol designed with cheat detection and prevention in mind that supports fast pacedgames. It is based on a randomized dynamic proxy scheme for both the dissemination andverification of actions.

P2Prec: a Recommendation Service for P2P Content Sharing Systems,Fady Draidi; Esther Pacitti; Patrick Valduriez; Bettina Kemme,Abstract. In this paper; we propose P2Prec; a recommendation service for P2P contentsharing systems that exploits users' social data. The key idea is to recommend to a user highquality documents in a specific topic using ratings of friends (or friends of friends) who areexpert in that topic. To manage users' social data; we rely on Friend-Of-A-Friend (FOAF)descriptions. P2Prec has a hybrid P2P architecture to work on top of any P2P contentsharing system. It combines efficient DHT indexing to manage the users' FOAF files withgossip robustness to disseminate the topics of expertise between friends. In ourexperimental evaluation; using the CiteSeer dataset; we show that P2Prec has the ability toget the maximum recall with very good performance. Furthermore; it increases recall andprecision by a factor of 2 compared with centralized solutions.,Bases de Donnees Avancees (BDA),2010,5

Area-based gossip multicast,Christian Seeger; Bettina Kemme; Patric Kabus; Alejandro Buchmann,Abstract This paper presents areacast; a dynamic; area-based gossip multicast that enablesa node to multicast messages only to nodes with a shared interest. This multicast can beused in multiplayer games where players want to send position updates; that is informationthat they have moved in the virtual game world; to players that reside close to them in thegame world. As nodes continuously change their position the set of nodes in theirneighborhood changes; too. areacast is able to handle this dynamism in a truly peer-to-peerfashion as each node keeps track of its current neighbors detecting new neighbors very fast.We evaluate our approach using game simulations where players either walk randomly inthe game field or flock to a few hotspots. The results show that areacast is able todisseminate messages very fast to neighbors while not overloading the network.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Network and System Support for Games,2008,4

Transactional failure recovery for a distributed key-value store,Muhammad Yousuf Ahmad; Bettina Kemme; Ivan Brondino; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris,Abstract With the advent of cloud computing; many applications have embraced the ensuingparadigm shift towards modern distributed key-value data stores; like HBase; in order tobenefit from the elastic scalability on offer. However; many applications still hesitate to makethe leap from the traditional relational database model simply because they cannotcompromise on the standard transactional guarantees of atomicity; isolation; and durability.To get the best of both worlds; one option is to integrate an independent transactionmanagement component with a distributed key-value store. In this paper; we discuss theimplications of this approach for durability. In particular; if the transaction manager providesdurability (eg; through logging); then we can relax durability constraints in the key-valuestore. However; if a component fails (eg; a client or a key-value server); then we need a …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2013,3
Cheat detection and prevention in p2p mogs,Kévin Huguenin; Amir Yahyavi; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Scalability and fairness are keys to the success of massively multi-player on-linegames. The first is necessary for the technical viability of the game while the latter is requiredfor the wide adoption by players. Although they achieve better scalability; peer-to-peergames are more prone to cheating as players have access to and manipulate sensitivegame data [2].,Proceedings of the 10th Annual Workshop on Network and Systems Support for Games,2011,3

Service Specification Language,Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; M Patino-Martinez; S Woodman; S Shrivastava; D Palmer; S Wheater; B Kemme; G Alonso,A web service can be either a basic service (BSs) or a composite service (CSs). BSs areprovided by a single organization while CSs can be inter-organizational and are made up ofBSs and other CSs. The composition of BSs and CSs into a new CS requires specifying theproperties of the constituent services in order to predict the properties of the new service.This document deals with a language to specify web services in order to ease thecomposition of CSs. The specification will cover both functional and nonfunctional attributes.The description of functional attributes will follow the widely accepted specification for thedescription of web services; web service description language (WSDL)[1]. An important partof this document will be devoted to the identification of nonfunctional aspects of services thatwill prove helpful to predict the properties of the CSs built out of them.

Exp-DB: Fast Development of Information Systems for Experiment Tracking.,Nomair A Naeem; Stéphane Raymond; Anne Poupon; Miroslaw Cygler; Bettina Kemme,Abstract. Bioinformatics research groups require information systems keeping track ofexperiments and their results. However; current solutions are often ad-hoc; difficult tomaintain; extend; or use in different context. This paper presents Exp-DB; an infrastructurefor the fast development of information systems for experiment tracking. Exp-DB provides abasic; extensible database design; modular components for accessing the data; and a web-based interface. It allows for fast implementation of an initial system even by non IT-expertswhich can then be extended step-by-step.,CAiSE Short Paper Proceedings,2003,3
Dynfilter: Limiting bandwidth of online games using adaptive pub/sub message filtering,Julien Gascon-Samson; Jörg Kienzle; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Multiplayer online games can generate a lot of server-related outgoing bandwidth;due to many factors such as highly variable amounts of players or the gathering of manyplayers towards the same in-game locations. Predicting the exact amount of requiredbandwidth to support varying conditions can be costly; and players can experience game-wide failures if bandwidth is insufficiently provisioned. We present DynFilter; a game-oriented message processing middleware designed to adaptively filter state updatemessages for in-game entities located apart; in order to reduce bandwidth needs and staywithin predefined quotas. We ran experiments on Amazon EC2 over a prototype gamemimicking a FPS and a MMOG. Our results show that DynFilter is properly able to maintainbandwidth use within the pre-established quotas while still maintaining adequate delivery …,Proceedings of the 2015 International Workshop on Network and Systems Support for Games,2015,2

Organizations need to ensure that these services are available; scalable and alsoautonomic to guarantee that user interactions are promptly processed even under highlyvolatile conditions. In most cases; organizations use application servers with a multi-tierarchitecture for the delivery of their services.

Database replication based on group communication: Implementation issues,Bettina Kemme,Abstract For many years; developers of group communication systems have claimed thatdatabase replication is an interesting application for their multicast primitives. Over the lastyears; several research groups have had a closer look into this claim and started to analyzehow group communication primitives can support replica control in database systems; forinstance [24.10];[24.20];[24.19];[24.16];[24.15];[24.14];[24.22];[24.13];[24.4];[24.2]. The mainideas of these proposals are to use the ordering guarantees of multicast primitives toserialize con. icting transactions; and to simplify atomic commit protocols by using reliable oruniform reliable multicast. Most of the results are published in distributed systemsconferences; and so far; they have received little attention in database conferences. There;the focus has been on quorum protocols [24.23](for fault-tolerance); and adaptive lazy …,*,2003,2
Transactions; messages and events: Merging group communication and database system,Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract In this paper; we report on the DRAGON (Database Replication on GroupCommunication) project and the results obtained so far at ETH Zürich. The goal of DRAGONis to improve database replication strategies by using group communication primitives. As afirst step in this direction; we have developed a suite of protocols implementing databasereplication based on broadcast primitives. We are currently embedding these protocols intoa database management system to show the feasibility of the approach. In this short paper;we briefly discuss these protocols and analyze how they can be included in a databasesystem. Our contribution is to further clarify the effort involved in the process and to explicitlystate some of the issues commonly not considered by existing work. These issues areanalyzed in detail and solutions are provided taking as example our current development …,In 3rd Europeean Research Seminar on Advances in Distributed Systems (ERSADS'99); Madeira Island,1999,2

A Simulation Study for Shared-Disk Parallel Database Systems,Bettina Kemme,Abstract Shared-disk parallel database systems are one form to exploit parallel architecturesfor high performance transaction processing. A shared-disk parallel database consists ofseveral processing nodes that are loosely coupled via a communication network and sharethe common database at the disk level. This thesis provides a comprehensive performancestudy of shared-disk systems. We have developed an simulation model that facilitates adetailed analysis of the different hardware and software components of a shared-disksystem and their cooperation. We show that the performance of concurrency and coherencycontrol algorithms depends greatly on the underlying hardware configuration and that someprotocols are suitable for one architecture; but not for others.

MultiPub: Latency and Cost-Aware Global-Scale Cloud Publish/Subscribe,Julien Gascon-Samson; Jörg Kienzle; Bettina Kemme,Topic-based pub/sub is a widely used communication mechanism in distributed systems fortargeted information dissemination between loosely coupled entities. To scale dynamicallydepending on the current communication demands; pub/services can be convenientlydeployed in the cloud. To provide fast dissemination; the service can be distributed acrossmultiple cloud regions. The architectural design and run-time deployment of such amiddleware is tricky; though; as it can have a significant effect on communication latencyand cloud-based cost. In this paper; we propose MultiPub; a flexible pub/sub middleware forlatency-constrained; world-wide distributed applications that dynamically reconfigures thecommunication layer to ensure a predefined maximum latency for publication disseminationwhile minimizing cloud-based costs.

Evolving pub/sub subscriptions for multiplayer online games,Cesar Canas; Kaiwen Zhang; Bettina Kemme; Jörg Kienzle; Hans-Arno Jacobsen,Abstract We identify a class of content-based pub/sub applications with highly dynamicsubscriptions. This includes location-based notification systems; predictive stock trading;and multiplayer games. The traditional method of handling subscription changes byengaging in expensive re-subscription protocols is inadequate when the workload issufficiently large. We propose evolving subscriptions as a technique to alleviate theoverhead of subscription churn when handling regular patterns of subscription changes.Subscribers express as a function of time the evolution of its subscriptions. The pub/subbrokers can then independently modify the evolving subscriptions without requiring furthercommunication with the subscribers.,Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems,2016,1
Monitoring large-scale location-based information systems,Hammad Khan; Julien Gascon-Samson; Jörg Kienzle; Bettina Kemme,Monitoring the state of a distributed virtual world is challenging for several reasons: 1) thedistributed information must be gathered in real-time without affecting the performance of theinformation system; 2) in large-scale systems it is impossible for a single node to collect andprocess all the data; 3) the vast information must be filtered and aggregated according towhat the human observer wants to focus on; and 4) the point of interest of the observer canchange frequently. In this paper we present and evaluate a non-intrusive monitoringmiddleware that addresses these challenges by dynamically partitioning the geographicmap (eg; of the virtual world or the game) in terms of map objects and (expected) statechanges. We assign a different collector node to each of these partitions to collect and pre-process the data; and forward it to a central monitoring node. Furthermore; we provide …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS); 2015 IEEE International,2015,1
Lamoth: A message dissemination middleware for MMOGs in the cloud,Julien Gascon-Samson; Bettina Kemme; Jorg Kienzle,Provisionning network resources for Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) posesinteresting challenges due to the fact that the load can greatly vary depending on the time orother in-game factors. In this paper; we propose Lamoth; a cloud middleware for MMOGsthat provides an interface for in-game message dissemination. Lamoth handles theexchange of game messages between nodes by making use of an arbitrary number of off-the-shelve pub/sub servers deployed in the cloud depending on the game scenario. In orderto evaluate our platform; we implement Lamoth on top of Mammoth; McGill's research-oriented MMOG; and conduct extensive experiments by triggering situations which wouldcause networks bottlenecks. Our evaluations show that Lamoth can allow a MMOG to scaleto high numbers of players and can properly handle extremely-demanding in-game …,Network and Systems Support for Games (NetGames); 2013 12th Annual Workshop on,2013,1

Showing correctness of a replication algorithm in a component based system,Huaigu Wu; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Reasoning about the correctness of a replication algorithm is a difficult endeavor. Ifcorrectness has to be shown for a component based architecture where a client request canlead to execution across different components or tiers; this is even more difficult. Existingformalisms are either restricted to systems with only one component; or make strongassumptions about the setup of the system. In this paper; we present a flexible framework toreason about exactly-once execution in a failure-prone replicated component based system.Our approach allows us to reason about the execution across the entire system; eg;application server and database tier. If a given replication algorithm makes assumptionsabout some of the components; then those can be easily integrated into the reasoningprocess.,Proceedings of the 2008 international symposium on Database engineering & applications,2008,1

These architectures have stringent requirements in terms of performance andreliability. Replication is a general solution to provide fast local access and high availability.At the application server tier this means replicating the reusable software component of thebusiness logic and the application dependent state of business data. However; whilereplication of databases is a well explored area and the implications of replica maintenanceare well understood; this is not the case for data replication in application servers whereentire business objects are replicated; Web Service interfaces are provided; main memoryaccess is much more prevalent; and which have a database server as a backend tier.

Towards Large-Scale Replicated Databases,Ricardo Jimenez-Peris; Marta Patino-Martinez; Damian Serrano; Bettina Kemme,Databases are core components of modern distributed multi-tier information systems. Inmost of the cases; the database is the bottleneck of the system; limiting the scalability of thefull system. This is the reason why database replication has demanded much attentionduring the last few years. However; current replication protocols rely on two facts thatinherently limit their scalability to a few tens of sites. This position paper aims at addressingthe three main limiting factors of the scalability of replicated databases. Firstly; currentapproaches are based on 1-copy serializability (1CS). 1CS as its centralized counterpart;serializability; limits the concurrency in the database and therefore; it also limits itsthroughput. Secondly; current approaches rely on full replication what also has an inherentlimit of scalability. Thirdly; as any replication approach there is some coordination …,Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems and Middleware (LADIS). Haifa (Israel),2007,1

Methods and systems for graph-based publication-subscription,*,A system and method for graph-based publication/subscription are provided. A graphcomprising nodes and edges is created; each node representative of a point of interest in aninformation domain; each edge linking a first node and a second node and representative ofa relationship between a first and a second point of interest. A request to publish content onat least one selected node and/or at least one selected edge is received. A request tosubscribe to a subset of nodes and/or a subset of edges is received from a subscriber. Thesubscription request is correlated with the publication request to determine whether thesubset of nodes comprises the selected node and whether the subset of edges comprisesthe selected edge.

CacheDOCS: A Dynamic Key-Value Object Caching Service,Julien Gascon-Samson; Michael Coppinger; Fan Jin; Jörg Kienzle; Bettina Kemme,Caching plays an important role in many domains; as it can lead to important performanceimprovements. A key-value based caching system typically stores the results of popularqueries in efficient storage locations. While caching enjoys widespread usage in the contextof dynamic web applications; most mainstream caching systems store static binary items;which makes them impractical for many real-world applications that would benefit fromstoring dynamic items. In this paper; we propose CacheDOCS; a dynamic key-value objectcaching service that allows for caching arbitrary objects. As part of our model; CacheDOCSprovides an API that supports the execution of operations against cached objects; andallows for clients to seamlessly subscribe to keep their local copies in sync with cachedremote objects.

Self-evolving subscriptions for content-based publish/subscribe systems,César Canas; Kaiwen Zhang; Bettina Kemme; Jörg Kienzle; Hans-Arno Jacobsen,Traditional pub/sub systems cannot adequately handle workloads of applications withdynamic; short-lived subscriptions such as location-based social networks; predictive stocktrading; and online games. Subscribers must continuously interact with the pub/sub systemto remove and insert subscriptions; thereby inefficiently consuming network and computingresources; and sacrificing consistency. In the aforementioned applications; we recognizethat the changes in the subscriptions can follow a predictable pattern over some variable(eg; time). In this paper; we present a new type of subscription; called evolving subscription;which encapsulates these patterns and allow the pub/sub system to autonomously adapt tothe dynamic interests of the subscribers without incurring an expensive re-subscriptionoverhead.

As mobile communication is expensive;DistributedGCS is designed for small message overhead and; additionally; exploits SMSbased message relaying to handle short-term disconnections. In this work; we present thegroup maintenance service and the multicast service of DistributedGCS. In order to distributethe overhead of failure discovery over all processes we introduce the concept of a circle ofresponsibility for failure detection.

Partial Replication,Bettina Kemme,P/FDM [5–7] integrated a functional data model with the logic programming language Prologfor general-purpose computation. The data model can be seen as an Entity-Relationshipdiagram with sub-types; much like a UML Class Diagram. The idea was for the user to beable to define a computation over objects in the diagram; instead of just using it as a schemadesign aid. Later versions of P/FDM included a graphic interface [2; 4] to build queries inDAPLEX syntax by clicking on the diagram and filling in values from menus.,*,2009,*
Replication for High Availability,Bettina Kemme,Many organizations; eg; government statistical offices and search engine companies; collectpotentially sensitive information regarding individuals either to publish this data for research;or in return for useful services. While some data collection organizations; like the census; arelegally required not to breach the privacy of the individuals; other data collectionorganizations may not be trusted to uphold privacy. Hence; if U denotes the original datacontaining sensitive information about a set of individuals; then an untrusted data collectoror researcher should only have access to an anonymized version of the data; U*; that doesnot disclose the sensitive information about the individuals. A randomized anonymizationalgorithm R is said to be a privacy preserving randomization method if for every table T; andfor every output T*= R (T); the privacy of all the sensitive information of each individual in …,*,2009,*
Traditional Concurrency Control for Replicated Databases,Bettina Kemme,There are two kinds of tables: frequency tables that display the count of respondents at thecrossing of the categorical attributes (in N) and magnitude tables that display information ona numerical attribute at the crossing of the categorical attributes (in R). For example; givensome census microdata containing attributes “Job” and “Town;” one can generate afrequency table displaying the count of respondents doing each job type in each town. If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,*
Data Replication,Bettina Kemme,realized using such logical structures. For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,*
Topic 5 Parallel and Distributed Databases,Marta Patiño-Martinez; Genoveva Vargas-Solar; Elena Baralis; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Advances in data exploitation (access; query; retrieval; analysis; mining) areinherent to current and future information systems. Today; accessing great volumes ofinformation is reality; tomorrow data intensive management systems will enable huge usercommunities to transparently access multiple pre-existing autonomous; distributed andheterogeneous resources (data; documents; services). Existing data management solutionsdo not provide efficient techniques for exploiting and mining tera-datasets available inclusters; peer to peer and grid architectures. Parallel and distributed databases are a keyelement for achieving scalable; efficient systems that will both cost-effectively manage andextract knowledge from huge amounts of highly distributed and heterogeneous digital datarepositories.,European Conference on Parallel Processing,2007,*
Exploiting Reflection to Enable Scalable and Performant Database Replication at the Middleware Level,J Salas; R Jimenez-Peris; M Patino-Martinez; B Kemme,Abstract Database replication has gained a lot of attention in the last few years sincedatabases are often the bottleneck of modern information systems. Database replication isoften implemented at the middleware level. However; there is an important tradeoff in termsof scalability and performance if the database is dealt with as a black box. In this paper; weadvocate for a gray box approach in which some minimal functionality of the database isexposed through a reflective interface enabling performant and scalable databasereplication at the middleware level. Reflection is the adequate paradigm to separate theregular functionality from the replication logic. However; traditional full-fledged reflection istoo expensive. For this reason; the paper focuses on the exploration of some lightweightreflective interfaces that can combine the architectonic advantages of reflection with good …,*,2007,*

A Replication Toolkit for J2EE Application Servers,Huaigu Wu; Bettina Kemme; Alberto Bartoli; Simon Patarin,Web service technology allows organizations to provide programmatic interfaces to theservices they export. In most cases; these services are implemented with a multi-tierarchitecture consisting of a client external to the organization; a middle-tier and a back-endtier. The middle-tier typically uses the infrastructure of an application server (AS) whereasthe back-end tier consists of a database system. In this demo we present our work forenhancing current AS technology with flexible and transparent failure management. Weconsider multi-tiered services based on the J2EE architecture and replicate the middle-tierfor fault-tolerance. The novelty of our contribution consists in the guarantees we provide withrespect to failures.

Integrating Synchronous Update-Everywhere Replication into the PostgreSQL Database Engine,Gustavo Alonso; Bettina Kemme; Win Bausch,A replicated database is a distributed database in which multiple copies of the same dataitems are stored at several different sites. In contrast to non-replicated databases whereeach data item is only stored at a single site; a replicated database offers the advantage ofincreased fault tolerance and performance. Fault tolerance is achieved since data is not onlystored at one single database node; whereas performance is gained because transactionsdo not have to access remote sites; they can execute on their local copy of the database.This mechanism works as long as a transaction issues read operations. If it executes a writeoperation; the database is inconsistent since data items at different sites; which logicallyrepresent one single data item; have different values. Obviously some mechanism has to beprovided to synchronize the different copies so as to preserve consistency. Several …,*,1999,*

Powering Archive Store Query Processing via Join Indices,Joseph Vinish D’silva; Bettina Kemme; Richard Grondin; Evgueni Fadeitchev,ABSTRACT In recent years; the industry landscape surrounding data processing systemshas been significantly impacted by Big Data. Core technology and algorithms for dataanalysis have been adjusted and redesigned to handle the ever increasing amount of data.In this paper we revisit the concept of join index; a base mechanism in relational DBMS tosupport the expensive join operator; and analyze how it can be effectively integrated andcombined with other mechanisms widely deployed for large-scale data processing. Inparticular; we show how the data store Informatica IDV; originally designed to facilitatebackup and archival of application data; can benefit from join indices to give fast SQL-basedaccess to archival data for discovery purposes. Informatica IDV supports both horizontal andvertical partitioning–two mechanisms that are widely used in modern data stores to speed …,*,*,*
Secondary Indexing Techniques for Key-Value Stores: Two Rings To Rule Them All,Joseph Vinish D’silva; Roger Ruiz-Carrillo; Cong Yu; Muhammad Yousuf Ahmad; Bettina Kemme,ABSTRACT Secondary indices are traditionally used in DBMS to increase the performanceof queries that do not rely on the keys of the table for data reads. Many of the newer NoSQLdistributed data stores; even if they provide a table-based data model such as HBase;however; do not yet have a secondary indexing feature built in. In this paper; we explore thechallenges associated with indexing modern distributed table-based data stores andinvestigate two secondary index approaches which we have integrated within HBase. Ourdetailed analysis and experimental results prove the benefits of both the approaches.Further; we demonstrate that such secondary index implementation decisions cannot bemade in isolation of the data distribution and that different indexing approaches can cater todifferent needs.,*,*,*

We havechosen to base the architecture on J2EE [Sha02]; and specifically on the JBoss open-sourceimplementation [JBo]. This decision is based on investigations in several related directions.We have examined JBoss in detail—not only its documentation; but also its codebase. Wehave considered the general problem of J2EE replication in the light of the literature onreplication techniques. And we have tested several available toolkits for groupcommunication; a fundamental building block of replication. As a result of theseinvestigations; we have decided that the best way for us to implement basic services is tobuild on the JBoss implementation of J2EE. However; we will replace its replicationmechanism with a new one of our own (probably reusing a few pieces of the replication …,*,*,*

Formulae are interpreted over state sequences; where each state islabeled with a set of propositions. A state sequence can be regarded as a discrete passageof time and the temporal logic provides the formalization and deduction of temporalproperties. On the other hand; in artificial intelligence research temporal knowledge is oftenrepresented by relations between intervals; and reasoning about incomplete information is amain task. Our aim is to use the mathematical and technical machinery of temporal logics toreason about temporal intervals. Therefore we present how state sequences can representrelations between intervals and how properties of the intervals can be expressed bytemporal formulae.

A Middleware for Consistent Data Replication: Is it feasible in WANs?,Yi Lin; Bettina Kemme; Marta Patino-Martınez,Abstract. Recent proposals have shown that middleware based database replication is ableto provide 1-copy-serializability in LAN environments with excellent performance. This canbe achieved by using powerful and fast multicast primitives that deliver messages to all sitesin the same order in an all-or-nothing fashion. The question is whether a similar approach isfeasible in WAN environments considering the increased message latency. Some of theapproaches used in LANs might also work in WANs but others will be prohibitive. We haveperformed extensive tests of different protocols in a WAN testbed; in order to identify themost crucial bottlenecks; and the most promising optimizations. The performance resultsshow that performance remains acceptable even for medium sized systems consisting of upto eight sites. As such; we believe that data replication guaranteeing 1-copy-serializability …,*,*,*

In spite ofthe many theoretical results; ity is generally accepted that eager and symmetric replication isnot feasible in a database environment due to the performance penalties of distributed locksand 2 phase commit; as well as to the increase in deadlock rate. At the same time;commercial databases are started to provide limited forms of replication; most of them basedon the primary copy approach.
