SKYPEER: Efficient subspace skyline computation over distributed data,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Skyline query processing has received considerable attention in the recent past. Mainly; theskyline query is used to find a set of non dominated data points in a multidimensionaldataset. While most previous work has assumed a centralized setting; in this paper weaddress the efficient computation of subspace skyline queries in large-scale peer-to-peer(P2P) networks; where the dataset is horizontally distributed across the peers. Relying on asuper-peer architecture we propose a threshold based algorithm; called SKYPEER; whichforwards the skyline query requests among peers; in such a way that the amount oftransferred data is significantly reduced. For efficient subspace skyline processing; weextend the notion of domination by defining the extended skyline set; which contains all dataelements that are necessary to answer a skyline query in any arbitrary subspace.

Angle-based space partitioning for efficient parallel skyline computation,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Recently; skyline queries have attracted much attention in the database researchcommunity. Space partitioning techniques; such as recursive division of the data space;have been used for skyline query processing in centralized; parallel and distributed settings.Unfortunately; such grid-based partitioning is not suitable in the case of a parallel skylinequery; where allpartitions are examined at the same time; since many data partitions do notcontribute to the overall skyline set; resulting in a lot of redundant processing. In this paperwe propose a novel angle-based space partitioning scheme using the hypersphericalcoordinates of the data points. We demonstrate both formally as well as through anexhaustive set of experiments that this new scheme is very suitable for skyline queryprocessing in a parallel share-nothing architecture. The intuition of our partitioning …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,145
Reverse top-k queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Yannis Kotidis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Rank-aware query processing has become essential for many applications that return to theuser only the top-k objects based on the individual user's preferences. Top-k queries havebeen mainly studied from the perspective of the user; focusing primarily on efficient queryprocessing. In this work; for the first time; we study top-k queries from the perspective of theproduct manufacturer. Given a potential product; which are the user preferences for whichthis product is in the top-k query result set? We identify a novel query type; namely reversetop-k query; that is essential for manufacturers to assess the potential market and impact oftheir products based on the competition. We formally define reverse top-k queries andintroduce two versions of the query; namely monochromatic and bichromatic. We firstprovide a geometric interpretation of the monochromatic reverse top-k query in the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,126
A survey of skyline processing in highly distributed environments,Katja Hose; Akrivi Vlachou,Abstract During the last decades; data management and storage have become increasinglydistributed. Advanced query operators; such as skyline queries; are necessary in order tohelp users to handle the huge amount of available data by identifying a set of interestingdata objects. Skyline query processing in highly distributed environments poses inherentchallenges and demands and requires non-traditional techniques due to the distribution ofcontent and the lack of global knowledge. This paper surveys this interesting and stillevolving research area; so that readers can easily obtain an overview of the state-of-the-art.We outline the objectives and the main principles that any distributed skyline approach hasto fulfill; leading to useful guidelines for developing algorithms for distributed skylineprocessing.

On efficient top-k query processing in highly distributed environments,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Lately the advances in centralized database management systems show a trendtowards supporting rank-aware query operators; like top-k; that enable users to retrieve onlythe most interesting data objects. A challenging problem is to support rank-aware queries inhighly distributed environments. In this paper; we present a novel approach; calledSPEERTO; for top-k query processing in large-scale peer-to-peer networks; where thedataset is horizontally distributed over the peers. Towards this goal; we explore theapplicability of the skyline operator for efficiently routing top-k queries in a large super-peernetwork. Relying on a thresholding scheme; SPEERTO returns the exact resultsprogressively to the user; while the number of queried super-peers and transferred data isminimized. Finally; we propose different variations of SPEERTO that allow balancing …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,98
Peer-to-peer similarity search in metric spaces,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract This paper addresses the efficient processing of similarity queries in metric spaces;where data is horizontally distributed across a P2P network. The proposed approach doesnot rely on arbitrary data movement; hence each peer joining the network autonomouslystores its own data. We present SIMPEER; a novel framework that dynamically clusters peerdata; in order to build distributed routing information at super-peer level. SIMPEER allowsthe evaluation of range and nearest neighbor queries in a distributed manner that reducescommunication cost; network latency; bandwidth consumption and computational overheadat each individual peer. SIMPEER utilizes a set of distributed statistics and guarantees thatall similar objects to the query are retrieved; without necessarily flooding the network duringquery processing. The statistics are employed for estimating an adequate query radius for …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,67
Efficient processing of top-k spatial preference queries,João B Rocha-Junior; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Top-k spatial preference queries return a ranked set of the k best data objectsbased on the scores of feature objects in their spatial neighborhood. Despite the wide rangeof location-based applications that rely on spatial preference queries; existing algorithmsincur non-negligible processing cost resulting in high response time. The reason is thatcomputing the score of a data object requires examining its spatial neighborhood to find thefeature object with highest score. In this paper; we propose a novel technique to speed upthe performance of top-k spatial preference queries.

Monochromatic and bichromatic reverse top-k queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Yannis Kotidis; Kjetil Norvag,Nowadays; most applications return to the user a limited set of ranked results based on theindividual user's preferences; which are commonly expressed through top-k queries. Fromthe perspective of a manufacturer; it is imperative that her products appear in the highestranked positions for many different user preferences; otherwise the product is not visible topotential customers. In this paper; we define a novel query type; namely the reverse top-kquery; that covers this requirement:“Given a potential product; which are the userpreferences that make this product belong to the top-k query result set?.” Reverse top-kqueries are essential for manufacturers to assess the impact of their products in the marketbased on the competition.

Identifying the most influential data objects with reverse top-k queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Top-k queries are widely applied for retrieving a ranked set of the k most interestingobjects based on the individual user preferences. As an example; in online marketplaces;customers (users) typically seek a ranked set of products (objects) that satisfy their needs.Reversing top-k queries leads to a query type that instead returns the set of customers thatfind a product appealing (it belongs to the top-k result set of their preferences). In this paper;we address the challenging problem of processing queries that identify the top-m mostinfluential products to customers; where influence is defined as the cardinality of the reversetop-k result set. This definition of influence is useful for market analysis; since it is directlyrelated to the number of customers that value a particular product and; consequently; to itsvisibility and impact in the market. Existing techniques require processing a reverse top-k …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,51
Branch-and-bound algorithm for reverse top-k queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Top-k queries return to the user only the k best objects based on the individual userpreferences and comprise an essential tool for rank-aware query processing. Assuming astored data set of user preferences; reverse top-k queries have been introduced forretrieving the users that deem a given database object as one of their top-k results. Reversetop-k queries have already attracted significant interest in research; due to numerous real-life applications such as market analysis and product placement. Currently; the most efficientalgorithm for computing the reverse top-k set is RTA. RTA has two main drawbacks whenprocessing a reverse top-k query:(i) it needs to access all stored user preferences; and (ii) itcannot avoid executing a top-k query for each user preference that belongs to the result set.To address these limitations; in this paper; we identify useful properties for processing …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,50
Constrained subspace skyline computation,Evangelos Dellis; Akrivi Vlachou; Ilya Vladimirskiy; Bernhard Seeger; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract In this paper we introduce the problem of Constrained Subspace Skyline Queries.This class of queries can be thought of as a generalization of subspace skyline queriesusing range constraints. Although both constrained skyline queries and subspace skylinequeries have been addressed previously; the implications of constrained subspace skylinequeries has not been examined so far. Constrained skyline queries are usually moreexpensive than regular skylines. In case of constrained subspace skyline queries additionalperformance degradation is caused through the projection. In order to support constrainedskylines for arbitrary subspaces; we present approaches exploiting multiple low-dimensionalindexes instead of relying on a single high-dimensional index. Effective pruning strategiesare applied to discard points from dominated regions.

AGiDS: A grid-based strategy for distributed skyline query processing,João Rocha-Junior; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Skyline queries help users make intelligent decisions over complex data; wheredifferent and often conflicting criteria are considered. A challenging problem is to supportskyline queries in distributed environments; where data is scattered over independentsources. The query response time of skyline processing over distributed data depends onthe amount of transferred data and the query processing cost at each server. In this paper;we propose AGiDS; a framework for efficient skyline processing over distributed data. Ourapproach reduces significantly the amount of transferred data; by using a grid-based datasummary that captures the data distribution on each server. AGiDS consists of two phases tocompute the result: in the first phase the querying server gathers the grid-based summary;whereas in the second phase a skyline request is sent only to the servers that may …,Data Management in Grid and Peer-to-Peer Systems,2009,39
Ranking the sky: Discovering the importance of skyline points through subspace dominance relationships,Akrivi Vlachou; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Skyline queries aim to help users make intelligent decisions over complex data bydiscovering a set of interesting points; when different and often conflicting criteria areconsidered. Unfortunately; as the dimensionality of the dataset grows; the skyline operatorloses its discriminating power and returns a large fraction of the data. The huge size of theresult set hinders decision-making and motivates the ranking of skyline points. Therefore;users prefer to retrieve the top-k skyline points instead of the whole skyline set. In this paper;we propose SKYRANK; a framework for ranking the skyline points in the absence of a user-defined preference function; thereby discovering a limited subset of the most interestingpoints of the skyline set. For this purpose; we define the skyline graph; which relies on thedominance relationships between the skyline points for different subsets of dimensions …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2010,37
Efficient execution plans for distributed skyline query processing,João B Rocha-Junior; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In this paper; we study the generation of efficient execution plans for skyline queryprocessing in large-scale distributed environments. In such a setting; each server storesautonomously a fraction of the data; thus all servers need to process the skyline query. Anexecution plan defines the order in which the individual skyline queries are processed ondifferent servers; and influences the performance of query processing. Querying serversconsecutively reduces the amount of transferred data and the number of queried servers;since skyline points obtained by one server prune points in the subsequent servers; but alsoincreases the latency of the system. To address this trade-off; we introduce a novelframework; called SkyPlan; for processing distributed skyline queries that generatesexecution plans aiming at optimizing the performance of query processing. Thus; we …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,36
Skyline query processing over joins,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Neoklis Polyzotis,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of efficiently computing the skyline set of arelational join. Existing techniques either require to access all tuples of the input relations ordemand specialized multi-dimensional access methods to generate the skyline join result.To avoid these inefficiencies; we introduce the novel SFSJ algorithm that fuses theidentification of skyline tuples with the computation of the join. SFSJ is able to compute thecorrect skyline set by accessing only a subset of the input tuples; ie; it has the property ofearly termination. SFSJ employs standard access methods for reading the input tuples andis readily implementable in an existing database system. Moreover; it can be used inpipelined execution plans; as it generates the skyline tuples progressively. Additionally; weformally analyze the performance of SFSJ and propose a novel strategy for accessing the …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,35
Distributed top-k query processing by exploiting skyline summaries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Recently; a trend has been observed towards supporting rank-aware queryoperators; such as top-k; that enable users to retrieve only a limited set of the mostinteresting data objects. As data nowadays is commonly stored distributed over multipleservers; a challenging problem is to support rank-aware queries in distributed environments.In this paper; we propose a novel approach; called DiTo; for efficient top-k processing overmultiple servers; where each server stores autonomously a fraction of the data. Towards thisgoal; we exploit the inherent relationship of top-k and skyline objects; and we employ theskyline objects of servers as a data summarization mechanism for efficiently identifying theservers that store top-k results. Relying on a thresholding scheme; DiTo retrieves the top-kresult set progressively; while the number of queried servers and transferred data is …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2012,27
Efficient search based on content similarity over self-organizing P2P networks,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract The advent of the World Wide Web has made an enormous amount of informationavailable to everyone and the widespread use of digital equipment enables end-users(peers) to produce their own digital content. This vast amount of information requiresscalable data management systems. Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have so far been wellestablished in several application areas; with file-sharing being the most prominent. Thenext challenge that needs to be addressed is (more complex) data sharing; managementand query processing; thus facilitating the delivery of a wide spectrum of novel data-centricapplications to the end-user; while providing high Quality-of-Service. In this paper; wepropose a self-organizing P2P system that is capable to identify peers with similar contentand intentionally assign them to the same super-peer.

Monitoring reverse top-k queries over mobile devices,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In typical mobile applications; mobile users seek points of interest in their vicinity(eg; nearby restaurants) that best match their preferences. We assume a set of points ofinterest described by a combination of static and dynamic attributes; and a set of mobileusers mi; each associated with a weighting vector wi; which expresses mi's preferences overthe aforementioned attribute set. The best points of interest for each mobile user correspondto the results of a top-k query; defined by the weighting vector wi; which is performed overthe combined set of static and dynamic attributes. The dynamic attribute is the currentdistance between the mobile user and the point of interest. Under these assumptions; thepotential customers of a given point of interest q are the mobile users whose weightingvectors wi belong to the reverse top-k set of q.

Efficient distributed top-k query processing with caching,Norvald Ryeng; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Recently; there has been an increased interest in incorporating in databasemanagement systems rank-aware query operators; such as top-k queries; that allow users toretrieve only the most interesting data objects. In this paper; we propose a cache-basedapproach for efficiently supporting top-k queries in distributed database managementsystems. In large distributed systems; the query performance depends mainly on the networkcost; measured as the number of tuples transmitted over the network. Ideally; only the ktuples that belong to the query result set should be transmitted. Nevertheless; a servercannot decide based only on its local data which tuples belong to the result set. Therefore; inthis paper; we use caching of previous results to reduce the number of tuples that must befetched over the network. To this end; our approach always delivers as many tuples as …,Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,22
Skyline-based peer-to-peer top-k query processing,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvå; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Due to applications and systems such as sensor networks; data streams; and peer-to-peer(P2P) networks; data generation and storage become increasingly distributed. Therefore achallenging problem is to support best-match query processing in highly distributedenvironments. In this paper; we present a novel framework for top-k query processing inlarge-scale P2P networks; where the dataset is horizontally distributed to peers. Ourproposed framework returns the exact results to the user; while minimizing the number ofqueried super-peers and transferred data.

Efficient routing of subspace skyline queries over highly distributed data,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Data generation increases at highly dynamic rates; making its storage; processing; andupdate costs at one central location excessive. The P2P paradigm emerges as a powerfulmodel for organizing and searching large data repositories distributed over independentsources. Advanced query operators; such as skyline queries; are necessary in order to helpusers handle the huge amount of available data. A skyline query retrieves the set ofnondominated data points in a multidimensional data set. Skyline query processing in P2Pnetworks poses inherent challenges and demands nontraditional techniques; due to thedistribution of content and the lack of global knowledge.

Apskyline: Improved skyline computation for multicore architectures,Stian Liknes; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract The trend towards in-memory analytics and CPUs with an increasing number ofcores calls for new algorithms that can efficiently utilize the available resources. This need isparticularly evident in the case of CPU-intensive query operators. One example of such aquery with applicability in data analytics is the skyline query. In this paper; we present APSkyline; a new approach for multicore skyline query processing; which adheres to the partition-execute-merge framework. Contrary to existing research; we focus on the partitioning phaseto achieve significant performance gains; an issue largely overlooked in previous work inmulticore processing. In particular; APS kyline employs an angle-based partitioningapproach; which increases the degree of pruning that can be achieved in the executephase; thus significantly reducing the number of candidate points that need to be checked …,*,2014,17
Bandwidth-constrained distributed skyline computation,Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Skyline queries have been studied in centralized systems; but also in distributedenvironments; such as web information systems and peer-to-peer networks. Most of theexisting work focuses on efficient processing of skyline queries that return the exact andcomplete result set. In this paper; we study skyline computation in a distributed environmentunder the assumption of a given upper bound on the bandwidth consumption. Supportingsuch a constraint is very important in a mobile environment; where data transmissions maylead to deterioration of query processing performance; while imposing high cost for themobile device in terms of energy consumption. Therefore; the cost of transferring all datapoints that may contribute to the skyline result set to the querying server is often prohibitive.Our target is; given an upper bound of bandwidth consumption; to maximize the quality of …,Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access,2009,16
Processing of rank joins in highly distributed systems,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis; Neoklis Polyzotis,In this paper; we study efficient processing of rank joins in highly distributed systems; whereservers store fragments of relations in an autonomous manner. Existing rank-join algorithmsexhibit poor performance in this setting due to excessive communication costs or highlatency. We propose a novel distributed rank-join framework that employs data statistics;maintained as histograms; to determine the subset of each relational fragment that needs tobe fetched to generate the top-k join results. At the heart of our framework lies a distributedscore bound estimation algorithm that produces sufficient score bounds for each relation;that guarantee the correctness of the rank-join result set; when the histograms are accurate.Furthermore; we propose a generalization of our framework that supports approximatestatistics; in the case that the exact statistical information is not available.

Distributed semantic overlay networks,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Semantic Overlay Networks (SONs) have been recently proposed as a way toorganize content in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The main objective is to discover peerswith similar content and then form thematically focused peer groups. Efficient contentretrieval can be performed by having queries selectively forwarded only to relevant groupsof peers to the query. As a result; less peers need to be contacted; in order to answer aquery. In this context; the challenge is to generate SONs in a decentralized and distributedmanner; as the centralized assembly of global information is not feasible. Differentapproaches for exploiting the generated SONs for content retrieval have been proposed inthe literature; which are examined in this chapter; with a particular focus on SONinterconnections for efficient search.

Multidimensional routing indices for efficient distributed query processing,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Traditional routing indices in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are mainly designed fordocument retrieval applications and maintain aggregated one-dimensional valuesrepresenting the number of documents that can be obtained in a certain direction in thenetwork. In this paper; we introduce the concept of multidimensional routing indices (MRIs);which are suitable for handling multidimensional data represented by minimum boundingregions (MBRs). Depending on data distribution on peers; the aggregation of the MBRs maylead to MRIs that exhibit extremely poor performance; which renders them ineffective. Thus;focusing on a hybrid unstructured P2P network; we analyze the parameters for buildingMRIs of high selectivity. We present techniques that boost the query routing performance bydetecting similar peers and grouping and reassigning these peers to other parts of the …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,14
Nearest neighbor search on vertically partitioned high-dimensional data,Evangelos Dellis; Bernhard Seeger; Akrivi Vlachou,Abstract In this paper; we present a new approach to indexing multidimensional data that isparticularly suitable for the efficient incremental processing of nearest neighbor queries. Thebasic idea is to use index-striping that vertically splits the data space into multiple low-andmedium-dimensional data spaces. The data from each of these lower-dimensionalsubspaces is organized by using a standard multi-dimensional index structure. In order toperform incremental NN-queries on top of index-striping efficiently; we first develop analgorithm for merging the results received from the underlying indexes. Then; an accuratecost model relying on a power law is presented that determines an appropriate number ofindexes. Moreover; we consider the problem of dimension assignment; where eachdimension is assigned to a lower-dimensional subspace; such that the cost of nearest …,Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2005,13

Discovering representative skyline points over distributed data,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Maria Halkidi,Abstract Skyline queries help users make intelligent decisions over complex data. The mainshortcoming of skyline queries is that the cardinality of the result set is not known a-priori. Toovercome this limitation; the representative skyline query has been proposed; whichretrieves a fixed set of k skyline points that best describe all skyline points. Even though therepresentative skyline has been studied before in centralized environments; this is the firstpaper that addresses efficient computation of the representative skyline in distributedsystems. The distributed nature of the environment makes the task of discovering trulyrepresentative skyline points even more challenging. In this paper; we propose a novelframework for discovering the representative skyline over distributed data sources. Ourexperimental study demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2012,9
Link-based ranking of skyline result sets,Akrivi Vlachou; Michalis Vazirgiannis,ABSTRACT Skyline query processing has received considerable attention in the recent past.Mainly; the skyline query is used to find a set of non dominated data points in a multi-dimensional dataset. One of the major drawbacks of the skyline operator is the highcardinality of the result set. Providing the most interesting points of the skyline set (top-k)inherently involves the ranking of the skyline points. In this paper; we propose a method forranking the skyline points and therefore for answering top-k skyline queries. First; weintroduce the notion of the skyline graph which relies on the dominance relationship of theskyline points in all possible subspaces of the original data space. Using theaforementioned mapping; we can apply well-known link-based ranking algorithms on theskyline graph. Unlike most previously proposed ranking approaches we do not rely on …,Proceedings of the 3rd Multidisciplinary Workshop on Advances in Preference Handling; M-Pref,2007,9

Location-aware tag recommendations for flickr,Ioanna Miliou; Akrivi Vlachou,Abstract Flickr is one of the largest online image collections; where shared photos aretypically annotated with tags. The tagging process bridges the gap between visual contentand keyword search by providing a meaningful textual description of the tagged object.However; the task of tagging is cumbersome; therefore tag recommendation is commonlyused to suggest relevant tags to the user. Apart from textual tagging based on keywords; anincreasing trend of geotagging has been recently observed; as witnessed by the increasednumber of geotagged photos in Flickr. Even though there exist different methods for tagrecommendation of photos; the gain of using spatial and textual information in order torecommend more meaningful tags to users has not been studied yet.

Peer-to-peer similarity search based on m-tree indexing,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Similarity search in metric spaces has several important applications both incentralized and distributed environments. In centralized applications; such as similarity-based image retrieval; usually a server indexes its data with a state-of-the-art centralizedmetric indexing technique; such as the M-Tree. In this paper; we propose a framework fordistributed similarity search; where each participating peer stores its own dataautonomously; under the assumption that data is indexed locally by peers using M-Trees. Inorder to support scalability and efficiency of search; we adopt a super-peer architecture;where super-peers are responsible for query routing. We propose the construction of metricrouting indices suitable for distributed similarity search in metric spaces.

However; customer preferences change over time; and product manufacturersare interested in monitoring the evolution of the popularity of their products; in order todiscover those products that are consistently highly ranked. To take into account thetemporal dimension; we define the continuous influential query and present algorithms forefficient processing and retrieval of continuous influential data objects. Furthermore; ouralgorithms support incremental retrieval of the next continuous influential data object in anatural way.

In all these applications; data is typically voluminous andmultidimensional; and support for advanced query operators is required for effectivequerying and efficient processing. To address this challenge; we adopt a hybrid P2Parchitecture and propose novel indexing and query processing algorithms. We present ascalable framework that relies on data summaries that are distributed and maintained asmultidimensional routing indices. Different types of data summaries enable efficientprocessing of a variety of advanced query operators.,*,2012,6
Efficient range query processing in metric spaces over highly distributed data,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Similarity search in P2P systems has attracted a lot of attention recently and severalimportant applications; like distributed image search; can profit from the proposed distributedalgorithms. In this paper; we address the challenging problem of efficient processing ofrange queries in metric spaces; where data is horizontally distributed across a super-peernetwork. Our approach relies on SIMPEER (Doulkeridis et al. in Proceedings of VLDB; pp.986–997; 2007); a framework that dynamically clusters peer data; in order to builddistributed routing information at super-peer level. SIMPEER allows the evaluation of exactrange and nearest neighbor queries in a distributed manner that reduces communicationcost; network latency; bandwidth consumption and computational overhead at eachindividual peer. In this paper; we extend SIMPEER by focusing on efficient range query …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2009,6
Representing and quantifying rank-change for the Web graph,Akrivi Vlachou; Michalis Vazirgiannis; Klaus Berberich,Abstract One of the grand research and industrial challenges in recent years is efficient websearch; inherently involving the issue of page ranking. In this paper we address the issue ofrepresenting and quantifying web ranking trends as a measure of web pages. We study therank position of a web page among different snapshots of the web graph and proposenormalized measures of ranking trends that are comparable among web graph snapshots ofdifferent sizes. We define the ra nk c hang er ate (racer) as a measure quantifying the webgraph evolution. Thereafter; we examine different ways to aggregate the rank change ratesand quantify the trends over a group of web pages. We outline the problem of identifyinghighly dynamic web pages and discuss possible future work. In our experimental evaluationwe study the dynamics of web pages; especially those highly ranked.,Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph,2008,6
Skyline Query Processing over Encrypted Data: An Attribute-Order-Preserving-Free Approach,Suvarna Bothe; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Panagiotis Karras; Akrivi Vlachou,Abstract Making co-existent and convergent the need for efficiency of relational queryprocessing over Clouds and the security of data themselves is figuring-out how one of themost challenging research problems in the Big Data era. Indeed; in actual analytics-orientedengines; such as Google Analytics and Amazon S3; where key-value storage-representationand efficient-management models are employed as to cope with the simultaneousprocessing of billions of transactions; querying encrypted data is becoming one of the mostannoying problem; which has also attracted a great deal of attention from the researchcommunity. While this issue has been applied to a large variety of data formats; egrelational; RDF and multidimensional data; very few initiatives have pointed-out skylinequery processing over encrypted data; which is; indeed; relevant for database analytics …,Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Privacy and Secuirty of Big Data,2014,5
eSkyline: processing skyline queries over encrypted data,Suvarna Bothe; Panagiotis Karras; Akrivi Vlachou,Abstract The advent of cloud computing redefines the traditional query processing paradigm.Whereas computational overhead and memory constraints become less prohibitive; dataprivacy; security; and confidentiality concerns become top priorities. In particular; as dataowners outsource the management of their data to service providers; query processing oversuch data has more resources to tap into; yet the data oftentimes has to be encrypted so asto prevent unauthorized access. The challenge that arises in such a setting is to devise anencryption scheme that still allows for query results to be efficiently computed using theencrypted data values. An important type of query that raises unconventional requirementsin terms of the operator that has to be evaluated is the skyline query; which returns a set ofobjects in a dataset whose values are not dominated by any other object therein.

Distributed skyline processing: a trend in database research still going strong,Katja Hose; Akrivi Vlachou,Abstract During the last decade; data management and storage have become increasinglydistributed. In consideration of the huge amount of data available in such systems; advancedquery operators; such as skyline queries; are necessary to help users process the data. Forexample; a user who is interested in buying a car wants to find a good trade-off betweenminimum age and minimum price. It is not obvious how much cheaper a car should be; if it isone year older than another car. Thus; the skyline query will retrieve a set of data items thatare the best trade-offs for the user's preferences. The skyline operator has been proposedabout a decade ago; but research on skyline queries; especially in distributed scenarios; isstill an ongoing process. Query processing in distributed environments poses inherentchallenges and requires non-traditional techniques due to the distribution of content and …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,5
Maximizing Influence of Spatio-Textual Objects Based on Keyword Selection,Orestis Gkorgkas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In modern applications; spatial objects are often annotated with textual descriptions;and users are offered the opportunity to formulate spatio-textual queries. The result set ofsuch a query consists of spatio-textual objects ranked according to their distance from adesired location and to their textual relevance to the query. In this context; a challengingproblem is how to select a set of at most b keywords to enhance the description of thefacilities of a spatial object; in order to make the object appear in the top-k results of as manyusers as possible. In this paper; we formulate this problem; called Best-terms and we showthat it is NP-hard. Hence; we present a baseline algorithm that provides an approximatesolution to the problem. Then; we introduce a novel algorithm for keyword selection thatgreatly improves the efficiency of query processing. By means of a thorough experimental …,*,2015,4
Finding the Most Diverse Products using Preference Queries,Orestis Gkorgkas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,ABSTRACT In this paper; given a product database and a set of customer preferences; weaddress the problem of discovering a bounded set of r diverse products that attract theinterests of different customers. This problem finds numerous applications in electronicmarketplaces; eg; for selecting the products that are placed in the home page of an onlineshop. Existing approaches to tackle this problem fall short because they ignore customerpreferences; and instead rely solely on products' attributes. We model this problem as adiversity problem; where each product is represented by its reverse top-k result set; andseek r products that maximize their diversity value. Since the problem is NP-hard; we employa greedy algorithm that takes as input the reverse top-k result sets of all candidate products.To further improve performance; we also design a more efficient approximate algorithm …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology; EDBT,2015,3

Efficient processing of exploratory top-k joins,Orestis Gkorgkas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of discovering a ranked set of k distinct mainobjects combined with additional (accessory) objects that best fit the given preferences. Thisproblem is challenging because it considers object combinations of variable size; whereobjects are combined only if the combination produces a higher score; and thus becomesmore preferable to a user. In this way; users can explore overviews of combinations that aremore suited to their preferences than single objects; without the need to explicitly specifywhich objects should be combined. We model this problem as a rank-join problem whereeach combination is represented by a set of tuples from different relations and we call therespective query eXploratory Top-k Join query. Existing approaches fall short to tackle thisproblem because they impose a fixed size of combinations; they do not distinguish on …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,2
On the selectivity of multidimensional routing indices,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Recently; the problem of efficiently supporting advanced query operators; such asnearest neighbor or range queries; over multidimensional data in widely distributedenvironments has attracted much attention. In unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks;peers store data in an autonomous manner; thus multidimensional routing indices (MRI) arerequired; in order to route user queries efficiently to only those peers that may contribute tothe query result set. Focusing on a hybrid unstructured P2P network; in this paper; weanalyze the parameters for building MRI of high selectivity. In the case where similar dataare located at different parts of the network; MRI exhibit extremely poor performance; whichrenders them ineffective. We present algorithms that boost the query routing performance bydetecting similar peers and reassigning these peers to other parts of the hybrid network in …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,2
Exploratory product search using top-k join queries,Orestis Gkorgkas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Given a relation that contains main products and a set of relations corresponding toaccessory products that can be combined with a main product; the Exploratory Top-k Joinquery retrieves the k best combinations of main and accessory products based on userpreferences. As a result; the user is presented with a set of k combinations of distinct mainproducts; where a main product is combined with accessory products only if the combinationhas a better score than the single main product. We model this problem as a rank-joinproblem; where each combination is represented by a tuple from the main relation and a setof tuples from (some of) the accessory relations. The nature of the problem is challengingbecause the inclusion of accessory products is not predefined by the user; but instead allpotential combinations (joins) are explored during query processing in order to identify …,Information Systems,2017,1

User-Centric Similarity Search,Konstantinos Georgoulas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Yannis Kotidis,User preferences play a significant role in market analysis. In the database literature; therehas been extensive work on query primitives; such as the well known top-k query that can beused for the ranking of products based on the preferences customers have expressed. Still;the fundamental operation that evaluates the similarity between products is typically doneignoring these preferences. Instead products are depicted in a feature space based on theirattributes and similarity is computed via traditional distance metrics on that space. In thiswork; we utilize the rankings of the products based on the opinions of their customers inorder to map the products in a user-centric space where similarity calculations areperformed. We identify important properties of this mapping that result in upper and lowersimilarity bounds; which in turn permit us to utilize conventional multidimensional indexes …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
Efficient processing of top-k joins in MapReduce,Mei Saouk; Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou,Top-k join is an essential tool for data analysis; since it enables selective retrieval of the kbest combined results that come from multiple different input datasets. In the context of BigData; processing top-k joins over huge datasets requires a scalable platform; such as thewidely popular MapReduce framework. However; such a solution does not necessarily implyefficient processing; due to inherent limitations related to MapReduce. In particular; theseinclude lack of an early termination mechanism for accessing only subset of input data; aswell as an appropriate load balancing mechanism tailored to the top-k join problem. Apartfrom these issues; a significant research problem is how to determine the subset of theinputs that is guaranteed to produce the correct top-k join result. In this paper; we addressthese challenges by proposing an algorithm for efficient top-k join processing in …,Big Data (Big Data); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,1

RoadRunnerfocuses on a specific class of queries that involve ranking; such as top-k queries and top-kjoins; as well as on preference-aware queries; such as skyline queries; which are tightlyrelated. For this class of queries; we identify improvements on various stages of MapReduceprocessing; which result in improved performance without sacrificing scalability.

A Framework for Clustering and Classification of Big Data Using Spark,Xristos Mallios; Vasilis Vassalos; Tassos Venetis; Akrivi Vlachou,Abstract Nowadays; massive data sets are generated in many modern applications rangingfrom economics to bioinformatics; and from social networks to scientific databases. Typically;such data need to be processed by machine learning algorithms; which entails highprocessing cost and usually requires the execution of iterative algorithms. Spark has beenrecently proposed as a framework that supports iterative algorithms over massive dataefficiently. In this paper; we design a framework for clustering and classification of big datasuitable for Spark.
