High weight fraction surfactant solubilization of single-wall carbon nanotubes in water,MF Islam; E Rojas; DM Bergey; AT Johnson; AG Yodh,We report a simple process to solubilize high weight fraction single-wall carbon nanotubesin water by the nonspecific physical adsorption of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate. Thediameter distribution of nanotubes in the dispersion; measured by atomic force microscopy;showed that even at 20 mg/mL∼ 63±5% of single-wall carbon nanotube bundles exfoliatedinto single tubes. A measure of the length distribution of the nanotubes showed that ourdispersion technique reduced nanotube fragmentation.,Nano letters,2003,1861
Carbon nanotube composites for thermal management,MJ Biercuk; Mark C Llaguno; M Radosavljevic; JK Hyun; Alan T Johnson; John E Fischer,Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were used to augment the thermal transportproperties of industrial epoxy. Samples loaded with 1 wt% unpurified SWNT materialshowed a 70% increase in thermal conductivity at 40 K; rising to 125% at room temperature;the enhancement due to 1 wt% loading of vapor grown carbon fibers was three timessmaller. Electrical conductivity data showed a percolation threshold between 0.1 and 0.2wt% SWNT loading. The Vickers hardness rose monotonically with SWNT loading up to afactor of 3.5 at 2 wt%. These results suggest that the thermal and mechanical properties ofSWNT-epoxy composites are improved; without the need to chemically functionalize thenanotubes.,Applied physics letters,2002,1849
Electrical and thermal transport properties of magnetically aligned single wall carbon nanotube films,J Hone; MC Llaguno; NM Nemes; AT Johnson; JE Fischer; DA Walters; MJ Casavant; J Schmidt; RE Smalley,Dense; thick films of aligned single wall carbon nanotubes and nanotube ropes have beenproduced by filtration/deposition from suspension in strong magnetic fields. Electricalresistivity exhibits moderate anisotropy with respect to the alignment axis; while thethermopower is the same when measured parallel or perpendicular to this axis. Bothparameters have identical temperature dependencies in the two orientations. Thermalconductivity in the parallel direction exceeds 200 W/mK; within a decade of graphite.,Applied physics letters,2000,894
Intrinsic response of graphene vapor sensors,Yaping Dan; Ye Lu; Nicholas J Kybert; Zhengtang Luo; AT Charlie Johnson,Graphene is a two-dimensional material with extremely favorable chemical sensorproperties. Conventional nanolithography typically leaves a resist residue on the graphenesurface; whose impact on the sensor characteristics has not yet been determined. Here weshow that the contamination layer chemically dopes the graphene; enhances carrierscattering; and acts as an absorbent layer that concentrates analyte molecules at thegraphene surface; thereby enhancing the sensor response. We demonstrate a cleaningprocess that verifiably removes the contamination on the device structure and allows theintrinsic chemical responses of the graphene monolayer to be measured. These intrinsicresponses are surprisingly small; even upon exposure to strong analytes such as ammoniavapor.,Nano letters,2009,785
DNA translocation through graphene nanopores,Christopher A Merchant; Ken Healy; Meni Wanunu; Vishva Ray; Neil Peterman; John Bartel; Michael D Fischbein; Kimberly Venta; Zhengtang Luo; AT Charlie Johnson; Marija Drndic,We report on DNA translocations through nanopores created in graphene membranes.Devices consist of 1− 5 nm thick graphene membranes with electron-beam sculptednanopores from 5 to 10 nm in diameter. Due to the thin nature of the graphene membranes;we observe larger blocked currents than for traditional solid-state nanopores. However; ioniccurrent noise levels are several orders of magnitude larger than those for silicon nitridenanopores. These fluctuations are reduced with the atomic-layer deposition of 5 nm oftitanium dioxide over the device. Unlike traditional solid-state nanopore materials that areinsulating; graphene is an excellent electrical conductor. Use of graphene as a membranematerial opens the door to a new class of nanopore devices in which electronic sensing andcontrol are performed directly at the pore.,Nano letters,2010,642

All fibers in a given preparation of certain polymers have diameters<lOOnm. Fibers of 100% doped polyaniline as well as its blends in polymers such aspolystyrene and polyethylene oxide have been prepared. Current/voltage in addition toconductivity/temperature relationships of single fibers as small as 419 nm have beenobtained. Polyacrylonitrile and polystyrene fibers can be easily and uniformly coated fromaqueous solution with conducting polypyrrole or with gold by electroless deposition.Polyacrylonitrile fibers can be thermally converted to conducting carbon nanofibers.,Synthetic Metals,2001,590
Quantized current in a quantum-dot turnstile using oscillating tunnel barriers,LP Kouwenhoven; AT Johnson; NC Van der Vaart; CJPM Harmans; Cf T Foxon,Abstract We have observed a quantized current in a lateral quantum dot; defined by metalgates in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. Bymodulating the tunnel barriers in the 2DEG with two phase-shifted rf signals; and employingthe Coulomb blockade of electron tunneling; we produced quantized current plateaus in thecurrent-voltage characteristics at integer multiples of ef; where f is the rf frequency. Thisdemonstrates that an integer number of electrons pass through the quantum dot each rfcycle.,Physical Review Letters,1991,563
Quantized phonon spectrum of single-wall carbon nanotubes,J Hone; B Batlogg; Z Benes; AT Johnson; JE Fischer,The electronic spectra of carbon nanotubes and other nanoscale systems are quantizedbecause of their small radii. Similar quantization in the phonon spectra has been difficult toobserve because of the far smaller energy scale. We probed this regime by measuring thetemperature-dependent specific heat of purified single-wall nanotubes. The data show directevidence of one-dimensional quantized phonon subbands. Above 4 kelvin; they are inexcellent agreement with model calculations of individual nanotubes and differ markedlyfrom the specific heat of two-dimensional graphene or three-dimensional graphite. Detailedmodeling yields an energy of 4.3 millielectron volts for the lowest quantized phononsubband and a tube-tube (or “lattice”) Debye energy of 1.1 millielectron volts; implying asmall intertube coupling in bundles.,Science,2000,541
DNA-decorated carbon nanotubes for chemical sensing,Cristian Staii; Alan T Johnson; Michelle Chen; Alan Gelperin,We demonstrate a new; versatile class of nanoscale chemical sensors based on single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) as the chemical recognition site and single-walled carbon nanotubefield effect transistors (swCN-FETs) as the electronic read-out component. swCN-FETs witha nanoscale coating of ss-DNA respond to gas odors that do not cause a detectableconductivity change in bare devices. Responses of ss-DNA/swCN-FETs differ in sign andmagnitude for different gases and can be tuned by choosing the base sequence of the ss-DNA. ss-DNA/swCN-FET sensors detect a variety of odors; with rapid response andrecovery times on the scale of seconds. The sensor surface is self-regenerating: samplesmaintain a constant response with no need for sensor refreshing through at least 50 gasexposure cycles. This remarkable set of attributes makes sensors based on ss-DNA …,Nano Letters,2005,535
High yield preparation of macroscopic graphene oxide membranes,Zhengtang Luo; Ye Lu; Luke A Somers; AT Charlie Johnson,Graphene oxide membranes up to 2000 μm2 in size can be synthesized with 90% yield inbulk quantities through a microwave-assisted chemical method.

Crystallographic etching of few-layer graphene,Sujit S Datta; Douglas R Strachan; Samuel M Khamis; AT Charlie Johnson,We demonstrate a method by which few-layer graphene samples can be etched alongcrystallographic axes by thermally activated metallic nanoparticles. The technique results inlong (> 1 μm) crystallographic edges etched through to the insulating substrate; making theprocess potentially useful for atomically precise graphene device fabrication. This advancecould enable atomically precise construction of integrated circuits from single graphenesheets with a wide range of technological applications.,Nano letters,2008,465
Thermal properties of carbon nanotubes and nanotube-based materials,J Hone; MC Llaguno; MJ Biercuk; AT Johnson; B Batlogg; Z Benes; JE Fischer,Abstract. The thermal properties of carbon nanotubes are directly related to their uniquestructure and small size. Because of these properties; nanotubes may prove to be an idealmaterial for the study of low-dimensional phonon physics; and for thermal management;both on the macro-and the micro-scale. We have begun to explore the thermal properties ofnanotubes by measuring the specific heat and thermal conductivity of bulk SWNT samples.In addition; we have synthesized nanotube-based composite materials and measured theirthermal conductivity. The measured specific heat of single-walled nanotubes differs from thatof both 2D graphene and 3D graphite; especially at low temperatures; where 1Dquantization of the phonon bandstructure is observed. The measured specific heat showsonly weak effects of intertube coupling in nanotube bundling; suggesting that this …,Applied physics A,2002,465
Photoluminescence and band gap modulation in graphene oxide,Zhengtang Luo; Patrick M Vora; Eugene J Mele; AT Charlie Johnson; James M Kikkawa,We report broadband visible photoluminescence from solid graphene oxide; andmodifications of the emission spectrum by progressive chemical reduction. The data suggesta gapping of the two-dimensional electronic system by removal of π-electrons. We discusspossible gapping mechanisms; and propose that a Kekule pattern of bond distortions mayaccount for the observed behavior.,Applied physics letters,2009,455
Nonvolatile molecular memory elements based on ambipolar nanotube field effect transistors,M Radosavljević; M Freitag; KV Thadani; AT Johnson,We have fabricated air-stable n-type; ambipolar carbon nanotube field effect transistors(CNFETs) and used them in nanoscale memory cells. n-Type transistors are achieved byannealing nanotubes in hydrogen gas and contacting them by cobalt electrodes. Scanninggate microscopy reveals that the bulk response of these devices is similar to gold-contactedp-CNFETs; confirming that Schottky barrier formation at the contact interface determinesaccessibility of electron and hole transport regimes. The transfer characteristics andCoulomb blockade (CB) spectroscopy in ambipolar devices show strongly enhanced gatecoupling; most likely due to reduction of defect density at the silicon/silicon-dioxide interfaceduring hydrogen anneal. The CB data in the “on”-state indicates that these CNFETs arenearly ballistic conductors at high electrostatic doping. Due to their nanoscale …,Nano Letters,2002,433
Mapping the one-dimensional electronic states of nanotube peapod structures,DJ Hornbaker; S-J Kahng; S Misra; BW Smith; AT Johnson; EJ Mele; DE Luzzi; A Yazdani,Arrays of C 60 molecules nested inside single-walled nanotubes represent a class ofnanoscale materials having tunable properties. We report electronic measurements of thissystem made with a scanning tunneling microscope and demonstrate that the encapsulatedC 60 molecules modify the local electronic structure of the nanotube. Our measurementsand calculations also show that a periodic array of C 60 molecules gives rise to a hybridelectronic band; which derives its character from both the nanotube states and the C 60molecular orbitals.,Science,2002,418
Zero-dimensional states and single electron charging in quantum dots,AT Johnson; LP Kouwenhoven; W De Jong; NC Van der Vaart; CJPM Harmans; CT Foxon,Abstract We observe new transport effects in lateral quantum dots where zero-dimensional(0D) states and single electron charging coexist. In linear transport we see coherentresonant tunneling; described by a Landauer formula despite the many-body charginginteraction. In the nonlinear regime; Coulomb oscillations of a quantum dot with about 25electrons show structure due to 0D excited states as the bias voltage increases; and thecurrent-voltage characteristic has a double-staircase shape.,Physical Review Letters,1992,371
Electrospun polyaniline/polyethylene oxide nanofiber field-effect transistor,NJ Pinto; AT Johnson Jr; AG MacDiarmid; CH Mueller; N Theofylaktos; DC Robinson; FA Miranda,We report on the observation of field-effect transistor (FET) behavior in electrospuncamphorsulfonic-acid-doped polyaniline/polyethylene oxide (PEO) nanofibers. Saturationchannel currents are observed at surprisingly low source–drain voltages. The hole mobilityin the depletion regime is 1.4× 10− 4 cm 2/V s; while the one-dimensional (1-D) chargedensity (at zero gate bias) is calculated to be approximately 1 hole per 50 two-ring repeatunits of polyaniline; consistent with the rather high channel conductivity (∼ 10− 3 S/cm).Reducing or eliminating the PEO content in the fiber is expected to enhance deviceparameters. Electrospinning is thus proposed as a simple method of fabricating one-dimensional polymer FETs.,Applied physics letters,2003,358
Probing the structure of DNA− carbon nanotube hybrids with molecular dynamics,Robert R Johnson; AT Charlie Johnson; Michael L Klein,DNA− carbon nanotube hybrids (DNA− CN) are novel nanoscale materials that consist ofsingle-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCN) coated with a self-assembled monolayer of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Recent experiments on DNA− CN have shown that this materialoffers a remarkable set of technologically useful properties such as facilitation of SWCNsorting; chemical sensing; and detection of DNA hybridization. Despite the importance ofDNA− CN; a detailed understanding of its microscopic structure and physical properties islacking. To address this; we have performed classical all-atom molecular dynamics (MD)simulations exploring the self-assembly mechanisms; structure; and energetic properties ofthis nanomaterial. MD reveals that SWCN induces ssDNA to undergo a spontaneousconformational change that enables the hybrid to self-assemble via the π− π stacking …,Nano Letters,2008,349
Controlled fabrication of nanogaps in ambient environment for molecular electronics,DR Strachan; DE Smith; DE Johnston; T-H Park; Michael J Therien; DA Bonnell; AT Johnson,We have developed a controlled and highly reproducible method of making nanometer-spaced electrodes using electromigration in ambient lab conditions. This advance will makefeasible single molecule measurements of macromolecules with tertiary and quaternarystructures that do not survive the liquid-helium temperatures at which electromigration istypically performed. A second advance is that it yields gaps of desired tunneling resistance;as opposed to the random formation at liquid-helium temperatures. Nanogap formationoccurs through three regimes: First it evolves through a bulk-neck regime whereelectromigration is triggered at constant temperature; then to a few-atom regimecharacterized by conductance quantum plateaus and jumps; and finally to a tunnelingregime across the nanogap once the conductance falls below the conductance quantum.,Applied Physics Letters,2005,301
Single electron charging effects in semiconductor quantum dots,LP Kouwenhoven; NC Van der Vaart; AT Johnson; W Kool; CJPM Harmans; JG Williamson; AAM Staring; CT Foxon,Abstract We have studied charging effects in a lateral split-gate quantum dot defined bymetal gates in the two dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure.The gate structure allows an independent control of the conductances of the two tunnelbarriers separating the quantum dot from the two 2 DEG leads; and enables us to vary thenumber of electrons that are localized in the dot. We have measured Coulomb oscillations inthe conductance and the Coulomb staircase in current-voltage characteristics and studiedtheir dependence on the conductances of the tunnel barriers. We show experimentally thatat zero magnetic field charging effects start to affect the transport properties when bothbarrier conductances are smaller than the first quantized conductance value of a pointcontact at 2 e 2/h. The experiments are described by a simple model in terms of …,Zeitschrift für Physik B Condensed Matter,1991,268
Photoconductivity of self-assembled porphyrin nanorods,Alexander D Schwab; Deirdre E Smith; Brooks Bond-Watts; Danvers E Johnston; James Hone; Alan T Johnson; Julio C de Paula; Walter F Smith,The photoconductivity of nanorods self-assembled from meso-tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl)porphine is described. The nanorods are insulating in the dark. Upon illumination with 488nm light; the nanorods become photoconductive; exhibiting a rapid turn on/off (< 100 ms) ofthe current when the light is turned on/off. This photoconductivity grows over hundreds ofseconds with light exposure and decays slowly when the light is off. The nanorods can betrained via an applied bias to exhibit a short-circuit photocurrent (with corresponding open-circuit photovoltage) that flows in the direction opposite that of the training bias. A qualitativemodel is proposed; in which conduction occurs through the tightly coupled LUMOs of close-packed porphyrin molecules.,Nano Letters,2004,241
Effect of substrate roughness and feedstock concentration on growth of wafer-scale graphene at atmospheric pressure,Zhengtang Luo; Ye Lu; Daniel W Singer; Matthew E Berck; Luke A Somers; Brett R Goldsmith; AT Charlie Johnson,The growth of large-area graphene on catalytic metal substrates is a topic of bothfundamental and technological interest. We have developed an atmospheric pressurechemical vapor deposition (CVD) method that is potentially more cost-effective andcompatible with industrial production than approaches based on synthesis under highvacuum. Surface morphology of the catalytic Cu substrate and the concentration of carbonfeedstock gas were found to be crucial factors in determining the homogeneity andelectronic transport properties of the final graphene film. The use of an electropolished metalsurface and low methane concentration enabled the growth of graphene samples withsingle layer content exceeding 95%.

Fabrication and electrical characterization of polyaniline-based nanofibers with diameter below 30 nm,Yangxin Zhou; Marcus Freitag; James Hone; Cristian Staii; AT Johnson Jr; Nicholas J Pinto; AG MacDiarmid,We fabricate and electrically characterize electrospun nanofibers of doped polyaniline/polyethylene oxide (PAn/PEO) blend with sub-30 nm diameter. Fiber diameters near 5 nmare obtained for optimized process parameters. Scanning conductance microscopy (SCM)shows that fibers with diameter below 15 nm are electrically insulating; the small diametermay allow complete dedoping in air or be smaller than phase-separated grains of PAn andPEO. Electrical contacts to nanofibers are made by shadow mask evaporation with nochemical or thermal damage to the fibers. Single fiber I–V characteristics show that thinfibers conduct more poorly than thick ones; in agreement with SCM data. I–V s of asymmetricfibers are rectifying; consistent with formation of Schottky barriers at the nanofiber-metalcontacts.,Applied Physics Letters,2003,232
Surface potentials and layer charge distributions in few-layer graphene films,Sujit S Datta; Douglas R Strachan; EJ Mele; AT Charlie Johnson,Graphene-derived nanomaterials are emerging as ideal candidates for postsiliconelectronics. Elucidating the electronic interaction between an insulating substrate and few-layer graphene (FLG) films is crucial for device applications. Here; we report electrostaticforce microscopy (EFM) measurements revealing that the FLG surface potential increaseswith film thickness; approaching a “bulk” value for samples with five or more graphenelayers. This behavior is in sharp contrast with that expected for conventional conducting orsemiconducting films; and derives from unique aspects of charge screening by graphene'srelativistic low energy carriers. EFM measurements resolve previously unseen electronicperturbations extended along crystallographic directions of structurally disordered FLGs;likely resulting from long-range atomic defects. These results have important implications …,Nano letters,2008,205
DNA-decorated graphene chemical sensors,Ye Lu; Brett R Goldsmith; Nicholas J Kybert; AT Charlie Johnson,Graphene is a two-dimensional material with exceptional electronic properties andenormous potential for applications. Graphene's promise as a chemical sensor material hasbeen noted but there has been little work on practical chemical sensing using graphene;and in particular; how chemical functionalization may be used to sensitize graphene tochemical vapors. Here we show one route towards improving the ability of graphene to workas a chemical sensor by using single stranded DNA as a sensitizing agent. The resultingdevices show fast response times; complete and rapid recovery to baseline at roomtemperature; and discrimination between several similar vapor analytes.,Applied Physics Letters,2010,201
Controlled creation of a carbon nanotube diode by a scanned gate,Marcus Freitag; Marko Radosavljevic; Yangxin Zhou; AT Johnson; Walter F Smith,We use scanning gate microscopy to precisely locate the gating response in field-effecttransistors (FETs) made from semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes. A dramaticincrease in transport current occurs when the device is electrostatically doped with holesnear the positively biased electrode. We ascribe this behavior to the turn-on of a reversebiased Schottky barrier at the interface between the p-doped nanotube and the electrode. Bypositioning the gate near one of the contacts; we convert the nanotube FET into a rectifyingnanotube diode. These experiments both clarify a longstanding debate over the gatingmechanism for nanotube FETs and indicate a strategy for diode fabrication based oncontrolled placement of acceptor impurities near a contact.,Applied Physics Letters,2001,173
Subband population in a single-wall carbon nanotube diode,RD Antonov; AT Johnson,Abstract We observe current rectification in a molecular diode consisting of asemiconducting single-wall carbon nanotube and an impurity. One-half of the nanotube hasno impurity; and it has a current-voltage (I− V) characteristic of a typical semiconductingnanotube. The other half of the nanotube has the impurity on it; and its I− V characteristic isthat of a diode. Current in the nanotube diode is carried by holes transported through themolecule's one-dimensional subbands. At 77 K we observe a stepwise increase in thecurrent through the diode as a function of gate voltage; showing that we can control thenumber of occupied one-dimensional subbands through electrostatic doping.,Physical Review Letters,1999,171
Role of single defects in electronic transport through carbon nanotube field-effect transistors,Marcus Freitag; AT Johnson; Sergei V Kalinin; Dawn A Bonnell,Abstract The influence of defects on electron transport in single-wall carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) is probed by combined scanning gate microscopy (SGM) andscanning impedance microscopy (SIM). SGM images are used to quantify the depletionsurface potential; and from this the Fermi level; at individual defects along the CNFET length.SIM is used to measure the voltage distribution along the CNFET. When the CNFET is in theconducting state; SIM reveals a uniform potential drop along its length; consistent withdiffusive transport. In contrast; when the CNFET is “off;” potential steps develop at theposition of depleted defects. High-resolution imaging of a second set of weak defects isachieved in a new “tip-gated” SIM mode.,Physical review letters,2002,146
Free energy landscape of a DNA− carbon nanotube hybrid using replica exchange molecular dynamics,Robert R Johnson; Axel Kohlmeyer; AT Charlie Johnson; Michael L Klein,The DNA− carbon nanotube hybrid (DNA-CN) consists of a single-wall carbon nanotube(SWCN) coated with a self-assembled monolayer of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Recentexperiments have demonstrated that this nanomaterial is ideal for numerousnanotechnological applications. Despite this importance; the structure of this materialremains poorly understood. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have providedinformation about the self-assembly mechanisms and ssDNA conformations thatcharacterize DNA-CN. However; MD simulations of biopolymers at low temperatures (T∼300 K) result in kinetic trapping that limits conformational sampling.

Growth mechanism of hexagonal-shape graphene flakes with zigzag edges,Zhengtang Luo; Seungchul Kim; Nicole Kawamoto; Andrew M Rappe; AT Charlie Johnson,The properties of a graphene nanostructure are strongly influenced by the arrangement ofthe atoms on its edge. Growing graphene nanostructures with specified edge types inpractical; scalable ways has proven challenging; with limited success to date. Here wereport a method for producing graphene flakes with hexagonal shape over large areas; by abrief chemical vapor deposition growth at atmospheric pressure on polished Cu catalyst foil;with limited carbon feedstock. Raman spectra show evidence that the edges of thehexagonal crystallites are predominantly oriented along the zigzag direction. Densityfunctional theory calculations demonstrate that the edge selectivity derives from favorablekinetics of sequential incorporation of carbon atoms to the vacancies in nonzigzag portionsof the edges; driving the edges to pure zigzag geometry.

Atomic resolution STM imaging of a twisted single-wall carbon nanotube,W Clauss; DJ Bergeron; AT Johnson,Abstract We present atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy images of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT's) embedded in a crystalline nanotube rope. Although theymay be interpreted as of a chiral nanotube; the images are more consistently explained asan achiral armchair tube with a quenched twist distortion. The existence of quenched twistsin SWNT's in ropes might explain the fact that both as-grown bulk nanotube material andindividual ropes have insulatorlike conductivity at low temperature.,Physical Review B,1998,124
Size-selective nanoparticle growth on few-layer graphene films,Zhengtang Luo; Luke A Somers; Yaping Dan; Thomas Ly; Nicholas J Kybert; EJ Mele; AT Charlie Johnson,We observe that gold atoms deposited by physical vapor deposition onto few-layergraphenes condense upon annealing to form nanoparticles with an average diameter that isdetermined by the graphene film thickness. The data are well described by a theoreticalmodel in which the electrostatic interactions arising from charge transfer between thegraphene and the gold particle limit the size of the growing nanoparticles. The modelpredicts a nanoparticle size distribution characterized by a mean diameter D̅ that follows aD̅∝ m 1/3 scaling law where m is the number of carbon layers in the few-layer graphenefilm.,Nano letters,2010,115

Electrical wind force–driven and dislocation-templated amorphization in phase-change nanowires,Sung-Wook Nam; Hee-Suk Chung; Yu Chieh Lo; Liang Qi; Ju Li; Ye Lu; AT Charlie Johnson; Yeonwoong Jung; Pavan Nukala; Ritesh Agarwal,Phase-change materials undergo rapid and reversible crystalline-to-amorphous structuraltransformation and are being used for nonvolatile memory devices. However; thetransformation mechanism remains poorly understood. We have studied the effect ofelectrical pulses on the crystalline-to-amorphous phase change in a single-crystalline Ge 2Sb 2 Te 5 (GST) nanowire memory device by in situ transmission electron microscopy. Weshow that electrical pulses produce dislocations in crystalline GST; which become mobileand glide in the direction of hole-carrier motion. The continuous increase in the density ofdislocations moving unidirectionally in the material leads to dislocation jamming; whicheventually induces the crystalline-to-amorphous phase change with a sharp interfacespanning the entire nanowire cross section.

Clean electromigrated nanogaps imaged by transmission electron microscopy,Douglas R Strachan; Deirdre E Smith; Michael D Fischbein; Danvers E Johnston; Beth S Guiton; Marija Drndić; Dawn A Bonnell; Alan T Johnson,Electromigrated nanogaps have shown great promise for use in molecular scale electronics.We have fabricated nanogaps on free-standing transparent SiN x membranes which permitthe use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to image the gaps. The electrodes areformed by extending a recently developed controlled electromigration procedure and yield ananogap with approximately 5 nm separation clear of any apparent debris. The gaps arestable; on the order of hours as measured by TEM; but over time (months) relax to about 20nm separation determined by the surface energy of the Au electrodes. A major benefit ofelectromigrated nanogaps on SiN x membranes is that the junction pinches in away fromresidual metal left from the Au deposition which could act as a parasitic conductance path.This work has implications to the design of clean metallic electrodes for use in nanoscale …,Nano letters,2006,101

Quantized current in a quantum dot turnstile,LP Kouwenhoven; AT Johnson; NC Van der Vaart; A Van der Enden; CJPM Harmans; CT Foxon,Abstract We have performed RF experiments on a lateral quantum dot defined in the twodimensional electron gas (2DEG) of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. The small capacitanceof the quantum dot gives rise to single-electron charging effects; which we employed torealize a quantum dot turnstile device. By modulating the tunnel barriers between thequantum dot and the 2DEG leads with two phase-shifted RF signals; we pass an integernumber of electrons through the quantum dot per RF cycle. This is demonstrated by theobservation of quantized current plateaus at multiples of ef in current-voltage characteristics;where f is the frequency of the RF signals. When an asymmetry is induced by applyingunequal RF voltages; our quantum dot turnstile operates as a single-electron pumpproducing a quantized current at zero bias voltage.,Zeitschrift für Physik B Condensed Matter,1991,86
Parallel fabrication of nanogap electrodes,Danvers E Johnston; Douglas R Strachan; AT Charlie Johnson,We have developed a technique for simultaneously fabricating large numbers of nanogapsin a single processing step using feedback-controlled electromigration. Parallel nanogapformation is achieved by a balanced simultaneous process that uses a novel arrangement ofnanoscale shorts between narrow constrictions where the nanogaps form. Because of thisbalancing; the fabrication of multiple nanoelectrodes is similar to that of a single nanogapjunction. The technique should be useful for constructing complex circuits of molecular-scaleelectronic devices.,Nano letters,2007,79

High‐On/Off‐Ratio Graphene Nanoconstriction Field‐Effect Transistor,Ye Lu; Brett Goldsmith; Douglas R Strachan; Jong Hsien Lim; Zhengtang Luo; AT Johnson,Abstract A method is reported to pattern monolayer graphene nanoconstriction field-effecttransistors (NCFETs) with critical dimensions below 10 nm. NCFET fabrication is enabled bythe use of feedback-controlled electromigration (FCE) to form a constriction in a gold etchmask that is first patterned using conventional lithographic techniques. The use of FCEallows the etch mask to be patterned on size scales below the limit of conventionalnanolithography. The opening of a confinement-induced energy gap is observed as theNCFET width is reduced; as evidenced by a sharp increase in the NCFET on/off ratio. Theon/off ratios obtained with this procedure can be larger than 1000 at room temperature forthe narrowest devices; this is the first report of such large room-temperature on/off ratios forpatterned graphene FETs.,Small,2010,74
Hybrids of a genetically engineered antibody and a carbon nanotube transistor for detection of prostate cancer biomarkers,Mitchell B Lerner; Jimson D’Souza; Tatiana Pazina; Jennifer Dailey; Brett R Goldsmith; Matthew K Robinson; AT Charlie Johnson,We developed a novel detection method for osteopontin (OPN); a new biomarker forprostate cancer; by attaching a genetically engineered single-chain variable fragment (scFv)protein with high binding affinity for OPN to a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (NT-FET).

Aconcentration-dependent increase in the source–drain current is observed in the regime ofclinical significance; with a detection limit of approximately 30 fM. The scFv-NT hybriddevices exhibit selectivity for OPN over other control proteins. These devices respond to …,ACS nano,2012,70
Controlled doping of graphene using ultraviolet irradiation,Zhengtang Luo; Nicholas J Pinto; Yarely Davila; AT Charlie Johnson,The electronic properties of graphene are tunable via doping; making it attractive in lowdimensional organic electronics. Common methods of doping graphene; however;adversely affect charge mobility and degrade device performance. We demonstrate a facileshadow mask technique of defining electrodes on graphene grown by chemical vapordeposition (CVD) thereby eliminating the use of detrimental chemicals needed in thecorresponding lithographic process. Further; we report on the controlled; effective; andreversible doping of graphene via ultraviolet (UV) irradiation with minimal impact on chargemobility.

We have investigatedCoulomb oscillations at zero magnetic field; and in the integer and fractional QHE regimes.Coulomb oscillations are found to appear only when both barrier conductances G are belowthe first well resolved plateau: at zero field G< 2e 2/h; in the IQHE regime G< e 2/h; and inthe FQHE regime G< 1 3 e 2/h. The period of the oscillations is shown to be fieldindependent. We furthermore studied the interplay between charging effects and discreteenergy states in the dot.

Graphene substantially lowers the friction force experienced by the sliding asperity of asilicon AFM tip compared to the surrounding oxidized copper surface by a factor rangingfrom 1.5 to 7 over loads from the adhesive minimum up to 80 nN. No damage to thegraphene was observed over this range; showing that friction force microscopy serves as afacile; high contrast probe for identifying the presence of graphene on Cu.

Homeotropic alignment of lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals using noncovalent interactions,Joonwoo Jeong; Ganghee Han; AT Charlie Johnson; Peter J Collings; Tom C Lubensky; Arjun G Yodh,We report on the homeotropic alignment of lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs).Homeotropic anchoring of LCLCs is difficult to achieve; and this challenge has limiteddevelopment of applications for LCLCs. In this work; homeotropic alignment is achievedusing noncovalent interactions between the LCLC molecules and various alignment layersincluding graphene; parylene films; poly (methyl methacrylate) films; and fluoropolymerfilms. The LCLC molecules are unique in that they self-assemble via noncovalentinteractions in water into elongated aggregates which; in turn; form nematic and columnarliquid crystal (LC) phases. Here we exploit these same noncovalent interactions to inducehomeotropic anchoring of the nematic LCLC. Homeotropic alignment is confirmed bypolarized optical microscopy and conoscopy.

Electrical response of electrospun PEDOT-PSSA nanofibers to organic and inorganic gases,Nicholas J Pinto; Danairé Rivera; Anamaris Melendez; Idalia Ramos; Jong Hsien Lim; AT Charlie Johnson,Abstract Electrospun isolated nanofibers of poly (3; 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with(poly styrene sulfonic acid)-PEDOT-PSSA were used to sense vapors of several aliphaticalcohols. Due to the large surface to volume ratio and small quantity of active material usedin their fabrication; these sensors have a similar or faster response time when compared toalcohol sensors based on PEDOT. Increasing the size of the alcohol molecule leads tolonger response times; which is attributed to slower diffusion of the larger molecule into thepolymer. The sensors were annealed in air at 70° C and used to sense NH 3; HCl and NO 2gas. The response time for NH 3 was faster than HCl; and the sensors showed a large initialresponse to NO 2 at room temperature which is very desirable; as some NO 2 gas sensorsonly operate at elevated temperatures.

Homo-DNA functionalized carbon nanotube chemical sensors,Samuel M Khamis; Robert R Johnson; Zhengtang Luo; AT Charlie Johnson,Abstract Arrays of chemical sensors based on homo-oligomer single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)adsorbed to single-walled carbon nanotube field effect transistors (SWNT-FETs) wereemployed to detect several gaseous analytes. Exposure of these devices to analytes resultsin a characteristic current shift in the SWNT-FET. The magnitude of this current shift for aparticular analyte varies with the base sequence of adsorbed ssDNA and follows the trend d(G) 21–SWNT> d (A) 21–SWNT> d (C) 21–SWNT> d (T) 21–SWNT. Molecular dynamicssimulations suggest that a comparable trend of d (G) 21> d (A) 21> d (T) 21-> d (C) 21 existsfor ssDNA–SWNT binding affinities. This indicates that the nature of ssDNA–SWNT bindingplays a vital role in the performance of the sensor. Stronger binding implies a greateramount of ssDNA adsorbed to SWNT surface. This would result in a more hydrophilic …,Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids,2010,26
Electronic transport of recrystallized freestanding graphene nanoribbons,Zhengqing John Qi; Colin Daniels; Sung Ju Hong; Yung Woo Park; Vincent Meunier; Marija Drndic; AT Charlie Johnson,The use of graphene and other two-dimensional materials in next-generation electronics ishampered by the significant damage caused by conventional lithographic processingtechniques employed in device fabrication.

Devicesdetected different vapor types; including carboxylic acids; aldehydes; organophosphates;and explosives. As-fabricated GNM field effect transistors (FETs) had larger vapor responsesthan standard graphene FETs due to the effect of oxidized edges and lattice defects. DNA-GNM devices discriminated between homologous species with detection limits of a few partsper million; with fast response and recovery.

Friction; adhesion; and elasticity of graphene edges,D Patrick Hunley; Tyler J Flynn; Tom Dodson; Abhishek Sundararajan; Mathias J Boland; Douglas R Strachan,Abstract Frictional; adhesive; and elastic characteristics of graphene edges are determinedthrough lateral force microscopy. Measurements reveal a significant local frictional increaseat exposed graphene edges; whereas a single overlapping layer of graphene removes thislocal frictional increase. Comparison of lateral force and atomic force microscopymeasurements shows that local forces on the probe are successfully modeled with a verticaladhesion in the vicinity of the atomic-scale graphene steps which also provides a new low-load calibration method. Lateral force microscopy performed with carefully maintained low-adhesion probes shows evidence of elastic straining of graphene edges. Estimates of theenergy stored of this observed elastic response is consistent with out-of-plane bending ofthe graphene edge.,Physical Review B,2013,20

X-raydiffraction; scanning transmission electron microscopy; scanning electron microscopy; andRaman spectroscopy are used to reveal high quality single-crystalline wires with a [001]growth direction. The study of electrical transport through a single nanowire based deviceand cathodoluminescence via scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrates thatan axial p–n junction exists within each ZnO nanowire.

Here we reportprogress towards that goal by demonstrating specific detection of Salmonella in complexnutrient broth solutions using nanotube transistors functionalized with covalently-bound anti-Salmonella antibodies. The small size of the active device region makes them compatiblewith integration in large-scale arrays. We find that the on-state current of the transistor issensitive specifically to the Salmonella concentration and saturates at low concentration (<1000 cfu/ml). In contrast; the carrier mobility is affected comparably by Salmonella and otherbacteria types; with no sign of saturation even at much larger concentrations (108 cfu/ml).,AIP Advances,2011,19

Under parameters appropriate forexperiment; both the addition spectrum and the conductance show a dramatic qualitativedifference between a situation dominated by interdot Coulomb interaction and the pureHubbard model. We calculate how; in the general case; these different contributionsinfluence the spectra. The effects of various types of disorder are discussed.,Physical Review B,1997,19

Addition spectra of arrays of interacting quantum dots: Dependence on array geometry and magnetic field,Zhiming Yu; AT Johnson; Thomas Heinzel,Abstract We use the extended Hubbard model to calculate the addition spectra of linearchains and ring-shaped arrays of three; four; and five quantum dots. We find that for lineararrays; the addition spectra obtained with the pure Hubbard model and the pure chargingmodel show no qualitative differences. For rings of quantum dots; however; the Hubbardmodel always produces doubly degenerate states that are absent in the charging model. Weattribute the double degeneracy to the presence of a periodic boundary condition. Thedegeneracies are lifted by a perpendicular magnetic field B→. As B→ varies; the spectra areperiodic with a period of one magnetic flux quantum φ 0= h/e and symmetric about one-halfmagnetic flux quantum enclosed by the ring of quantum dots.,Physical Review B,1998,15

In particular; the vdW heterostructures combine high mobility andoptical properties that can be exploited for optoelectronic devices. Since the pn junction isone of the most fundamental units of optoelectronics; we propose an approach for itsfabrication based on the intrinsic n doped MoS2 and the p doped bilayer graphene hybridinterfaces. We demonstrate the control of the photoconduction properties using electrolyticgating which ensures a low bias operation.

Load-dependent friction hysteresis on graphene,Zhijiang Ye; Philip Egberts; Gang Hee Han; AT Charlie Johnson; Robert W Carpick; Ashlie Martini,Nanoscale friction often exhibits hysteresis when load is increased (loading) and thendecreased (unloading) and is manifested as larger friction measured during unloadingcompared to loading for a given load. In this work; the origins of load-dependent frictionhysteresis were explored through atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments of a silicon tipsliding on chemical vapor deposited graphene in air; and molecular dynamics simulations ofa model AFM tip on graphene; mimicking both vacuum and humid air environmentalconditions. It was found that only simulations with water at the tip–graphene contactreproduced the experimentally observed hysteresis.

Coulomb-blockade oscillations in a quantum dot strongly coupled to leads,T Heinzel; AT Johnson; DA Wharam; JP Kotthaus; G Böhm; W Klein; G Tränkle; G Weimann,Abstract We report on the behavior of Coulomb-blockade oscillations in a semiconductorquantum dot; when its coupling to the leads is strong; ie; of the order of the dot's energy-levelseparation. Under magnetic fields 0.75≤ B≤ 4 T; we find a periodic amplitude modulationof both the peaks and the valleys of the conductance resonances. Assuming that only thelowest edge channel carries current; we apply a model; describing partly coherent and partlyincoherent electron transport; to explain these modulations. Within this model; the period ofthe amplitude modulation reflects the filling factor inside the dot. The amplitude of theenvelope function is determined by the fraction of electrons scattered inelastically in the dot;the electron temperature; and the transmission of the tunnel barriers that couple the dot tothe reservoirs. We show that it is only in the strong coupling regime where we can …,Physical Review B,1995,11
Quantifying the effect of ionic screening with protein-decorated graphene transistors,Jinglei Ping; Jin Xi; Jeffery G Saven; Renyu Liu; AT Charlie Johnson,Abstract Liquid-based applications of biomolecule-decorated field-effect transistors (FETs)range from biosensors to in vivo implants. A critical scientific challenge is to develop aquantitative understanding of the gating effect of charged biomolecules in ionic solution andhow this influences the readout of the FETs. To address this issue; we fabricated protein-decorated graphene FETs and measured their electrical properties; specifically the shift inDirac voltage; in solutions of varying ionic strength. We found excellent quantitativeagreement with a model that accounts for both the graphene polarization charge and ionicscreening of ions adsorbed on the graphene as well as charged amino acids associatedwith the immobilized protein.

A few-cycle carrier-envelope phase-stable laser pulse centered at 1800 nm was used to generate a stable soft X-raysupercontinuum; with amplitude gating limiting the generated pulse duration to a singleoptical half-cycle. We report a quantitative transmission measurement of the sulfur L 2; 3edge over the range 160–200 eV and the carbon K edge from 280 to 330 eV.

Quantized current in a quantum dot turnstile,LP Kouwenhoven,Abstract We have observed a quantized current in a lateral quantum dot defined by metalgates in the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. Bymodulating the tunnel barriers in the 2DEG with two phase shifted RF signals; andemploying the Coulomb blockade of electron tunneling; we produced quantized currentplateaus in the current-voltage characteristics at integer multiples of ef; where f is the RFfrequency. This demonstrates that an integer number of electrons pass through the quantumdot each RF cycle.,Physica Scripta,1992,10

Charging effects in quantum dots,LP Kouwenhoven; NC van der Vaart; AT Johnson; CJPM Harmans; JG Williamson; AAM Staring; CT Foxon,Abstract We have studied single electron charging effects in lateral quantum dots; defined bymetal gates in the two dimensional electron gas of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. Thecharging effects cause periodic oscillations in the conductance versus gate voltage; whereeach period corresponds to a change of one electron in the dot. A study of the dependenceof these Coulomb oscillations on the barrier conductances shows that charging effectsbecome visible precisely when the barrier conductances become smaller than the quantizedconductance value 2e 2/h. The amplitude of the Coulomb oscillations increases graduallyupon reducing the barrier conductances to a value much smaller than 2e 2/h. We determineexperimentally the total capacitance involved; and thereby the corresponding chargingenergy.,*,1991,9
Pose-aware C-arm for automatic re-initialization of interventional 2d/3d image registration,Javad Fotouhi; Bernhard Fuerst; Alex Johnson; Sing Chun Lee; Russell Taylor; Greg Osgood; Nassir Navab; Mehran Armand,Abstract Purpose In minimally invasive interventions assisted by C-arm imaging; there is ademand to fuse the intra-interventional 2D C-arm image with pre-interventional 3D patientdata to enable surgical guidance. The commonly used intensity-based 2D/3D registrationhas a limited capture range and is sensitive to initialization. We propose to utilize an opto/X-ray C-arm system which allows to maintain the registration during intervention by automatingthe re-initialization for the 2D/3D image registration. Consequently; the surgical workflow isnot disrupted and the interaction time for manual initialization is eliminated.

High-throughput nanogap formation using single ramp feedback control,Stephen L Johnson; D Patrick Hunley; Abhishek Sundararajan; AT Charlie Johnson; Douglas R Strachan,We demonstrate a technique for simultaneously fabricating arrays of electromigratednanogaps using a single-ramp feedback-controlled voltage clamp. The parallel formation isachieved by controlling the applied bias with a voltage clamp directly adjacent to a nanogaparray containing low-impedance shunts. Self-balancing of the electromigration permits thetwo voltage leads to fix the applied voltage across all the forming nanogaps simultaneously.This single-ramp feedback-controlled voltage clamp method is at least a 100 times fasterthan previous work utilizing computer feedback control of parallel nanojunctions and alsocircumvents the deleterious thermal runaway that occurs in the conventional single-ramptechnique.,IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology,2011,8

Our comprehensive studyof the ion-induced morphological changes in various MoS 2 samples shows that dependingon the irradiation parameters a multitude of extended defects can be fabricated. Theserange from chains of nano-hillocks in bulk-like MoS 2; and foldings in single and bilayerMoS 2; to unique nano-incisions in supported and freestanding single layers of MoS 2. Ourdata reveals that the primary mechanism responsible for the incisions in the ultrathinsupported samples is the indirect heating by the SiO 2 substrate. We thus conclude that anenergy of less than 2 keV per nm track length is sufficient to fabricate nano-incisions in MoS2 which is compatible with the use of the smallest accelerators.,2D Materials,2016,6
Spatio-temporal characterization of intense few-cycle 2 μm pulses,Dane R Austin; Tobias Witting; Sébastien J Weber; Peng Ye; Thomas Siegel; Paloma Matía-Hernando; Allan S Johnson; John WG Tisch; Jonathan P Marangos,We present a variant of spatially encoded spectral shearing interferometry for measuring two-dimensional spatio-temporal slices of few-cycle pulses centered around 2 μm. Wedemonstrate experimentally that the device accurately retrieves the pulse-front tilt caused byangular dispersion of two-cycle pulses. We then use the technique to characterize 500–650μJ pulses from a hollow fiber pulse compressor; with durations as short as 7.1 fs (1.3 opticalcycles).,Optics express,2016,6

Especially for plantsand animals exposed to direct solar radiation; body temperatures can be substantiallydifferent from air temperatures. We deployed biomimetic sensors that approximate thethermal characteristics of intertidal mussels at 71 sites worldwide; from 1998-present.Loggers recorded temperatures at 10–30 min intervals nearly continuously at multipleintertidal elevations. Comparisons against direct measurements of mussel tissuetemperature indicated errors of~ 2.0–2.5 C; during daily fluctuations that often exceeded 15–20 C.

Mechanics and Energetics of DNA Hybridization on Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Explored Using Adaptive Biasing Force Calculations,Michael W Chien; Robert R Johnson; Shreekumar R Pillai; Shree Ram Singh; AT Charlie Johnson Jr,Hybrid nanostructures consisting of single-walled carbon nanotubes (swCNs) coated withsingle stranded DNA (ssDNA) are of great interest due to their numerous potentialapplications in nanotechnology; medicine; and homeland security. Recent experimentshave demonstrated that DNA-CN hybrids can detect the hybridization of complementaryDNA strands; paving the way for applications in DNA sequencing and genetic testing.However; the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previous moleculardynamics (MD) simulations studying DNA-CN self-assembly have found that adsorbed DNAbases are poorly positioned to hybridize with complementary DNA strands. Here; we applythe adaptive biasing force (ABF) method to all-atom MD models; and find that DNA basesmust desorb from the swCN sidewall and suffer significant energy penalties to hybridize …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,2014,6

The effect of investment materials on the surface of cast fluorcanasite glasses and glass–ceramics,Sanchita Bandyopadhyay-Ghosh; Ian M Reaney; Antony Johnson; Kathryn Hurrell-Gillingham; Ian M Brook; PV Hatton,Abstract Modified fluorcanasite glass–ceramics were produced by controlled two stage heat-treatment of as-cast glasses. Castability was determined using a spiral castability test andthe lost-wax method. Specimens were cast into moulds formed from gypsum and phosphatebonded investments to observe their effect on the casting process; surface roughness;surface composition and biocompatibility. Both gypsum and phosphate bonded investmentscould be successfully used for the lost-wax casting of fluorcanasite glasses. Although thestoichiometric glass composition had the highest castability; all modified compositionsshowed good relative castability. X-ray diffraction showed similar bulk crystallisation for eachglass; irrespective of the investment material.

Inverting polar domains via electrical pulsing in metallic germanium telluride,Pavan Nukala; Mingliang Ren; Rahul Agarwal; Jacob Berger; Gerui Liu; AT Charlie Johnson; Ritesh Agarwal,Abstract Germanium telluride (GeTe) is both polar and metallic; an unusual combination ofproperties in any material system. The large concentration of free-carriers in GeTe precludesthe coupling of external electric field with internal polarization; rendering it ineffective forconventional ferroelectric applications and polarization switching. Here we investigatealternate ways of coupling the polar domains in GeTe to external electrical stimuli throughoptical second harmonic generation polarimetry and in situ TEM electrical testing on single-crystalline GeTe nanowires. We show that anti-phase boundaries; created from currentpulses (heat shocks); invert the polarization of selective domains resulting in reorganizationof certain 71 o domain boundaries into 109 o boundaries. These boundaries subsequentlyinteract and evolve with the partial dislocations; which migrate from domain to domain …,Nature communications,2017,4

Surface characterization of PZT thin films obtained at various O2 gas ratios,Sujin Choi; Juyun Park; Jisoo Kang; AT Charlie Johnson; Yong-Cheol Kang,Abstract We fabricated PZT (Pb (Zr 1-x Ti x) O 3; PZT) thin films at various O 2 gas ratios byutilizing the radio frequency (RF) magnetron co-sputtering method. Ar-ion sputtered depthprofile was performed to investigate both the surface and the bulk region of the PZT thinfilms. The thickness of the PZT thin films was monitored through the means of a surfaceprofiler and a decrease from 272.7 to 89.7 nm was observed after introducing O 2 gas in thesputter gas. Based on the XRD study; the perovskite phase of PZT evolved after O 2 gas wasintroduced to the system. As the O 2 gas ratio increased; the portion of Pb increased while Zrand Ti decreased; in which this was confirmed by XPS. The conductivity of the PZT thin filmsobtained at 0 and 5% of O 2 gas ratio in the sputter gas dramatically decreased from 778.6to 75.4 S/cm; respectively.,Vacuum,2016,4
Unidirectional Doubly Enhanced MoS2 Emission via Photonic Fano Resonances,Xingwang Zhang; Shinhyuk Choi; Dake Wang; Carl H Naylor; AT Charlie Johnson; Ertugrul Cubukcu,Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS2 monolayers exhibit uniqueluminescent properties. However; weak quantum yield and low light absorption hinder theirpractical applications in two-dimensional light emitting devices. Here; we report 1300 timesenhancement in photoluminescence emission from a MoS2 monolayer via simultaneousFano resonances in a dielectric photonic crystal. The spatially extended double Fanoresonance scheme allows resonant enhancement of both the MoS2 absorption andemission. We also achieve unidirectional emission within a narrow divergence angle of 5°by engineering the Fano resonance angular dispersion. Our approach provides a newplatform for efficient light sources with high directionality based on emerging two-dimensional materials.,Nano letters,2017,3
Ambient effects on electrical characteristics of CVD-grown monolayer MoS 2 field-effect transistors,Jae-Hyuk Ahn; William M Parkin; Carl H Naylor; AT Charlie Johnson; Marija Drndić,Abstract Monolayer materials are sensitive to their environment because all of the atoms areat their surface. We investigate how exposure to the environment affects the electricalproperties of CVD-grown monolayer MoS 2 by monitoring electrical parameters of MoS 2field-effect transistors as their environment is changed from atmosphere to high vacuum. Themobility increases and contact resistance decreases simultaneously as either the pressureis reduced or the sample is annealed in vacuum. We see a previously unobserved; non-monotonic change in threshold voltage with decreasing pressure. This result could beexplained by charge transfer on the MoS 2 channel and Schottky contact formation due toadsorbates at the interface between the gold contacts and MoS 2. Additionally; from ourelectrical measurements it is plausible to infer that at room temperature and pressure …,Scientific Reports,2017,3

To fully harness this potential; we must accurately knowthe X-ray properties: intensity; spectrum and temporal profile. Owing to the inherentfluctuations in free-electron lasers; this mandates a full characterization of the properties foreach and every pulse. While diagnostics of these properties exist; they are often invasiveand many cannot operate at a high-repetition rate. Here; we present a technique forcircumventing this limitation. Employing a machine learning strategy; we can accuratelypredict X-ray properties for every shot using only parameters that are easily recorded at high-repetition rate; by training a model on a small set of fully diagnosed pulses.

Increased power factors of organic–inorganic nanocomposite thermoelectric materials and the role of energy filtering,Zhiming Liang; Mathias J Boland; Kamal Butrouna; Douglas R Strachan; Kenneth R Graham,Significant enhancements in the performance of organic–inorganic nanocompositethermoelectrics may be obtained through appropriately adjusting energetics at the organic–inorganic interfaces. Through altering these interfacial energetics; the energy dependenceof the electrical conductivity; and therefore the Seebeck coefficient; can in principle bereadily manipulated through energy filtering. In this work; we controllably vary the energeticbarrier between transport states in the conjugated polymer poly (3-hexylthiophene) andtellurium nanowires. The energetic barrier is adjusted from 0.08 to 0.88 eV by altering theconcentration of the p-type dopant (FeCl3) present in the polymer phase. We show that themaximum power factors in these composites are increased beyond that of either the purepolymer or pure nanowires for barriers of both 0.08 and 0.88 eV.

Quantifying the intrinsic surface charge density and charge-transfer resistance of the graphene-solution interface through bias-free low-level charge measurement,Jinglei Ping; AT Charlie Johnson,Liquid-based bio-applications of graphene require a quantitative understanding of thegraphene-liquid interface; with the surface charge density of adsorbed ions; the interfacialcharge transfer resistance; and the interfacial charge noise being of particular importance.We quantified these properties through measurements of the zero-bias Faradaic charge-transfer between graphene electrodes and aqueous solutions of varying ionic strength usinga reproducible; low-noise; minimally perturbative charge measurement technique. Themeasurements indicated that the adsorbed ions had a negative surface charge density ofapproximately− 32.8 mC m− 2 and that the specific charge transfer resistance was 6.5±0.3MΩ cm2.

Samples of tBLG were assembled on free-standing siliconnitride (SiN x) membranes (< 100 nm thick) by transferring chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown single layer graphene (SLG) twice; this allowed the measurement of the angle ofrotation between the two layers; the twist angle; by electron diffraction using a transmissionelectron microscope (TEM). To compare with the previous reports on tBLG; we performedRaman spectroscopy on our samples. We measured the MR of tBLG for two different twistangles: 2 (small) and 18 (large). The MR showed superposition of two Shubnikov de Haas(SdH) oscillations for both angles. An analysis of the oscillation peaks by Landau fandiagrams showed difference as twist angle. While the large twist angle (18) sample had …,Synthetic Metals,2016,3

Direct observation of Li diffusion in Li-doped ZnO nanowires,Guohua Li; Lei Yu; Bethany M Hudak; Yao-Jen Chang; Hyeonjun Baek; Abhishek Sundararajan; Douglas R Strachan; Gyu-Chul Yi; Beth S Guiton,Abstract The direct observation of Li diffusion in Li-doped zinc oxide nanowires (NWs) wasrealized by using in situ heating in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).A continuous increase of low atomic mass regions within a single NW was observedbetween 200 C and 600 C when heated in vacuum; which was explained by the conversionof interstitial to substitutional Li in the ZnO NW host lattice. A kick-out mechanism isintroduced to explain the migration and conversion of the interstitial Li (Li i) to Zn-sitesubstitutional Li (Li Zn); and this mechanism is verified with low-temperature (11 K)photoluminescence measurements on as-grown and annealed Li-doped zinc oxide NWs; aswell as the observation of an increase of NW surface roughing with applied bias.,Materials Research Express,2016,2
Role of tunnel ionization in high harmonic generation from substituted benzenes,Dane R Austin; Felicity McGrath; Lukas Miseikis; David Wood; Peter Hawkins; Allan S Johnson; Morgane Vacher; Zdeněk Mašín; Alex Harvey; Misha Ivanov; Olga Smirnova; Jon P Marangos,We theoretically study high-harmonic generation in toluene; ortho-xylene and fluorobenzenedriven by a 1.8 μm ultrashort pulse. We find that the chemical substitutions have a stronginfluence on the amplitude and phase of the emission from the highest occupied molecularorbital; despite having a small influence on the orbital itself. We show that this influence isdue to the tunnel ionization step; which depends critically on the sign and amplitude of theasymptotic part of the wave function. We discuss how these effects would manifest in phase-sensitive high-harmonic generation spectroscopy experiments.,Faraday discussions,2016,2
Nonlinear ballistic transport in an atomically thin material,Mathias J Boland; Abhishek Sundararajan; M Javad Farrokhi; Douglas R Strachan,Ultrashort devices that incorporate atomically thin components have the potential to be thesmallest electronics. Such extremely scaled atomically thin devices are expected to showballistic nonlinear behavior that could make them tremendously useful for ultrafastapplications. While nonlinear diffusive electron transport has been widely reported; clearevidence for intrinsic nonlinear ballistic transport in the growing array of atomically thinconductors has so far been elusive.

Abrupt capacitance variations detectedacross etch tracks indicates that the nano-domains have strong electrical isolation betweenthem.

Scaling of cross-over currents in current-voltage characteristics of Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ films,DR Strachan; MC Sullivan; CJ Lobb,Abstract We investigate current-voltage measurements of a superconductor in a magneticfield for a continuous superconducting transition. Existence of such a transition in the mixedstate has been the subject of recent controversy due to flexibility in the conventional scalinganalysis. To address this; we analyze current-voltage data using scaling forms based on thecrossover current. One of these scaling forms; based on the logarithmic derivative of current-voltage isotherms; is a stringent test for a superconducting transition. Applying this derivativescaling test to the data shows marked disagreement with a superconducting transition;which indicates that one does not occur within the mixed state.,Physical Review B,2006,2
Two distinct time-scale regimes of the effective temperature for an aging colloidal glass,DR Strachan; GC Kalur; SR Raghavan,Abstract: Colloidal dispersions of Laponite platelets are known to age slowly from viscoussols to colloidal glasses. We follow this aging process by monitoring the diffusion of probeparticles embedded in the sample via dynamic light scattering. Our results show that the time-dependent diffusion of the probe particles scales with their size. This implies that thefluctuation-dissipation theorem can be generalized for this out-of-equilibrium system byreplacing the bath temperature with an effective temperature. Simultaneous dynamicrheological measurements reveal that this effective temperature increases as a function ofaging time and frequency. This suggests the existence of two regimes: at probed time scaleslonger than the characteristic relaxation time of the Laponite dispersion; the systemthermalizes with the bath; whereas at shorter time scales; the system is out-of-equilibrium …,arXiv preprint cond-mat/0510742,2005,2

However; two-dimensional observations of the three-dimensionalanatomy suffer from the effects of projective simplification. Consequently; many X-rayimages from various orientations need to be acquired for the surgeon to accurately assessthe spatial relations between the patient's anatomy and the surgical tools.

Here; we studythe electronic properties of a mixed-dimensional heterostructure composed of intrinsic n-doped Mo S 2 flakes transferred on p-doped GaN (0001) layers. Based on angle-resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and high resolution x-ray photoemissionspectroscopy (HR-XPS); we investigate the electronic structure modification induced by theinterlayer interactions in Mo S 2/GaN heterostructure. In particular; a shift of the valenceband with respect to the Fermi level for Mo S 2/GaN heterostructure is observed; which is thesignature of a charge transfer from the 2D monolayer Mo S 2 to GaN.

An Aptamer-Based Biosensor for the Azole Class of Antifungal Drugs,Gregory R Wiedman; Yanan Zhao; Arkady Mustaev; Jinglei Ping; Ramya Vishnubhotla; AT Charlie Johnson; David S Perlin,ABSTRACT This technical report describes the development of an aptamer for sensingazole antifungal drugs during therapeutic drug monitoring. Modified synthetic evolution ofligands through exponential enrichment (SELEX) was used to discover a DNA aptamerrecognizing azole class antifungal drugs. This aptamer undergoes a secondary structuralchange upon binding to its target molecule; as shown through fluorescence anisotropy-based binding measurements. Experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy revealeda unique G-quadruplex structure that was essential and specific for binding to the azoleantifungal target. Aptamer-functionalized graphene field effect transistor (GFET) deviceswere created and used to measure the strength of binding of azole antifungals to thissurface. In total; this aptamer and the supporting sensing platform provide a valuable tool …,mSphere,2017,1

Metal Nanoparticle Growth within Clay–Polymer Nacre-Inspired Materials for Improved Catalysis and Plasmonic Detection in Complex Biofluids,Eric H Hill; Christoph Hanske; Alexander Johnson; Luis Yate; Hans Jelitto; Gerold A Schneider; Luis M Liz-Marzán,Recent studies have shown that layered silicate clays can be used to form a nacre-likebioinspired layered structure with various polymer fillers; leading to composite films withgood material strength; gas-barrier properties; and high loading capacity. We go one stepfurther by in situ growing metal nanoparticles in nacre-like layered films based on layeredsilicate clays; which can be used for applications in plasmonic sensing and catalysis. Thedegree of anisotropy of the nanoparticles grown in the film can be controlled by adjusting theratio of clay to polymer or gold to clay and reducing agent concentration; as well as silverovergrowth; which greatly enhances the surface enhanced Raman scattering activity of thecomposite. We show the performance of the films for SERS detection of bacterial quorumsensing molecules in culture medium; and catalytic properties are demonstrated through …,Langmuir,2017,1

Monolayer WS 2 crossed with an electro-spun PEDOT-PSS nano-ribbon: Fabricating a Schottky diode,Deliris N Ortiz; Josee Vedrine; Nicholas J Pinto; Carl H Naylor; AT Charlie Johnson,Abstract WS 2 and PEDOT-PSS were individually characterized with the goal of analyzingcharge transport across a hetero-junction formed by these two materials. In thermalequilibrium electron flow from the WS 2 conduction band into the polymer LUMO level leadsto band bending that creates a potential barrier preventing further current.

MoS2 based dual input logic AND gate,Luis M Martinez; Nicholas J Pinto; Carl H Naylor; AT Charlie Johnson,Crystalline monolayers of CVD MoS2 are used as the active semiconducting channel in asplit-gate field effect transistor. The device demonstrates logic AND functionality that iscontrolled by independently addressing each gate terminal with±10V. When+ 10V wassimultaneously applied to both gates; the device was conductive (ON); while any othercombination of gate voltages rendered the device resistive (OFF). The ON/OFF ratio of thedevice was∼ 35 and the charge mobility using silicon nitride as the gate dielectric was 1.2cm2/Vs and 0.1 cm2/Vs in the ON and OFF states respectively. Clear discrimination betweenthe two states was observed when a simple circuit containing a load resistor was used to testthe device logic AND functionality at 10Hz.

Couplings to cationresonances are clearly very important in the IR/vis region–what do you anticipate to be therole of these strong field couplings and how can you unpick this effect in theexperiment?Fernando Martín responded: In the experiment; the molecule is ionized by usinga single XUV attosecond pulse. This process is clean and it is not contaminated by thepresence of an IR pulse. This second pulse is used to probe the dynamics induced by theattosecond pulse. Therefore it is at this stage where the IR field can induce additionalcouplings between the cationic states that might complicate the analysis of the dynamicsinduced by the attosecond pulse or even blur it.

The nanocrystalline Er metals have the same hexagonalclose packed structure as that of coarse-grained sample. Decrease in grain size results inremarkable changes in the three magnetic ordering temperatures of the nanocrystalline Ermetal. At 5 K; the magnetization drops by 10.9%; while the coercivity increases by 4 times fornanocrystalline Er compared with those of coarse-grained sample.

Why can’t experimentalists agree on the superconducting critical exponents?,MC Sullivan; DR Strachan; Su Li; Hua Xu; K Segawa; Yoichi Ando; Steven M Anlage; CJ Lobb,Abstract The scaling analysis of voltage vs. current curves has been an invaluable tool in thestudy of the normal-superconducting phase transition; both in zero-field and in the vortex–glass transition in a field. However; we have recently shown that the conventional scalinganalysis is too flexible to uniquely determine the critical parameters. We have also shownthat extrinsic effects such as current noise; small magnetic fields (for the zero-field transition);and finite size effects can obscure and even destroy the three-dimensional phase transition.These factors have led to the wide range of values for the dynamic critical exponent z andthe static critical exponent ν reported in the literature; even for the zero-field transition. Wehave developed a criterion that removes the flexibility in the scaling analysis and haveconducted experiments to eliminate the extrinsic effects described above.

Is there a vortex-glass transition in high-temperature superconductors?,DR Strachan; MC Sullivan; P Fournier; SP Pai; T Venkatesan; CJ Lobb,Abstract: We show that DC voltage versus current measurements of a YBCO micro-bridge ina magnetic field can be collapsed onto scaling functions proposed by Fisher; Fisher; andHuse; as is widely reported in the literature. We find; however; that good data collapse isachieved for a wide range of critical exponents and temperatures. These results stronglysuggest that agreement with scaling alone does not prove the existence of a phasetransition. We propose a criterion to determine if the data collapse is valid; and thus if aphase transition occurs. To our knowledge; none of the data reported in the literature meetour criterion.,arXiv preprint cond-mat/0011014,2000,1

Thermal Relaxation in Gases: A New Method of Analysing the Experimental Data,ACJ Johnson,Abstract It is shown that in the case of a single relaxation in a gas the relaxation time can befound in a simple manner if measurements are made of both the velocity dispersion and theabsorption per wavelength. The problem is reduced to one of fitting circles and straight linesto the data. In the case of a multiple relaxation it is shown how the individual relaxation timescan be found. The method is applied to some published results in a few gases to show theworking of the method in practice.,Proceedings of the Physical Society,1959,1

Non-perturbative Quantification of Ionic Charge Transfer through Nm-Scale Protein Pores Using Graphene Microelectrodes,Jinglei Ping; AT Johnson; AT Charlie Johnson Team,Abstract Conventional electrical methods for detecting charge transfer through protein poresperturb the electrostatic condition of the solution and chemical reactivity of the pore; and arenot suitable to be used for complex biofluids. We developed a non-perturbative methodology(fW input power) for quantifying trans-pore electrical current and detecting the pore status(ie; open vs. closes) via graphene microelectrodes. Ferritin was used as a model proteinfeaturing a large interior compartment; well-separated from the exterior solution with discretepores as charge commuting channels. The charge flowing through the ferritin pores transfersinto the graphene microelectrode and is recorded by an electrometer. In this example; ourmethodology enables the quantification of an inorganic nanoparticle-protein nanoporeinteraction in complex biofluids.,APS March Meeting Abstracts,2017,*

The resonant cavity will have a long lifetime; while theexcited molecules will evolve on a much faster time; which can change their absorptionspectrum and thus the strength of interaction with the cavity. Will this be a problem for themethod that you are proposing? Shaul Mukamel replied: This is not a problem in theapplications I presented. The cavity eld is stationary and its only role is static: It dresses thebare molecular states to create joint molecule/ eld (polariton) states.

Preventing Oxide Adhesion of Liquid Metal Alloys to Enable Actuation in Microfluidic Systems,Ishan Joshipura; Alexander Johnson; Hudson Ayers; Michael Dickey,Abstract This work explores the wetting behavior of an oxide-coated liquid metal; eutecticalloy of gallium and indium (EGaIn'); which remains a liquid at room temperature. Liquidmetals uniquely combine fluidity with metallic properties. Combined; these properties enablesoft; stretchable; and shape reconfigurable electronics withsofter than skin'interfaces. Gaforms spontaneously a thin surface oxide that alters its wetting behavior and makes it difficultto move across surfaces without leaving residue behind. We examine the effects of surfaceroughness (ie; Cassie-Baxter state) and lubrication to minimize adhesion of Ga oxide tosurfaces. Lubricated surfaces create aslip-layer'of liquid between the metal and surface thatalso inhibits wetting.

Schottky diode based on WS2 crossed with PEDOT/PSSA,Deliris Ortiz; Nicholas Pinto; Carl Naylor; AT Johnson,Abstract An easy technique to fabricate a Schottky diode with WS2 and PEDOT-PSSA underambient conditions is presented. WS2 is an air stable transition metal dichalcogenidesemiconductor. When connected as a field effect transistor; WS2 exhibited n-type behaviorwith a charge mobility of~ 7cm2/Vs on SiO2. PEDOT/PSSA is a conducting polymer that canbe electro-spun to form fibers with a conductivity of~ 1 S/cm.

Electrical response of monolayer MoS2 to vapors of aliphatic alcohols,Pablo Sepulveda; Idalia Ramos; Carl Naylor; AT Johnson; Nicholas Pinto,Abstract Monolayer MoS2 crystals were used to sense vapors of Methanol; Ethanol and 1-Propanol. Due to the large surface area; these sensors are expected to show rapid responseand recovery times. The current through the sensor was monitored as a function of time witha constant applied voltage. This current decreased in the presence of the sensing gas andrecovered upon its removal. Our results show that the response time gets longer as the sizeof the alcohol increases; but the recovery time stays approximately the same (~ 20s)regardless of the size of the alcohol. The sensitivity was also seen to decrease as the size ofthe alcohol increased. These observations could be associated with the slower diffusion ofthe larger alcohol molecules into the MoS2 crystal. The sensors are also fairly robust sincethe same sensor was used in all of the measurements after annealing in air at 70C for 10 …,APS March Meeting Abstracts,2016,*

Can you explain why this is the case?Artem Rudenko responded: It indicates that thedissociation to the CO+ O+ channel does not proceed via the ground state of the CO 2+ ion;in contrast to sequential double ionization. This is consistent with the conclusions made inM. Opperman; et al. 1 The appearance of the spin–orbit frequency of the excited A-stateindicates that this dissociation channel at least partly proceeds via the excitation to the A-state.,Faraday discussions,2016,*

Graphene decorated with mu-opioid receptor: the ionic screening effect and detection of enkephalin,Jinglei Ping; AT Johnson; Renyu Liu; AT Charlie Johnson Team; Renyu Liu Collaboration,Abstract We investigated the properties of graphene field effect transistors (GFETs)decorated with a computaionally redesigned; water-soluble variant of the human mu-opioidreceptor (wsMOR) in physiological buffer solution. The shift of the Fermi level in the GFETs isquantitatively described by chemical-gating effect of charges on the wsMOR that arescreened by the ionic solution. Our results suggest that sensitivity to the molecular target islost when the Debye screening length of the solution is shorter than the distance from thegraphene to the wsMOR; thus de-salting may be necessary when wsMOR decorated GFETsare used as biosensors in solution.

Charge transport in CVD graphene,Marishka Oquendo Mustafa; Gabriel Calderon; Josee Vedrine; Gang Hee; Allen Johnson; Nicholas Pinto,Abstract Graphene is a mono-layer of sp 2 bonded carbon atoms arranged in a honeycombpattern. It is considered a promising candidate for the next generation of electronic materialsas it exhibits both electron and hole conduction with extremely high carrier mobilities.Graphene films were prepared via chemical vapor deposition and then transferred to dopedSi/SiO 2 wafers. It was washed in toluene several times to remove any organic deposits leftbehind during the transfer process. Atomic force microscopy images shows that thegraphene surface is very rough. The graphene device was then electrically characterized ina field effect transistor configuration as a function of temperature and the resistancecalculated at the Dirac point minimum of the device transconductance curve. The Dirac pointresistance showed weak temperature dependence characteristic of graphene. Thermally …,2014 NCUR,2014,*
Putting it all together: quantum process tomography and pump–probe spectroscopies,Joel Yuen-Zhou; Jacob J Krich; Ivan Kassal; Allan S Johnson; Alán Aspuru-Guzik,We will now tie all the previous results together and show how a sequence of PP 0experiments can be used to perform QPT. So far; we have shown that a PP 0 signal SPP0yields information on the dynamics of the SEM both for coupled dimers in the absence ofcoupling to a vibrational bath B (example 6) or in the context of strictly adiabatic electronicdynamics (example 7). In this chapter; we will lift these restrictions and extend the discussionto the general coupled dimer; which; regardless of the electronic basis of S; can featuretransfers between different electronic states due to coupling to vibrations in B. We will showthat for ultrashort broadband pulses P and P 0; and for a given waiting time T; the signal maybe represented as a linear combination of elements of the process matrix χ (T) of the SEM;which is the main object to reconstruct in QPT.

Possible generation of $\gamma $-ray laser by electrons wiggling in a background laser,Qi-Ren Zhang,To extend the spectrum of lasers to the γ-ray range is a long dream for both nuclear and laserphysicists. It means fantastic improvement of techniques; such as much more precise measurementsof space-time; holography for nanometer size or even smaller objects; and so on. There are variousproposals[1–7] for its realization; including those of using nuclear decay and condensedpositron- ium decay and those of using γ−ray emitted by wiggling charged particles. [1; 2] arereview articles. We preferred the way of using the radiations from charged particles wigglingin a periodically bent crystal[5–7]. However; this proposal assumes that the crystal is ideal.Contrar- ily; the real crystals are not ideal. They have lacunae and impurities. This point hurtsthe reliability of the proposal. Another problem is that; the theory used in this proposal is notfundamental; which also spoils its reliability. Moreover; to bend the crystal periodically in …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1408.3112,2014,*

Semi-classical Methods in Non-Sequential Double Ionization,Allan S Johnson; André Staudte; DM Villeneuve,Non-sequential double ionization of an atom in an intense laser field is a prototypicalproblem in multi-body strong field interactions. To examine non-sequential doubleionization; an often used approach is the semi-classical method; by which initial conditionsare set according to quantum expressions and the ensuing dynamics modelled classically.Here we present a comparative study of quantum and semi-classical methods in the singleactive electron approximation. We show that semi-classical methods over-estimate thekinetic energy of rescattered electrons by up to 150%. We further show that the return time ofthe recolliding electrons deviates between quantum and semi-classical methods at lowintensities; and that the deviation is attributable to the choice of the initial tunnelling position.,Chinese Journal of Physics,2014,*

Research performed over the lastdecade revealed that cells surrounding the central canal of the adult spinal cord and formingthe ependymal layer acquire stem cell properties either in vitro or in response to injury.Following SCI activated ependymal cells generate progeny cells which migrate to the injurysite but fail to produce the appropriate type of cells in sufficient number to limit the damage;rendering this physiological response mainly ineffective. Research is now focusing on themanipulation of ependymal cells to produce cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage which areprimarily lost in such a situation leading to secondary neuronal degeneration.

Distinguishing excitonic from vibronic oscillations in ultrafast spectroscopy,Jacob Krich; Joel Yuen; Allan Johnson; Joseph Goodknight; Alán Aspuru-Guzik,Abstract Ultrafast experiments on photosynthetic and conjugated organic systems haveindicated that coherent delocalization of exciton states significantly contributes to excitontransport; even up to room temperature. Oscillations in 2D spectra due to excitonicdelocalization can be similar to those from vibronic oscillations; which are not important forexciton transport. We describe a straightforward experiment-broadband pump-probe-todistinguish between ultrafast oscillations from excitonic or vibronic-only sources.

Bio-nano Hybrids for Chemical Detection,Charlie Johnson,[evdate 2012-09-26] IAS/School of Engineering Joint Lecture. Abstract: The speaker and hisresearch group have explored all-electronic chemical detectors based on bio-nano hybrids;where the biomolecule (DNA or protein) provides chemical recognition and a carbonnanotube (NT) or graphene transistor enables electronic readout. This sensor classrepresents a promising approach towards sensitive detection of liquid-and vapor-phaseanayltes. NT or graphene transistors are functionalized with proteins through an amide bondusing a robust process based on carboxylated diazonium salts. Control of protein orientationis achieved through the use of a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) chemistry with affinity for thehistidine tag on an engineered protein. They used this approach to create a nanoelectronicinterface to olfactory receptor proteins (ORs) that were embedded in synthetic nanoscale …,*,2012,*

Trainable solar cell effect in TPPS4 nanowires.,Katherine L Van Aken; Marjon Zamani; Ian W Halvic; Zhengqing J Qi; AT Johnson; Walter F Smith,Abstract We have measured photovoltaic currents for self-assembled meso-tetra (4-sulfonato-phenyl) porphine (TPPS4) nanowires. This is surprising; given that our devices aresymmetrical. However; by``training''the nanowires with a bias voltage; we can break thissymmetry. After training; when the nanowires are illuminated with a 488 nm laser under zerobias voltage; a solar cell current is observed; with polarity opposite to the training voltage.The magnitude of solar cell current depends on both the time of training and the magnitudeof the training voltage. After the training voltage is removed; the solar cell current decaysvery quickly initially and then transitions to a much slower decay. This suggests that thereare different populations of trapped charges that are repositioned by the electric field of thetraining voltage; and that are responsible for the solar cell current.

Polarizationmemories show ultrafast dynamics within the PL lifetime in solid GO preparations where theincident light lies fully in the plane of the GO flakes.

Photoconductivity of complexes of chrysotile with tetra (4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrins created via ionic self-assembly,Wesley Chu; Walter Smith; Ye Lu; AT Johnson; Giovanna De Luca; Luigi Scolaro,Abstract Tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl) porphine (TPPS4) molecules form complexes withchrysotile nanotubes in a chloroform-methanol solvent; the self-assembly is driven byCoulombic attractions. The UV/vis absorption spectrum indicates J-aggregation. In AFM; thecomplexes appear as straight; long tubes when deposited onto oxidized silicon substrates.Preliminary experiments conducted in a dry nitrogen atmosphere (0.2% oxygenconcentration) show that the aggregates are photoconductive. When illuminated for longperiods at 428 nm; the photoconductivity grows slowly; and there is also a growth ofpersistent photoconductivity. These observations are similar to those for nanorods self-assembled from TPPS4 (without chrysotile); though the current levels are much lower in thechrysotile complexes.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2011,*

Teasing Apart the Influence of Past Land Use and Current Invertebrate Processes on the Controls of Soil Organic Matter Stabilization in Eastern Deciduous Forests;...,Y Ma; TR Filley; CT Johnston; KA Szlavecz; M McCormick; C Thayer; J Jourdain; A Johnson,Abstract Our work seeks to identify how earthworm (EW) activity and past land interact tocontrol the relative importance of physical; chemical; and biochemical protectionmechanisms governing SOM stabilization in deciduous forests. Within forests of theSmithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) in coastal Maryland; USA; wood andlitter amendment plots were established in high; low and no EW activity areas within forestsof different stand age and land use history to study the controlling factor for litter-soilsystems. Through a detailed soil survey and litter decay study we have demonstrated thatplant biopolymer chemistry of both decayed litter and soil (0-5 cm) particulate organic matter(POM) is driven by variation in EW activity and is responsible for the differences observed inlignin and root aliphatic matter accumulation in this system.

Changes in forest floor composition and chemistry along an invasive earthworm gradient in a hardwood forest,JN Jourdain; TR Filley; SM Top; C Thayer; A Johnson; M Jenkins; P Welle; S Zurn-Birkhimer; T Kroeger,Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated how invasive European earthworm specieshave caused large and long lasting perturbations to forest floor dynamics and soilcomposition in many northern hardwood forests. The type of perturbation is driven primarilyby the composition and activity of the invasive species and the original state of the forestsystem. Over the past 4 years we have investigated an invasive earthworm front movingthrough the Ojibwa Red Lake Reservation (Minnesota). Significant shifts in litter and organichorizon mass were observed; similar to other gradients identified in the region; but thespecies of earthworms exhibited differences compared to other reservation lands in theregion--possibly driven by the availability of recreation fishing near to the sites. Sharpgradients in earthworm abundance were observed exhibiting shifts from 600-900 …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2010,*
Potential impacts of invasive European earthworms and soil moisture on herbaceous species richness within the Ojibwa Red Lake Reservation,C Thayer; SM Top; TR Filley; J Jourdain; S Zurn-Birkhimer; T Kroeger; P Welle; M Jenkins; A Johnson,Abstract Throughout many northern North American forests invasive earthworms havecaused significant ecological alteration to soil structure and chemistry; fine root distributions;duff and litter layer thickness; and soil moisture. Additionally; this phenomenon has beenimplicated in shifts in herbaceous-layer vegetation. Over the past 4 years; we haveestablished research plots in forests on the Ojibwa Red Lake Reservation (Minnesota) tostudy the impact of exotic earthworms on forest ecosystem structure and functions. Toexamine herbaceous-layer response to potential gradients in earthworm abundance andsoil moisture; we conducted surveys of herbaceous-layer species cover; earthwormabundance; and soil moisture across six plot dispersed along a previously identifiedgradient of earthworm activity. Our initial results have shown that the earthworms …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2010,*
The emergence of antibiotic resistance in the hospital environment,ALAN JOHNSON,The discovery of different classes of antibiotic from the late 1940s onwards and theirintroduction into clinical use was a major breakthrough in the fight against bacterialinfections. Their initial success was so dramatic that; in the 1960s; the US Surgeon GeneralWilliam H. Stewart is reputed to have declared that 'it is time to close the book on infectiousdiseases'. 1 Four decades later; and with the benefit of hindsight; it is evident that suchoptimism was entirely misplaced. The reality is that infectious disease remains the secondmost common cause of death worldwide; 2 and in terms of bacterial infections; our failure tocontrol these diseases is related in large part to the emergence of antibiotic resistance.Antibiotic resistance can arise in individual strains of bacteria through the mutation of genesthat encode target sites to which antibiotics bind; with the result that antibiotic-binding is …,Environmental Medicine,2010,*

Graphene Nanoconstriction Field Effect Transistor,Ye Lu; Brett Goldsmith; Douglas Strachan; AT Johnson,Abstract We report an approach to fabricate monolayer graphene nanoconstriction fieldeffect transistors (NCFETs) with critical dimensions below 10 nm; a regime that is notaccessible by conventional nanolithography. We start by fabricating a gold nanowire on topof mechanically-exfoliated monolayer graphene. We use Feedback ControlledElectromigration to form a nanoconstriction in the gold wire; which is then used as an etchmask for the graphene during an oxygen plasma patterning step. We observe the opening ofa confinement-induced energy gap as the NCFET width is reduced; as evidenced by a sharpincrease in the NCEFT on/off ratio; which can be as large as 1100 at room temperature forthe thinnest devices. Such devices deliver up to 100microampere current at 50mV bias withan on state resistance of 50kilo ohm; which is at least an order of magnitude lower than …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2010,*
Memristance in single-component metallic nanowires,Stephen Johnson; Patrick Hunley; Abhishek Sundararajan; Douglas Strachan,Abstract In this talk; we will discuss a new type of memristor-one whose state variable is itsphysical geometry. Using a single metallic material; we employ electromigration to changethe resistance of metallic nanowires. The resistive switching is due to the creation/filling-in ofvoids in the nanowire as atoms are pushed back and forth by the electrical current.Exploiting electromigration in this manner; we repeatedly switch the resistance of single-component metallic nanowires between low and high states over many cycles. This workthus completes the array of fundamental passive circuit elements; now including thememristor; which can be fabricated from a single metallic material.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2010,*
Large sensor array based on functionalized graphene devices,Zhengtang Luo; Daniel W Singer; Matthew E Berck; Luke A Somers; Lolita Rotkina; Brett R Goldsmith; AT Charlie Johnson,Graphene has been shown to have an extraordinary set of electronic properties and itschemical affinity is readily tuned by functionalization with a broad range of molecules. It isknown that field effect transistors based on single-layer graphene demonstrate extremelyhigh sensitivity for chemical sensing. It is thus very important to achieve fabrication ofintegrated circuits on large-area graphene in order to realize practical applications; eg anadvanced “electronic nose” system. Utilizing recent advances in graphene and grapheneoxide preparation and functionalization techniques; we aim to achieve fabrication of sensorarrays using conventional photolithography; where signals from the array are coupled tosignal-conditioning electronics and sensor responses fed to odor recognition algorithms toperform detection and classification of vapors.,Nanoelectronics Conference (INEC); 2010 3rd International,2010,*
Wetland Mitigation in Abandoned Gravel Pits: Creating Fresh Meadow and Shrub Swamp,Kurt Johnson; Gary Walton; Andrew Johnson,It is becoming increasingly difficult to provide on-site mitigation for wetland impacts due toroad construction in northeastern Minnesota counties that retain greater than 80 percent oftheir pre-settlement wetlands. Abandoned gravel pits are one of the few remaining areasthat can serve as wetland mitigation sites within the impacted watersheds. The overall goalof the project is to develop cost effective methods for creating functional mitigation wetlandson abandoned gravel pit sites to compensate for wetland impacts due to road construction innortheastern Minnesota. More specifically; the aim is to achieve" in-kind" compensation bycreating wetlands of the same type and function as those being disturbed; such as freshmeadow and shrub swamp.

Size Selection of Metal Nanoparticles on Few Layer Graphene,Luke A Somers; Zhengtang Luo; EJ Mele; AT Johnson,Abstract We find layer number dependence in the size of metal nanoparticles grown on 1 to10 layer graphene. Graphene is an attractive substrate for investigating and usingnanoparticles due to its loose interaction with them. To preserve this condition it is ideal togrow particles in place rather than deposit them from solution. We find that annealing ofevaporated metal nanoparticles on graphene and few layer graphene surfaces tightens theirsize distribution. The number of graphene layers changes the selected size. These resultsare in quantitative agreement with a model incorporating surface; bulk; and coulomb freeenergies.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2009,*
Optical and diamagnetic anisotropy of graphene oxide,AL Exarhos; PM Vora; Z Lou; AT Johnson; JM Kikkawa,Abstract We have recently shown that graphene oxide (GO) emits a broadphotoluminescence (PL) band in both solid and aqueous preparations. The origin of this PLis not yet well understood; but for absorptive and emissive optical processes originating inthe two dimensional GO plane; one expects an in-plane polarization. Studies of opticalanisotropy can therefore help to clarify the origin of the PL. Here we use a method of opticalnanomagnetometry (Torrens; et al; JACS 129; p. 252 (2007)) to extract these quantities; alsodetermining the magnetic anisotropy. We find that when aqueous preparations of GO areplaced in a magnetic field; diamagnetically induced alignment leads to marked linearpolarization anisotropy of absorbance and photoluminescence. By taking six opticalmeasurements at each magnetic field; we are able to extract the intrinsic polarization …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2009,*
Calculation of the free energy of binding of DNA bases on a single-wall carbon nanotube,Robert Johnson; AT Johnson; Michael Klein,Abstract Biological molecules can be combined with inorganic nanostructures to formmultifunctional hybrid materials with unique properties that will drives advances innanoelectronics; environmental safety; medicine and homeland security. One such materialof contemporary interest is the DNA-carbon nanotube hybrid (DNA-CN); which consists of asingle-wall carbon nanotube (SWCN) coated with a self-assembled monolayer of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Computation and experiment indicate that DNA-CN self-assembleswith DNA bases binding to SWCN sidewall. However; the nature; strength and solvationeffects of base-SWCN binding have not been studied in detail. To address these issues andexpand our understanding of DNA-CN; we have computed the binding free energy ofindividual DNA bases with SWCN using alchemical free energy methods.

Thermal Effects in Precision Nano-Electronics Construction,Stephen Johnson; Douglas Strachan,Abstract The development of high precision nano-electronics requires a detailedunderstanding of the non-equilibrium thermal effects during their construction and use. Tobetter understand the dynamics of these nano-scale thermal effects; we investigatenanowires and nano-scale junctions of various dimensions with applied electric currents.During the application of current; significant joule heating occurs which induces thestructures to evolve through thermo-and electromigration processes. A distinct change in thesymmetry of these processes indicates that different mechanisms occur at the various stagesof evolution. The results are compared to detailed thermal modeling of our structures andhave implications on the development of a wide range of novel nanoscale devices.Supported in part by NSF Award No. DMR-0805136; the Kentucky NSF EPSCoR program …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2009,*

Probing Vapor Phase Analytes with Single Walled Carbon Nanotube Biopolymer Hybrid Devices.,Samuel Khamis; Michelle Chen; AT Johnson,Abstract Covalent and non-covalent functionalization schemes have been investigated inorder to tune the chemical affinity of Single Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWNT) Field EffectTransistors (FET's). Non-covalent means are preferable since they have minimal impact onthe electronic structure of pristine nanotubes. We present work involving the non-covalentadsorption of both ss-DNA and ss-RNA strands to SWNT FET's in order to obtain a class ofdevices that respond electrically to the presence of gaseous odors. We present a databaserepresenting measurements of hundreds of such devices; involving ten different sequencesof ss-DNA; two different sequences of ss-RNA; and five different chemical vapors. We showthat these responses are determined by the sequence of the adsorbed species ofbiopolymer; and we explore the performance limits of these devices.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2008,*
Remarkable Effects of Gating on the Photoconductivity of Porphyrin Nanorods,CK Riley; X Huang; WF Smith; DE Johnston; AT Johnson,Abstract Tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl) porphine self assembles into well-defined nanorodswith intriguing photoelectronic properties.^ 1 For example; when light is applied; theconductivity immediately jumps up from zero; then grows further over several hours. Thismay be due to a light-induced structural change. In recent experiments; we imaged thenanorods with AFM while measuring the photoconductivity; we observed no change inmorphology. We also deposited nanorods onto oxidized silicon substrates. We find that thephotoconductivity is not sensitive to the value of the gate voltage applied to the underlyingsilicon; but only to changes in the gate voltage. The photoconductivity increases when thegate voltage is increased; but then relaxes back to its original level over about one hour.When the gate voltage is decreased; the photoconductivity decreases; and again slowly …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2008,*
Dielectrophoretic Trapping of Au Nanoparticles using High Quality Nanogap Electrodes,Ye Lu; Danvers E Johnston; Douglas R Strachan; Beth S Guiton; Peter K Davies; Tae-Hong Park; Michael J Therien; AT Johnson,Abstract In the past decade; single molecule-based electronic devices have drawnenormous attention. One of the great challenges to be overcome is the fabrication of well-defined; uncontaminated nanogap electrodes; and the subsequent assembly of individualmolecules or nanoparticles onto the contacts. A promising route to this goal is the feedbackcontrolled electromigration (FCE) process; which can be used to create stable; metal-particlefree nanogap contacts at temperatures ranging from 4--300 K.^ 1; 2 Here we describeexperiments where Au nanoparticles (NPs) are assembled inside FCE fabricated nanogapsby using positive AC dielectrophoresis (DEP). Specific challenges relating to circuit designfor efficient DEP and solutions to these challenges are discussed. Additionally; substrateinteractions are found to substantially influence dielectrophoretic assembly. Methods for …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2008,*

Structure of a DNA-carbon nanotube hybrid using replica exchange molecular dynamics,Robert Johnson; AT Johnson; Michael Klein,Abstract DNA-carbon nanotube hybrids (DNA-CN) are novel nanoscale materials thatconsist of single-wall carbon nanotubes coated with a self-assembled monolayer of singlestranded DNA (ssDNA). Many recent experiments have demonstrated that this nanomaterialis an ideal candidate for a variety of nanotechnological applications. Despite the importanceof this material; a complete understanding of its structural and physical properties is lacking.Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of this nanomaterial have providedinformation about the self-assembly mechanisms and possible ssDNA conformations thatcharacterize DNA-CN. However; MD simulations of biopolymers at low temperatures (T 300K) result in kinetic trapping and limits sampling of ssDNA configurational space.

STM study of MOCVD-grown a-plane ZnO thin films: film thickness; growth temperature; and substrate miscut effects,O Dulub; U Diebold; G Saraf; Y Lu,Abstract ZnO films with a-plane orientation were grown on r-plane (011bar2) sapphiresubstrates using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The surfacemorphology of ZnO films with various thicknesses (20--2000 nm); growth temperatures (300-580^ oC); and substrate miscut orientations and angles (0.2-2^ o) was characterized by lowenergy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Our resultsshow strong dependence of surface morphology on growth parameters and the substratemiscut. STM images reveal uniform surfaces with small; rectangular terraces during theinitial growth stage (20 nm-thick film). Films with thicknesses between 100 and 450 nm havea characteristic wave-like surface morphology with needle-shaped domains runningpredominantly along the crystallographic c-direction.

To demonstrate its utility; it was applied to the asymmetrichydrogenation of ketones. Although the only substrates tested in this report were b-hydroxyketones 1; the enantioselectivity obtained is high. Previous hydrogenation methods usingRu (II)/MeO-BIPHEP are excellent for alkyl ketones; but gave 95% ee with aryl ketones like 1(P. Bertus et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40; 3175-3178). Comment: The new ligand 4presents only planar chirality. Also; it can potentially act either as a bidentate P; O-or P; P-ligand; or as a tridentate P; P; O-ligand.

High Quality Nanogap Electrodes for Electronic Transport Measurements of Single Molecules,Danvers E Johnston; Douglas R Strachan; Beth S Guiton; Peter K Davies; Dawn A Bonnell; AT Charlie Johnson,ABSTRACT Electromigrated nanogaps have frequently been used in molecular scaleelectronics. We use a computer controlled electromigration (CCE) process for creatingnanogaps at room temperature permitting characterization of bare gaps prior to applicationof molecules. This is very different from other approaches where nanogaps are formed by asimple voltage ramp performed at low temperature with molecules already attached to thenanowire. Using CCE; we formed nanogaps at room temperature on both thick substratesand thin SiNx membranes compatible with transmission electron microscopy. We showedthat the electromigration process evolves through an initial bulk behavior regime andcrosses over to a ballistic conduction regime. It was found that nanogaps formed on SiNxmembranes are clean of parasitic conduction pathways and contamination. This work has …,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2007,*
Sequence Dependent Single Stranded DNA-Single Walled Carbon Nanotube Interactions and Their Applications in Detection of Gaseous Analytes,Samuel Khamis; Michelle Chen; Robert Johnson; AT Johnson,Abstract Recently there has been great interest in sensing strategies based on the use ofnon-covalent means to tune the chemical affinity of single walled carbon nanotube fieldeffect transistors (SWNT FET's).

Persistent Photoconductivity and Photo-induced Morphology Changes of Porphyrin Nanorods,BE Feldman; EA Muller; VH Joines; WF Smith; AD Schwab; JC de Paula; DE Johnston; AT Johnson,Abstract Tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl) porphine self assembles into well-defined nanorodswith intriguing photoelectronic properties.^ 1 Recently; we have found that; over long timescales; they undergo a transition from non-persistent photoconductivity (NPPC) to a newmode; in which part of the conductivity persists after the light is blocked; decaying overhundreds of seconds. NPPC initially dominates; but its growth asymptotes within 2-3 hoursof illumination; while the persistent current continues to grow; even after 8 hours of lightexposure. The decay of persistent current after the light is blocked can be roughly modeledby a single exponential; a double exponential fits much better. The morphology of somenanorods changes as a result of long-term illumination---they become shorter; thinner andless well-formed. Other rods; however; appear unchanged.

Observation of unusual structure in the low-temperature conductance of carbon nanotubes,Jeffrey D Stephens; Jerome C Licini; AT Johnson; Douglas R Strachan; Sam Khamis; Danvers E Johnston,Abstract Carbon nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition on a oxidized siliconsubstrate were contacted to form a gated sample consisting of a pair of tubes in parallel. Thesample was tested at low temperature and high magnetic field using a dilution refrigeratorand superconducting magnet. The current versus bias voltage graph shows a general trendconsistent with the linear relationship except at low voltage. Further investigation is done bycomputing the differential conductance (dI/dV) and investigating how it varies with biasvoltage. Here we see some intriguing behavior including a substantial increase inconductivity near zero voltage and a pronounced asymmetry with bias voltage. Thetemperature dependence of the zero field peak and asymmetry show that they appear at lowtemperatures and receding quickly by 3.0 K. However; the magnetic field dependence is …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2007,*

The magnetic field peaks show complicated shifts and possible splits.The simplest interpretation that satisfies the data is that of a metallic tube whose Schottkybarriers to the external contacts are asymmetric. The observation of a Kondo effect thatvaries with bias polarity dramatically illustrates the impact of coupling to the external leads.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2007,*

Reversible Persistence and Effects of Oxygen on the Photoconductivity of Porphyrin Nanorods,EA Muller; VH Joines; WF Smith; AD Schwab; JC de Paula; DE Johnston; AT Johnson,Abstract Tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl) porphine (TPPS 4) self assembles^ 1 into well-definednanorods with intriguing photoelectronic properties.^ 2 New experiments show thatillumination under Ar for several hours induces a change to persistent behavior; ieconductivity decays slowly when light is removed; rather than dropping to zero. After resting24 hours; the sample recovers non-persistent behavior. The dark conductivity of TPPS 4aggregates formed by a different technique is sensitive to O 2.^ 3 We find that theconductivity under illumination of nanorod aggregates decreases when 0.2% O 2 is added;but this change is reversible. By contrast; if the sample is exposed to 21% O 2 shortly afterlight is removed; the photoconductivity is permanently lowered. These effects may be due toa combination of O 2-mediated quenching of excited state porphyrin and oxidation.^ 1A …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2006,*

The recorded change in the oscillation phase is proportional to the LDOS ofthe sample. We monitor the phase change as a function of both the tip voltage and cantileveroscillation amplitude for a fixed cantilever position above the sample. We also show that thisis a general electrostatic method that can be used to measure the band gap and LDOS ofboth conducting and insulating nanoscale systems with no need for electrical contacts.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2006,*

RNA interference and its feasibility in antiviral use,Z Shen; Z Luo,RNA interference (RNAi) is the process by which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directssequence-specific degradation of mRNA in animal and plant cells. In mammalian cells;RNAi can be triggered by 21-25 nucleotide duplexes of small interfering RNA (siRNA).Strategies to inhibit virus multiplication based on the siRNAs have gained greataccomplishment. But the high sequence specificity of RNA interference; combined with thetendency of the viruses such as HIV-1; HBV A; to rapidly generate sequence variability andtheir tendency to change their secondary structure or secrete resistant proteins; indicatesthat these viruses are easy to evolve resistance to RNAi. In this article; the author probe intothese problems and bring up some resolvents to these problems.,Chinese Bulletin of Life Sciences,2006,*

Controlled Fabrication of Nanogaps for Molecular Electronics,DR Strachan; DA Bonnell; T-H Park; FV Cochran,Abstract We have developed a controlled and highly reproducible method of makingnanometer-spaced electrodes using electromigration in ambient lab conditions. Thisadvance has several advantages over the typical method at liquid-helium temperatures. Oneadvantage is that it will make feasible electrical measurements of molecules that do notsurvive a sub-freezing environment. A second advantage is that it yields nanogaps ofdesired tunneling resistance; as opposed to the random formation at liquid-heliumtemperatures. We discuss how the nanogap evolves through three regimes--a bulk-neckregime where electromigration is triggered at constant temperature; then a few-atom regimecharacterized by quantized plateaus in the conductance; and finally to a tunneling regimeacross the nanogap once the conductance falls below the conductance quantum (G o …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2005,*

The superconducting phase transition obscured by finite-size effects in thick $\mathrm {\bf {YBa_ {2} Cu_ {3} O_ {7-\delta}}} $ films,MC Sullivan; RA Ott; M Lilly; DR Strachan; T Frederiksen; CJ Lobb,Abstract We report on the normal-superconducting phase transition in thick $\mathrm {YBa_{2} Cu_ {3} O_ {7-\delta}} $ films in zero magnetic field. We find significant finite-size effectsat low currents even in our thickest films ($ d= 3200$ $\mathrm {\AA} $). Using data at highercurrents; we can unambiguously find $ T_c $ and $ z $; and show $ z= 2.1\pm 0.15$; asexpected for the three-dimensional XY model with diffusive dynamics. The crossover to two-dimensional behavior; seen by other researchers in thinner films ($ d\leq 500$ $\mathrm{\AA} $); obscures the three-dimensional transition in both zero field and the vortex-glasstransition in field; leading to incorrect values of $ T_c $(or $ T_g $); $\nu $; and $ z $.

Atotal of 43 7 cows from two dairy herds; with no clinical mastitis and four functional quarters;were enrolled at dry off. Prior to the final milking all quarters were sampled forbacteriological culture and SCC analysis. After milking all four quarters were infused with acommercially available long-acting dry cow antibiotic. Two contra-lateral quarters were theninfused with an internal teat seal (Orbeseal®; Pfizer Animal Health; New York; NY).Following calving the teat seal was stripped out at first milking.

Predictions of mortality from mesothelioma,AW Musk; NH de Klerk; A Johnson; DH Yates,The update of predictions of mortality from pleural mesothelioma in the Netherlands1provides welcome news that the peak number and the total during 2000–28 are nowpredicted to be only a little more than half of the figures predicted only four years earlier. 2This marked change in prediction has occurred because the known decrease in asbestosuse after 1984 and a ban in 1993 were taken into account in the modelling; and there werefive extra years of data (1994–98).

Memory Effect and Role of Defects in Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors,AT Johnson,We fabricate air‐stable n‐type; ambipolar carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs);and use them in nanoscale memory cells. Room temperature transport and CoulombBlockade data indicate that these CNFETs behave similarly to metallic nanotubes at“degenerate” electrostatic doping. Extreme sensitivity of the CNFET channel to nearbycharge is harnessed to construct data storage elements that operate at the few‐electronlevel. We probe the influence of defects on electron transport in CNFETs by combinedscanning gate microscopy (SGM) and scanning impedance microscopy (SIM). Depletionsurface potential of individual defects is quantified from the SGM‐imaged defect radius as afunction of tip bias voltage. This provides a measure of the Fermi level at the defect with zerotip voltage.,AIP Conference Proceedings,2002,*

The long-range interactions between the steps and atoms on thesurface were found to have a very large impact on island formation. Densities of islandswere found to be quite different from the ones predicted by the standard scaling law. Thedistribution of islands was also greatly affected by the presence of steps. The concentrationof islands was found to be non-uniform on the surface and dependent on the distance fromthe steps.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2002,*
Examination of the critical regime in high-temperature superconductors,MC Sullivan; DR Strachan; Steven M Anlage; CJ Lobb,Abstract Conventional scaling analyses of current-voltage curves have yielded manydifferent values for the dynamic and static critical exponents in superconductors. Part of thedifficulty is that higher current data may be affected by sample heating; so it is often excludedfrom the analysis. A low-frequency high-current technique (PJM Wöltgens phet al.); Phys.Rev. B. 52; 4536 (1995) makes it possible to minimize heating effects. For lower currents; weemploy standard DC measurements. We will show that if we use the opposite concavitycriterion (DR Strachan phet al.); Phys. Rev.

The absorption maxina was found to lie at 590nminstead of 585nm in the absence of lactic acid. The apparent molar absorptivity achieved avalue of 1.26× 10 5L· mol-1· cm-1. The mole ratio of the mixed micellar ligand complex wasfound to be Sc (Ⅲ)∶ LA∶ ECR= 1∶ 1∶ 2.

The method incorporatescarbon nanotubes (NTs) within conventional electron beam resist (PMMA); and utilizes NTsin a modified shadow mask approach. Using this technique; we can attach electrical probesto the sides of individual bundle of single-walled carbon nanotubes. This enables us tomeasure transverse conduction on bundles; and quantify coupling of individual nanotubeswithin a rope. Preliminary results indicate that the coupling is indeed weak; as theconductance across the bundle is an order of magnitude greater than along its length.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2000,*

Investigation of Scaling Voltage-Current Measurements of YBCO Films,DR Strachan; P Fournier; MC Sullivan; T Venkatesan; CJ Lobb; RS Newrock,Abstract We report recent voltage versus current (IV) measurements near thesuperconducting phase transition of YBCO films. According to theory (DS Fisher phet al.);Phys. Rev. B 43; 130 (1991); these IV curves are expected to collapse onto scaling functionsin the critical region. As is typically done; by choosing an appropriate temperaturedependent coherence length; xi; a dynamic exponent; z; and a transition temperature; T_C;we find that it is possible to obtain a scaling collapse over a certain temperature rangeconsistent with a critical region. Despite this agreement with theory; we also find that thedata scales by defining lower T_Cs while increasing the value of z. We are even able tomaintain the scaling collapse when TC is defined outside of the critical region with the valueof z changing by more than a factor of 2. This indicates that a successful scaling collapse …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2000,*

The individualhoney-comb cells could be clearly resolved; in contrast to what is usually seen in the case ofHOPG.

Ropes of Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes: an STM Morphology Study.,J Lefebvre; AT Johnson,Abstract Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on ropes of single wall carbon nanotubes(SWNT) was performed under ambient conditions. Results show that ropes have apolycrystalline structure with grain size ranging from less than 10 nm to up to 100 nm; withtypical grain size between 10 and 20 nm. Grains entity seems to be preserved over theentire rope length. Implications of the rope polycrystallinity on the transport properties arediscussed. A study of ropes cross-sections reveals that they are not circular. In fact; ahistogram of the ratio``width over height''presents a marked peak at three along with a tailextending to values as high as twenty (likely called ribbons of SWNT).

Critical Exponents of the Superconducting Phase Transition in YBCO Films,DR Strachan; ZW Dong; A Cavanaugh; SP Pai; JM Repaci; T Venkatesan; CJ Lobb,Abstract We present nanovolt-level DC current-voltage (IV) measurements of YBCO films inzero magnetic field (background< 0.1 milligauss) which we use to find the correlation-lengthcritical exponent; phnu; and the dynamic critical exponent; phz; near the superconductingphase transition. By implementing the scaling ideas of Fisher; Fisher; and Huse (DS Fisherphet al.); Phys. Rev. B 43; 130 (1991); T c is determined by identifying the critical isothermwhich separates the qualitatively different behavior of the normal state from thesuperconducting state. The exponent phz is then determined by fitting the critical isotherm.Low-current measurements of the resistance vs temperature just above T_c; are analyzed toyield the remaining critical exponent; nu. Using these values for T_c; nu; and phz; the entireset of IV curves are then employed to test the scaling hypothesis.,APS March Meeting Abstracts,1998,*

Under parameters appropriateto experiment; the addition spectrum and the conductance of an array dominated by interdotcharging are qualitatively different from that of a Hubbard system. In general; this signaturein the energy spectrum exists for rings of quantum dots; in contrast to linear arrays; wherethe spectrum in the two cases are qualitatively similar. We trace the origin of this effect to theboundary conditions on the array.

The typical dwell time betweenswitching events is found to depend very strongly on the magnetic field; reaching values ofthe order of 100 s at large fields.,Surface science,1996,*
Open questions in non‐neutral plasma physics panel discussion,Moderated by Charles Roberson; Edited by Dan Dublin,Charles Roberson: Let me explain how we will run the session. First; I will make a fewremarks and so I have a few viewgraphs here to do. Then I will also use the privileges of themoderator by asking the first question of our panel members to get that part of the sessionstarted. After that we will open the questions up to the audience. The other thing I want to tryto do here is to encourage the students and recent graduate students to ask questions. Sothe last half hour or so will be devoted just to the questions from students or recentgraduates. You can ask questions at any other time but at that time; if you don't askquestions we're just going to sit here and wait. With those ground rules; let's begin. Now thetitle of this session is" Open Questions." For me; one of the open questions is;" Where arewe; and where do we go in this kind of field in general?"

Time-Resolved Tunneling of Single Electrons between Quantum Hall States in a Quantum Dot,NC Van Der Vaart; MP De Ruyter van Steveninck; LP Kouwenhoven; AT Johnson; A Van Der Enden; YV Nazarov; CJPM Harmans; CT Foxon,Abstract We have investigated Coulomb blockade oscillations in a quantum dot with twoconfined Landau levels. Some oscillations show switching between two discreteconductance values as a function of time. We show that these switches are due to singleelectron tunnel events between the two Landau levels. Upon increasing the magnetic field;we find that the time between two tunnel events reaches macroscopic values on the order of100 s. Furthermore; we observed two types of magneto conductance oscillations in theinteger quantum Hall regime resulting from the removal of single electrons from the dot andthe redistribution of electrons over the Landau levels.,*,1995,*

Irradiance and spectral distribution control system for controlled environment chambers.,MJ Krones; JC Sager; AT Johnson,Abstract This paper describes a closed-loop control system for controlling the irradiance andspectral quality generated by fluorescent lamps in a controlled environment chamber. The400 to 800 nm irradiance and the ratio of the red waveband (600 to 700 nm) to the far-redwaveband (700 to 800 nm) were independently controlled and varied as functions of time. Asuggested application is to investigate the possibility of synergistic effects of changingirradiance levels and changing spectral distributions on photoperiodism andphotomorphogenesis.,HortScience: a publication of the American Society for Horticultural Science,1987,*

The Effect of Processing Conditions on the Flexural Strength of Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) Used as Innovative Denture Base Material,SA MUHSIN; DJ WOOD; PV HATTON; A JOHNSON; N SERENO,Despite the fact that material scientists and researchers have continued to improve themechanical properties of denture base materials; none yet meet the ideal requirements. Therange of denture biomaterials is small and there is currently considerable interest in thedevelopment of new speciality materials. Current materials may not have appropriatemechanical properties for loadbearing dental devices. Flexural properties are a crucial factorin material selection for dental use. Polyetheretherketone(PEEK) has become established inmedical engineering as it is resistant to aggressive environments; and it has increasinglybeen suggested for dental applications. However; it is not known whether PEEK preparedusing either thermo-pressing or machining techniques would compromise the benefits ofPEEK compared to the conventional denture materials.

Calculatingaccurate accessibility data and visualizing it in an effective way is challenging. We designedand developed a web-based tool to visualize multi-modal job accessibility data in theChicago metropolitan area as the first step of an effort to build an integrated platform foraccessibility analysis and other urban planning tasks.,*,*,*

Finding the Absolute Configuration of Chiral Molecules with Coulomb Explosion Imaging,Martin Pitzer; Markus S Schöffler; Maksim Kunitski; Allan S Johnson; Lothar Ph H Till Jahnke; Horst Schmidt-Böcking; Reinhard Dörner,A deeper understanding of molecular chirality is of great interest in many domains: inpharmaceutical diagnostics; concerning the origin of biological homochirality and even forfundamental physics; as molecular properties may be linked to parity violation [1]. So far;experimental methods on the microscopic scale are restricted either to the investigation ofelectronic properties (Photoelectron circular dichroism;[2]) or to the analysis of fragment ionyields [3]. In both cases; however; quantities are typically averaged over all differentorientations of the molecule in space. Multi-fragment coincident imaging via the COLTRIMStechnique (Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy;[4]) opens a new way to explorethe properties of chiral molecules. Fully three-dimensional momenta of electrons and ionicfragments are recorded for each molecule individually. Here; we report for the first time …,*,*,*
