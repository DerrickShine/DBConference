Ownership structure and economic performance in the largest European companies,Steen Thomsen; Torben Pedersen,The paper examines the impact of ownership structure on company economic performancein 435 of the largest European companies. Controlling for industry; capital structure andnation effects we find a positive effect of ownership concentration on shareholder value(market-to-book value of equity) and profitability (asset returns); but the effect levels off forhigh ownership shares. Furthermore we propose and support the hypothesis that the identityof large owners-family; bank; institutional investor; government; and other companies-hasimportant implications for corporate strategy and performance. For example; compared toother owner identities; financial investor ownership is found to be associated with highershareholder value and profitability; but lower sales growth. The effect of ownershipconcentration is also found to depend on owner identity.,Strategic Management Journal,2000,1296
MNC knowledge transfer; subsidiary absorptive capacity; and HRM,Dana Minbaeva; Torben Pedersen; Ingmar Björkman; Carl F Fey; Hyeon Jeong Park,Abstract Based on a sample of 169 subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs)operating in the USA; Russia; and Finland; this paper investigates the relationship betweenMNC subsidiary human resource management (HRM) practices; absorptive capacity; andknowledge transfer. First; we examine the relationship between the application of specificHRM practices and the level of the absorptive capacity. Second; we suggest that absorptivecapacity should be conceptualized as being comprised of both employees' ability andmotivation. Further; results indicate that both ability and motivation (absorptive capacity) areneeded to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from other parts of the MNC.,Journal of international business studies,2003,1276
Transferring knowledge in MNCs: The role of sources of subsidiary knowledge and organizational context,Nicolai J Foss; Torben Pedersen,Abstract We link up with the recent literature on the differentiated MNC and in particular withits stress on intra-MNC knowledge flows. However; rather than focusing on thecharacteristics of knowledge as determinants of knowledge transfer within MNCs; we focusinstead on levels of knowledge in subsidiaries; the sources of transferable subsidiaryknowledge and on the organizational means and conditions that realize knowledge transferas the relevant determinants. We find largely positive support for the relevant hypotheses.These are tested on a unique dataset on knowledge development in subsidiary firms [theCentre of Excellence (CoE) project].,Journal of International Management,2002,792
Reconceptualizing the firm in a world of outsourcing and offshoring: The organizational and geographical relocation of high‐value company functions,Farok J Contractor; Vikas Kumar; Sumit K Kundu; Torben Pedersen,abstract In the largest sense; global strategy amounts to (1) the optimal disaggregation orslicing of the firm's value chain into as many constituent pieces as organizationally andeconomically feasible; followed by (2) decisions as how each slice should be allocatedgeographically ('offshoring') and organizationally ('outsourcing'). Offshoring and outsourcingare treated as strategies that need to be simultaneously analysed; where just 'core'segmentsof the value chain are retained in-house; while others are optimally dispersedgeographically; as well as dispersed over allies and contractors. This amounts to areconsideration of the nature of the firm that captures the dynamic changes in globalconfiguration and a reconsideration of what constitutes 'core'activities that need to beretained internally.

The emergence and impact of MNC centres of excellence,Ulf Holm; Torben Pedersen; Ingmar Björkman,Page 1 of 4 to transfer knowledge. Furthermore; knowledge transfer often entails theengagement of expensive and often unique experts who are also engaged in; and neededin the competence development process of the subsidiary. A number of propositions aredeveloped; providing a useful platform for future empirical research. Several of theirpropositions are in fact discussed further and tested in other chapters of the book. MatsForsgren and Torben Pedersen (chapter 4) draw on the framework developed in chapter 3;and test a model of the determinants of a CoEs based on data on 301 foreign-ownedsubsidiaries in Denmark.

Linking customer interaction and innovation: The mediating role of new organizational practices,Nicolai J Foss; Keld Laursen; Torben Pedersen,The notion that firms can improve their innovativeness by tapping users and customers forknowledge has become prominent in innovation studies. Similar arguments have beenmade in the marketing literature. We argue that neither literatures take sufficient account offirm organization. Specifically; firms that attempt to leverage user and customer knowledgein the context of innovation must design an internal organization appropriate to support it.This can be achieved in particular through the use of new organizational practices; notably;intensive vertical and lateral communication; rewarding employees for sharing andacquiring knowledge; and high levels of delegation of decision rights. In this paper; sixhypotheses were developed and tested on a data set of 169 Danish firms drawn from a 2001survey of the 1;000 largest firms in Denmark. A key result is that the link from customer …,Organization Science,2011,379
Strategy and management in MNE subsidiaries,Julian Birkinshaw; Torben Pedersen,THE purpose of this chapter is to review the large and growing literature on MNEsubsidiaries; and to offer some perspectives on how it may evolve in the future. There isclearly some overlap between the content of this chapter; and a number of other chapters—notably those concerned with the strategy and structure of the MNE as a whole; and thechapter about alliances and joint ventures in MNEs. What makes this chapter distinctive is itsfocus on the wholly-owned subsidiary company as the primary unit of analysis (where thesubsidiary is denned as a value-adding activity outside the MNE's home country). Theresearch reviewed here typically is concerned with the activities and/or responsibilities of thesubsidiary company; and how the subsidiary company relates to other entities inside andoutside the MNE. And from an applied perspective; it is typically directed towards the …,The Oxford handbook of international business,2001,361
Organizing knowledge processes in the multinational corporation: An introduction,Nicolai Juul Foss; Torben Pedersen,Abstract This Introduction discusses the contrast between; on the one hand; the currentpopularity of addressing MNC organization in knowledge terms and; on the other; the lack ofadequate understanding of many of the causal mechanisms and contextual factors inrelations between knowledge processes and organizational factors. A number of therelevant research challenges are identified; and it is clarified how the five articles in thisFocused Issue addresses some of these.,*,2004,355
Blockholder ownership: Effects on firm value in market and control based governance systems,Steen Thomsen; Torben Pedersen; Hans Kurt Kvist,Abstract In this study; Granger tests are used to examine the relationship betweenblockholder ownership and the values of the largest companies in the European Union andthe US. Previous studies on US data have found that blockholder ownership has nosystematic effect on performance. We propose that these results may not apply toContinental Europe; where ownership concentration is typically higher; the level of investorprotection is lower; and influential blockholders may have objectives other than shareholdervalue. In accordance with previous research; we find no significant association betweenblockholder ownership and prior or subsequent firm value in either the US or the UK.Nonetheless; in Continental Europe we find a negative association between blockholderownership and firm value or accounting returns in the next period.

Encouraging knowledge sharing among employees: How job design matters,Nicolai J Foss; Dana B Minbaeva; Torben Pedersen; Mia Reinholt,Abstract Job design is one of the most frequently researched practices in the HumanResource Management (HRM) literature; and knowledge sharing has become an importantand heavily researched managerial practice. The links between these practices; however;have received little attention in the literature. We argue that job design matters to knowledgesharing for motivational reasons. Specifically; jobs contain characteristics that stimulatedifferent kinds of motivation toward knowledge sharing; which have different effects onindividual knowledge sharing behavior. We develop six hypotheses that unfold these ideasand test them on the basis of individual-level data collected within a single firm. Thehypotheses are tested in a LISREL model that confirms that job characteristics; such asautonomy; task identity; and feedback; determine different motivations to share …,Human resource management,2009,307
Why a central network position isn't enough: The role of motivation and ability for knowledge sharing in employee networks,MIA Reinholt; Torben Pedersen; Nicolai J Foss,Abstract Contrasting views exist on how network characteristics predict knowledge sharing.Although large; open egocentric networks foster network positions that provide access tononredundant knowledge; critics have noted that such networks impair knowledge sharing;because trust and reciprocity do not thrive in them. This problem may; however; be resolvedby including motivation and ability to share knowledge as moderators of the associationbetween network position and knowledge sharing. Our analysis of 705 employees in aconsultancy shows that employees' knowledge acquisition and provision are highest whennetwork centrality; autonomous motivation; and ability are all high; thus supporting theproposed three-way interaction.,Academy of Management Journal,2011,298
Learning paths to offshore outsourcing: from cost reduction to knowledge seeking,Peter Maskell; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen; Jens Dick‐Nielsen,A corporation's offshore outsourcing may be seen as the result of a discrete; strategicdecision taken in response to an increasing pressure from worldwide competition. However;empirical evidence of a representative cross‐sector sample of international Danish firmsindicates that offshore sourcing in low‐cost countries is best described as a learning‐by‐doing process in which the offshore outsourcing of a corporation goes through a sequenceof stages towards sourcing for innovation. Initially; a corporation's outsourcing is driven by adesire for cost minimization. Over a period of time the outsourcing experience lessens thecognitive limitations of decision‐makers as to the advantages that can be achieved throughoutsourcing in low‐cost countries: the insourcer/vendor may not only offer cost advantages;but also quality improvement and innovation.

The role of path dependency and managerial intentionality: A perspective on international business research,Thomas Hutzschenreuter; Torben Pedersen; Henk W Volberda,Abstract Several decades of research in the field of international business have advancedvarious theories and studies on the internationalization of firms. Our assessment of theliterature on internationalization shows that the focus has been primarily on path-dependency and learning-based aspects of internationalization; while managerialintentionality and the possibility of managers making deliberate strategic choices towardsfurther internationalization have not been very prominent in the IB literature. We argue thatinternationalization paths and processes should be approached as a joint outcome ofmanagement intentionality and experience-based learning. In other words; managers areassumed to have the ability and the intention to influence the evolutionary paths of the firm.We derive a future research agenda that calls for the pursuit of this promising and …,*,2007,236
Closing knowledge gaps in foreign markets,Bent Petersen; Torben Pedersen; Marjorie A Lyles,Abstract Knowledge and learning are ascribed pivotal roles in firms' internationalizationprocesses: perceived market uncertainties; namely knowledge gaps related to businessenvironments in foreign markets; may curb firms' inclinations to commit resources to thesemarkets. This study explores whether knowledge gaps tend to increase or decrease withtime when operating in the foreign market; and it discusses which learning componentsnarrow–or widen–the perceived knowledge gap. A theoretical model is developed based onthe internationalization process view and the more recent organizational learningperspective; including such concepts as overconfidence and absorptive capacity. Thetheoretical model is tested on a set of primary data covering Danish and Swedish firms andtheir foreign market operations. The results suggest a more subtle relationship between …,Journal of international business studies,2008,220
Subsidiary performance in multinational corporations: the importance of technology embeddedness,Ulf Andersson; Mats Forsgren; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Subsidiaries have access to different types of resources and therefore performdifferently in their market-place and within a multinational corporation (MNC). Yet; eventhough subsidiaries are the object of intense interest; remarkably little has been writtenabout the assessment of subsidiary performance. In short; the strategic opportunities ofsubsidiaries seem to generate more attention in the literature than their results. The twodistinctive features of this paper are the development of the concept of subsidiaryperformance and the exploration of the linkage between subsidiary business context andperformance. More specifically; by drawing on the literature about organizational learning;absorptive capacity and embeddedness in business relationships; some hypotheses will beformulated about the causal link between subsidiary environment and subsidiary …,International Business Review,2001,217
Uncovering the hidden costs of offshoring: The interplay of complexity; organizational design; and experience,Marcus M Larsen; Stephan Manning; Torben Pedersen,Abstract This study investigates estimation errors due to hidden costs—the costs ofimplementation that are neglected in strategic decision-making processes—in the context ofservices offshoring. Based on data from the Offshoring Research Network; we find thatdecision makers are more likely to make cost-estimation errors given increasingconfiguration and task complexity in captive offshoring and offshore outsourcing;respectively. Moreover; we show that experience and a strong orientation towardorganizational design in the offshoring strategy reduce the cost-estimation errors that followfrom complexity. Our findings contribute to research on the effectiveness of sourcing andglobal strategies by stressing the importance of organizational design and experience indealing with increasing complexity.

Coping with liability of foreignness: Different learning engagements of entrant firms,Bent Petersen; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Much has been written about how international firms create and sustain firm-specific advantages that offset their liability of foreignness. Less attention has been devotedto the question of how international firms reduce their liability of foreignness. It is thecontention of this study that as a consequence of managerial discretion; such as willingnessto undertake local adaptation; international firms familiarize with foreign markets at differentpaces. The data from a sample of 494 international firms from Sweden; Denmark; and NewZealand suggest that entrant firms' learning engagement; ie; the effort and ability to learnhow to conduct business in a foreign environment; varies considerably. In particular;adoption of standardized international business routines and unwillingness to adaptproducts and marketing practices to local markets seem to be associated with a low …,Journal of International Management,2002,188
Ownership structure and value of the largest European firms: The importance of owner identity,Torben Pedersen; Steen Thomsen,Abstract The paper examines the relationship betweenownership structure and value of thelargestEuropean firms. Using simultaneous estimationand controlling for nation and industryeffectswe find that ownership concentration (measuredby the fraction of``closelyheld''shares) hasa positive effect on firm value (market-to-bookvalue of equity); when thelargest owner is afinancial institution or another corporation. If the largest owner is a familyor a singleindividual; ownership concentration has noeffect on firm value; and the effectisnegative if the largest owner is a governmentorganisation. Firm value is found to haveapositive feedback effect on ownershipconcentration except for governments; whichholdhigher stakes in low-value firms. Inother words; owner-identity matters; particularly in aContinental Europeaninstitutional setting where ownershipconcentration is high and …,Journal of Management and Governance,2003,185
Explaining gradually increasing resource commitment to a foreign market,Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract A large number of studies has examined the pattern of firms' internationalization interms of the sequence by which a firm introduces various operation methods to a foreignmarket. With few exceptions; the studies seek to establish whether or not the observedpatterns of internationalization areincremental'. Looking at the internationalization process inrelation to the firms' resource commitment to foreign markets; the point taken in this study isthat the internationalization process of any firm will display some element ofincrementalism'.However; the pace by which firms commit resources may differ substantially. By looking atthe pace of commitment instead of the pattern (the establishment chain') the study leavesbehind the crude dichotomy of incremental-versus-instantaneous resource commitment to aforeign market. Instead; the focus of the study is on the factors which hold the potential of …,International business review,1998,177
Governance mechanisms for the promotion of social capital for knowledge transfer in multinational corporations,Paul Gooderham; Dana B Minbaeva; Torben Pedersen,abstract The aim of this paper is to extend social capital approaches to knowledge transferby identifying governance mechanisms that managers can deploy to promote thedevelopment of social capital. In order to achieve this objective; insights from the micro-level;knowledge governance approach are combined with theory on the determinants of socialcapital. Three governance mechanisms are identified: market-based mechanisms;hierarchical mechanisms; and social mechanisms. The findings; based on data from twoDanish MNCs; indicate that although the use of social governance mechanisms promotespositive assessment of social capital; hierarchical governance mechanisms constrain itsdevelopment. The application of market-based governance mechanisms has no significanteffect. In addition; the findings provide evidence that social capital has a positive impact …,Journal of Management Studies,2011,155
The role of knowledge in firms’ internationalisation process: Wherefrom and whereto,Bent Petersen; Torben Pedersen; D Deo Sharma,Twenty-five years ago the business theorists at the University of Uppsala in Swedenassigned knowledge a key role in their explanation of firms' internationalisation. Firms'learning–or; acquisition of knowledge-about foreign markets was pointed out as beingdetermining not only the speed by which firms expand internationally; but also which regionsof the world firms enter and what operation methods they employ in the foreign markets(Carlson; 1975; Forsgren and Johanson; 1975; Johanson and Wiedersheim-Paul; 1975;Johanson and Vahlne; 1977; Welch and Wiedersheim-Paul; 1980).

How subsidiaries gain power in multinational corporations,Ram Mudambi; Torben Pedersen; Ulf Andersson,Abstract This study focuses on how power is gained within large organizations; such as theintra-organizational network of MNCs. Drawing on resource dependence literature; thisstudy develops and empirically tests a set of hypotheses aimed at explaining themultifaceted nature of power and decision making in multinational firms. Data collected from2107 foreign-owned subsidiaries in seven European countries is used to test thehypotheses. The results indicate that mutual dependence and dependence imbalanceprovide strong explanations for subsidiary power. Furthermore; subsidiary power overstrategic decisions in the MNC is gained through functional power; notably the possession oftechnological; rather than business-related; power or by the possession of both as theyreinforce each other in strengthening the subsidiary's strategic power in the MNC network.,Journal of World Business,2014,130
Knowledge transfer performance of multinational companies,Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen; Deo Sharma,Abstract The effective dissemination throughout the MNC organization of valuableknowledge acquired by its local affiliates is seen as an important source of competitiveadvantage. Knowledge differs in characteristics and so do the available transfer mechanism.As such; it is essential that the MNC employ the mechanism of transfer that suits the specificknowledge characteristics. The use of unsuitable transfer mechanisms may cause loss ofknowledge in the process of transmission or may involve unnecessarily high communicationcosts—both with potentially negative effects on the performance of the MNC.,*,2003,130
Managing global offshoring strategies: A case approach,Torben Pedersen," This book addresses the challenges associated with managing global offshoringstrategies. Offshoring and offshore outsourcing are hardly new phenomena. What is new isthat information technology creates new opportunities for geographically dispersed businessactivities and enables the fragmentation of the value chain for"" traditional"" production andservice companies. The pace of offshoring is likely to gain further momentum. The authors'intention in this book is to"" put a face"" on some Danish companies as they contemplate andengage in offshoring projects. When selecting the cases; the authors chose a diverse setthat exemplifies the complicated range of challenges that companies face when they migrateproducts or services. All of the cases were developed on the basis of in-depth field researchand close collaboration with the respective company managers. The book targets …,*,2006,129
Learning about foreign markets: are entrant firms exposed to a “shock effect”?,Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract This study addresses how managers' perceived familiarity with local marketsdevelops during a period of entry or expansion. The authors derive different predictions ofhow foreign-market familiarity changes during periods of entry from the internationalizationprocess literature. They then subject the predictions to an empirical examination; using adata set that covers foreign business operations as reported by managers of internationalfirms from small; open economies (Denmark; Sweden; and New Zealand). In addition toaddressing these predictions; the empirical study gives insight into the incidence andcharacter of “shock effects” in foreign-market entries. The effects are evident in managers'inclination to underestimate differences between the home and host countries in terms ofbusiness environments. The data support the supposition that; in general; managers of …,Journal of International Marketing,2004,129
Host-country environment and subsidiary competence: Extending the diamond network model,Christian Geisler Asmussen; Torben Pedersen; Charles Dhanaraj,Abstract We extend the “centers of excellence” concept to address the diversity andmultidimensionality of subsidiary competence. Using Rugman and Verbeke's diamondnetwork model; we hypothesize the contingencies influencing the links between host-country environments and subsidiary competence configuration; and provide evidence frommore than 2000 subsidiaries in seven European countries. Our results provide new insightsinto how multinational enterprises can overcome “unbalanced” national diamonds byacquiring complementary capabilities across borders.,Journal of International Business Studies,2009,125
The impact of knowledge management on MNC subsidiary performance: the role of absorptive capacity,Volker Mahnke; Torben Pedersen; Markus Venzin,To date; empirical studies on the impact of knowledge management on the performance ofMNC subsidiaries remain few in number. This study examines the effect of knowledgemanagement tools upon absorptive capacity; knowledge-flows and performance with uniquedata from subsidiary units in a large German MNC-HeidelbergCement. Treating absorptivecapacity as an endogenous construct subject to managerial discretion; we show howknowledge management tools unfold their performance impact through their significantinfluence on absorptive capacity and knowledge inflows.,MIR: Management International Review,2005,118
The economic geography of offshoring: the fit between activities and local context,Peter D Ørberg Jensen; Torben Pedersen,abstract We draw from the literature on economic geography and from the thematicoffshoring literature; and propose three hypotheses that rest on the assumption that thechoice of offshoring location is based on the fit between the attributes of differentdestinations and the attributes of the offshored business activities. The study reveals a multi-faceted location pattern in which firms' location strategies; to some degree; follow a logicwhereby manufacturing is relocated to low-cost destinations; and research and developmentis relocated to high-cost destinations. However; the picture is more nuanced whendistinguishing between standardized and advanced activities. Asia attracts as manyadvanced activities as Western Europe while North America attracts more advancedactivities even in manufacturing.

Economic and systemic explanations of ownership concentration among Europe's largest companies,Torben Pedersen; Steen Thomsen,The paper examines causes and effects of ownership concentration among the largestcompanies in 12 European countries. As a reference point the paper takes a seminalempirical study on US data and examines to what extent the model is applicable inEuropean countries. The findings indicate that both general economic effects and systemeffects are significant. Ownership concentration is found to decrease with firm size and toincrease with earnings volatility. But in support of the system theories advocated nationalityis also found to have a significant effect which is partly attributable to institutional differencesbetween nations such as stock market size and the frequency of large banks.

Wediscuss the sources of organizational strengths of subsidiaries in the larger multinationalcorporation; and argue that organizational strength can to some extent be proxied bystrength in the market place. Based on analysis of data on foreign-owned production firms inDenmark; we test three hypotheses: 1) that internal factors (capabilities; patents....) arepositively related to the organizational strengths of MNC subsidiaries; 2) business networkfactors (network relations) are positively related to the organizational strengths of MNCsubsidiaries; and 3) there is an interaction effect between internal factors and businessnetwork factors when explaining the organizational strengths of MNC subsidiaries …,International Business Review,1999,102

Using datafrom a sample of 214 Danish exporters; of which 32 had changed their foreign operationmethod between 1992 and 1997; the analysis shows that switching cost factors are indeedof particular importance in order to explain the incidence of such changes.,International Business Review,2002,101
Multinational enterprises from small economies: internationalization patterns of large companies from Denmark; Finland; and Norway,Gabriel RG Benito; Jorma Larimo; Rajneesh Narula; Torben Pedersen,It is generally accepted that; ceteris paribus; firms from small; open economies (SMOPECs)tend to demonstrate a higher propensity to internationalize their operations than those fromlarger home economies (Bellak and Cantwell 1998). The most obvious factor is market size;and the tendency for SMOPEC firms to venture to foreign markets is often explainedprimarily by this constraint. At the same time; many industries are becoming increasinglyglobal. Factors like increasingly rapid technological change; convergence of consumerstastes; and increased worldwide competition have led to a quest for scale; scope; andlearning economies that; in turn; has motivated the development of increasingly largercorporations through international mergers and acquisitions (Ghoshal 1987; Yip 1989; Kozul-Wright and Rowthorn 1998).

Centres of excellence in multinational companies: The case of Denmark,Mats Forsgren; Torben Pedersen,Abstract An important body of literature on multinational corporations (MNCs) relates to howthey are organised; and especially the role of the subsidiaries within the organisation.(seeDoz and Prahalad; 1981; Egelhoff; 1988; Bartlett and Ghoshal; 1989; Forsgren; 1989;Ghoshal and Nohria; 1989; Ghoshal and Bartlett; 1990; Gupta and Govindarajan; 1991;1994; Forsgren and Johanson; 1992.) One theme in recent writings is the need to changefrom a situation of the firm as a bundle of headquarters-subsidiary relationships into a morecomplicated system with reciprocal interdependencies between units in different countries(Hedlund; 1986; Bartlett et al.; 1990). Connected with this view is the assumption that thecompetitiveness of the modern MNC is characterised by a shift away from the initial stage ofproprietary knowledge and brand labels to the exploitation of international activities …,*,1998,86
Offshoring and international competitiveness: Antecedents of offshoring advanced tasks,Peter D Ørberg Jensen; Torben Pedersen,Abstract During the past decade; offshoring has become an established business practice.Yet it is still more common to offshore less advanced tasks compared with offshoring moreadvanced tasks; ie; tasks closer to the core activities of the firm. The latter is a newphenomenon which raises many new issues on the boundaries of the firm. More or lessadvanced tasks can be found within all activities; eg; in sales and marketing where telesalesis on the less advanced end of the scale while branding and identity building are on theadvanced end of the scale. This article focuses on the antecedents of advanced offshoring;exploring what causes firms to offshore some of their more advanced tasks. Our findingsindicate that while the lower cost of unskilled; labor-intensive processes is the main driver forfirms that offshore less advanced tasks; the offshoring of advanced tasks is part of firms' …,Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,2012,73

Two contrasting MNC strategies; which reflect an integration-responsiveness dichotomy; are scrutinized in terms of their effects on jobs among locallinkage partners in developing countries. It is hypothesized that the investments of MNCspursuing local responsiveness create more jobs among local linkage partners; but implyless job upgrading; when compared to investments undertaken by MNCs followingstrategies of global integration. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of Danish MNCswith extensive investments in developing countries.,Journal of World Business,2009,72

Global outsourcing and offshoring: an integrated approach to theory and corporate strategy,Farok J Contractor; Vikas Kumar; Sumit K Kundu; Torben Pedersen,Companies are increasingly asking which of their value chain activities are best performedwithin their own company and which may be outsourced. In addition; they are alsoconsidering which pieces of their value chain may be better performed abroad. Theseinterrelated decisions concerning outsourcing and offshoring have not only changed entireindustries; they have also transformed the lives of people across the world. Hundreds ofmillions of jobs in emerging nations have been the direct result of outsourcing and offshoringdecisions. At the same time; many people in the developed world have lost their jobsbecause a company has been able to find a cheaper alternative.

Internationalization revisited: the big step hypotheses,Torben Pedersen; J Myles Shaver,Abstract We refine the prominent theory of the process by which firms expandinternationallyinternationalization theory. By augmenting the behavioral theory of the firm(which is the basis of internationalization theory) with theories of foreign direct investment;we argue that international expansion is not a gradual incremental process as argued byinternationalization theory. Rather; we hypothesize that international expansion is adiscontinuous process characterized by an initial “big step.” We expect that the differences ofoperating in one's home country versus abroad are the major difficulties faced by foreignfirms; and subsequently the differences between foreign countries are only marginal. As aresult; we hypothesize that the internationalization process will be characterized by thefollowing observations:(a) firms take a long period of time to make their first international …,European International Business Academy Annual Meeting; Manchester,2000,69

Is there a trend towards global value chain specialization?—An examination of cross border sales of US foreign affiliates,Sjoerd Beugelsdijk; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract In this study we discuss and empirically test the assertion that over the last twodecades multinational enterprises'(MNEs') configuration of value-adding activities hasshifted from a sparse and simple (host–home) international division of labor among theforeign affiliates to a more specialized and 'advanced'global value chain configuration inwhich MNEs locate fine-sliced parts of the value chain at the most efficient locations. Usingdata on trade flows of US affiliates in 56 host countries between 1983 and 2003 we findsome indications of a trend in the direction of global value chain specialization. In particularamong US affiliates in developing countries the proportion of host–host; intra-firm trade hasincreased significantly during the observed period of time. Conversely; the proportion of host–home and inter-firm trade has diminished. We interpret this as indicating both value chain …,Journal of International Management,2009,67
Spontaneous resolution of amniotic bands,TK Pedersen; SG Thomsen,Abstract The amniotic band syndrome comprises a group of sporadic congenital anomaliescharacterized by amputations; constriction bands; pseudosyndactylism and multiplecraniofacial; visceral and body wall defects. It occurs in approximately 1 in 1200 to 1 in 15000 live births. Some of the cases present with congenital anomalies that are incompatiblewith life; but a selected group shows isolated limb constrictions. Repeated sonographicexaminations afforded us the opportunity of observing the in utero process of limbstrangulation and subsequent spontaneous lysis of an amniotic band attached to a fetalelbow. Surgical fetal therapy with lysis of the constriction ring in utero is an option; butintervention is probably not always warranted. Spontaneous resolution does occur.Copyright© 2001 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology,Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology,2001,59
Global software development: commitment; trust and cultural sensitivity in strategic partnerships,Anne-Marie Søderberg; S Krishna; Pernille Bjørn,Abstract Much research has studied off-shore outsourcing from a Western client perspective.This article tries to shed light on what an Indian vendor perceives as important to managelarge and complex strategic partnerships in IT outsourcing; and in particular how mutuallyprofitable; long-term relationships with European clients are created and maintained; both atcompany and project levels. We investigate this issue through qualitative interviews withvarious vendor representatives in offshore and on-site teams in a top tier multinationalcompany of Indian origin. In the analysis of interview accounts of close collaborationprocesses in two large and complex projects; where off-shoring of software development ismoved to a strategic level; we found that the vendor was able to establish a strategicpartnership through long-term engagement with the field of banking and insurance as …,Journal of International Management,2013,56
Fast and slow resource commitment to foreign markets: What causes the difference?,Bent Petersen; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Apparently; the pace by which companies commit resources to foreign marketsdiffers significantly. We test six propositions that potentially explain why some companiesundertake faster foreign market commitment than others. Suggested factors discriminatingbetween a fast and a slow foreign market commitment are (1) whether the company isproducing manufactures or services;(2) foreign market entry motives;(3) company size;(4)foreign market stability;(5) experience with foreign markets similar to the entered; and (6)degree of globalization in the industry. Using multiple regression analysis on Danish MNEdata; we obtain supportive empirical evidence for all propositions; except for number 5;experience with similar markets. The results indicate that resource commitment to stable;foreign markets undertaken by small; market-seeking; manufacturing companies …,Journal of International Management,1999,56
Agency theory and resource dependency theory: Complementary explanations for subsidiary power in multinational corporations,Ram Mudambi; Torben Pedersen,As noted by Mintzberg (1979); the operation of a business firm gives rise to both cooperationand conflict. Conflicts can arise between owners and managers in the division of the valuecreated by the firm as well as amongst managers in the struggle for power and control rightswithin the firm. We focus on the latter conflict in this paper; using the multinationalcorporation (MNC) as the subject organizational form. In the literature; this conflict has beenanalyzed within two quite disparate perspectives; namely agency theory and resourcedependency theory. Within the agency perspective; conflict amongst managers has beenframed as one where managers at headquarters are linked in an agency relationship withmanagers in operating divisions (eg; Scharfstein and Stein; 2000). It is recognized that MNCsubsidiaries pursue their own interests and are not a mechanical instruments of …,Bridging IB theories; constructs; and methods across cultures and social sciences.

The organizational design of offshoring: Taking stock and moving forward,Peter D Ørberg Jensen; Marcus M Larsen; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Offshoring can be defined as the relocation of organizational tasks and services toforeign locations. At the same time as the scale and scope of offshoring have reachedunprecedented levels in recent years; firms have increasingly been exposed to thechallenges relating to managing an organization consisting of a number of offshoredactivities. In this special issue introduction paper; we argue that an organizational designperspective on offshoring can benefit research and practice in understanding how firms cancoordinate and integrate offshoring activities. Specifically; we argue that offshoring impliesan organizational reconfiguration consisting of three stages: disintegration; relocation andreintegration. We discuss the implications of this perspective and outline a research agenda.,Journal of International Management,2013,50
The MNC as a knowledge structure: The roles of knowledge sources and organizational instruments in MNC knowledge management,Nicolai Foss; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Recent research on the differentiated MNC has concerned knowledge flowsbetween MNC units. While linking up with this literature; we extend in two directions. First;we argue that conceptualizing the MNC as a knowledge structure furthers the understandingof intra-MNC knowledge flows. Thus; we see MNC knowledge elements as being structuredalong such dimensions as their type and degree of complementarity to other knowledgeelements; and their sources; for example; whether they are mainly developed from externalor internal knowledge sources. These dimensions matter in terms of knowledge flows;because they influence the costs and benefits of knowledge transfer and; hence; the actuallevel of knowledge transferred. Second; based on this conceptualization; we argue thatMNC management can influence the development; characteristics and transfer of …,*,2003,50
Foreign bank penetration of newly opened markets in the Nordic countries,Lars Engwall; Rolf Marquardt; Torben Pedersen; Adrian E Tschoegl,Abstract The opening to foreign banks in the Nordic countries provides us with anopportunity to study the evolution of the foreign bank sector in situations where the sectorhad a definite start date. Despite low survival rates for individual foreign banks; on balancethe foreign bank sector gained market share (in terms of the assets of the banking system)over time. Our results for the role of time; links to the home market and problems facingdomestic competitors were strongly in accordance with expectations in the cases ofDenmark; mixed or indeterminate for Finland and Norway; and strongly opposite in the caseof Sweden. Lastly; our results are broadly consistent with the Stiglitz–Weiss argument thatthe foreign banks bought entry by accepting worse lending risks.,Journal of International Financial Markets; Institutions and Money,2001,49
Export channel dynamics: An empirical investigation,Gabriel RG Benito; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract We investigate the dynamics of export channel arrangements by modelling foreignoperation method decisions as the interplay between factors that motivate switches andfactors that deter them. Our model extends previous analyses by looking simultaneously at(1) no change of channel arrangement;(2) replacements of foreign intermediaries (within-mode shifts); and (3) integration of the sales function abroad (between-mode shifts). We usea multinomial logit model on longitudinal data from a sample of Danish exporters that hadentered foreign markets through intermediaries. The results suggest that the decision tocarry out within-mode shifts (ie to replace an existing intermediary) is driven by a different setof factors than the decision to switch to another foreign operation mode (ie to in-houseoperations).

Foreign operation methods and switching costs: conceptual issues and possible effects,Gabriel RG Benito; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract Although the issue of switching costs does appear in some of the frameworks forchoosing modes of foreign operation; the treatment of these costs is fairly cursory. In thisarticle we propose a simple classification of switching costs which distinguishes between“take-down” costs and “set-up” costs. A distinction is also made between measurable andperceptual switching costs. The article outlines the assumptions regarding switching coststhat are embedded in current theoretical approaches to the internationalization of firms; anddiscusses the possible effects of such costs on the choice and timing of foreign operationmethods.,Scandinavian Journal of Management,1999,48
The driving forces of subsidiary absorptive capacity,Stephanie C Schleimer; Torben Pedersen,Abstract The study investigates how a multinational corporation (MNC) can promote theabsorptive capacity of its subsidiaries. The focus is on what drives the MNC subsidiary'sability to absorb marketing strategies that are initiated by the MNC parent; as well as how thesubsidiary enacts on this absorptive capacity in order to compete in its focal market. Thedual embeddedness of MNC subsidiaries plays a key role in this investigation; assubsidiaries belong to the MNC network and are simultaneously embedded in their hostcountry environment. We argue that subsidiary absorptive capacity is formed as a purposefulresponse to this dual embeddedness. An analysis of marketing strategy absorptionsundertaken by 213 subsidiaries reveals that MNCs can assist their subsidiaries to competein competitive and dynamic focal markets by forming specific organizational mechanisms …,Journal of Management Studies,2013,44
Business systems and corporate governance,Torben Pedersen; Steen Thomsen,Since the beginning of the 1990s a large number of economic and legal studies havedocumented the existence of significant international variations in corporate governance(Franks and Mayer; 1990; 1995; La Porta et aI.; 1997; 1999; Moerland; 1995; Pedersen andThomsen; 1997; Prowse; 1995; Roe; 1991; 1994a; Shleifer and Vishny; 1997; as well asmore descriptive work by Baums; Buxbaum; and Hopt; 1994; Charkham; 1994; Porter; 1992;Prentice and Holland; 1993; and others). But apart from the investor-protection explanationlaunched by La Porta et al.(1998); which regards ownership diversification as a function oflegal protection of small investors; little systematic research has been done on thedeterminants of international differences in corporate governance.

While these concepts have evolvedover the last decades; the point that the ideas and the international connectivity are centralfor IB remains genuine. This paper is an attempt to take stock of the evolution of the conceptstechnology; innovation and knowledge in IB literature along the past five decades with aparticular focus on the role of the Columbia Journal of World Business (CJWB) and theJournal of World Business (JWB) in this evolution.

First; weexamine the relationship between the application of specific HRM practices and the level ofthe absorptive capacity. Second; we suggest that absorptive capacity should beconceptualized as being comprised of both employees' ability and motivation. Further;results indicate that both ability and motivation (absorptive capacity) are needed to facilitatethe transfer of knowledge from other parts of the MNC.,Journal of International Business Studies,2014,39

Microfoundations in strategy,Nicolai J Foss; T Pederson,Resume: Scholars increasingly seek to proffer microfoundations for macro managementtheory; notably strategic management theory. These microfoundations naturally revolvearound human resources. We argue that proper microfoundations for strategic managementtheory must recognize that the management of motivation is first and foremost a matter of themanagement of cognitions of organizational members; an insight that we found in goal-framing theory; an emerging perspective based on cognitive science; behavioral economics;and social psychology. Building on this insight; we argue that a key reason why strategicgoals matter to firm performance── that is; firm-level value creation and value capture andsustained competitive heterogeneity── is that such goals influence value creation rootedin employee motivations. Unfolding this idea allows us to generate new insight in the …,Strategic Management Journal,2014,36
Polymorphism; microstructure and rheology of butter. Effects of cream heat treatment,Stine Rønholt; Jacob Judas Kain Kirkensgaard; Thomas Bæk Pedersen; Kell Mortensen; Jes Christian Knudsen,Abstract The effect of cream heat treatment prior to butter manufacturing; fluctuatingtemperatures during storage and presence of fat globules vs. no fat globules was examinedin laboratory scale produced butter. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetrywas used to study crystallization behaviour and nuclear magnetic resonance to measuresolid fat content and water droplet size distribution. Furthermore; the crystal structure waslinked to the rheological properties and microstructure of the butter using confocal laserscanning microscopy. Butter produced from non-matured cream mainly formed α-and β′-crystals with minor traces of β-crystals. Maturing of the cream caused a transition from α-toβ′-and β-form. The rheological behaviour of slow cooled butter deviated from the maturedones by having a lower elastic modulus; caused by a weaker crystal network. Presence of …,Food chemistry,2012,36
Beyond the'rules of the game': Three institutional approaches and how they matter for international business,Jasper J Hotho; Torben Pedersen,A recurring question in international business (IB) research is how institutions matter for IBactivity (Henisz and Swaminathan 2008; Eden 2010). The value of institutional thought tounderstanding international business is increasingly recognized and the use of institutionalarguments has risen considerably in recent years. Yet what institutions are and how theyimpact upon the behaviour of international firms often remains unclear. This is partiallybecause terms such as 'institutions';'institutional distance'and 'institutional theory'mask thewide variety of institutional approaches that are currently used in international businessresearch. In line with its interdisciplinary nature; international business research draws oninstitutional approaches from various disciplines; such as economics; sociology and politicaleconomy.

How do we capture “Global Specialization” when measuring firms’ degree of globalization?,Christian Geisler Asmussen; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract Abstract and Key Results The IB literature informs us of several ways to measurefirms' degree of globalization. In this paper we make the argument that in fact none of theexisting indices really measure firms' degree of “global specialization”; that is; to what extenttheir allocation of resources is multidomestic or global. In order to remedy this we introducea complementary index measuring how firms are configuring their value chains—whetherthey are replicating value chain activities from country to country or locating them in globallyspecialized units in order to exploit an international division of labor. We then test this“global specialization” index empirically on a sample of Danish MNCs. We find that the indexis able to identify a distinct group of firms with significantly higher degrees of global valuechain configuration. The firms in this group do not necessarily score high on conventional …,Management International Review,2007,36
Organizational design mechanisms for the R&D function in a world of offshoring,Ulf Andersson; Torben Pedersen,Summary Later years' globalization and increased competition has forced firms to re-evaluate their current configuration and location of activities. An emerging shortage of talentand a recognition of knowledge sources far more spread around the globe have inducedfirms to re-think their configuration of knowledge-intensive activities; such as R&D.Disaggregation and dispersion of activities is though a double edged sword as itsimultaneously enhances the access to resources and talent increasing the value ofknowledge development activities in the firm; but also add to the costs of management andcoordination. In this article we discuss how designing the configuration of R&D activities andthe utilization of organizational coordination and control mechanisms help firms to stay ontop of the costs induced by inter-task interdependencies among the disaggregated R&D …,Scandinavian Journal of Management,2010,35
The dilemma of centres of excellence: Contextual creation of knowledge versus global transfer of knowledge,Ulf Holm; Torben Pedersen,Abstract A common understanding in recent literature on the development of multinationalcorporations (MNCs) and headquarters-subsidiary relations is that some subsidiaries willhave; or ought to have; a strategic role in the global organization that reaches beyond theirlocal undertakings. This notion implies that MNC competitive advantage depends on theability of several corporate units to assimilate and make use of knowledge created in otherbusiness contexts than their own. Hence; an MNC subsidiary must adapt and commit to thelocal environment in order to survive in the market competition. On the other hand; corporatesister units' usage of subsidiary knowledge implies that the subsidiary also must adapt andcommit within the corporate environment. The dilemma here lies in the extent to which thesubsidiary's external market environment and its corporate environment are separated (or …,Copenhagen Business School Department of International Economics and Management Working Paper,2000,35

The internationalisation process of Danish firms-gradual learning or discrete rational choices?,Torben Pedersen,Abstract The Uppsala Internationalisation model has greatly influenced Nordic research onthe internationalisation process of firms. In this article; the Uppsala model is tested onDanish empirical material. The Danish firms largely follow a sequential development asregards the geographical dimension; where; typically; they set up in culturally close marketsfirst and later set up in the more distant markets. On the other hand; the firms seem to followto a less extent a pattern of sequential expansion of market commitment on the singleforeign markets; just as a surprising number of establishments are set up without previousactivity on the market. Crucial differences cannot be found between the establishmentpattern abroad of large and small firms. The Uppsala model in itself cannot explain theinternationalisation pattern of the Danish firms; which is why the article advocates that the …,Journal of Transnational Management Development,2000,33
The causal relationship between insider ownership; owner identity and market valuation among the largest European companies,Torben Pedersen; Steen Thomsen,The causal relationship between insider ownership and market valuation is tested bysimultaneous estimation of the causes and effect of insider ownership among the largestcontinental European companies. Controlling for nation and industry effects insiderownership (measured by the fraction of “closely held” shares) is found to have a positiveeffect on market valuation (market-to-book values). And market valuation is found to have apositive feedback effect on the level of insider ownership. The findings provide empiricalsupport for a theoretical model proposed by La Porta et al (1999). But the results are alsofound to be sensitive to owner identity: while a higher level of financial and corporate insiderownership is found to increase market valuation; family ownership has no significant effect;and a higher level of government ownership is found to reduce market valuation.,*,2001,32

We argue that managers can shape formal organization structure andorganization forms and can influence the more informal organizational practices in order tofoster knowledge sharing and creation. Theoretically; we unfold this argument by relying onkey ideas of organizational economics and organizational behaviour studies.

The effects of MNC parent effort and social structure on subsidiary absorptive capacity,Stephanie C Schleimer; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Although the literature provides ample evidence that the global transfer and localimplementation of knowledge represents a key advantage for multinational corporations(MNCs); we lack comparable understanding as to whether knowledge-creating MNCparents can actively expand the absorptive capacity of their subsidiaries. Using a teacher–student lens; this study examines the combined impact of specific structural mechanismsand motivational processes by MNC parents on the ability of 216 subsidiaries to absorbparent-initiated marketing strategies. The findings reveal that MNC parents can indeedcultivate subsidiaries' ability to appropriate marketing knowledge through a combination ofadopting specific social structures and investing in particular efforts. However; the effect ofsocial structure on subsidiary absorptive capacity is indirect; and accounted for by the …,Journal of International Business Studies,2014,29
Fine slicing of the value chain and offshoring of essential activities: empirical evidence from European multinationals,Esmeralda Linares-Navarro; Torben Pedersen; José Pla-Barber,Abstract The offshoring of more advanced activities is increasing and a debate about thelimits of offshoring has emerged. Companies are fine-slicing their value chains; and movingbeyond the offshoring of peripheral and non-core activities to the offshoring of advanced andessential activities that are closer to their core (eg research; design and productdevelopment). The challenge is to understand the limits of offshoring and the mostappropriate modes of offshoring. The purpose of this paper is to analyze what activities areoffshorable and how best to govern offshored activities. We argue that companies areredefining their core activities and in this process; some essential activities previouslyviewed as core activities are being detached from the core; and they become moreoffshorable.

We develop hypotheses derived from literature on MNE knowledgeflows integrated with an organizational economics perspective on knowledge-creating MNEsubsidiaries. The hypotheses are tested using a simultaneous equation model applied to aunique data set encompassing a German MNE; HeidelbergCement. Enablers andimpediments of knowledge outflows are assessed to explain why subsidiary managersshare their knowledge with other MNE units. Our findings suggest that knowledge outflowsincrease a subsidiary's performance only up to a certain point and that too much knowledgesharing is detrimental to the contributing subsidiary's performance.,*,2009,29

Dissatisfaction with the currentintermediary is the explanation typically given for why intermediaries are replaced; but otherfactors may also influence the likelihood of such a change. Using longitudinal data from asample of Danish exporters; we apply logistic regression analysis to model the impact of anumber of factors. Our data show that dissatisfaction with the local intermediary does notappear as a determinant of replacement. Instead; changes in the level of informationasymmetry exert the most important influence on the decision to replace the foreignintermediary.

There is a common held view-a myth-that thecyclical component has a period up to eight years but the empirical evidence underlying thatmyth is the tradition of empirical business cycle research of Burns and Mitchell (1946) andNBER. That is not a good measure of the duration of the cyclical component inmacroeconomic time series since Burns and Mitchell do not distinguish between businesscycles and economic growth and they measure economic growth as a part of the expansionphase of a business cycle and consequently overstate the duration of the cyclicalcomponent.

No doubt; the governance of knowledge flows has remained a central theme in alarge body of current academic work concerned with managerial practices in the MNC. Themodern MNC is considered to be a 'differentiated network'; where knowledge is created invarious parts of the MNC and transferred to several interrelated units (Hedlund; 1986;Bartlett and Ghoshal; 1989; Gupta and Govindarajan; 1991; 2000).

Corning fromthe United States has a RHQ and its shared centre for financial transactions in Shanghaiand there are a number of other examples of establishment and relocation of RHQs. A reportfrom UNCTAD (2003) suggested a “world market for corporate headquarter operations” isemerging and provided many recent examples of relocations of HQ operations. In fact;UNCTAD (2003) counted 829 establishments or relocations of HQ operations worldwidebetween January 2002 and March 2003; which clearly indicate that the relocation of HQ …,*,2008,20
Knowledge flows; governance and the multinational enterprise: frontiers in international management research,Volker Mahnke; Torben Pedersen,This book contributes to the understanding of Knowledge Governance in the MultinationalCorporation. Intra-firm and inter-firm processes of knowledge creation; sharing andexploitation have attracted increasingly managerial and scholarly interest. However therelation between particular knowledge processes; determinants of organizational choices;governance mechanisms; their relevant costs and benefits; and associated strategicadvantages remain less well understood. To address these challenges; this book givesanswers to the following questions. What are key challenges of governing knowledge in themultinational corporation? How do contingencies influence relevant trade-offs? How do setsof governance mechanisms respond to problems of cognition and incentives?,*,2003,20
Why complementary HRM practices impact performance: The case of rewards; job design; and work climate in a knowledge‐sharing context,Nicolai J Foss; Torben Pedersen; Mia Reinholt Fosgaard; Diego Stea,Abstract The strategic HRM literature suggests that HRM influences employees incombinations of practices that “fit” each other rather than as stand-alone practices; however;it pays little attention to the underlying individual-level mechanisms. In contrast; the HRMliterature on knowledge sharing examines the influence of single practices on individual-level knowledge sharing; but fails to include the influence of combinations of practices. Welink the idea of fit between practices to employee motivation for knowledge sharing byarguing that rewards may be ambiguous and difficult to interpret; but that such ambiguitymay be reduced if rewards are combined with other aligned HRM practices; notably jobdesign and work climate. Thus; fit is established through the ambiguity-reducing effect ofcombining specific HRM practices. Accordingly; we test for complementarities among …,Human Resource Management,2015,19
The dilemmas of MNC subsidiary transfer of knowledge,Jens Gammelgaard; Ulf Holm; Torben Pedersen,Abstract To an increasing extent; the success of multinational companies (MNCs) isconsidered to be contingent upon the ease and speed by which valuable knowledge isdisseminated throughout the organization (Hedlund; 1986; Bartlett and Ghoshal; 1989;Gupta and Govindarajan; 1991). Thus; creation of knowledge in a spatially dispersedmultinational organization and tapping into advanced local knowledge wherever it can befound are necessary conditions for success in the global marketplace. The implication is thatsome subsidiaries are supposed to act as bridgeheads (Forsgren et al.; 1999) that tap intoknowledge created in a local context and subsequently transfer the knowledge to other MNCunits where it is of better use. Therefore; some subsidiaries will or ought to have a strategicrole in the global organization that reaches beyond their local undertakings (eg Gupta …,*,2004,19
Top management teams in their national context,René Olie; Ad van Iterson,Since the mid-1980s; much research attention has been devoted to top management teamsand their impact on the strategic behavior and performance of firms. In particular; thisresearch has focused on the role of top managers' background; values; and experiences inexplaining the choices they make. So far; this research has largely failed to address thenational context in which top management teams are formed and operate. Empirical studieshave typically involved top management teams of US firms. Other studies are rare; and whenthey exist; they usually do not take the national context into account. This paper explores theimpact of national context characterized by society-specific value systems and institutions;on the composition; organization; and functioning of top management.

SMG WP 1/2010,Dana B Minbaeva; Kristiina Mäkelä; Larissa Rabbiosi,Abstract The knowledge-based view has recently been criticized for overlooking individual-level action and interaction in favor of an over-emphasis on the firm-level capabilities. Thispaper seeks to respond to that criticism by providing some individual-level explanations for acollective-level phenomenon–intraorganizational knowledge transfer. We suggest thatvariations in individual ability; motivation and the use of interaction opportunities provided bythe organization explain part of the variation found in individuallevel knowledge acquisitionand use; and that this has an influence on organizational level knowledge transfer within afirm. More specifically; we find that ability and intrinsic motivation are important drivers ofindividual level knowledge acquisition and use; while extrinsic motivation has no impact.Furthermore; the extent to which an individual uses interaction opportunities provided by …,*,2010,18
International evidence on the connection between business cycles and economic growth,Torben Mark Pedersen; Anne Marie Elmer,Abstract If economic growth and business cycles were completely independent of eachother; then changes in the growth rate would be unrelated to dates of business cycle turningpoints (apart from pure coincidence). That is a testable implication; and we study theconnection between business cycles and economic growth by comparing dates of businesscycle turning points with dates of estimated trend breaks using quarterly real GDP for 16OECD countries. Business cycle turning points are identified using a computer algorithmand trend breaks are estimated using a general intervention model. We find that more than82% of the estimated trend breaks occur near a turning point. We find evidence ofdeterministic shifting and/or segmented time trends for all 16 OECD countries. We concludefrom this that we cannot reject that there might be quantitatively important …,Journal of Macroeconomics,2003,18

Whether and What to offshore?,Peter D Ørberg Jensen; Torben Pedersen,Abstract: In this article; we explore the idea that offshoring of services and technical workshould be regarded as a dynamic process that evolves over time. Firms gradually move fromoffshoring of simple; standardized activities towards offshoring of advanced activities whenthey accumulate experience with offshoring; and this type of offshoring comes with anentirely different set of characteristics compared to traditional; cost-seeking offshoring.Based on a unique survey among the total population of firms in the eastern region ofDenmark; we analyze some of the dynamics of this process through a model thatincorporates two different aspects of the process of offshoring. First; we approach thequestion of whether to offshore and establish a baseline that investigates the determinantsof firms' participation-or lack thereof-in offshoring.,*,2007,16

Determining factors of subsidiary development,Torben Pedersen,Abstract The literature on subsidiary development has greatly expanded over the last 20years; evaluating the dynamics behind the evolution of subsidiary roles. The literatureemerged out of a critique of the traditional 'center-periphery'view where the firm-specificadvantages are developed and controlled by the parent company; while the foreignsubsidiaries are the long-arm of the parent company in exploiting the firm-specificadvantages in the local market. The observation that some subsidiaries have a strategic rolein the multinational corporation (MNC) that reaches beyond their local undertakings (egÉtemad and Dulude; 1986; Bartlett and Ghoshal; 1989; Gupta and Govindarajan; 1994) wasthe starting point of research on different subsidiary roles and the evolution of subsidiaryroles.,*,2006,15

Beginning in 2001;Coloplast commenced the process of relocating major parts of its manufacturing activitiesaway from Denmark to Tatabanya in Hungary. Ten years later; the company had relocatedup to almost 90% of the production mainly to Hungary and China; but also to France and theUnited States. This reconfiguration had given substantial benefits; such as access to lowerlabor and production costs; but also an important means to reduce redundant organizationallayers and resources.

The importance of internal and external knowledge sourcing and firm performance: A latent class estimation,Torben Pedersen; Christine Soo; Timothy M Devinney,This research examines the differential impact of the importance of internally and externallysourced information and knowledge and their relationship to absorptive capacity and firmperformance. In addition; this analysis deals directly with the unobservable heterogeneityamongst firms that is generally viewed as the raison d'être for a unique resource-basedperspective of organizational performance. Latent class; finite mixture regression models areused that show that a single model relating knowledge sourcing; absorptive capacity andfirm performance is inadequate in explaining even a minor portion of the variation which isseen between firms.,*,2011,13
Internal versus external knowledge sourcing of subsidiaries and the impact of headquarters control,Jens Gammelgaard; Torben Pedersen,Recent literature proposes that modern MNCs consist of advanced organizational forms; likethe 'transnational firm'(Bartlett and Ghoshal; 1989); the heterarchy (Hedlund; 1986); thedifferentiated network (Nohria and Ghoshal; 1997) or the metanational firm (Doz et al.;2001). The development of new knowledge is no longer carried out or controlled solely byheadquarters. It is increasingly recognized that much development of new knowledge inMNCs is happening in subsidiaries; where some of these subsidiaries gain world productmandate or become Centres of Excellence (Holm and Pedersen; 2000). Intenserelationships with local counterparts are often the basis for creation of new knowledge in thesubsidiaries; implying that they to a large extent design their knowledge creation process tomeet the particular context of the local counterparts.

Sources of subsidiary knowledge and knowledge transfer in MNCs,Nicolai J Foss; Torben Pedersen,It is now commonly accepted that knowledge ranks first in the hierarchy of strategicallyrelevant resources (eg; Grant 1996); in fact; it is so widely accepted'... as to have becomealmost axiomatic'(Gupta and Govindarajan 2000: 473). More precisely; the issue ofknowledge imitability is seen as crucial to the understanding of competitive advantage andits sustainability (Lippman and Rumelt 1982; Simonin 1999). Accordingly; a cottage industryhas emerged on the various characteristics of knowledge that may hinder the imitability ofrent-yielding knowledge assets; such as causal ambiguity (Lippman and Rumelt 1982;Mosakowski 1997); complexity and tacitness (Winter 1987). Much of this has taken place inthe context of resource-based (Wernerfelt 1984; Barney 1991); knowledge-based (Grant1996) and evolutionary theories of the firm (Nelson and Winter 1982; Foss; Knudsen and …,Network Knowledge in International Business; Cheltenham: Edward Elgar,2002,13

Emerging-market multinational corporations as agents of globalization: Conflicting institutional demands and the isomorphism of global markets,Ru-Shiun Liou; Alex S Rose; Alan E Ellstrand,We view emerging-market multinational corporations (EMNCs) as agents for globalisomorphism. EMNCs seek to enter developed markets not only to expand their businessoperations but also to acquire advanced knowledge to enhance their core competencies. Inentering these markets; EMNCs are subject to coercive; normative and cognitive pressuresas they seek legitimacy. Once these firms gain legitimacy in advanced markets through theadoption of local business practices; they transfer these approaches to their headquarters indeveloping markets; establishing best practices in their home markets. Further; EMNCs mayengage in efforts aimed at changing the institutional environment in the developing marketto facilitate the transfer of learned practices from the developed market. Thus; we proposethat these best practices lead to global isomorphism; but also note instances where …,*,2012,12
The hidden costs of offshoring: The impact of complexity; design orientation and experience,Marcus Møller Larsen; Stephan Manning; Torben Pedersen,Abstract This study seeks to explain hidden costs of offshoring; ie unexpected costs resultingfrom the relocation of business tasks and activities outside the home country. We develop amodel that highlights the role of complexity; design orientation and experience in explaininghidden costs of offshoring. Specifically; we propose that hidden costs can be explained bythe combination of increasing structural; operational and social complexity of offshoringactivities. In addition; we suggest that firm orientation towards organizational design as partof an offshoring strategy and offshoring experience moderate the relationship betweencomplexity and hidden costs negatively ie reduces the cost generating impact of complexity.We develop three hypotheses and test them on comprehensive data from the OffshoringResearch Network (ORN). In general; we find support for our hypotheses. A key result of …,Academy of Management Proceedings,2011,12
Entry mode decisions by emerging-market firms investing in developed markets,Dan Li; Stewart R Miller; Lorraine Eden,This study draws upon the interorganizational imitation theory and endorsement literaturesto explain the entry mode decisions of emerging-market firms (EMFs) into developedmarkets. Specifically; the study argues that EMFs entering developed markets paydifferential attention to the prior actions of reference groups–by type of country of origin(whom to follow?) and by entry mode (how to imitate?). We test our hypotheses with asample of 591 entries by EMFs investing in the United States over a 10-year period. Theresults support an isomorphism-based framework with different influences across referencegroups by country of origin and entry mode. We find a dominant form of isomorphism; evenafter controlling for transaction costs and resource-based explanations.,*,2012,11
The termination dilemma of foreign intermediaries: Performance; anti-shirking measures and hold-up safeguards,Bent Petersen; Torben Pedersen; Gabriel RG Benito,For many exporting firms; success in foreign markets hinges to a large extent on theperformance of their foreign intermediaries (;;). In spite of the key role played byintermediaries in foreign markets–ie sales agents and independent distributors–exportersoften regard them as temporary arrangements and second-best alternatives to conductingforeign marketing; sales; and service activities in-house. The typical assumption is thatforeign intermediaries are low-control entry modes (;) that do not have the potential ofexploiting the full sales potential of export markets. In other words; foreign intermediaryarrangements could have inherent limitations that foster mediocre rather than excellentmarket performance. Several studies report that exporters generally distrust foreignintermediaries and suspect them of shirking at any given occasion (;;). Poor performance …,*,2006,11
Organizing to gain from user interaction: The role of organizational practices for absorptive and innovative capacities,Nicolai J Foss; Keld Laursen; Torben Pedersen,Abstract We address how organizational practices may leverage the knowledge absorptionfrom users in the context of innovation. We focus on practices that enhance communicationand knowledge sharing between management and employees and between departments;and on pecuniary rewards for engaging in knowledge sharing. Such practices leverageknowledge absorption and lead to higher innovative capacity. Thus; we identify some of theorganizational dimensions of absorptive capacity that are needed to benefit from the “userinnovation model” and provide quantitative support for the propositions put forward.

LHRH analogue as a depot preparation (Zoladex) in the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate followed by orchiectomy as a second line therapy—a phas...,Peter Iversen; Carsten Rose; Jens Georg Stage; Hans-Georg Iversen; Rolf Iversen Hansen; Valdemar Hvidt; Peter Mogensen; Torben Pedersen; Jørgen Bech Hansen,An LHRH agonist; Zoladex®; was employed as a monthly depot in 56 previously untreatedpatients with advanced carcinoma of the prostate. Of 53 evaluable patients; 27 achievedpartial remission and 7 were stable. Median duration of response was 10 months. Afavorable subjective response was attained in 68% of the patients. During treatment; serumtestosterone was in the castrate range in all patients except five. Possible explanations forthis escape phenomenon are discussed. No toxicity was observed and treatment was welltolerated in all patients. Thirty-two patients underwent bilateral orchiectomy followingtreatment failure of Zoladex®. In one patient partial remission according to protocol criteriawas recorded. Treatment with LHRH agonists seems safe and may serve as an alternative toconventional hormonal treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate.,Scandinavian journal of urology and nephrology,1989,11
Organizational adaptation in offshoring: the relative performance of home-and host-based learning strategies,Christian Geisler Asmussen; Marcus M Larsen; Torben Pedersen,Offshoring offers managers the promise of substantial economic benefits; but also comeswith the risk of increased complexity and coordination challenges. We argue that offshoringfirms must accumulate architectural knowledge to keep the cost of coordination of thegeographically separated activities at bay. Based on a simulation model that examines theperformance implications of firms' learning strategies when offshoring; we show that suchknowledge accumulation can be achieved through either a home-based or a host-basedlearning strategy. Our analysis suggests that the relative performance of these two strategiesdepends on nontrivial interactions among the costs of communication; the distance to theoffshoring location; and the level of noise in the firm's performance function. In particular; thedifficulties of interpreting performance signals in noisy situations suggest that there are …,Organization Science,2016,10

Administration of tramadol or ibuprofen increases the INR level in patients on warfarin,Jacob Juel; Torben Brøchner Pedersen; Christian Sigvald Langfrits; Svend Eggert Jensen,Anticoagulation with the vitamin-K antagonist warfarin is widely used in cardiology to reducethe risk of thromboembolism in cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. The targetinternational normalized ratio (INR) level should often be kept in the interval of 2.0-3.0; inorder to diminish the risk of thromboembolism and decrease the risk of adverse effects suchas hemorrhage. Monitoring of the INR is necessary [1]. A 74-year-old man was admitted tohospital with recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

Technological clusters and multinational enterprise R&D strategy,Ram Mudambi; Tim Swift,Economic clusters are global centers of excellence in particular industries or technologies.They consist of interlinked companies; specialized suppliers; support services; and relevantinstitutional actors in a specific field. Multinational enterprise (MNE) R&D strategy withregard to economic clusters is impacted by two contradictory forces. MNEs locating theirR&D activities within economic clusters can benefit by availing of specialized resources andby capturing location-specific tacit knowledge. However; the risks of knowledge leakage canlead to adverse selection whereby clusters attract underperforming firms that have much togain and little to lose. Further; general disagreement exists on the measurement ofperformance within economic clusters.

Lego group: an outsourcing journey,Marcus Møller Larsen; Torben Pedersen; Dmitrij Slepniov,Abstract: The last years' rather adventurous journey from 2004 to 2009 had taught the fifth-largest toy-maker in the world-the LEGO Group-the importance of managing the globalsupply chain effectively. In order to survive the largest internal financial crisis in its roughly70 years of existence; the management had; among many initiatives; decided to offshoreand outsource a major chunk of its production to Flextronics. In this pursuit of rapid cost-cutting sourcing advantages; the LEGO Group planned to license out as much as 80 percent of its production besides closing down major parts of the production in high costcountries. Confident with the prospects of the new partnership; the company signed a long-term contract with Flextronics. This decision eventually proved itself to have been too hasty;however.

The MNC as a knowledge structure: The role of knowledge sources and organizational instruments for knowledge creation and transfer,Nicolai J Foss; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Most recent research on the differentiated MNC has been taken up with knowledgeflows between MNC units. In contrast; we develop a view of the MNC as a knowledgestructure where knowledge elements in MNCs are seen as being structured along a numberof dimensions (eg; complementarity; dispersal; sources of knowledge) that help determiningthe costs and benefits of knowledge transfer. Based on this conceptualization; we argue thatMNC management through choices regarding organizational control; motivation and contextcan influence the development; characteristics and transfer of knowledge. This furtherextends existing literature. For example; in most of the literature; the characteristics ofknowledge are seen as exogenous rather than endogenous variables.

Building a MNC knowledge structure: the role of knowledge sources; complementarities and organizational context,N Foss; Torben Pedersen,Abstract We develop a view of the MNC as a knowledge-creating and and utilizing entity;building on the extant literature on the differentiated MNC as well as on Lyles andSchwenk's work on corporate knowledge structures. The starting point for thisconceptualization is that MNC management through choices regarding organizationalcontrol; motivation and context can influence the development; characteristics and transfer ofknowledge. This extends existing literature. For example; in most of the literature; thecharacteristics of knowledge are seen as exogenous rather than endogenous variables.However; to the extent that management chooses a specific way of sourcing knowledge; italso implicitly chooses the characteristics of the sourced knowledge and the ease with whichit can be transferred inside the MNC.

Means of knowledge acquisition and knowledge transfer mechanism in the internationalization process,Torben Pedersen; B Petersen; D Sharma,Resume: This large-scale study explores the performance implications of differentcombinations of knowledge sourcing and transfer mechanisms of multinational corporations(MNCs). The focus is on transfer of internationalization knowledge. After having acquiredknowledge in foreign markets; the MNCs face a choice as to the mechanism used fortransferring this knowledge to other units of the corporation. MNCs can use" richcommunication media" that are able to transfer experiential knowledge as acquiredoriginally. Alternatively; the MNCs may aim to codify the knowledge in written media in orderto transfer it to other units. A wrong choice of transfer mechanism may result in unnecessarilyhigh communication costs or impaired quality of the knowledge subject to transfer. On thebasis of data on Danish MNCs the performance implications of the transfer mechanism …,*,2001,8

What do we know about state-owned emerging-economy firms; and how? Evaluating literature about inward and outward multinational activities,Xavier Martin; Cha Li,Abstract In this paper; we conduct a conceptual and bibliographic analysis of the literaturethat deals with the international strategy of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); with particularattention to SOEs from emerging economies (EEs). We first review the state of the art indefining the concepts of EEs and SOEs. We then conduct a detailed bibliographic analysisof the literature pertaining to SOEs' involvement in international activities; whether asoutward foreign investors or as potential local partners of inward-investing multinationalenterprises. The analysis covers general trends in the literature; prominent researchquestions and outcome variables; use of theories; and choices pertaining to methodology(type of research and effects; empirical contexts). We document a literature that is fast-growing and well balanced in some respects. In other respects; we advance …,*,2015,7
Business groups; institutional transition; and the internationalization of firms from emerging economies,Torben Pedersen; Tamara Stucchi,Studies on internationalization often claim that the patterns and drivers of theinternationalization of firms from emerging markets (EMs) are qualitatively different from thecorresponding patterns and drivers of the internationalization of firms from advancedeconomies (AEs). Such studies are based on the proposition that AE firms have moreresources; and access to better technology and competences; while EM firms arelatecomers with fewer resources and less knowledge. Along the same lines; these studiesargue that the existing theories on internationalization are of less value in the context of EMfirms; as they are based on the internationalization ofAE firms (see; eg; Luo and Tung; 2007;Mathews; 2002; 2006). We believe that this view reflects stereotypes of EM and AE firms thatare rather misleading. The term “EM firms” gives the false impression that these firms form …,Understanding Multinationals from emerging markets,2014,7
Offshoring white-collar work: an explorative investigation of the processes and mechanisms in two Danish manufacturing firms,Dmitrij Slepniov; Marcus M Larsen; Brian Vejrum Wæhrens; Torben Pedersen; John Johansen,Abstract The purpose of this chapter is twofold: to explain why white-collar service work inmanufacturing firms is increasingly subject to offshoring and to understand the effects of thisprocess on work integration mechanisms. The empirical part of the study is based on twocase studies of Danish manufacturers. First; the chapter finds that drivers of white-collar workoffshoring in many respects are parallel to those of the earlier wave of blue-collar workoffshoring; that is; cost minimisation and resource seeking. Second; due to theinterdependence of white-collar tasks with the rest of the organisation; our results suggestthat white-collar offshoring in manufacturing firms poses higher requirements to theorganisational configuration and capabilities compared with blue-collar work.

Effect of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria of DL-starters in initial ripening of semi-hard cheese,Thomas Bæk Pedersen; Finn Kvist Vogensen; Y Ardö,Abstract The role of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria from dl-starters in ripening ofsemi-hard cheese was investigated using the strains Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroidesPS12 and 1159; Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris T26 and Lactobacillusdanicus 13M1. Control cheese was made with starter containing only homofermentativeLactococcus lactis subspecies. Leuc. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris T26 did not grow incheese and started to decrease in number early; whereas the others grew and remained ata high number throughout the nine-week ripening period. None of the addedheterofermentative strains affected proteolysis and total amount of amino acids; however;differences in the composition of amino acids were observed; and caused significantdifferences in the composition of volatile aroma compounds.

Physiographic data for road stretch forecasting,Torben Strunge Pedersen; Claus Petersen; Kai Sattler; Alexander Mahura; BH Sass,ABSTRACT There is a balance between doing to much or too little preventing salting toavoid slippery roads. Both for environmental and economical reasons it pays off to make allpossible efforts to find out if salting is necessary. For these reasons an interest for roadstretch forecasts has been growing recently. The requirements to make these very accurateforecasts are huge compared to traditional numerical weather forecasts which are for a fixedgrid and not defined for specific points. However; it should be underlined that this is the onlysource of data to predict the future of the atmospheric state. Furthermore; the spatialresolution in numerical weather prediction models is still not high enough to be used directlyfor detailed road stretch forecasting even though numerical weather prediction models haveimproved much; especially when it comes to spatial resolution which now is in the order …,Proceedings of the 15th International Road Weather Conference; Québec City; Canada,2010,6

The MNC as a differentiated network: subsidiary technology embeddedness and performance,Ulf Andersson; Mats Forsgren; Torben Pedersen,ABSTRACT There has been a growing interest in looking upon the MNC as a differentiatednetwork in the sense that subsidiaries have access to different types of resources andtherefore perform differently in its market-place and within the MNC. Yet; even thoughsubsidiaries are the object of intense interests; remarkably little have been written aboutassessment of subsidiary performance. In short; the possibilities of subsidiaries seem togenerate more attention in the literature than their results. The two distinctive features of thispaper lie in the development of the concept of subsidiary performance and the exploration ofthe linkage between subsidiary embeddedness and performance. More specifically; bydrawing on literature about organizational learning; absorptive capacity and embeddednessin business relationships; some hypotheses will be formulated about the casual link …,Uppsala University; Copenhagen Business School,1999,6

The Relational Antecedents of Interpersonal Helping:‘Quantity’;‘Quality’or Both?,Diego Stea; Torben Pedersen; Nicolai J Foss,Abstract Having a large network of colleagues means having several opportunities to helpthose colleagues; as well as a higher chance of receiving requests for help from them.Employees with large networks are therefore expected to help more in the workplace thanthose with small networks. However; large networks are also associated with cognitive costs;which may reduce the focal employee's ability to both recognize the need for help andengage in helping behaviours. For these reasons; the authors assert an inverted U-shapedrelation between the size of an ego's social network and engagement in helping behaviour.However; high-quality relationships imply higher mutual understanding between the actors;and hence lower cognitive costs. In turn; the position (and threshold) of the curve betweennetwork size and interpersonal helping should be influenced by the quality of the …,British Journal of Management,2017,4

We focus on firms establishing asubsidiary abroad. We delve into the nature of institutional change and propose twocategories of institutional change that have impacts of different magnitudes on internationalinvestments. We also investigate the case of firms affiliated with domestic business groups.We develop four hypotheses and test them using data on Indian firms. Our findings provideinteresting insights into different institutional factors that promote firms' internationalization ina context characterized by dynamic change.

Organizational Reconfiguration and Strategic Response: The Case of Offshoring,Marcus M Larsen; Torben Pedersen,Abstract The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the organizationalreconfiguration of offshoring on firms' strategies. A consequence of offshoring is the need toreintegrate the geographically relocated organizational activities into a coherentorganizational architecture. In order to do this; firms need a high degree of architecturalknowledge; which is typically gained through learning by doing. We therefore argue thatfirms with more offshoring experience are more likely to include organizational objectives intheir offshoring strategies. We develop and find support for this hypothesis using a mixed-method approach based on a qualitative case study and comprehensive data from theOffshoring Research Network. These findings contribute to research on the organizationaldesign and architecture of offshoring and the dynamics of organizational architectures.,*,2014,4

In order toavoid accident at slippery roads preventing salting must be taken. A balance on how muchand where exactly this measure should be taken have become of critical importance forenvironmental and economical reasons. For these reasons; in addition to forecasts at roadstations; recently practical use of the forecasts at road stretches along the driving lanes hasbeen growing rapidly.

How do we capture “Global Specialization” when measuring firms’ degree of internationalization?,Christian Geisler Asmussen; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract The IB literature informs us of several ways to measure firms' degree ofinternationalization. In this paper we make the argument that in fact none of the existingindices really measure firms' degree of “global specialization”; that is; to what extent theirallocation of resources is multidomestic or global. As argued; all the existing measures maygauge a purely multidomestic firm as having a high degree of internationalization; whereasa truly global firm may be ranked low. In order to remedy this we introduce a complementaryindex measuring how firms are configuring their value chains–whether they are replicatingvalue chain activities from country to country or locating them in globally specialized units inorder to exploit an international division of labor. In addition to mathematical modeling andnumerical examples; we examine the relevance of the new index of global specialization …,Center for Strategic Management and Globalization; Denmark: Copenhagen,2005,4

The aim of the project is to replace aging workstation systems (Kusch 1994;Koppert 1997) and to provide an unified environment to support forecasting and warningoperations. Besides the development of new; or the integration of recently developedapplications; it is necessary to provide most of the capabilities of the existing systems.Forecasters are conservative and often would like to stay with their old tools.

One stream of research has addressed how competitive advantagesdeveloped at home are complemented by additional advantages gained from worldwideoperations. Concepts like 'Disadvantages of Foreignness'(Dunning 1977) and 'Psychicdistance'(Johanson and Vahlne 1977) that describe the differences between the homecountry and the foreign markets relate to this stream of literature. According to Dunning(1977); firm-specific advantages are necessary to overcome disadvantages of foreignnessand are therefore believed to be the driving factor behind FDIs; while Johanson and Vahlne(1977) argue that gaining local market experience is the driving factor in the …,DRUID Conference,1998,4

Surgical correction of pectus carinatum,T Pedersen; HK Pilegaard,Abstract INTRODUCTION: Pectus carinatum (PC) is a protrusion of the sternum due toovergrowth of the costal cartilages. It can have considerable psychological and somaticimpact on the patient. Many physicians are unaware of the beneficial effects and lowcomorbidity related to surgical correction and therefore erroneously advise patients againstthe operation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the preliminary experience with 26consecutive patients operated for PC at our Department between 1 April 2006 and 1 April2007. Surgery was performed by a modified Ravitch and Welch technique. The mean agewas 15 years (13-21); and 92% of the patients were boys. RESULTS: We obtained excellentcosmetic results in the majority of patients (92%); no major complications; no major paincomplaints and short hospital stays for all patients. CONCLUSION: Patients who are …,Ugeskrift for laeger,2008,3
Is There a Trend Towards Global Value Chain Specialization? An Examination of Cross Border Sales of US Foreign Affiliates,Sjoerd Beugelsdijk; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract: In this study we discuss and empirically test the assertion that over the last twodecades multinational enterprises'(MNEs') configuration of value-adding activities hasshifted from a sparse and simple (host-home) international division of labor among theforeign affiliates to a more specialized and'advanced'global value chain configuration inwhich MNEs locate fine-sliced parts of the value chain at the most efficient locations. Usingdata on trade flows of US affiliates in 56 host countries between 1983 and 2003 we findsome indications of a trend in the direction of global value chain specialization. In particularamong US affiliates in developing countries the proportion of host-host; intra-firm trade hasincreased significantly during the observed period of time. Conversely; the proportion of host-home and inter-firm trade has diminished. We interpret this as indicating both value chain …,*,2008,3
The VetMet veterinary decision support system for airborne animal diseases,Jens Havskov; Søren Alexandersen; Poul Astrup; Knud Erik Christensen; Torben Mikkelsen; Sten Mortensen; Torben Strunge Pedersen; Søren Thykier-Nielsen,Abstract A veterinary meteorological decision-support system; VetMet; is developed incollaboration between Danish meteorological and veterinary research institutes andauthorities. The system; which is implemented at the Danish Meteorological Institute; is usedby the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration; which has the responsibility forprevention and control of animal diseases in Denmark. By estimating the risk of atmosphericspread of airborne animal diseases; including first of all foot-and-mouth disease; VetMetimproves the preparedness and the disease eradication. The Internet-based system will beused for decision support regarding establishment of surveillance and eradication zones.VetMet can describe both local spread of infectious airborne diseases betweenneighbouring farms and long-range dispersion; including disease spread to or from other …,*,2008,3

Thermal Mapping Data in Verification of Road Weather Modelling,A Mahura; C Petersen; BH Sass; P Holm; T Pedersen,ABSTRACT In this study; vehicles measurements of road conditions (road surfacetemperature; Ts and air temperature; Ta-thermal mapping data; ThMD) from the Ribe Amtcounty roads–VA-4; RI-1; and GR-2-of the Jutland Peninsula (Denmark) have been used forverification of the Danish Road Weather Model (RWM) system. During 2005-2007 caseswith road salting activities have been identified and analyzed by comparing observed and 3hour forecasted road surface and air temperatures at selected stretches (situated atdistances of 2 km from each other) of the roads. The output of road conditions forecasts forall cases is evaluated. The main focus is on the night time forecasts; although the diurnalvariability was also evaluated. It is found that the RWM system has a good predictive skill forthe road surface temperature at the road stretches having a mean absolute error of 0.5 …,Abstract submitted to the 7th Annual Meeting of the European Meteorological Society and EU Conference on Applications of Meteorology; 1-5 October 2007; San Lorenzo; Spain,2007,3

Topics in Merger Control-Experiences from a Recent Merger in the Danish Electricity Sector,Torben Pedersen; Carsten Smidt; Peder Kongsted Christiansen,The Danish Competition Authority (DCA) recently approved a merger between Denmark'stwo largest electricity companies-Elsam and NESA. This article focuses on some topics ofgeneral interest that this merger raises. One such issue is that the merger happened in amarket where the product characteristics and the capacity constraints give a dominantproducer the opportunity to make use of its position to increase both prices and profits. Themerger also illustrates some difficulties in calculating the effect on competition when amerger makes the merged entity a minority owner of an important competitor. Furthermore; alonger time horizon than usual was used for the investigation of the competition effects of themerger.,World Competition,2004,3

The direction of causality between blockholder ownership and firm value: US and EU Evidence,Torben Pedersen; Steen Thomsen; Hans Kurt Kvist,We examine the causal relationship between blockholder ownership (measured by thefraction of shares controlled by large shareholders) and firm value (measured as the simpleTobin's Q) of the largest EU and US companies. Using Granger causality tests we find nosignificant causal effects either way in the US/UK; but in continental Europe we find anegative effect of blockholder ownership on firm value and a negative effect of firm value onblockholder ownership. Consistent with an overall non-linear relationship; as hypothesisedby Morck; Shleifer and Vishny (1988) and Stultz (1988); the negative effect of blockholderownership on firm value performance is found to be significant only for companies with highinitial levels of blockholder ownership (> 10%); but insignificant for companies with low initiallevels.

The effect of organizational separation on individuals’ knowledge sharing in MNCs,Àngels Dasí; Torben Pedersen; Paul N Gooderham; Frank Elter; Jarle Hildrum,Abstract The ability of an organization to apply knowledge globally has been conceptualizedas critical for the existence of multinational corporations (MNCs). We argue for anorganizational separation effect on knowledge sharing that challenges the view of the MNCas a latent social community. Using a unique data-set of more than 4000 individualresponses from an MNC; Telenor; we test how three types of drivers for individuals'knowledge sharing–individuals' motivation; and individuals' perceptions of organizationalvalues and organizational work practices–work differently within; as opposed to across;business units. Our analysis suggests that while intrinsic motivation; innovative values andjob autonomy are relatively important drivers of knowledge sharing within the business units;extrinsic motivation; result-oriented values and participation in corporate employee …,Journal of World Business,2017,2
Global entrepreneurship: Assessment and challenges,Gideon Markman; Timothy M Devinney; Torben Pedersen; Laszlo Tihanyi,Advances in technology; and especially the optimization of the Internet; ushered in tectonicshifts in our economic structures; including innovations in management; governance;regulations; and international trade. These new developments then gave rise to andreinforced concepts such as “global village;”“borderless world;” and “worldwide society.”From a business perspective; this is most noticeable in the expansion in the number andreach of multinational enterprises (MNEs). However; we suddenly also noticed a relativelynew phenomenon: startups that operate internationally À in fact globally À from day one.Scholars and practitioners describe these startups as;“international startups;”“globalventures;”“born global;” and “global entrepreneurs”(Knight; 2001; McDougall & Oviatt; 2000;McDougall; Shane; & Oviatt; 1994; Oviatt & McDougall; 1994; 2005; Rennie; 1993).

Introduction to Part II: emerging economies and multinational enterprises,Elitsa R Banalieva; Laszlo Tihanyi; Timothy M Devinney; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Do multinational enterprises evolve differently in emerging and developedeconomies? Although one camp argues that emerging economy multinationals are differentfrom their developed country counterparts owing to the underdeveloped institutions in theirhome countries; another camp counters that they are the same and the existing internationalbusiness theories can fully explain their strategies. A third camp suggests a more nuancedperspective by finding value in both approaches. In this introductory chapter; we review thisdebate and offer new perspectives on how to extend existing theories by accounting for fourspecific aspects of the home country institutional environments of emerging economies:breadth; depth; timing; and duration of exposure to institutional development. We thendiscuss how the chapters in this volume extend these ideas.,*,2015,2
Managing hidden costs of offshoring: learning to achieve system integration,Marcus M Larsen; Torben Pedersen,ABSTRACT This chapter investigates the concept of the 'hidden costs' of offshoring; ieunexpected offshoring costs exceeding the initially expected costs. Due to the highlyundefined nature of these costs; we position our analysis towards the strategic responses offirms' realisation of hidden costs. In this regard; we argue that a major response to thehidden costs of offshoring is the identification and utilisation of strategic mechanisms in theorganisational design to eventually achieving system integration in a globally dispersed anddisaggregated organisation. This is heavily moderated by a learning-by-doing process;where hidden costs motivate firms and their employees to search for new and betterknowledge on how to successfully manage the organisation. We illustrate this thesis basedon the case of the LEGO Group.,Global Operations Networks,2014,2
Do expectations match reality when firms consider the risks of offshoring? A comparison of risk assessment by firms with and without offshoring experience,Peter D Ørberg Jensen; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract The risk associated with offshoring is a recurrent theme in research. However;previous research has mainly given a static picture of offshoring risks even though thestrategies of offshoring firms; including their views on risks; may change as they gainexperience in the field. In this chapter we investigate the influence of organizational learningon firms' perceptions of the risks in offshoring. We use survey data from firms in Scandinaviaand compare the risk assessments of firms without offshoring experience with firms thatengage in offshoring. The findings show that firms without offshoring experience particularlystress exogenous risks while firms with offshoring experience see the endogenous risks asimportant. We offer two different interpretations of these results.,*,2013,2
Multinational Enterprises–How Important are they for the Danish Economy?,Torben Pedersen; Jan Rose Skaksen,The Danish economy is under pressure. First; demographic changes imply that the laborforce is shrinking; and the population becomes disproportionally elderly with a growingnumber of people relying on public pensions and on early retirement schemes. Thisdevelopment results in substantial public deficits; and it reduces the growth potential of theeconomy. Second; in the period 1995–2008 the labor productivity–ie production per workinghour–has only increased by ¾ percent per year; which is less than half of what has been thecase in comparable countries. This implies that the labor productivity in top five of the mostproductive OECD countries is 35 percent higher than in Denmark. Further; in 1995 theDanish productivity was nearly 30 percent higher than the OECD average-in 2008 it is lessthan 10 percent higher than the average. 2 On top of that; in 2008 and 2009 a large …,a Conference on Explaining and Improving Productivity: The Danish Experience in an International Perspective; organised by Danmarks Nationalbank and the International Monetary Fund,2011,2

Organising to gain from interaction with customers: the role of organisational practices for absorptive and innovative capacities,Nicolai J Foss; Keld Laursen; Torben Pedersen,Abstract We address how organizational practices may leverage the knowledge absorptionfrom customers in the context of innovation. We focus on practices that enhancecommunication and knowledge sharing between management and employees and betweendepartments; and on pecuniary rewards for engaging in knowledge sharing. Suchcomplementary practices leverage knowledge absorption and lead to higher innovativecapacity. Thus; we identify some of the organizational dimensions of absorptive capacity thatare needed to benefit from interaction with customers in the context of innovation. The paperthus contributes to both the absorptive capacity and the user-innovation literatures.. Thehypotheses are tested on a dataset drawn from a survey of 169 Danish private firms whichwas implemented in 2001 among a sample of the 1000 largest Danish manufacturing and …,11th International Schumpeter Society Conference.

Why do MNC subsidiaries engage in knowledge sharing with other subsidiaries and what are the implications for performance?,Volker Mahnke; Torben Pedersen; Markus Venzin,Abstract This paper suggests how a MNC subsidiary's knowledge outflow can influence itsperformance. We distinguish between direct costs and opportunity costs. Direct costs arecontingent on knowledge types and the lack of appropriate communication channels.Opportunity costs are due to resource-use for knowledge outflows that could have beenutilized for the subsidiary's own business and development activities. Despite costs;increased knowledge inflow and reputation gains induce knowledge outflows. Asimultaneous equation model applied to unique data; from a German MNC;HeidelbergCement; shows that costs and benefits incurred have a significant effect onknowledge outflows; which in turn have a significant curvilinear effect on subsidiaryperformance.,The DRU-ID Tenth Anniversary Summer Conference,2005,2

Causes and Consequences of Ownership Concentration among Europe´ s Largest Companies: Economic and Systemic Explanations,Torben Pedersen; Steen Thomsen,Abstract: The paper examines causes and effects of ownership concentration among thelargest companies in 12 European countries. As a reference point the paper takes a seminalempirical study on US data by Demsetz and Lehn (1985) and examines to what extent theirmodel is applicable in European countries. The findings indicate that both general economiceffects and system effects are significant. Ownership concentration is found to decrease withfirm size and to increase with earnings volatility. But in support of the system theoriesadvocated by Roe (1991); Laporta et al.(1996) and Shleifer and Vishny (1997) nationality isalso found to have a significant effect which is partly attributable to institutional differencesbetween nations such as stock market size and the frequency of large banks.

Not all brokers are alike: Creative implications of brokering networks in different work functions,Diego Stea; Torben Pedersen,Brokers are expected to be more creative than employees embedded in closed socialstructures because they occupy a position in the social space that provides them with accessto non-redundant knowledge. However; the extant research provides partly inconsistentfindings on the creative implications of brokerage; which raises important questions aboutwhen and how brokering between otherwise disconnected colleagues leads to individualcreativity. We advance the relational perspective on individual creativity by adopting acontingency view; and showing that a curvilinear (inverted U-shape) specification of therelationship between brokerage and creativity applies particularly when brokers work inresearch and development; as they are more likely to intensively exploit their structuralopportunities. In addition; we show that brokers who work in research and development …,Human Relations,2017,1
Why Do the Turkish Firms Invest in Mainland Europe?,Sathyajit R Gubbi; Sinan A Sular,Abstract Outward foreign direct investments (FDI) by Turkish firms in the new millenniumshow intriguing geographic distribution pattern and unlike the predictions of classicaltheories of FDI. In this study we contribute by linking the observed pattern of outward FDIwith Turkish firms' motivation for investment across national borders. We enrich research bycollecting and analyzing FDI motivation data at the firm-level for a very important but lessresearched developing country: Turkey. Content analysis of text material on the foreigninvestments made by 211 Turkish firms reveals that Turkish firms primarily perform FDI inEuropean developed countries for reasons other than conventional; namely; market-andstrategic-asset-seeking motivations. More importantly; Turkish firms seem to be using theEuropean countries to (1) present themselves as a European Union company;(2) make …,*,2015,1
Hepato-pericardial fistula caused by radiofrequency ablation of colorectal liver metastases,MF Mogensen; P Edling; TB Raade; TI Pedersen; HK Pilegaard,Abstract Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of colorectal liver metastases is a well toleratedminimally invasive procedure. Various complications can occur but most of these are self-limiting if diagnosed and treated in time. This case report describes a serious and rarecomplication following RFA treatment: hepato-pericardial fistula caused by several RFAprocedures aiming to cure colorectal liver metastases. Complications to RFA treatment varyand can be difficult to diagnose.

Ontology and IB: re-imagining the multinational,Brent Burmester,Setting the multinational enterprise (MNE) apart on the basis of a weakly specified idea offoreignness may impede progress in international business (IB). The discipline lacks aparadigm to assimilate the idea of foreignness as an incident of internationality; a globalcondition describing the political context within which the MNE functions and which confersuniqueness on that institution. However; a plausible re-imagining of the MNE is possible anduseful; and here a candidate for such an ontological shift is proffered. Rather than a firmstruggling in one or more foreign contexts; the MNE is reconstructed as a foreignercontending with the responsibilities of a firm. The proposed re-imagining of the MNE isexperimentally substituted for the received ontology in different IB research contexts. Ittranspires that this ontological revision maintains intelligibility in those contexts while …,*,2013,1

Thermal Mapping Data Measurements: Road Weather Seasons 2008-2011,Alexander Mahura; Claus Petersen; Bent Hansen Sass; Peter Holm; TS Pedersen,Abstract The vehicles measurements of the road conditions (so-called thermal mappingdata; ThMD) have been used for verification of the performance of the Danish Road WeatherModelling System (RWMS) at road stretches of selected roads and compared with forecastsat selected road stations of the Danish road network. It was found that the RWMS systemshowed a comparable predictability for the road surface temperature for 3 hour forecasts atroad stations vs. road stretches. Although ThMD data showed that they are very useful forverification; these are less applicable and valuable for on-line assimilation into the systemdue to limited spatial and temporal distribution and irregular measurements. But such ThMDcan be used for possible correction of the road surface temperature forecasts based ondetailed analysis and integration of such data; if the data are of sufficient quality and if …,DMI Sci.

KNOWLEDGE COMPLEMENTARITY AND TRANSFER THRESHOLDS IN THE DIFFERENTIATED MNC,Christian Geisler Asmussen; Nicolai J Foss; Torben Pedersen,Much recent strategy research has focused on knowledge stocks and their accumulationprocesses as determinants of sustained competitive advantage (eg; Dierickx & Cool; 1989;Makadok; 2001). A parallel development in the literature on the “differentiated multinationalcorporation” points out that MNC knowledge stocks are often distributed across the networkof subsidiaries; each controlling heterogeneous knowledge resources (eg; Hedlund 1986;Bartlett & Ghoshal 1989; Birkinshaw 1996; Ghoshal & Bartlett; 1990; Gupta & Govindarajan1991; 1995; 2000; Holm and Pedersen 2000). A key message in this literature is that MNCsmay derive advantages relative to purely domestic firms from their 1) superior access to suchheterogenous distributed knowledge resources (eg; Bartlett & Ghoshal; 1986; Hedlund;1986); and 2) ability to to transfer and combine knowledge resources in a low cost …,*,2008,1

Internal Versus External Knowledge Sourcing Of Subsidiaries: An Organizational Trade-Off,Jens Gammelgaard; Torben Pedersen,Abstract: When building up competences; a subsidiary of a multinational corporation (MNC)may rely onexternal knowledge sources like customers; suppliers; competitors or localscience centers. Internalsourcing is also available through knowledge offered byheadquarters or other affiliates. Thequestion is whether the two kinds of sources are mutualexclusive. A dilemma or organizationaltrade-off is foreseeable; since the more the subsidiaryadapts its knowledge creation processes tohost country institutions; the less it will be able toutilize internal knowledge sources due to theinstitutional distance between the external andinternal networks. However; newer organizationalforms; like the concept of thedifferentiatedMNC'; imply a relatively smooth flow of knowledgeinside the MNC; indicating that we shouldnot expect an organizational trade-off between internaland external sources.

Replacing the foreign intermediary,Bent Peterson; Gabriel RG Benito; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Using longitudinal data from a sample of Danish exporters; logistic regressionanalysis is applied to model the impact of a number of factors. Data show that dissatisfactionwith the local intermediary does not appear as a determinant of replacement. Instead;changes in the level of information asymmetry exert the most important influence on thedecision to replace the foreign intermediary. As an exporter becomes more informed aboutalternative-and potentially more qualified-intermediaries operating in a particular market; theexisting intermediary faces a higher risk of being replaced.,International Studies of Management & Organization,2000,1

The Internationalization Process of Danish Firms,Torben Pedersen,АННОТАЦИЯ: The Swedish internationalization model has greatly influenced nordicresearch in firms' internationalization processes. In this article; the Uppsala model is testedon empirical material gathered in Denmark. The Uppsala model in itself is unable to explainthe internationalization pattern of Danish firms; therefore; the article advocates theinterpretation of the internationalization process as an interaction of the firm's internal affairs(''search-learning''process); external competitive conditions; and basic economic elements(assessment of market potential).,International Journal of Research in Marketing,1996,1

Prostatotomy. Long-term results,T Pedersen; CF Asmussen; HV Nielsen,Abstract Sixty-five patients were treated with transurethral incision of the prostate (TUI-P) onaccount of slight obstructive enlargement of the prostate. Out of these; 46 were followed-upwith a median period of observation of just under four years. In five patients prostatotomyproved insufficient and resection or repeated TUI-P was necessary. 80% of the patientsconsidered that micturition had improved as assessed subjectively by means of a simplerank scale. Assessed symptomatically according to Madsen & Iversen's scale; a medianscore of 2 and less than 10 was found in 85%.

The ambivalent effect of complexity on firm performance: A study of the global service provider industry,Marcus M Larsen; Stephan Manning; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Prior literature is ambivalent about whether organizational complexity has positiveor negative effects on firm performance. Using rich data on global service providers; weexplore this ambivalence by disentangling performance consequences of different types oforganizational complexity. We show that complexity arising from the coordination of differentservices and operations negatively influences profit margins through increased coordinationcosts; whereas complexity coming from the sophistication of particular services maypositively influence margins through informational advantages. We also investigate themoderating effects of process commoditization and client-specific investments. Our findingspoint to critical performance dilemmas facing global service providers in a highly competitiveindustry; and they help better differentiate performance effects of complexity at different …,Long Range Planning,2018,*

Breaking up the global value chain: opportunities and consequences,Torben Pedersen; Timothy M Devinney; Laszlo Tihanyi; Arnaldo Camuffo,With intensified global competition; institutional changes and reduced communication coststhe propensity of firms to reconfigure their global value chain and separate their activitiesacross national boundaries has increased markedly. It enables firms to combine the benefitsarising from specialization and increased flexibility with location advantages. Consequently;large parts of manufacturing and other more standardized activities have been offshored toemerging countries. However; recent developments are challenging this traditionalseparation between advanced and emerging economies as host of knowledge-andproduction-intensive activities; respectively. Recent research has emphasized the role ofintra-organizational relationships and links among the different parts of the value chain.Innovative and productive activities are affected by strong interdependencies and …,*,2017,*
New Business Models In-The-Making in Extant MNCs: Digital Transformation in a Telco,Àngels Dasí; Frank Elter; Paul N Gooderham; Torben Pedersen,Abstract In recent years; we can observe the emergence of firms; born both digital andglobal; that have disrupted existing industries. Deploying digital technologies; they havedeveloped innovative value chains and business models that threaten establishedmultinational companies (MNCs). In this chapter; we examine how MNCs can and dorespond to the challenge digital technologies represent. We describe the main facets ofdigital technologies and discus the potential these have to undermine the value chains andbusiness models of established MNCs. In order to illustrate this; we employ longitudinal datafrom Telenor; a leading multinational mobile telecom company. Telenor perceivesdigitalization as a critical threat that in turn is causing a radical rethink about the viability ofits decentralized; locally responsive value chain and business model.

How Does the Context of Language Use Affect the Perception of Language Barriers?,Àngels Dasí; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Language commonality and barriers are often taken as exogenous given variableand independent of the context; however in this chapter we investigate the factorsdetermining perception of language barriers. As such we are responding to the question ofwhen do managers perceive language barriers and which business contexts foster theperception of language barriers and which do not? Language serves different purposes andentails different communicative requirements depending on the context in which it is used. Inaddition; language has multiple dimensions and we argue that the different dimensions oflanguage vary in their importance depending on the specific context; where the contextualvariation in this case is related to the operation mode chosen in the foreign market.

We will develop a discussion and provide someexamples of this in the next section of this chapter. We also believe that expectations relatingto topics; relevant literature; data collection; methods; and presentation tend to be a bitdifferent in the IB/IM literature from general management.

Network Structure; Collaborative Context; and Individual Creativity,Diego Stea; Giuseppe Soda; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Network research has yet to determine whether bonding ties or bridging ties aremore beneficial for individual creativity; but the debate has mostly overlooked theorganizational context in which such ties are formed. In particular; the causal chainconnecting network structures and individual outcomes often assumes that different networkstructures embody specific individual behaviors. This paper challenges the widespreadassumption that dense; heavily bonded network structures imply a collaborative attitude onthe part of network actors. We propose that collaboration can also be contextual andexogenous to a network's structural characteristics; such that it moderates the effects of bothdense and brokered networks on individual creativity. Specifically; we argue that knowledgeacquisition and; in turn; individual creativity are more likely when an individual's network …,Academy of Management Proceedings,2016,*

THE IMPACT or FOREIGN ACQUISITION ON THE EVOLUTION or DANISH FIRMS,Torhen Pedersen; Finn Valentin,The last decade has seen a considerable increase in cross-border acquisition of ﬁrms. Thetendency has been global; and has most recently also included Denmark.

On the basis of a study of Danish ﬁrmsacquired by foreign ﬁrms; conducted at the Copenhagen Business School; 2 this chapterattempts to analyse the business economic effects of such acquisitions. The key questions ofthe analysis are: are the competences of Danish production ﬁrms expanded; reduced or inother ways changed as a result of a foreign take—over and is the position of these ﬁrmsweakened or strengthened? The analysis focuses on two aspects: the role of the acquiredﬁrm within the multinational enterprise (MNE); and its charac-teristic competences. Both …,Towards a Competence Theory of the Firm,2013,*

In the period from 1996 to2005 80–90% of renal stones were treated with ESWL; but as the number PCNL andespecially RIRS has increased over the last 6 years; the relative number of stones treatedwith ESWL has dropped to 62%(fig. 1). During the period the number of PCNL performedhas increased slowly; and the number of RIRS performed has increased rapidly; especiallyover the last 5 years (fig. 2). The number of ESWL procedures for renal calculi has beenfairly constant except for a rise in 2010; which cannot be accounted for. The genderdistribution has been constant during the whole period; with an average male: female ratioof 61: 39 (fig. 3).

Language has many dimensions and firms' communicative requirements vary byoperational platform. We argue that different dimensions of language vary in theirimportance depending on the operation mode chosen for a foreign market; so that languagedistance matters in the case of a home-based sales force; while language incidence is keywhen operating through a local agent. The hypotheses are tested on a large data setencompassing 462 multinational corporations headquartered in Finland; South Korea; NewZealand; and Sweden that have undertaken a business operation in a foreign country.,AIB 2013 Annual Meeting,2013,*

Foreign Partners’ Disseminative Capacities and their Impact on Knowledge Transfers to International Joint Ventures,Chansoo Park; Dana Minbaeva; Ilan Vertinsky,Abstract: This paper attempts to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on the influence ofknowledge senders' willingness to share knowledge; their disseminative capacities and theknowledge-transfer opportunities they create on the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Wedevelop a theoretical framework that examines the impacts of key knowledge-senders'abilities and behaviors. We test our theory using survey data collected from 199 SouthKorean IJVs. We find that the willingness of foreign parent firms to share knowledge ismanifested in their efforts to increase their abilities to articulate and codify knowledge; and toapply those skills to the codification of knowledge relevant to their IJVs. A willingness toshare knowledge also plays a role in increasing the opportunities for two-way interactions;especially face-to-face interactions between the employees of the parents and those of …,AIB 2013 Annual Meeting,2013,*
The ambivalent effect of complexity on firm performance: The global service provider industry,Marcus M Larsen; Stephan Manning; Torben Pedersen,Abstract While complexity has usually been associated with more detrimental organizationalconsequences; there are also arguments suggesting that complexity may function as asource of competitiveness. In this paper; we investigate specific circumstances that yieldopposing effects of complexity on firm performance. Embedded in rich data on the globalservice provider industry; we find that configuration complexity is negatively related toperformance (due to rising coordination costs); while task complexity is positively related toperformance (due to information asymmetry). Besides explicating specific performancecontingencies of complexity; these results suggest that treating complexity as an aggregatevariable may lead to underspecified and even incorrect; conclusions; and that a finer-grained understanding of its effects is crucial.,Academy of Management Proceedings,2013,*

This research considers how subunits that span structuralholes within the MNE network reap private benefits in terms of innovation; as well ascontribute to the common network benefits through knowledge outflows. Acknowledging thata direct relationship between knowledge sharing and innovation exists; we use a 3SLSmodel to elucidate the various individual and simultaneous links among brokerage;innovation and knowledge outflows. In this way; we decompose some of the ways in whichbrokerage simultaneously affects knowledge outflows and innovation to map out the privateand common benefits of brokering within the MNE network.

Network Size and Prosocial Behavior: Taking Bounded Rationality Into Account,Torben Pedersen; Diego Stea,Abstract We combine structural and psychological perspectives on prosocial behaviors inorganizations. Employees are expected to be more likely to engage in prosocialorganizational behaviors if they have a large social network that gets them in contact withseveral colleagues. However; drawing on bounded rationality arguments; we argue that thiseffect depends on the focal employee's ability to focus and concentrate in the workplace;and thereby give attention to the need for prosocial action. Data from 69 employees in asingle firm suggest that the interaction between egocentric network size and attention has asignificant and positive effect on employees' engagement in prosocial organizationalbehaviors.,Academy of Management Proceedings,2013,*

The Dynamics of International Business Research: A Relational Cluster Perspective,Werner Kunz,Abstract This study examines the evolution of the field of international business (IB) researchbased on a relational cluster analysis of co-citations in the Journal of International BusinessStudies (JIBS) from 1982 to 2011. Particularly; we examine the changing role of theory inrelation to empirical IB research. Based on a factor and network analysis; we identify distinctclusters of IB research and their relations over time. We show that the initial focus of IBresearch on issues of international expansion has shifted towards issues of governance andimplementation. In this process; debates on foreign entry mode and culture have served asimportant integrating themes. At the same time; theory debates in IB have expanded from anarrow focus on explaining international expansion; to a rather heterogeneousconglomerate of approaches which have assisted increasingly differentiated empirical …,Academy of Management Proceedings,2013,*

Evaluation of Fine-Scale Road Stretch Forecasts using High Resolution Physiographic and Multi-Year Thermal Mapping Data,A Mahura; C Petersen; K Sattler; BH Sass; TS Pedersen; P Holm,The study is a part of the efforts done to improve winter maintenance and safety of roadsunder winter conditions in Denmark. This includes: economical and environmental benefitswhich can be obtained by only applying the needed dose of salt/chemicals to the roadsurface and do it with optimal timing. The Danish Road Weather Modelling System (RWMS)–composed of dense network of road conditions measurements; numerical weatherprediction model and road conditions model–delivers 24 hour forecasts 24 times each dayof road surface conditions for 22800 road stretches (located at distances of about 250meters from each other and covering 153 Danish roads). A main goal is that the quality offorecasts for all the road stretches should be comparable to the forecasts made for the roadstations.

ISS & Nordea: Facility Management in the Nordic Region,Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract: Nordea Bank had emerged as the largest financial group in the Nordic region. Aspart of its consolidated approach; Nordea's top management had made the strategicdecision to outsource a number of the company's peripheral activities; such as catering;security; and cleaning; in order to focus on the core business of banking. In Denmark;Finland; and Sweden; some services had been outsourced to one of the leaders in thefacility management (FM) market; the global service provider ISS. The relationship betweenNordea and ISS on the delivery of facility services had a long history; but a new contract wassuccessfully concluded by the end of 2010. Consequently; ISS was chosen as Nordea's FMpartner and would continually be providing Nordea with a scope of supportive servicesacross 20 locations in the Nordic region.

Whether or Not to Prepare for Offshoring: A Simulation Study,Marcus Møller Larsen; Christian Geisler Asmussen; Torben Pedersen,Abstract: A consequence of offshoring is increased coordination costs. To counter this; firmscan strive to identify a cost reducing organizational configuration either ex ante or ex post tothe offshoring implementation. In this paper; we investigate the performance implications ofthese contrasting strategies through a computational model of offshoring. We find that aproactive approach to offshoring is largely beneficial if the impact of geographic distanceand coordination costs relative to production costs is sufficiently high; but that this changesmore towards the reactive approach if this diminishes. Thus; we explicate importantcontingencies in the paradox that firms face when balancing between strategic rationalessuch as lower production costs in foreign locations and the changing costs of coordinationwhen implementing such strategic rationales.,AIB 2012 Annual Meeting,2012,*

International Specialization: A Bridge between Polar Views of Operating Flexibility and Location-Specific Commitment,Ingo Kleindienst; Christian Geisler Asmussen; Thomas Hutzschenreuter; Torben Pedersen,Abstract: Whether and how international diversification and cross-border arbitrage affectsfirm performance remains one of the major unresolved research questions in the strategyand international business literatures. We propose that knowing how much a firm hasinternationally diversified tells us very little about performance implications; if we do notknow; and do not ask; how the firm has diversified. Therefore; building on the two broadarguments of operating flexibility and location-specific commitment; we develop a theoreticalframework that focuses on the extent to which a firm's international arbitrage strategy ischaracterized by specialization versus replication and argue that these different strategiesmay have differential impact on profitability and risk reduction.

The Private and Common Benefits of Spanning Structural Holes within the MNE Network,Lisa Katarina Gärber; Torben Pedersen; Shalini Rogbeer,Abstract: It is well established that spanning structural holes creates private benefits throughinnovation. However; the extent to which other network members profit from spanningstructural holes remains unclear. This research considers how subunits that span structuralholes within the MNE network reap private benefits in terms of innovation; as well ascontribute to the common network benefits through knowledge outflows. Acknowledging thata direct relationship between knowledge sharing and innovation exists; we use a 3SLSmodel to elucidate the various individual and simultaneous links among brokerage;innovation and knowledge outflows. In this way; we decompose some of the ways in whichbrokerage simultaneously affects knowledge outflows and innovation to map out the privateand common benefits of brokering within the MNE network.

With this background; thepurpose of this paper is to report on the most important macro logistics decision factors thatdescribe environmental complexity for global/cross border logistics operations. The studyapplies a decisionmaking oriented approach in order to develop a set of macro-logisticsfactors that pose international uncertainty in cross-border flows of goods; information;payment and ownership.

Disentangling the impact of control-enhancing mechanisms on firm performance: an empirical investigation across five european countries,Alessandro Zattoni; Torben Pedersen,Governance scholars and investors traditionally advocate against the use of controlenhancing mechanisms; ie mechanisms aimed at separating voting and cash flow rights.These mechanisms may; in fact; determine a deviation from the proportionality principle andmay encourage large and controlling shareholders to expropriate minority shareholders.The aim of this article is to contribute to the current debate investigating the implications ofthese control-enhancing mechanisms on firm performance. To reach this purpose; wecollected ownership data on the (100) largest listed companies per capitalization in fiveEuropean countries (ie France; Germany; Italy; Spain; and the UK). Then we tested theconsequences of control-enhancing mechanisms for firm performance using 2SLSregression models.

N-culturals: Functional individuals with multicultural identities,Andre Anugerah Pekerti,This conceptual paper addresses the question;“Do Multicultural-Individuals exist? If so; howdo they function in work environments?” Multicultural-Individuals (N-culturals) are neitherjust bi-cultural nor third-culture individuals. They are functional individuals who successfullyfunction by maintaining more than two cultural identities and frameworks. It is proposed thatN-culturals are already operating with either an integratedadoption or integrated-contactacculturation mode; thus at least bi-cultural individuals. However; N-culturals also operatewith additional frameworks. These multiple identities and frameworks could be based onidentification; internalization; commitment and the identities' salience in relation to perceivedsituations. An individual-level metacognitive working model is proposed based on the bi-dimensional perspective of acculturation; identity and internalization of cultures.

Sosiologien og menneskerettighetene,Sverre Moe,Sociology has traditionally been critical of the idea of universal human rights. Marx;Durkheim and Weber all opposed it from quite different positions. Generally; their criticismpointed to human rights as making man into something abstract; a-historical anddecontextualized; thus representing notions contrary to questions concerning relations ofman and society that are central to sociology. Likewise; the normative and ideologicalcharacter of the rights was understood as contrary to sociology as an empirical science in itsown right. Still; the idea of human rights has continued to expand; with modern society nowreferring to the issue in numerous situations. Modern sociology therefore has to ask why therelation between man and society is expected to be ordered by granting people expandedrights and to study how this order is working.

How do we capture" Global Specialization" when measuring firms’ degree of internationalization?,Christian Geisler Asmussen; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Resume: The IB literature informs us of several ways to measure firms' degree ofinternationalization. In this paper we make the argument that in fact none of the existingindices really measure firms' degree of" global specialization"; that is; to what extent theirallocation of resources is multidomestic or global. As argued; all the existing measures maygauge a purely multidomestic firm as having a high degree of internationalization; whereasa truly global firm may be ranked low. In order to remedy this we introduce a complementaryindex measuring how firms are configuring their value chains–whether they are replicatingvalue chain activities from country to country or locating them in globally specialized units inorder to exploit an international division of labor. In addition to mathematical modeling andnumerical examples; we examine the relevance of the new index of global specialization …,*,2005,*
Closing the Knowledge Gap in Foreign Markets-A Learning Perspective,Marjorie A Lyles; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Abstract: The study explores how firms close their knowledge gaps in relation to businessenvironments of foreign markets. Potential determinants are derived from traditionalinternationalization process theory as well as more recent literature on organizationallearning processes; including the concept of absorptive capacity. Building on these twoliterature streams a conceptual model is developed and tested on a set of primary data ofDanish firms and their foreign market operations. The empirical study suggests that factorsconsidered essential in traditional internationalization process theory; such as experientiallearning; explains only a very limited part of perceived knowledge gaps. When factorspertaining to the concepts of absorptive capacity and superstitious learning are added; theexplanatory power improves significantly. Apparently; our understanding of firms' …,*,2005,*
Nye arbejdsorganisationsformer i de danske virksomheder: hvordan virker de?,Nicolai Juul Foss; Torben Pedersen,Abstract Baseret på et sample af de 1000 største danske virksomheder undersøgesforekomsten af nye arbejdsorganiseringsformer i dansk erhvervsliv (såsom decentraliseringaf beslutnings-kompetence og øget kommunikation). Endvidere undersøges det hvilkevirksomheder; der typisk implementerer de nye måder at organisere arbejdet på. Det visesat det primært er virksomheder i konkurrenceprægede og videnintensive brancher; der gørdette. De nye arbejdsorganiseringsformer implementeres i bundter. Det indikerer; at de nyeorganiseringsformer er komplementære. Deres forekomst er endelig tæt korreleret medforekomsten af resultatløn. Det tyder på; at” kontrol”-og” kommitment”-modeller forarbejdsorganisering ikke er modsatrettede; men tværtimod komplementære.,Ledelse & Erhvervsøkonomi,2005,*

Steen Thomsen,Torben Pedersen,Abstract We use Granger-tests to examine the causal relationship between blockholderownership and value of the largest EU and US companies. Previous studies on US datahave found no systematic effect; but we propose that these results may not carry over tocontinental Europe; where ownership concentration is higher; the level of investor protectionis lower; and influential blockholders may have other objectives than shareholder value. Inaccordance with previous research; we find no significant causal effects either way in theUS/UK. But in continental Europe we find a negative effect of blockholder ownership on firmvalue. Further analysis reveals that this effect is significant only for companies with highinitial levels of blockholder ownership (> 10%). We interpret this as evidence that ownershipconcentration in continental Europe may be too high from a minority shareholder value …,*,2003,*

Torben Pedersen,Steen Thomsen,Resume: The causal relationship between insider ownership and market valuation is testedby simultaneous estimation of the causes and effect of insider ownership among the largestcontinental European companies. Controlling for nation and industry effects insiderownership (measured by the fraction of" closely held" shares) is found to have a positiveeffect on market valuation (market-to-book values). And market valuation is found to have apositive feedback effect on the level of insider ownership. The findings provide empiricalsupport for a theoretical model proposed by La Porta et al (1999). But the results are alsofound to be sensitive to owner identity: while a higher level of financial and corporate insiderownership is found to increase market valuation; family ownership has no significant effect;and a higher level of government ownership is found to reduce market valuation.,*,2000,*

We find thatdespite low survival rates; on balance the entrants gained market share (in terms of theassets of the banking system) over time. Our results for the role of time; links to the homemarket and problems facing domestic competitors were strongly in accordance withexpectations in the cases of Denmark; mixed or indeterminate for Finland and Norway; andstrongly opposite in the case of Sweden. Lastly; our results are broadly consistent with theStiglitz-Weiss argument that new entrants; in this case foreign banks; buy entry by acceptingworse lending risks.,*,1999,*

En fortolkning af den strategiske betydning af den moderne diskurs om bevaring af biologisk mangfoldighed,Thomas Nicolai Pedersen,Et af de væsentligste aspekter ved miljøpolitikken siden" Rio-Konferencen" i 1992 er; atdiskussionen om ansvaret for bl. a. forvaltning af biologisk mangfoldighed er blevetinstitutionaliseret i statslige og mellemstatslige organisationer.

Clinical application of lens autofluorescence.,P Kofoed; M Larsen; T Hansen; T Pedersen; H Lund-Andersen,Background and purpose: A likely explanation for the increase in lens fluorescence withaging and the acceleration of this process in patients with diabetes; is that lens proteins arealtered by non-enzymatic glycosylation and the further steps of the Maillard reaction. Thus;the lens fluorescence intensity appears to represent a cumulative index of glycemia over theentire lifetime of the subject. Together with the gradual onset of hyperglycemia in non-insulindependent diabetes (NIDDM); which usually precedes the clinical detection of the diseaseby several years; this implies that patients with newly detected NIDDM should haveincreased lens fluorescence. We have investigated this theory on 14 patients with newlydetected NIDDM and 11 age-matched healthy subjects with normal glucose tolerance.Results: Lens fluorescense in 11 of the 14 diabetic patients where higher than the age …,Vision Research,1995,*

Calcium blood changes in septic conditions. A review,S Vadstrup; TF Pedersen,Abstract Hypocalcemia has been reported in critically ill patients over the last 10-15 years;however; measurements of Ca2+ in blood have not yet became routine in the treatment ofseverely ill patients. In order to stress the importance of calcium in such patients; a review ofcalcium changes in septic conditions is presented. In vitro studies show that the intracellularcalcium metabolism is disturbed in these patients; and that the changes in extracellularcalcium are probably secondary to the intracellular changes. Parathyroid hormone secretionis inappropriate in septic patients. The reason for this is unknown. Administration of calciumparenterally does not seem to affect the prognosis; however calcium seems to be beneficialin patients with hypotension. Since the level of Ca2+ in blood may have prognosticsignificance in septic patients; measurements of Ca2+ in blood should be used routinely …,*,1993,*

Export Channel Dynamics: An Empirical Investigation,Gabriel Garcia Benito; Torben Pedersen; Björn Preuss,Abstract We investigate the dynamics of export channel arrangements by modelling foreignoperation method decisions as the interplay between factors that motivate switches andfactors that deter them. Our model extends previous analyses by looking simultaneously at(1) no change of channel arrangement;(2) replacements of foreign intermediaries (within-mode shifts); and (3) integration of the sales function abroad (between-mode shifts). We usea multinomial logit model on longitudinal data from a sample of Danish exporters that hadentered foreign markets through intermediaries. The results suggest that the decision tocarry out within-mode shifts (ie to replace an existing intermediary) is driven by a different setof factors than the decision to switch to another foreign operation mode (ie to in-houseoperations).,*,*,*

Business systems and corporate governance O PEN A RCHIVE,Torben Pedersen; Steen Thomsen,Abstract: The paper tests the applicability of Whitley's business systems framework to thestudy of international differences in corporate ownership structure. In support of Whitley'sframework we document the existence of large differences among the largest companies in12 European nations. Furthermore we find that these differences can be partly attributed tothe institutional determinants stressed by Whitley: structure of the financial system;government regulation and labour relations. However; we also find evidence ofmicroeconomic effects attributable to firm size and industry structure which cut acrossnational borders and which influence cross country variations in ownership structure. Weconclude that ownership structures are influenced by both economic and system effects.,*,*,*
Organizational Learning in Foreign Markets,Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Resume: This empirical study addresses the question of how foreign market unfamiliarity ofentrant firms develops post-entry. Three different predictions of post-entry change of foreignmarket unfamiliarity are derived from the literature on firms' internationalization process. Thepredictions are made subject to empirical examination using a set of primary data of current(ie at the point in time of mail interviews) foreign operation business operations reported bymanagers of Danish international firms. The empirical study gives insight to the incidenceand character of the so-called 'shock effect'in relation to foreign market entry: thephenomenon of entrant firms' inclination to underestimate differences between the homeand host country in terms of the business environment. The data support the supposition thatentrant firms in general are exposed to a 'shock effect'. On average; the foreign market …,*,*,*

In this article; the Uppsala model is tested onDanish empirical material. The Danish firms largely follow a sequential development asregards the geographical dimension; where; typically; they set up in culturally close marketsfirst and later set up in the more distant markets. On the other hand; the firms seem to followto a less extent a pattern of sequential expansion of market commitment on the singleforeign markets; just as a surprising number of establishments are set up without previousactivity on the market. Crucial differences cannot be found between the establishmentpattern abroad of large and small firms. The Uppsala model in itself cannot explain theinternationalization pattern of the Danish firms; which is why the article advocates that the …,*,*,*

Internal Versus External Knowledge Sourcing Of Subsidiaries,Jens Gammelgaard; Torben Pedersen,Resume: When building up competences; a subsidiary of a multinational corporation (MNC)may rely on external knowledge sources like customers; suppliers; competitors or localscience centers. Internal sourcing is also available through knowledge offered byheadquarters or other affiliates. The question is whether the two kinds of sources are mutualexclusive. A dilemma or organizational trade-off is foreseeable; since the more thesubsidiary adapts its knowledge creation processes to host country institutions; the less itwill be able to utilize internal knowledge sources due to the institutional distance betweenthe external and internal networks. However; newer organizational forms; like the concept ofthe" differentiated MNC"; imply a relatively smooth flow of knowledge inside the MNC;indicating that we should not expect an organizational trade-off between internal and …,*,*,*
Danske virksomheders internationaliseringsproces,Torben Pedersen,Resumé Den svenske lnternationaliseringsmodel har haft stor indflydelse på den nordiskeforskning i virksomhedernes internationaliseringsproces. I denne artikel bliver Uppsala-modellen testet på et dansk empirisk materiale. De danske virksomheder følger i vidudstrækning en sekventiel udvikling med hensyn til den geografiske dimension; hvor detypisk først etablerer sig på de miljønære markeder og senere etablerer sig på de fjerneremarkeder. Virksomhederne synes derimod i mindre grad at følge et mønster med sekventieludbygning af markedsengagementet på de enkelte udenlandske markeder; ligesom der eroverraskende mange etableringer; der oprettes uden forudgående aktivitet på markedet.Der kan heller ikke konstateres afgørende forskelle mellem store og små virksomhedersetableringsmønster i udlandet. Uppsala-modellen kan ikke i sig selv forklare de danske …,Ledelse og Erhvervsøkonomi,*,*

Knowledge Gaps,Marjorie Lyles; Torben Pedersen; Bent Petersen,Resume: The study explores what factors influence the reduction of managers' perceivedknowledge gaps in the context of the environments of foreign markets. Potentialdeterminants are derived from traditional internationalization theory as well asorganizational learning theory; including the concept of absorptive capacity. Building onthese literature streams a conceptual model is developed and tested on a set of primary dataof Danish firms and their foreign market operations. The empirical study suggests that thefactors that pertain to the absorptive capacity concept–capabilities of recognizing;assimilating; and utilizing knowledge-are crucial determinants of knowledge gapelimination. In contrast; the two factors deemed essential in traditional internationalizationprocess theory–elapsed time of operations and experiential learning–are found to have …,*,*,*
Virksomhedens viden og virksomhedens grænser: illustreret ved en Case,Nicolai J Foss; Torben Pedersen,Resumé Blandt de økonomiske teorier om virksomheden er det særligt værd at hæfte sigved kontraktsperspektivet; som bygger på Coases og Williamsons arbejder; og detkundskabsbaserede perspektiv; som blandt andet bygger på Edith Penrose. Perspektiverneomhandler henholdsvis virksomhedens grænser og virksomhedens vidensbase. Artiklenargumenterer for; at disse to perspektiver er forenelige; og illustrerer dette med RockwoolInternational AIS som case. Det betyder; at en mere tilfredsstillende erhvervsøkonomisk teoriom virksomheden; en teori der omfatter begge perspektiver; er indenfor rækkevidde.,Ledelse og Erhvervsøkonomi,*,*
