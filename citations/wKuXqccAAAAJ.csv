Temperature; growth rate; and body size in ectotherms: fitting pieces of a life-history puzzle,Michael J Angilletta Jr; Todd D Steury; Michael W Sears,Abstract The majority of ectotherms grow slower but mature at a larger body size in colderenvironments. This phenomenon has puzzled biologists because classic theories of life-history evolution predict smaller sizes at maturity in environments that retard growth. Duringthe last decade; intensive theoretical and empirical research has generated some plausibleexplanations based on nonadaptive or adaptive plasticity. Nonadaptive plasticity of bodysize is hypothesized to result from thermal constraints on cellular growth that cause smallercells at higher temperatures; but the generality of this theory is poorly supported. Adaptiveplasticity is hypothesized to result from greater benefits or lesser costs of delayed maturationin colder environments. These theories seem to apply well to some species but not others.Thus; no single theory has been able to explain the generality of temperature-size …,Integrative and comparative biology,2004,528
Riding the wave: reconciling the roles of disease and climate change in amphibian declines,Karen R Lips; Jay Diffendorfer; Joseph R Mendelson III; Michael W Sears,We review the evidence for the role of climate change in triggering disease outbreaks ofchytridiomycosis; an emerging infectious disease of amphibians. Both climatic anomaliesand disease-related extirpations are recent phenomena; and effects of both are especiallynoticeable at high elevations in tropical areas; making it difficult to determine whether theyare operating separately or synergistically. We compiled reports of amphibian declines fromLower Central America and Andean South America to create maps and statistical models totest our hypothesis of spatiotemporal spread of the pathogen Batrachochytriumdendrobatidis (Bd); and to update the elevational patterns of decline in frogs belonging tothe genus Atelopus. We evaluated claims of climate change influencing the spread of Bd byincluding error into estimates of the relationship between air temperature and last year …,PLoS biology,2008,452
Can mechanism inform species’ distribution models?,Lauren B Buckley; Mark C Urban; Michael J Angilletta; Lisa G Crozier; Leslie J Rissler; Michael W Sears,Abstract Two major approaches address the need to predict species distributions inresponse to environmental changes. Correlative models estimate parametersphenomenologically by relating current distributions to environmental conditions. Bycontrast; mechanistic models incorporate explicit relationships between environmentalconditions and organismal performance; estimated independently of current distributions.Mechanistic approaches include models that translate environmental conditions intobiologically relevant metrics (eg potential duration of activity); models that captureenvironmental sensitivities of survivorship and fecundity; and models that use energetics tolink environmental conditions and demography. We compared how two correlative and threemechanistic models predicted the ranges of two species: a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes …,Ecology letters,2010,334
The world is not flat: defining relevant thermal landscapes in the context of climate change,Michael W Sears; Evan Raskin; Michael J Angilletta Jr,Abstract Although climates are rapidly changing on a global scale; these changes cannoteasily be extrapolated to the local scales experienced by organisms. In fact; suchgeneralizations might be quite problematic. For instance; models used to predict shifts in theranges of species during climate change rarely incorporate data resolved to< 1 km2;although most organisms integrate climatic drivers at much smaller scales. Empirical studiesalone suggest that the operative temperatures of many organisms vary by as much as 10–20° C on a local scale; depending on vegetation; geology; and topography. Furthermore;this variation in abiotic factors ignores thermoregulatory behaviors that many animals use tobalance heat loads. Through a set of simulations; we demonstrate how variability inelevational topography can attenuate the effects of warming climates. These simulations …,Integrative and Comparative Biology,2011,119
Predicting the physiological performance of ectotherms in fluctuating thermal environments,Amanda C Niehaus; Michael J Angilletta; Michael W Sears; Craig E Franklin; Robbie S Wilson,SUMMARY Physiological ecologists have long sought to understand the plasticity oforganisms in environments that vary widely among years; seasons and even hours. This isnow even more important because human-induced climate change is predicted to affectboth the mean and variability of the thermal environment. Although environmental changeoccurs ubiquitously; relatively few researchers have studied the effects of fluctuatingenvironments on the performance of developing organisms. Even fewer have tried tovalidate a framework for predicting performance in fluctuating environments. Here; wedetermined whether reaction norms based on performance at constant temperatures (18; 22;26; 30 and 34° C) could be used to predict embryonic and larval performance of anurans atfluctuating temperatures (18–28° C and 18–34° C). Based on existing theory; we …,Journal of Experimental Biology,2012,116
Body size clines in Sceloporus lizards: proximate mechanisms and demographic constraints,Michael W Sears; Michael J Angilletta Jr,Abstract Although most species of animals examined to date exhibit Bergmann's clines inbody size; squamates tend to exhibit opposing patterns. Squamates might exhibit reversedBergmann's clines because they tend to behaviorally regulate their body temperatureeffectively; the outcome of this thermoregulation is that warmer environments enable longerdaily and annual durations of activity than cooler environments. Lizards of the genusSceloporus provide an opportunity to understand the factors that give rise to contrastingthermal clines in body size because S. undulatus exhibits a standard Bergmann's clinewhereas S. graciosus exhibits a reverse Bergmann's cline. Interestingly; rapid growth byindividuals of both species involves adjustments of physiological processes that enablemore efficient use of food. Patterns of adult body size are likely the evolutionary …,Integrative and Comparative Biology,2004,87
Urban physiology: city ants possess high heat tolerance,Michael J Angilletta Jr; Robbie S Wilson; Amanda C Niehaus; Michael W Sears; Carlos A Navas; Pedro L Ribeiro,Urbanization has caused regional increases in temperature that exceed those measured ona global scale; leading to urban heat islands as much as 12° C hotter than theirsurroundings. Optimality models predict ectotherms in urban areas should tolerate heatbetter and cold worse than ectotherms in rural areas. We tested these predications bymeasuring heat and cold tolerances of leaf-cutter ants from South America's largest city (SãoPaulo; Brazil). Specifically; we compared thermal tolerances of ants from inside and outsideof the city. Knock-down resistance and chill-coma recovery were used as indicators of heatand cold tolerances; respectively. Ants from within the city took 20% longer to lose mobility at42° C than ants from outside the city. Interestingly; greater heat tolerance came at noobvious expense of cold tolerance; hence; our observations only partially support current …,PLoS One,2007,79

Geographic variation in the life history of the sagebrush lizard: the role of thermal constraints on activity,Michael W Sears,Abstract Thermal constraints on the time available for activity have been proposed as aproximate mechanism to explain variation in suites of life history traits. The longer that anectotherm can maintain activity; the more time it has to forage and the greater chance that itwill encounter a predator and be eaten. Thus; the thermal environment may produce a tradeoff between growth and survival when variation in the environment favors increased activity.I used mark-recapture data from a demographic study of three natural populations of thesagebrush lizard (Sceloporus graciosus) and estimates of thermal opportunity for eachpopulation to evaluate whether variation in the thermal environment can explain patterns ofgrowth and survival that occur over an elevational gradient. Lizards from the highestelevation population exhibited higher individual growth rates than those of lizards from …,Oecologia,2005,73
Spatial dynamics of nesting behavior: lizards shift microhabitats to construct nests with beneficial thermal properties,Michael J Angilletta; Michael W Sears; Robert M Pringle,Abstract Because temperature affects the growth; development; and survival of embryos;oviparous mothers should discriminate carefully among available nesting sites. Wecombined a radiotelemetric study of animal movements with a spatial mapping ofenvironmental temperatures to test predictions about the nesting behavior of the easternfence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Females made large excursions from their typical homeranges to construct nests in exposed substrates. These excursions appeared to be relatedsolely to nesting because all females returned to forested habitat immediately afterward. Onaverage;< 1%(range= 0–8%; n= 19) of the area used by a female during nesting wascontained within the area used before and after nesting. The selection of nesting sitesmatched predictions based on laboratory studies of embryonic performance; specifically …,Ecology,2009,71
Widespread rapid reductions in body size of adult salamanders in response to climate change,Nicholas M Caruso; Michael W Sears; Dean C Adams; Karen R Lips,Abstract Reduction in body size is a major response to climate change; yet evidence inglobally imperiled amphibians is lacking. Shifts in average population body size couldindicate either plasticity in the growth response to changing climates through changes inallocation and energetics; or through selection for decreased size where energy is limiting.We compared historic and contemporary size measurements in 15 Plethodon species from102 populations (9450 individuals) and found that six species exhibited significantreductions in body size over 55 years. Biophysical models; accounting for actual changes inmoisture and air temperature over that period; showed a 7.1–7.9% increase in metabolicexpenditure at three latitudes but showed no change in annual duration of activity. Reducedsize was greatest at southern latitudes in regions experiencing the greatest drying and …,Global Change Biology,2014,69
Costs and benefits of thermoregulation revisited: both the heterogeneity and spatial structure of temperature drive energetic costs,Michael W Sears; Michael J Angilletta Jr,Abstract In recent years; ecologists have stepped up to address the challenges imposed byrapidly changing climates. Some researchers have developed niche-based methods topredict how species will shift their ranges. Such methods have evolved rapidly; resulting inmodels that incorporate physiological and behavioral mechanisms. Despite theirsophistication; these models fail to account for environmental heterogeneity at the scale ofan organism. We used an individual-based model to quantify the effects of operativeenvironmental temperatures; as well as their heterogeneity and spatial structure; on thethermoregulation; movement; and energetics of ectotherms. Our simulations showed that theheterogeneity and spatial structure of a thermal landscape are as important as its meantemperature. In fact; temperature and heterogeneity interact to determine organismal …,The American Naturalist,2015,65
Genetic variances and covariances of aerobic metabolic rates in laboratory mice,Bernard Wone; Michael W Sears; Marta K Labocha; Edward R Donovan; Jack P Hayes,The genetic variances and covariances of traits must be known to predict how they mayrespond to selection and how covariances among them might affect their evolutionarytrajectories. We used the animal model to estimate the genetic variances and covariances ofbasal metabolic rate (BMR) and maximal metabolic rate (MMR) in a geneticallyheterogeneous stock of laboratory mice. Narrow-sense heritability (h 2) was approximately0.38±0.08 for body mass; 0.26±0.08 for whole-animal BMR; 0.24±0.07 for whole-animalMMR; 0.19±0.07 for mass-independent BMR; and 0.16±0.06 for mass-independent MMR.All h 2 estimates were significantly different from zero. The phenotypic correlation of wholeanimal BMR and MMR was 0.56±0.02; and the corresponding genetic correlation was0.79±0.12.

LIFE‐HISTORY VARIATION IN THE SAGEBRUSH LIZARD: PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY OR LOCAL ADAPTATION?,Michael W Sears; Michael J Angilletta,Abstract We performed a laboratory common-environment study to determine the geneticand environmental sources of variation in growth rates of the sagebrush lizard (Sceloporusgraciosus). Hatchling lizards were reared from gravid females collected from three studypopulations along an elevational gradient in southern Utah; USA. Hatchlings were fed adlibidum and were maintained on a 14: 10 light: dark cycle; with temperatures at 33 C and 21C during photophase and scotophase; respectively. Each hatchling was randomly assignedto either a water-supplementation treatment or a control group receiving no supplementalwater. Once every five days; the water-supplemented lizards were administered orally aquantity of water equal to 5% of their body mass. Growth was quantified as the total changein body size (length and mass) for 30 d after hatching. Resting metabolic rates of a subset …,Ecology,2003,50
Resting metabolic expenditure as a potential source of variation in growth rates of the sagebrush lizard,Michael W Sears,Abstract Along an elevational gradient on SW Utah; sagebrush lizards (Sceloporusgraciosus) exhibit an unexpected pattern of growth. Lizards from a high elevation populationgrow faster than lizards from two populations at lower elevations despite shorter daily andseasonal activity. Results from a common environment study of growth suggest that thedifferences in growth are not due to adaptation to local environmental conditions. In thisstudy; I test the hypothesis that higher growth rates in lizards from high elevation may beattributable to reduced resting metabolic expenditure compared to that of lizards frompopulations at two lower elevations. Resting metabolic rates were measured for individualsfrom each of the study populations across different times of day and over a broad range oftemperatures. Under the same laboratory conditions; field-caught lizards from the high …,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology,2005,42
Coordinating theoretical and empirical efforts to understand the linkages between organisms and environments,Michael J Angilletta Jr; Michael W Sears,Abstract Schwenk and colleagues challenged biologists to develop a deeper understandingof the linkages between organisms and environments. These linkages are captured by theconcept of the niche; which has guided theoretical and empirical research in ecology fordecades. Despite this research; we still cannot explain or predict much of the variation inniches over space and time. This shortcoming hinders efforts to forecast biologicalresponses to environmental change. We believe that progress has been slowed by poorcoordination between theoretical and empirical efforts to understand the evolution of niches.Therefore; progress should be sped by research programs that integrate modeling andexperiments. Such research programs should focus on the structures of environmentalvariation; the constraints on phenotypes; and the relationships between phenotypes and …,Integrative and Comparative Biology,2011,40
Individual variation in thermogenic capacity affects above‐ground activity of high‐altitude deer mice,MW Sears; JP Hayes; CS O'connor; K Geluso; JS Sedinger,1Understanding an animal's ecology requires knowledge of how individual variation in behaviourand physiology interact with each other and with the environment that an animalexperiences … 2Environmental variation affects behaviour; but whether individual variationin physiological performance also affects behaviour is poorly known … 3We studied ahigh-altitude population of Deer Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) inhabiting an environment coldenough that above-ground activity (behaviour) may be limited by the thermogenic capacity (maximalrate of oxygen consumption [Vo 2 max ] during cold exposure) of mice … 4We measured thermogeniccapacity and operative environmental temperature (an integrated measure of the thermalenvironment); and then used robust-design capture–mark–recapture (CMR) models to test whetherthe thermal environmental and individual variation in thermogenic capacity affected …,Functional Ecology,2006,32
Out in the cold: physiological capacity influences behaviour in deer mice,Michael W Sears; Jack P Hayes; Marilyn R Banta; Donna McCormick,Summary 1 Understanding the links between physiological performance and fitness is key topredicting the responses of individuals to environmental change; especially that imposed byclimate. Of particular interest are traits linked with metabolic performance. In particular;maximal metabolic rate (MMR; which describes the upper limit to heat production) and basalmetabolic rate (BMR; which describes the lower limit to heat production for a normothermicendotherm) are important causal mechanisms that determine the physiological limits foractivity under cold conditions.,Functional ecology,2009,27
Is parental care the key to understanding endothermy in birds and mammals?,Michael J Angilletta; Jr; Michael W Sears,In a recent paper; Farmer (2000) offered a novel and stimulating hypothesis for theconvergent evolution of endothermy in birds and mammals. She proposed that a high levelof nonshivering thermogenesis by adults evolved because of the benefits it provided to theirdeveloping embryos. Initially; a higher standard metabolic rate (SMR); and consequently ahigher body temperature; served only to increase the temperature of embryos duringdevelopment. Later; increased aerobic capacity arose from the need to meet the energeticdemands of parental care. Importantly; Farmer's model of the evolution of endothermy; whichwe will refer to as the “parental care model;” and the long-standing aerobic capacity model(Bennett and Ruben 1979) are mutually exclusive. The aerobic capacity model asserts thatendothermy evolved via a correlated response to selection for a greater capacity for …,The American Naturalist,2003,27
Configuration of the thermal landscape determines thermoregulatory performance of ectotherms,Michael W Sears; Michael J Angilletta; Matthew S Schuler; Jason Borchert; Katherine F Dilliplane; Monica Stegman; Travis W Rusch; William A Mitchell,Abstract Although most organisms thermoregulate behaviorally; biologists still cannot easilypredict whether mobile animals will thermoregulate in natural environments. Current modelsfail because they ignore how the spatial distribution of thermal resources constrainsthermoregulatory performance over space and time. To overcome this limitation; wemodeled the spatially explicit movements of animals constrained by access to thermalresources. Our models predict that ectotherms thermoregulate more accurately whenthermal resources are dispersed throughout space than when these resources are clumped.This prediction was supported by thermoregulatory behaviors of lizards in outdoor arenaswith known distributions of environmental temperatures. Further; simulations showed howthe spatial structure of the landscape qualitatively affects responses of animals to climate …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2016,24
Thermal adaptation of maternal and embryonic phenotypes in a geographically widespread ectotherm,Michael J Angilletta Jr; Christopher E Oufiero; Michael W Sears,Abstract Current theories predict the thermal adaptation of both maternal and embryonicphenotypes such that the fitness of the entire life cycle is maximized. Our studies of theeastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) have generated evidence that maternal andembryonic phenotypes are designed to promote growth and development in coldenvironments. Females in colder environments allocate more energy per egg enablingoffspring to grow faster and reach a larger size at hatching. Females in cold environmentsalso nest exclusively in warm; open sites that maximize rates of embryonic growth anddevelopment; although this behavior involves risky migrations. Likewise; thermal adaptationof embryonic physiology also promotes growth and development in cold environments.When incubated in the laboratory under shared environmental conditions; embryos from …,International Congress Series,2004,23
Isopods failed to acclimate their thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance during predictable or stochastic cooling,Matthew S Schuler; Brandon S Cooper; Jonathan J Storm; Michael W Sears; Michael J Angilletta Jr,Most organisms experience environments that vary continuously over time; yet researchersgenerally study phenotypic responses to abrupt and sustained changes in environmentalconditions. Gradual environmental changes; whether predictable or stochastic; might affectorganisms differently than do abrupt changes. To explore this possibility; we exposedterrestrial isopods (Porcellio scaber) collected from a highly seasonal environment to fourthermal treatments:(1) a constant 20° C;(2) a constant 10° C;(3) a steady decline from 20° to10° C; and (4) a stochastic decline from 20° to 10° C that mimicked natural conditions duringautumn. After 45 days; we measured thermal sensitivities of running speed and thermaltolerances (critical thermal maximum and chill-coma recovery time). Contrary to ourexpectation; thermal treatments did not affect the thermal sensitivity of locomotion; …,PLoS One,2011,22
Evolution of thermal reaction norms for growth rate and body size in ectotherms: an introduction to the symposium,Michael J Angilletta Jr; Michael W Sears,Although the size of an organism is influenced by many features of its environment; therelationship between temperature and body size has captivated generations of biologists.From the renowned observations by Bergmann (1847) to the phylogenetic comparativestudies by our contemporaries (eg; Ashton et al.; 2000); evidence of a widespreadrelationship between temperature and adult body size has been offered repeatedly forvarious groups of animals. This relationship; which has come to be known as Bergmann'srule; is an increase in the body size of a species with a decrease in environmentaltemperature. Bergmann's rule was inspired initially by endotherms; but numerous species ofectotherms also exhibit Bergmann's clines in body size (de Queiroz and Ashton; 2004).Furthermore; lab studies have shown that a higher temperature during ontogeny …,Integrative and Comparative Biology,2004,20
Introduction to the symposium: responses of organisms to climate change: a synthetic approach to the role of thermal adaptation,Michael W Sears; Michael J Angilletta Jr,Abstract On a global scale; changing climates are affecting ecological systems acrossmultiple levels of biological organization. Moreover; climates are changing at ratesunprecedented in recent geological history. Thus; one of the most pressing concerns of themodern era is to understand the biological responses to climate such that society can bothadapt and implement measures that attempt to offset the negative impacts of a rapidlychanging climate. One crucial question; to understand organismal responses to climate; iswhether the ability of organisms to adapt can keep pace with quickly changingenvironments. To address this question; a syntheses of knowledge from a broad set ofbiological disciplines will be needed that integrates information from the fields of ecology;behavior; physiology; genetics; and evolution.

Seasonal variation in reproductive effort and its effect on offspring size in the lizard Sceloporus undulatus,Michael J Angilletta Jr; Michael W Sears; R Scott Winters,Fence lizards; Sceloporus undulatus; reproduce multiple times per year. Survival ofreproducing females drops dramatically between clutches from first to final clutch of the year.Also; offspring from later clutches emerge with less time available for growth and storageprior to hibernation. Considering these two facts; life history theory predicts that (1) femalesshould exhibit greater reproductive effort (RE) in the second clutch of the active season thanin the first; and (2) that the increase in RE should be mediated by a greater allocation ofenergy per offspring. To test these hypotheses; we compared reproductive traits (RE; clutchsize; and egg mass) of lizards from a New Jersey population laying their first and secondclutches. Two different estimates of RE (relative clutch mass; and clutch mass adjusted forcondition) were significantly lower for the second clutch than for the first clutch. The …,Herpetologica,2001,17
Fine-scale microclimatic variation can shape the responses of organisms to global change in both natural and urban environments,Sylvain Pincebourde; Courtney C Murdock; Mathew Vickers; Michael W Sears,Abstract When predicting the response of organisms to global change; models usemeasures of climate at a coarse resolution from general circulation models or fromdownscaled regional models. Organisms; however; do not experience climate at such largescales. The climate heterogeneity over a landscape and how much of that landscape anorganism can sample will determine ultimately the microclimates experienced by organisms.This past few decades has seen an important increase in the number of studies reportingmicroclimatic patterns at small scales. This synthesis intends to unify studies reportingmicroclimatic heterogeneity (mostly temperature) at various spatial scales; to infer anyemerging trends; and to discuss the causes and consequences of such heterogeneity fororganismal performance and with respect to changing land use patterns and climate.

Geographic variation of resistance to water loss within two species of lungless salamanders: implications for activity,Eric A Riddell; Michael W Sears,Abstract For many organisms; constraints on activity increase energetic costs; whichultimately reduce the suitability of a particular habitat. Mechanistic species distributionmodels often use estimates of activity to predict how organisms will respond to climatechange. These models couple physiology and morphology with climatic data to estimatepotential activity. In turn; the duration of activity is used to estimate the energetic balance ofindividuals at a given location. Whether individuals remain in positive net energetic balancedetermines if a given location is suitable for the species. However; because these modelsoften assume that physiology does not vary across the species range; estimates of activity(and consequently energetics) are potentially misleading. To test the consequence of thisassumption; we measured total resistance to water loss (R) within two species of lungless …,Ecosphere,2015,14
A strong response to selection on mass-independent maximal metabolic rate without a correlated response in basal metabolic rate,Bernard WM Wone; Peter Madsen; Edward R Donovan; Marta K Labocha; Michael W Sears; Cynthia J Downs; Daniel A Sorensen; Jack P Hayes,Abstract Metabolic rates are correlated with many aspects of ecology; but how selection ondifferent aspects of metabolic rates affects their mutual evolution is poorly understood. Usinglaboratory mice; we artificially selected for high maximal mass-independent metabolic rate(MMR) without direct selection on mass-independent basal metabolic rate (BMR). Then wetested for responses to selection in MMR and correlated responses to selection in BMR. Inother lines; we antagonistically selected for mice with a combination of high mass-independent MMR and low mass-independent BMR. All selection protocols and dataanalyses included body mass as a covariate; so effects of selection on the metabolic ratesare mass adjusted (that is; independent of effects of body mass). The selection lasted eightgenerations. Compared with controls; MMR was significantly higher (11.2%) in lines …,Heredity,2015,11
Food consumption does not affect the preferred body temperature of Yarrow's spiny lizard (Sceloporus jarrovi),Matthew S Schuler; Michael W Sears; Michael J Angilletta,Abstract When animals consume less food; they must reduce their body temperature tomaximize growth. However; high temperatures enhance locomotion and other performancesthat determine survival and reproduction. Therefore; thermoregulatory behaviors duringdifferent metabolic states reveal the relative importance of conserving energy and sustainingperformance. Using artificial thermal gradients; we measured preferred body temperaturesof male spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovi) in fed and fasted states. Both the mean andmaximal body temperatures (33° and 35° C; respectively) were unaffected by metabolicstate. This finding suggests that the benefits of foraging effectively; evading predators; anddefending territory outweigh the energetic cost of a high body temperature during fasting.,Journal of Thermal Biology,2011,11
Physical calculations of resistance to water loss improve predictions of species range models,Eric A Riddell; Evan K Apanovitch; Jonathan P Odom; Michael W Sears,Abstract Species ranges are constrained by the physiological tolerances of organisms toclimatic conditions. By incorporating physiological constraints; species distribution modelscan identify how biotic and abiotic factors constrain a species' geographic range. Rates ofwater loss influence species distributions; but characterizing water loss for an individualrequires complex calculations. Skin resistance to water loss (ri) is considered to be the mostinformative metric of water loss rates because it controls for experimental biases. However;calculating ri requires biophysical equations to solve for the resistance of the air thatsurrounds an organism; termed the boundary layer resistance (rb). Here; we comparedtheoretical and empirical methods for measuring skin resistance to water loss of a Plethodonsalamander collected from nature. For the empirical methods; we measured rb of agar …,Ecological monographs,2017,9
High-resolution niche models via a correlative approach: Comparing and combining correlative and process-based information,Victor Bogosian III; Eric C Hellgren; Michael W Sears; Raymond W Moody,Abstract Correlative and process-based approaches to describing the ecological niche in aspatially explicit fashion have often been compared in an adversarial framework. We soughtto compare niche models developed via classic (correlative only); niche (process-basedinformation); and hybridized (correlative augmented with process-based derivedinformation) approaches; with the goal of determining if the added effort of process-basedmodel development yielded better model fit. Correlative data layers (ie; habitat models)included vegetation community types; Euclidean distance statistics; neighborhood analyses;and topographically-derived information. Mechanistic data layers were estimates of thermalsuitability derived from field-collected datasets and biophysical calculations; and estimatesof prey biomass interpolated from monitoring stations.

Evaluating the costs of thermoregulation: simulating animal movements through spatially-structured environments define cost curves for small lizards,Michael W Sears; Michael J Angilletta,Abstract. Quantifying the costs of thermoregulation is a difficult task because the spatialcomplexity of the thermal environment largely determines the magnitude of such costs.Because we know little about the spatial configuration of environmental temperatures innature; much insight can be gained from simulating thermoregulatory behavior in silico.Previous simulations of movement through spatiallystructured environments revealed thatthe configuration of environ mental temperatures influences the accuracy ofthermoregulation; even when the frequencies of environmental temperatures remainedconstant. Using a similar approach; we modeled the cost of thermoregulation under specificconfigurations of environmental temperatures. Individuals were given thermal preferencesand biophysical properties similar to those of small lizards. These virtual lizards were then …,Integrative and Comparative Biology,2007,6
Interdune dispersal of sand dune lizards (Sceloporus arenicolus) in the Mescalero Sands Ecosystem,Lee A Fitzgerald; Michael W Sears; Charles W Painter,Previous research on Sceloporus arenicolus; the Sand Dune Lizard; demonstrated theselizards are restricted to shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) sand dunes with active dunecomplexes (Mescalero Sands ecosystem). Anthropogenic habitat disturbance; specificallystabilizing dunes through shinnery oak removal and oil and gas development; wereassociated with a significant reduction in the numbers of Sand Dune Lizards (Painter et al.1999). The geographic range and distribution of the species was documented in great detailin New Mexico; and it was realized the distribution of S. areaicolus is small and composed ofoccupied and unoccupied areas of potential and suitable habitat (Fitzgerald et al. 1997).

Physical calculations of resistance to water loss improve species range models: reply,Eric A Riddell; Michael W Sears,Christian et al.(2017) proposed several possible flaws in the methods and logic presentedby Riddell et al.(2017) that included potential activity of salamanders during measurements;trimming of the agar model's legs; misinterpretations of the empirical data; limitations onagar models; and the relationship between body size and skin resistance to water loss (ri).We argue that these criticisms are easily addressable; and here; we reinforce our originalclaim that the agar method for determination of resistance to water loss is flawed. Beforeresponding to these individual critiques; we begin with a deeper criticism of the agar modelmethod and general methodology for determining resistance to water loss that has resultedin the reification of the boundary layer's ecological and physiological importance.

Moistened seeds increase rodent trap success,John C Tull; Michael W Sears,Abstract Seed moisture has been shown to influence the rates of seed cache removal byrodents. Although the precise mechanism is not known; this knowledge might prove useful infield applications. We examined whether moistened bait would increase trap success indesert rodent populations. We placed traps 15 m apart in grids within a 500-ha study areaand randomly baited traps with either dry or moistened seeds. We found that traps baitedwith moistened seeds had 34.9% higher success than traps baited with dry seeds (n= 190;χ2= 5.389; df= 1; P= 0.020). Our results suggest that application of water to dry seed bait canlead to increased trap success for desert rodents.,Western North American Naturalist,2007,1

Recurrent sublethal warming reduces embryonic survival; inhibits juvenile growth; and alters species distribution projections under climate change,Michael A Carlo; Eric A Riddell; Ofir Levy; Michael W Sears,Abstract The capacity to tolerate climate change often varies across ontogeny in organismswith complex life cycles. Recently developed species distribution models incorporate traitsacross life stages; however; these life-cycle models primarily evaluate effects of lethalchange. Here; we examine impacts of recurrent sublethal warming on development andsurvival in ecological projections of climate change. We reared lizard embryos in thelaboratory under temperature cycles that simulated contemporary conditions and warmingscenarios. We also artificially warmed natural nests to mimic laboratory treatments.

Can lizard embryos survive climate warming? Thermal constraints on the physiology of developing Eastern fence lizards,Michael A Carlo; Eric A Riddell; Michael W Sears,Abstract Sublethal stressors will likely mediate an organismâ€™ s response to climatechange. Mobile animals can change their behavior to maintain temperatures withinpreferred ranges. However; animals in immobile life stages are particularly vulnerable towarming. For example; lizard embryos experience recurrent thermal stress as they developin shallow nests with daily temperature fluctuations. Nesting temperatures above 41.5 ÂCcan be lethal to Eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) embryos. Although that isbeyond the range experienced at current nest sites; rapid warming will push nest conditionstoward critical limits. Therefore; it is important to examine the effects of sublethal high nesttemperatures on developing lizards. We reared S. undulatus embryos under three thermalregimesâ€” one to simulate contemporary nest conditions with a maximum daily …,*,2015,*
No Evidence of Metabolic Depression in Western Alaskan Juvenile Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias,LA Hoopes; LD Rea; A Christ; GAJ Worthy,Abstract Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) populations have undergone precipitousdeclines through their western Alaskan range over the last four decades with the leadinghypothesis to explain this decline centering around changing prey quality; quantity; oravailability for this species (ie; nutritional stress hypothesis). Under chronic conditions ofreduced food intake sea lions would conserve energy by limiting energy expendituresthrough lowering of metabolic rate known as metabolic depression. To examine the potentialfor nutritional stress; resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body composition were measured infree-ranging juvenile Steller sea lions (N= 91) at three distinct geographical locations(Southeast Alaska; Prince William Sound; Central Aleutian Islands) using open-flowrespirometry and deuterium isotope dilution; respectively.

SYMP 7-8: Adaptation of thermal reaction norms along a latitudinal gradient: implications for the responses of species ranges to climate,Michael Sears; Michael J Angilletta,Understanding the responses of plants and animals to ongoing climate change is one of themost pressing questions for a practicing ecologist today. Over the past century; globalclimates have warmed and climatic models predict continued warming in the near future.Warmer temperatures will directly impact organisms given the thermal sensitivity ofnumerous physiological traits. One strategy for persistence; then; is for organisms to shifttheir geographic ranges by tracking climates to which their physiological processes areadapted. Here; we examine how thermal reaction norms for energy assimilation; which havebeen optimized along a latitudinal gradient; might contribute to future shifts in thegeographical range of a species. Because daily; seasonal; and annual temperatures varywith latitude; we expect that selective pressures have generated distinct reaction norms …,The 95th ESA Annual Meeting,2010,*

Predicting anuran phenotypes in complex environments,AC Niehaus; MJ Angilletta Jr; M Sears; CE Franklin; RS Wilson,Abstract Ecologists have long sought to understand the plasticity of organisms inenvironments that vary widely among years; seasons; and even hours of the day. Thoughenvironmental change is ubiquitous; relatively few empirical studies have considered theconsequences of diel temperature variation on developing organisms; instead comparingphenotypes among un-natural stable conditions. Here; we determined whether reactionnorms based on stable environments (18; 22; 26; 30 and 34 C) could be used to predicthatchling; larval and metamorphic phenotypes of anurans in variable environments (18-28 Cand 18-34 C). We used existing theory to evaluate how acclimation might result in poorpredictability.

Evaluating alternatives for watershed-scale design of BMPs,John William Nicklow,4. Problem and Research Objectives: Best management practices (BMPs) are widelyusedstructural or non-structural methods intended to manage and/or improve the quantity andquality of stormwater runoff. BMPs are commonly individually designed and site-specific.Studies (eg; Ferguson; 1991); however; suggest that such fragmented layouts may actuallyworsen stormwater impacts at the scale of a watershed; thus negating the intended purposeof runoff controls. Detention systems and other structural BMPs are instead most cost-effective when designed and implemented in regionallystrategic combinations to meetrelated stormwater treatment goals. Implementation of a watershed-scale BMP design isoften challenged by conflicting objectives (eg; environmental; ecological; economic criteria)as well as unquantifiable (and therefore; unmodeled) objectives.

PS 72-20: Exploring the influence of micro-scale spatial arrangements of surface temperatures on animal movements under climate change scenarios,Michael Sears,Predicting the impacts of climate change on species distributions is a pressing problem forecologists. Two general approaches have been taken to address this problem: climateenvelop models and physiological models. Climate envelop models predict futuredistributions of species given contemporary associations between climate and speciespresence data. Physiological models predict potential species ranges given energetic andbiophysical requirements of organisms. Both approaches can be implemented in ageographic context; but neither approach considers barriers to movements between currentand future habitat patches. This is because both approaches examine the influence ofclimate change at a considerably larger spatial scale than the scale over which individualsactually experience or interact with the environment. Thus; it is unknown how the spatial …,*,2007,*
OOS 37-2: Amphibian population declines; disease; and climate change,Karen Lips; Jay Diffendorfer; Joseph Mendelson III; Michael Sears,Amphibians are declining across the globe for a variety of reasons. We review the evidencefor the role of climate change in triggering disease outbreaks of chytridiomycosis; anemerging infectious disease of amphibians. Growing evidence clearly indicates thatchytridiomycosis is a major contributor to the global loss of amphibian diversity. Somestudies find no evidence for climate change during the time of amphibian populationdeclines; and posit chytridiomycosis as an exotic pathogen introduced into naïvepopulations and spreading along wave-like fronts. Other studies find that the timing ofdisease outbreaks is correlated with climatic events (eg; multiple El Niño events); or agradual increase in ambient temperature that apparently stimulates the emergence of anendemic pathogen.

Moistened Seeds Increase Rodent Trap Success,Michael W Sears; John C Tull,Abstract Seed moisture has been shown to influence the rates of seed cache removal byrodents. Although the precise mechanism is not known; this knowledge might prove useful infield applications. We examined whether moistened bait would increase trap success indesert rodent populations. We placed traps 15 m apart in grids within a 500-ha study areaand randomly baited traps with either dry or moistened seeds. We found that traps baitedwith moistened seeds had 34.9% higher success than traps baited with dry seeds (n= 190; Χ2= 5.389; df= 1; P= 0.020). Our results suggest that application of water to dry seed bait canlead to increased trap success for desert rodents.,Western North American Naturalist,2007,*
Urban Physiology: City Ants Possess High Heat Tolerance,Michael W Sears; Michael J Angilletta; Robbie S Wilson; Amanda C Niehaus; Pedro L Ribeiro; Carlos A Navas,Abstract Urbanization has caused regional increases in temperature that exceed thosemeasured on a global scale; leading to urban heat islands as much as 12 C hotter than theirsurroundings. Optimality models predict ectotherms in urban areas should tolerate heatbetter and cold worse than ectotherms in rural areas. We tested these predications bymeasuring heat and cold tolerances of leaf-cutter ants from South America's largest city (SãoPaulo; Brazil). Specifically; we compared thermal tolerances of ants from inside and outsideof the city. Knock-down resistance and chill-coma recovery were used as indicators of heatand cold tolerances; respectively. Ants from within the city took 20% longer to lose mobility at42 C than ants from outside the city. Interestingly; greater heat tolerance came at no obviousexpense of cold tolerance; hence; our observations only partially support current theory …,PLOS ONE,2007,*
Urban Physiology: City Ants Possess High Heat Tolerance,Michael J Angilletta Jr; Robbie S Wilson; Amanda C Niehaus; Michael W Sears; Carlos A Navas; Pedro L Ribeiro,METHODS Sampling of colonies We sampled colonies of leaf-cutter ants (Atta sexdensrubropilosa) inside and outside of Sao Paulo. Our samples included four urban coloniesnear the University of Sao Paulo and five rural colonies distributed along a north-westerlytransect (Fig. 1). We only collected ants that were walking along trails; carrying leaves orpieces of leaves. To minimize environmental and procedural effects; we collected all antsand measured their thermal tolerances on the same day (30 March 2006). We collected antsbetween 1600 and 2200 h and began measures of thermotolerance by 2300 h. Logistically;we were unable to collect ants from urban and rural colonies at the same time; therefore;urban ants were collected after rural ants to minimize the chance that high temperaturesduring collection would cause urban ants to tolerate heat better than rural ants.

Phenotypic plasticity of life history in the sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus graciosus),Michael Wayne Sears,Abstract Geographically widespread species often exhibit variation in life history traits thatare a result of differences in the quality and abundance of available resources. Documentedbody size patterns among populations of sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus graciosus) showthat large body size in free-ranging lizards is associated environments that provide longerseasonal activity. It is not known whether these body size differences among populations areenvironmentally induced or whether they can be attributed to adaptation to local conditions.Additionally; laboratory studies have demonstrated that growth rates increase with theamount of time a lizard can maintain elevated temperatures for activity (thermal opportunity).In this study; I use a combination of field mark-recapture techniques; laboratorymeasurement of physiological rates; and a common environment rearing study to discern …,*,2001,*

Mechanistic species distribution models oftenuse estimates 4 of activity to predict how organisms will respond to climate change.

Whether 7 individuals remain in positive net energetic balance determines ifa given location is suitable for 8 the species.

Genetic variances and covariances of aerobic metabolic rates,Bernard Wone; Michael W Sears; Marta K Labocha; Edward R Donovan; Jack P Hayes,The genetic variances and covariances of traits must be known to predict how they mayrespond to selection and how covariances among them might affect their evolutionarytrajectories. We used the animal model to estimate the genetic variances and covariances ofbasal metabolic rate (BMR) and maximal metabolic rate (MMR) in a geneticallyheterogeneous stock of laboratory mice. Narrow-sense heritability (h2) was approximately0.38+ 0.08 for body mass; 0.26+ 0.08 for whole-animal BMR; 0.24+ 0.07 for whole-animalMMR; 0.19+ 0.07 for mass-independent BMR; and 0.16+ 0.06 for mass-independent MMR.All h2 estimates were significantly different from zero.
