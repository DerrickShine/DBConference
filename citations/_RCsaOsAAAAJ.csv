Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained associations rules,Raymond T Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han; Alex Pang,Abstract From the standpoint of supporting human-centered discovery of knowledge; thepresent-day model of mining association rules suffers from the following seriousshortcomings:(i) lack of user exploration and control;(ii) lack of focus; and (iii) rigid notion ofrelationships. In effect; this model functions as a black-box; admitting little user interaction inbetween. We propose; in this paper; an architecture that opens up the black-box; andsupports constraint-based; human-centered exploratory mining of associations. Thefoundation of this architecture is a rich set of constraint constructs; including domain; class;and SQL-style aggregate constraints; which enable users to clearly specify whatassociations are to be mined. We propose constrained association queries as a means ofspecifying the constraints to be satisfied by the antecedent and consequent of a mined …,ACM Sigmod Record,1998,946
Learning influence probabilities in social networks,Amit Goyal; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Recently; there has been tremendous interest in the phenomenon of influencepropagation in social networks. The studies in this area assume they have as input to theirproblems a social graph with edges labeled with probabilities of influence between users.However; the question of where these probabilities come from or how they can be computedfrom real social network data has been largely ignored until now. Thus it is interesting to askwhether from a social graph and a log of actions by its users; one can build models ofinfluence. This is the main problem attacked in this paper. In addition to proposing modelsand algorithms for learning the model parameters and for testing the learned models tomake predictions; we also develop techniques for predicting the time by which a user maybe expected to perform an action. We validate our ideas and techniques using the Flickr …,Proceedings of the third ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2010,813
Timber: A native xml database,Hosagrahar V Jagadish; Shurug Al-Khalifa; Adriane Chapman; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Andrew Nierman; Stelios Paparizos; Jignesh M Patel; Divesh Srivastava; Nuwee Wiwatwattana; Yuqing Wu; Cong Yu,Abstract This paper describes the overall design and architecture of the Timber XMLdatabase system currently being implemented at the University of Michigan. The system isbased upon a bulk algebra for manipulating trees; and natively stores XML. New accessmethods have been developed to evaluate queries in the XML context; and new costestimation and query optimization techniques have also been developed. We presentperformance numbers to support some of our design decisions. We believe that the keyintellectual contribution of this system is a comprehensive set-at-a-time query processingability in a native XML store; with all the standard components of relational queryprocessing; including algebraic rewriting and a cost-based optimizer.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2002,568
A foundation for multi-dimensional databases,Marc Gyssens; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract We present a multi-dimensional database model; which we believe can serve as aconceptual model for On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)-based applications. Apart fromproviding the functionalities necessary for OLAP-based applications; the main feature of themodel we propose is a clear separation between structural aspects and the contents. Thisseparation of concerns allows us to dene data manipulation languages in a reasonablysimple; transparent way. In particular; we show that the data cube operator can beexpressed easily. Concretely; we de ne an algebra and a calculus and show them to beequivalent. We conclude by comparing our approach to related work. The conceptual multi-dimensional database model developed here is orthogonal to its implementation; which isnot a subject of the present paper.,VLDB,1997,451
Probview: A flexible probabilistic database system,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Nicola Leone; Robert Ross; Venkatramanan Siva Subrahmanian,Abstract Probability theory is mathematically the best understood paradigm for modeling andmanipulating uncertain information. Probabilities of complex events can be computed fromthose of basic events on which they depend; using any of a number of strategies. Whichstrategy is appropriate depends very much on the known interdependencies among theevents involved. Previous work on probabilistic databases has assumed a fixed andrestrictive combination strategy (eg; assuming all events are pairwise independent). In thisarticle; we characterize; using postulates; whole classes of strategies for conjunction;disjunction; and negation; meaningful from the viewpoint of probability theory.(1) Wepropose a probabilistic relational data model and a generic probabilistic relational algebrathat neatly captures various strategies satisfying the postulates; within a single unified …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1997,433
Mining frequent itemsets with convertible constraints,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint based mining paradigm in thecontext of frequent itemsets; associations; correlations; sequential patterns; and many otherinteresting patterns in large databases. The authors study constraints which cannot behandled with existing theory and techniques. For example; avg (S)/spl theta//spl nu/; median(S)/spl theta//spl nu/; sum (S)/spl theta//spl nu/(S can contain items of arbitrary values)(/spltheta//spl isin/{/spl ges/;/spl les/}); are customarily regarded as" tough" constraints in that theycannot be pushed inside an algorithm such as a priori. We develop a notion of convertibleconstraints and systematically analyze; classify; and characterize this class. We alsodevelop techniques which enable them to be readily pushed deep inside the recentlydeveloped FP-growth algorithm for frequent itemset mining. Results from our detailed …,Data Engineering; 2001.

TAX: A tree algebra for XML,Hosagrahar Visvesvaraya Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava; Keith Thompson,Abstract Querying XML has been the subject of much recent investigation. A formal bulkalgebra is essential for applying database-style optimization to XML queries. We developsuch an algebra; called TAX (Tree Algebra for XML); for manipulating XML data; modeled asforests of labeled ordered trees. Motivated both by aesthetic considerations of intuitiveness;and by efficient computability and amenability to optimization; we develop TAX as a naturalextension of relational algebra; with a small set of operators. TAX is complete for relationalalgebra extended with aggregation; and can express most queries expressible in popularXML query languages. It forms the basis for the Timber XML database system currentlyunder development by us.,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,2001,358
A declarative language for querying and restructuring the Web,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri; Iyer N Subramanian,World Wide Web is a hypertext based; distributed information system that provides access tovast amounts of information in the Internet. A fundamental problem with the Web is thedifficulty of retrieving specific information of interest to the user; from the enormous numberof resources that are available. We develop a simple logic called WebLog that is capable ofretrieving information from HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents in the Web.WebLog is inspired by SchemaLog; a logic for multidatabase interoperability. Wedemonstrate the suitability of WebLog for: querying and restructuring Web information;exploiting partial knowledge users might have on the information being queried; and dealingwith the dynamic nature of information in the Web. We illustrate the simplicity and power ofWebLog using a variety of applications involving real life information in the Web.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1996.

Celf++: optimizing the greedy algorithm for influence maximization in social networks,Amit Goyal; Wei Lu; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Kempe et al.[4](KKT) showed the problem of influence maximization is NP-hard anda simple greedy algorithm guarantees the best possible approximation factor in PTIME.However; it has two major sources of inefficiency. First; finding the expected spread of anode set is# P-hard. Second; the basic greedy algorithm is quadratic in the number ofnodes. The first source is tackled by estimating the spread using Monte Carlo simulation orby using heuristics [4; 6; 2; 5; 1; 3]. Leskovec et al. proposed the CELF algorithm for tacklingthe second. In this work; we propose CELF++ and empirically show that it is 35-55% fasterthan CELF.,Proceedings of the 20th international conference companion on World wide web,2011,331
Minimization of tree pattern queries,Sihem Amer-Yahia; SungRan Cho; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Tree patterns forms a natural basis to query tree-structured data such as XML andLDAP. Since the efficiency of tree pattern matching against a tree-structured databasedepends on the size of the pattern; it is essential to identify and eliminate redundant nodesin the pattern and do so as quickly as possible. In this paper; we study tree patternminimization both in the absence and in the presence of integrity constraints (ICs) on theunderlying tree-structured database. When no ICs are considered; we call the process ofminimizing a tree pattern; constraint-independent minimization. We develop a polynomialtime algorithm called CIM for this purpose. CIM's efficiency stems from two key properties:(i)a node cannot be redundant unless its children are; and (ii) the order of elimination ofredundant nodes is immaterial. When ICs are considered for minimization; we refer to it …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,317
A data-based approach to social influence maximization,Amit Goyal; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of users in a social network;such that by targeting this set; one maximizes the expected spread of influence in thenetwork. Most of the literature on this topic has focused exclusively on the social graph;overlooking historical data; ie; traces of past action propagations. In this paper; we studyinfluence maximization from a novel data-based perspective. In particular; we introduce anew model; which we call credit distribution; that directly leverages available propagationtraces to learn how influence flows in the network and uses this to estimate expectedinfluence spread. Our approach also learns the different levels of influence-ability of users;and it is time-aware in the sense that it takes the temporal nature of influence into account.We show that influence maximization under the credit distribution model is NP-hard and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,296
Quotient cube: How to summarize the semantics of a data cube,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jian Pei; Jiawei Han,Abstract Partitioning a data cube into sets of cells with" similar behavior" often betterexposes the semantics in the cube. Eg; if we find that average boots sales in the West 10thstore of Walmart was the same for winter as for the whole year; it signifies somethinginteresting about the trend of boots sales in that location in that year. In this paper; we areinterested in finding succinct summaries of the data cube; exploiting regularities present inthe cube; with a clear basis. We would like the summary:(i) to be as concise as possible;(ii)to itself form a lattice preserving the rollup/drilldown semantics of the cube; and (iii) to allowthe original cube to be fully recovered. We illustrate the utility of solving this problem anddiscuss the inherent challenges. We develop techniques for partitioning cube cells forobtaining succinct summaries; and introduce the quotient cube.

FleXPath: flexible structure and full-text querying for XML,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Shashank Pandit,Abstract Querying XML data is a well-explored topic with powerful database-style querylanguages such as XPath and XQuery set to become W3C standards. An equally compellingparadigm for querying XML documents is full-text search on textual content. In this paper; westudy fundamental challenges that arise when we try to integrate these two queryingparadigms. While keyword search is based on approximate matching; XPath has exactmatch semantics. We address this mismatch by considering queries on structure as a"template"; and looking for answers that best match this template and the full-text search. Toachieve this; we provide an elegant definition of relaxation on structure and define primitiveoperators to span the space of relaxations. Query answering is now based on rankingpotential answers on structural and full-text search conditions. We set out certain …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,261
SchemaSQL-a language for interoperability in relational multi-database systems,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri; Iyer N Subramanian,Abstract We provide a principled extension of SQL; called SchemaSQL; that o ers thecapability of uniform manipulation of data and meta-data in relational multi-databasesystems. We develop a precise syntax and semantics of SchemaSQL in a manner thatextends traditional SQL syntax and semantics; and demonstrate the following.(1)SchemaSQL retains the avour of SQL while supporting querying of both data and meta-data.(2) It can be used to represent data in a database in a structure substantially di erentfrom original database; in which data and meta-data may be interchanged.(3) It also permitsthe creation of views whose schema is dynamically dependent on the contents of the inputinstance.(4) While aggregation in SQL is restricted to values occurring in one column at atime; SchemaSQL permits\horizontal" aggregation and even aggregation over more …,VLDB,1996,249
Constraint-based; multidimensional data mining,Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Although many data-mining methodologies and systems have been developed in recentyears; the authors contend that by and large; present mining models lack humaninvolvement; particularly in the form of guidance and user control. They believe that datamining is most effective when the computer does what it does best-like searching largedatabases or counting-and users do what they do best; like specifying the current miningsession's focus. This division of labor is best achieved through constraint-based mining; inwhich the user provides restraints that guide a search. Mining can also be improved byemploying a multidimensional; hierarchical view of the data. Current data warehousesystems have provided a fertile ground for systematic development of this multidimensionalmining. Together; constraint-based and multidimensional techniques can provide a more …,Computer,1999,234
Discovering conditional functional dependencies,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Jianzhong Li; Ming Xiong,This paper investigates the discovery of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs). CFDsare a recent extension of functional dependencies (FDs) by supporting patterns ofsemantically related constants; and can be used as rules for cleaning relational data.However; finding quality CFDs is an expensive process that involves intensive manual effort.To effectively identify data cleaning rules; we develop techniques for discovering CFDs fromrelations. Already hard for traditional FDs; the discovery problem is more difficult for CFDs.Indeed; mining patterns in CFDs introduces new challenges. We provide three methods forCFD discovery. The first; referred to as CFDMiner; is based on techniques for mining closeditem sets; and is used to discover constant CFDs; namely; CFDs with constant patterns only.Constant CFDs are particularly important for object identification; which is essential to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,233
Simpath: An efficient algorithm for influence maximization under the linear threshold model,Amit Goyal; Wei Lu; Laks VS Lakshmanan,There is significant current interest in the problem of influence maximization: given adirected social network with influence weights on edges and a number k; find k seed nodessuch that activating them leads to the maximum expected number of activated nodes;according to a propagation model. Kempe et al. showed; among other things; that under theLinear Threshold Model; the problem is NP-hard; and that a simple greedy algorithmguarantees the best possible approximation factor in PTIME. However; this algorithm suffersfrom various major performance drawbacks. In this paper; we propose SIMPATH; an efficientand effective algorithm for influence maximization under the linear threshold model thataddresses these drawbacks by incorporating several clever optimizations. Through acomprehensive performance study on four real data sets; we show that SIMPATH …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,229
Optimization of constrained frequent set queries with 2-variable constraints,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond Ng; Jiawei Han; Alex Pang,Abstract Currently; there is tremendous interest in providing ad-hoc mining capabilities indatabase management systems. As a first step towards this goal; in [15] we proposed anarchitecture for supporting constraint-based; human-centered; exploratory mining of variouskinds of rules including associations; introduced the notion of constrained frequent setqueries (CFQs); and developed effective pruning optimizations for CFQs with 1-variable (1-var) constraints. While 1-var constraints are useful for constraining the antecedent andconsequent separately; many natural examples of CFQs illustrate the need for constrainingthe antecedent and consequent jointly; for which 2-variable (2-var) constraints areindispensable. Developing pruning optimizations for CFQs with 2-var constraints is thesubject of this paper. But this is a difficult problem because:(i) in 2-var constraints; both …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,220
Constraint-based clustering in large databases,Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Constrained clustering—finding clusters that satisfy user-specified constraints—ishighly desirable in many applications. In this paper; we introduce the constrained clusteringproblem and show that traditional clustering algorithms (eg; k-means) cannot handle it. Ascalable constraint-clustering algorithm is developed in this study which starts by finding aninitial solution that satisfies user-specified constraints and then refines the solution byperforming confined object movements under constraints. Our algorithm consists of twophases: pivot movement and deadlock resolution. For both phases; we show that finding theoptimal solution is NP-hard. We then propose several heuristics and show how ouralgorithm can scale up for large data sets using the heuristic of micro-cluster sharing. Byexperiments; we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristics.,International Conference on Database Theory,2001,205
QC-Trees: An efficient summary structure for semantic OLAP,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jian Pei; Yan Zhao,Abstract Recently; a technique called quotient cube was proposed as a summary structurefor a data cube that preserves its semantics; with applications for online exploration andvisualization. The authors showed that a quotient cube can be constructed very efficientlyand it leads to a significant reduction in the cube size. While it is an interesting proposal; thatpaper leaves many issues unaddressed. Firstly; a direct representation of a quotient cube isnot as compact as possible and thus still wastes space. Secondly; while a quotient cube canin principle be used for answering queries; no specific algorithms were given in the paper.Thirdly; maintaining any summary structure incrementally against updates is an importanttask; a topic not addressed there. In this paper; we propose an efficient data structure calledQC-tree and an efficient algorithm for directly constructing it from a base table; solving the …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,204
Efficient mining of constrained correlated sets,Gösta Grahne; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Xiaohong Wang,Studies the problem of efficiently computing correlated item sets satisfying given constraints.We call them valid correlated item sets. It turns out that constraints can have subtleinteractions with correlated item sets; depending on their underlying properties. We showthat; in general; the set of minimal valid correlated item sets does not coincide with that ofminimal correlated item sets that are valid; and we characterize classes of constraints forwhich these sets coincide. We delineate the meaning of these two spaces and givealgorithms for computing them. We also give an analytical evaluation of their performanceand validate our analysis with a detailed experimental evaluation.,Data Engineering; 2000.

-From Tree Patterns to Generalized Tree Patterns: On Efficient Evaluation of XQuery,Zhimin Chen; HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Stelios Paparizos,This chapter discusses the efficient evaluation of XQuery. XQuery is the current de factostandard XML query language. A core operation in the evaluation of XQuery is the finding ofmatches for specified tree patterns; and there has been much work towards algorithms forfinding such matches efficiently. Multiple XPath expressions can be evaluated by computingone or more tree pattern matches. Several XQuery implementation efforts have beenreported around the world. A key construct in most XML query models is the so-called treepattern (query)(TP (Q)); which is a tree T with nodes labeled by variables; together with aBoolean formula F specifying constraints on the nodes and their properties; including theirtags; attributes; and contents. The chapter proposes a structure called generalized treepattern (GTP) for concise representation of a whole XQuery expression. Evaluating the …,*,2003,170
It takes variety to make a world: diversification in recommender systems,Cong Yu; Laks Lakshmanan; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract Recommendations in collaborative tagging sites such as del. icio. us and Yahoo!Movies; are becoming increasingly important; due to the proliferation of general queries onthose sites and the ineffectiveness of the traditional search paradigm to address thosequeries. Regardless of the underlying recommendation strategy; item-based or user-based;one of the key concerns in producing recommendations; is over-specialization; which resultsin returning items that are too homogeneous. Traditional solutions rely on post-processingreturned items to identify those which differ in their attribute values (eg; genre and actors formovies). Such approaches are not always applicable when intrinsic attributes are notavailable (eg; URLs in del. icio. us). In a recent paper [20]; we introduced the notion ofexplanation-based diversity and formalized the diversification problem as a compromise …,Proceedings of the 12th international conference on extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2009,166
Discovering leaders from community actions,Amit Goyal; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract We introduce a novel frequent pattern mining approach to discover leaders andtribes in social networks. In particular; we consider social networks where users performactions. Actions may be as simple as tagging resources (urls) as in del. icio. us; rating songsas in Yahoo! Music; or movies as in Yahoo! Movies; or users buying gadgets such ascameras; handhelds; etc. and blogging a review on the gadgets. The assumption is thatactions performed by a user can be seen by their network friends. Users seeing their friends'actions are sometimes tempted to perform those actions. We are interested in the problem ofstudying the propagation of such" influence"; and on this basis; identifying which users areleaders when it comes to setting the trend for performing various actions.

Information and influence propagation in social networks,Wei Chen; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Carlos Castillo,Abstract Download Free Sample Research on social networks has exploded over the lastdecade. To a large extent; this has been fueled by the spectacular growth of social mediaand online social networking sites; which continue growing at a very fast pace; as well as bythe increasing availability of very large social network datasets for purposes of research. Arich body of this research has been devoted to the analysis of the propagation of information;influence; innovations; infections; practices and customs through networks. Can we buildmodels to explain the way these propagations occur? How can we validate our modelsagainst any available real datasets consisting of a social network and propagation tracesthat occurred in the past? These are just some questions studied by researchers in this area.Information propagation models find applications in viral marketing; outbreak detection …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2013,159
Efficient secure query evaluation over encrypted XML databases,Hui Wang; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Motivated by the" database-as-service" paradigm wherein data owned by a client ishosted on a third-party server; there is significant interest in secure query evaluation overencrypted databases. We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attackmodel where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and theiroccurrence frequencies; and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well asvalue associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of securityconstraints. For security reasons; sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted.There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for differentgranularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal; secure encryption scheme isNP-hard. For speeding up query processing; we propose to keep metadata; consisting of …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,150

While there are some recent studies on mining data streams; we would like to askthe following essential question: What are the distinct features of mining data streamscompared to mining other kinds of data? In this paper; we take the following position: onlinemining of the changes in data streams is one of the core issues. We propose someinteresting research problems and highlight the inherent challenges. Moreover; we sketchsome preliminary results.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams,2003,147
Probabilistic Deductive Databases.,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri,The Problem: Knowledge-base (KB) systems must typically deal with imperfection inknowledge; eg in the form of incompleteness; inconsistency; uncertainty; to name a few.Currently KB system development is mainly based on the expert system technology. Expertsystems; through their support for rule-based programming; uncertainty; etc. o er aconvenient framework for KB system development.

Anonymizing moving objects: How to hide a mob in a crowd?,Roman Yarovoy; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Wendy Hui Wang,Abstract Moving object databases (MOD) have gained much interest in recent years due tothe advances in mobile communications and positioning technologies. Study of MOD canreveal useful information (eg; traffic patterns and congestion trends) that can be used inapplications for the common benefit. In order to mine and/or analyze the data; MOD must bepublished; which can pose a threat to the location privacy of a user. Indeed; based on priorknowledge of a user's location at several time points; an attacker can potentially associatethat user to a specific moving object (MOB) in the published database and learn her positioninformation at other time points. In this paper; we study the problem of privacy-preservingpublishing of moving object database.

Tree pattern query minimization,Sihem Amer-Yahia; SungRan Cho; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract. Tree patterns form a natural basis to query tree-structured data such as XML andLDAP. To improve the efficiency of tree pattern matching; it is essential to quickly identify andeliminate redundant nodes in the pattern. In this paper; we study tree pattern minimizationboth in the absence and in the presence of integrity constraints (ICs) on the underlying tree-structured database. In the absence of ICs; we develop a polynomial-time queryminimization algorithm called CIM; whose efficiency stems from two key properties:(i) a nodecannot be redundant unless its children are; and (ii) the order of elimination of redundantnodes is immaterial. When ICs are considered for minimization; we develop a technique forquery minimization based on three fundamental operations: augmentation (an adaptation ofthe well-known chase procedure); minimization (based on homomorphism techniques) …,The VLDB Journal,2002,136
Optimizing the secure evaluation of twig queries,SungRan Cho; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Divesh Srivastava,This chapter focuses on the problem of secure evaluation of eXtensible Markup Language(XML) twig queries; for the simple; but useful; multilevel security model. The rapidemergence of XML as a standard for data exchange over the Web has led to considerableinterest in the problem of securing XML documents. In this context; query evaluation enginesneed to ensure that user queries only use and return XML data that the user is allowed toaccess. These added access control checks can considerably increase query evaluationtime. Companies are using the Web as the main means of information dissemination;sparking interest in models; and efficient mechanisms for controlled access to informationcontent over the Web. In this respect; securing XML documents is an important step;because XML is rapidly emerging as the standard for data representation and exchange …,*,2002,135
On approximating optimum repairs for functional dependency violations,Solmaz Kolahi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract We study the problem of repairing an inconsistent database that violates a set offunctional dependencies by making the smallest possible value modifications. For aninconsistent database; we define an optimum repair as a database that satisfies thefunctional dependencies; and minimizes; among all repairs; a distance measure thatdepends on the number of corrections made in the database and the weights of tuplesmodified. We show that like other versions of the repair problem; checking the existence of arepair within a certain distance of a database is NP-complete. We also show that finding aconstant-factor approximation for the optimum repair for any set of functional dependenciesis NP-hard. Furthermore; there is a small constant and a set of functional dependencies; forwhich finding an approximate solution for the optimum repair within the factor of that …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory,2009,128

Efficient network aware search in collaborative tagging sites,Sihem Amer Yahia; Michael Benedikt; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract The popularity of collaborative tagging sites presents a unique opportunity toexplore keyword search in a context where query results are determined by the opinion of anetwork of taggers related to a seeker. In this paper; we present the first in-depth study ofnetwork-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of ananswer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue thatobvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive; due to the dependence ofscores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintainingscore upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag; over the entire collection of users. The resulting boundsare very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,125
A parametric approach to deductive databases with uncertainty,Laks V. S.  Lakshmanan; Nematollaah Shiri,Numerous frameworks have been proposed in recent years for deductive databases withuncertainty. On the basis of how uncertainty is associated with the facts and rules in aprogram; we classify these frameworks into implication-based (IB) and annotation-based(AB) frameworks. We take the IB approach and propose a generic framework; called theparametric framework; as a unifying umbrella for IB frameworks. We develop the declarative;fixpoint; and proof-theoretic semantics of programs in our framework and show theirequivalence. Using the framework as a basis; we then study the query optimization problemof containment of conjunctive queries in this framework and establish necessary andsufficient conditions for containment for several classes of parametric conjunctive queries.Our results yield tools for use in the query optimization for large classes of query …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2001,123
Privacy-preserving mining of association rules from outsourced transaction databases,Fosca Giannotti; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Anna Monreale; Dino Pedreschi; Hui Wang,Spurred by developments such as cloud computing; there has been considerable recentinterest in the paradigm of data mining-as-a-service. A company (data owner) lacking inexpertise or computational resources can outsource its mining needs to a third party serviceprovider (server). However; both the items and the association rules of the outsourceddatabase are considered private property of the corporation (data owner). To protectcorporate privacy; the data owner transforms its data and ships it to the server; sends miningqueries to the server; and recovers the true patterns from the extracted patterns receivedfrom the server. In this paper; we study the problem of outsourcing the association rulemining task within a corporate privacy-preserving framework.

What can hierarchies do for data warehouses?,Hosagrahar V Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Data in a warehouse typically has multiple dimensions of interest; such as location;time; and product. It is well-recognized that these dimensions have hierarchies defined onthem; such as" store-city-state-region" for location. The standard way to model such data iswith a star/snowflake schema. However; current approaches do not give a first-class statusto dimensions. Consequently; a substantial class of interesting queries involving dimensionhierarchies and their interaction with the fact tables are quite verbose to write; hard to read;and difficult to optimize. We propose the SQL (%) model and a natural extension to the SQLquery language; that gives a first-class status to dimensions; and we pin down its semantics.Our model permits structural and schematic heterogeneity in dimension hierarchies;situations often arising in practice that cannot be modeled satisfactorily using the star …,VLDB,1999,119

A set of XML elements; say oftype book; may have members that vary greatly in structure; eg in the number of author sub-elements. This kind of heterogeneity may permeate the entire document in a recursivefashion: eg; different authors of the same or different book may in turn greatly vary instructure. Even when the document conforms to a schema; the flexible nature of schemas forXML still allows such significant variations in structure among elements in a collection. Bulkprocessing of such heterogeneous sets is problematic. In this paper; we introduce the notionof logical classes (LC) of pattern tree nodes; and generalize the notion of pattern tree …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,117
On the logical foundations of schema integration and evolution in heterogeneous database systems,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri; Iyer N Subramanian,Abstract Developing a declarative approach to schema integration in the context ofheterogeneous database systems is a major goal of this research. We take a first steptoward this goal in this paper; by developing a simple logic called SchemaLog which issyntactically higher-order but has a first-order semantics. SchemaLog can provide for alogical integration of multiple relational databases in a federation of database systems. Wedevelop a fixpoint theory as well as a sound and complete proof theory for the definiteclause fragment of SchemaLog and show their equivalence to the model-theoreticsemantics. We argue that a uniform framework for schema integration as well as schemaevolution is both desirable and possible. We illustrate the simplicity and power ofSchemaLog with a variety of applications involving database programming (with schema …,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1993,115
Pushing convertible constraints in frequent itemset mining,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-based miningparadigm in the context of frequent itemsets; associations; correlations; sequential patterns;and many other interesting patterns in large databases. Constraint pushing techniques havebeen developed for mining frequent patterns and associations with antimonotonic;monotonic; and succinct constraints. In this paper; we study constraints which cannot behandled with existing theory and techniques in frequent pattern mining. For example; avg (S)θ v; median (S) θ v; sum (S) θ v (S can contain items of arbitrary values; θ∈{<;<;≤;≥} and vis a real number.) are customarily regarded as “tough” constraints in that they cannot bepushed inside an algorithm such as Apriori. We develop a notion of convertible constraintsand systematically analyze; classify; and characterize this class. We also develop …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2004,110
Maximizing product adoption in social networks,Smriti Bhagat; Amit Goyal; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract One of the key objectives of viral marketing is to identify a small set of users in asocial network; who when convinced to adopt a product will influence others in the networkleading to a large number of adoptions in an expected sense. The seminal work of Kempe etal.[13] approaches this as the problem of influence maximization. This and other previouspapers tacitly assume that a user who is influenced (or; informed) about a productnecessarily adopts the product and encourages her friends to adopt it. However; aninfluenced user may not adopt the product herself; and yet form an opinion based on theexperiences of her friends; and share this opinion with others. Furthermore; a user whoadopts the product may not like the product and hence not encourage her friends to adopt itto the same extent as another user who adopted and liked the product. This is …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2012,106
Tables as a paradigm for querying and restructuring,Marc Gyssens; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Iyer N Subramanian,Abstract Tables are one of the most natural representations of real-life data. Previous table-based data models(such as relational; nested relational; and complex objects models)capture only a limited variety of real-life tables. In this paper; we study the foundations oftabular representations of data. We propose the tabular database model for handling abroad class of natural data represent at ions and develop tabular algebra as a language forquerying and restructuring tabular data. We show that the tabular algebra is complete for avery general class of transformations and show that several languages designed for verydifferent purposes can naturally be embedded into the tabular model; We also demonstratethe applicability of our model as a theoretical foundation for on-line analyticalprocessing(OLAP); an emerging technology for complementing the robust data …,Proceedings of the fifteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1996,105
X^ 3: A cube operator for xml olap,Nuwee Wiwatwattana; HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,With increasing amounts of data being exchanged and even generated or stored in XML; anatural question is how to perform OLAP on XML data; which can be structurallyheterogeneous (eg; parse trees) and/or marked-up text documents. A core operator forOLAP is the data cube. While the relational cube can be extended in a straightforward wayto XML; we argue such an extension would not address the specific issues posed by XML.While in a relational warehouse; facts are flat records and dimensions may have hierarchies;in an XML warehouse; both facts and dimensions may be hierarchical. Second; XML isflexible:(a) an element may have missing or repeated subelements;(b) different instances ofthe same element type may have different structure. We identify the challenges introducedby these features of XML for cube definition and computation. We propose a definition for …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Answering tree pattern queries using views,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Hui Wang; Zheng Zhao,Abstract We study the query answering using views (QAV) problem for tree pattern queries.Given a query and a view; the QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways:(i) find anequivalent rewriting of the query using only the view; or (ii) find a maximal containedrewriting using only the view. The former is appropriate for classical query optimization andwas recently studied by Xu and Ozsoyoglu for tree pattern queries (TP). However; forinformation integration; we cannot rely on equivalent rewriting and must instead usemaximal contained rewriting as shown by Halevy. Motivated by this; we study maximalcontained rewriting for TP; a core subset of XPath; both in the absence and presence of aschema. In the absence of a schema; we show there are queries whose maximal containedrewriting (MCR) can only be expressed as the union of exponentially many TPs.

Breaking out of the box of recommendations: from items to packages,Min Xie; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Peter T Wood,Abstract Classical recommender systems provide users with a list of recommendationswhere each recommendation consists of a single item; eg; a book or DVD. However; severalapplications can benefit from a system capable of recommending packages of items; in theform of sets. Sample applications include travel planning with a limited budget (price or time)and twitter users wanting to select worthwhile tweeters to follow given that they can deal withonly a bounded number of tweets. In these contexts; there is a need for a system that canrecommend top-k packages for the user to choose from. Motivated by these applications; weconsider composite recommendations; where each recommendation comprises a set ofitems. Each item has both a value (rating) and a cost associated with it; and the userspecifies a maximum total cost (budget) for any recommended set of items.

The techniques described here have been implemented in theTIMBER native XML database system being developed at the University of Michigan.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,89
On minimizing budget and time in influence propagation over social networks,Amit Goyal; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In recent years; study of influence propagation in social networks has gainedtremendous attention. In this context; we can identify three orthogonal dimensions—thenumber of seed nodes activated at the beginning (known as budget); the expected numberof activated nodes at the end of the propagation (known as expected spread or coverage);and the time taken for the propagation. We can constrain one or two of these and try tooptimize the third. In their seminal paper; Kempe et al. constrained the budget; left timeunconstrained; and maximized the coverage: this problem is known as InfluenceMaximization (or MAXINF for short). In this paper; we study alternative optimization problemswhich are naturally motivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketingcampaigns. In the first problem; termed minimum target set selection (or MINTSS for short) …,Social network analysis and mining,2013,88
Data cleaning and query answering with matching dependencies and matching functions,Leopoldo Bertossi; Solmaz Kolahi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Matching dependencies were recently introduced as declarative rules for datacleaning and entity resolution. Enforcing a matching dependency on a database instanceidentifies the values of some attributes for two tuples; provided that the values of some otherattributes are sufficiently similar. Assuming the existence of matching functions for makingtwo attribute values equal; we formally introduce the process of cleaning an instance usingmatching dependencies; as a chase-like procedure. We show that matching functionsnaturally introduce a lattice structure on attribute domains; and a partial order of semanticdomination between instances. Using the latter; we define the semantics of clean queryanswering in terms of certain/possible answers as the greatest lower bound/least upperbound of all possible answers obtained from the clean instances. We show that clean …,Theory of Computing Systems,2013,88
Colorful XML: one hierarchy isn't enough,HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Monica Scannapieco; Divesh Srivastava; Nuwee Wiwatwattana,Abstract XML has a tree-structured data model; which is used to uniformly representstructured as well as semi-structured data; and also enable concise query specification inXQuery; via the use of its XPath (twig) patterns. This in turn can leverage the recentlydeveloped technology of structural join algorithms to evaluate the query efficiently. In thispaper; we identify a fundamental tension in XML data modeling:(i) data represented as deeptrees (which can make effective use of twig patterns) are often un-normalized; leading toupdate anomalies; while (ii) normalized data tends to be shallow; resulting in heavy use ofexpensive value-based joins in queries. Our solution to this data modeling problem is anovel multi-colored trees (MCT) logical data model; which is an evolutionary extension of theXML data model; and permits trees with multi-colored nodes to signify their participation …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,86
Compressed accessibility map: Efficient access control for XML,Ting Yu; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava; HV Jagadish,This chapter proposes a space-and time-efficient solution to the access control problem foreXtensible Markup Language (XML) data. The solution is based on a novel notion of acompressed accessibility map (CAM); which compactly identifies the XML data items towhich a user has access; by exploiting structural locality of accessibility in tree-structureddata. Transacting business over the Internet using XML is becoming more and more of areality as one moves towards a world of Internet-worked data; with applications requiringaccess to data on the Internet. In this setting; there is a need for much more sophisticatedtypes of access control than is permitted by simple firewalls. XML is widely regarded as apromising means for data representation integration; and exchange. As companies transactbusiness over the Internet; the sensitive nature of the information mandates that access …,*,2002,86
Socialscope: Enabling information discovery on social content sites,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Laks Lakshmanan; Cong Yu,Abstract: Recently; many content sites have started encouraging their users to engage insocial activities such as adding buddies on Yahoo! Travel and sharing articles with theirfriends on New York Times. This has led to the emergence of {\em social content sites};which is being facilitated by initiatives like OpenID (this http URL) and OpenSocial (this httpURL). These community standards enable the open access to users' social profiles andconnections by individual content sites and are bringing content-oriented sites and socialnetworking sites ever closer. The integration of content and social information raises newchallenges for {\em information management and discovery} over such sites. We propose alogical architecture; named\kw {SocialScope}; consisting of three layers; for tackling thechallenges. The {\em content management} layer is responsible for integrating …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.2058,2009,84
Modeling uncertainty in deductive databases,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri,Abstract Information Source Tracking (IST) method has been developed recently for themodeling and manipulation of uncertain and inaccurate data in relational databases. In thispaper we extend the IST method to deductive databases. We show that positive uncertaindatabases; ie IST-based deductive databases with only positive literals in the heads and thebodies of the rules; enjoy a least model/least fixpoint semantics. Query processing in thismodel is studied next. We extend the top-down and bottom-up evaluation techniques of logicprogramming and deductive databases to our model. Finally; we study negation foruncertain databases; concentrating on stratified uncertain databases.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1994,84
Efficient dynamic mining of constrained frequent sets,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Data mining is supposed to be an iterative and exploratory process. In this context;we are working on a project with the overall objective of developing a practical computingenvironment for the human-centered exploratory mining of frequent sets. One criticalcomponent of such an environment is the support for the dynamic mining of constrainedfrequent sets of items. Constraints enable users to impose a certain focus on the miningprocess; dynamic means that; in the middle of the computation; users are able to (i) change(such as tighten or relax) the constraints and/or (ii) change the minimum support threshold;thus having a decisive influence on subsequent computations. In a real-life situation; theavailable buffer space may be limited; thus adding another complication to the problem. Inthis article; we develop an algorithm; called DCF; for Dynamic Constrained Frequent-set …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2003,80
Querying network directories,HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Tova Milo; Divesh Srivastava; Dimitra Vista,Abstract Heirarchically structured directories have recently proliferated with the growth of theInternet; and are being used to store not only address books and contact information forpeople; but also personal profiles; network resource information; and network and servicepolicies. These systems provide a means for managing scale and heterogeneity; whileallowing for conceptual unity and autonomy across multiple directory servers in the network;in a way for superior to what conventional relational or object-oriented databases offer. Yet;in deployed systems today; much of the data is modeled in an ad hoc manner; and many ofthe more sophisticated “queries” involve navigational access. In this paper; we develop thecore of a formal data model for network directories; and propose a sequence of efficientlycomputable query languages with increasing expressive power.

On testing satisfiability of tree pattern queries,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Ganesh Ramesh; Hui Wang; Zheng Zhao,Abstract XPath and XQuery (which includes XPath as a sublanguage) are the major querylanguages for XML. An important issue arising in efficient evaluation of queries expressed inthese languages is satisfiability; ie; whether there exists a database; consistent with theschema if one is available; on which the query has a non-empty answer. Our experienceshows satisfiability check can effect substantial savings in query evaluation. Wesystematically study satisfiability of tree pattern queries (which capture a useful fragment ofXPath) together with additional constraints; with or without a schema. We identify cases inwhich this problem can be solved in polynomial time and develop novel efficient algorithmsfor this purpose. We also show that in several cases; the problem is NP-complete. We ran acomprehensive set of experiments to verify the utility of satisfiability check as a …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,77
Exploiting succinct constraints using FP-trees,Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Since its introduction; frequent-set mining has been generalized to many forms;which include constrained data mining. The use of constraints permits user focus andguidance; enables user exploration and control; and leads to effective pruning of the searchspace and efficient mining of frequent itemsets. In this paper; we focus on the use of succinctconstraints. In particular; we propose a novel algorithm called FPS to mine frequent itemsetssatisfying succinct constraints. The FPS algorithm avoids the generate-and-test paradigm byexploiting succinctness properties of the constraints in a FP-tree based framework. In termsof functionality; our algorithm is capable of handling not just the succinct aggregateconstraint; but any succinct constraint in general. Moreover; it handles multiple succinctconstraints. In terms of performance; our algorithm is more efficient and effective than …,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2002,76
The 3w model and algebra for unified data mining,Theodore Johnson; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Real data mining analysis applications call for a framework which adequatelysupports knowledge discovery as a multi-step process; where the input of one miningoperation can be the output of another. Previous studies; primarily focusing on fastcomputation of one specific mining task at a time; ignore this vital issue. Motivated by thisobservation; we develop a unified model supporting all major mining and analysis tasks. Ourmodel consists of three distinct worlds; corresponding to intensional and extensionaldimensions; and to data sets. The notion of dimension is a centerpiece of the model.Equipped with hierarchies; dimensions integrate the output of seemingly dissimilar miningand analysis operations in a clean manner. We propose an algebra; called the dimensionalgebra; for manipulating intensional dimensions; as well as operators that serve as …,VLDB,2000,71

On E ciently Implementing SchemaSQL on a SQL Database System,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri; IN Subramanian,Abstract SchemaSQL is a recently proposed extension to SQL for enabling multi-databaseinteroperability. Several recently identi ed applications for SchemaSQL; however; mainlyrely on its ability to treat data and schema labels in a uniform manner; and call for an e cientimplementation of it on a single RDBMS. We rst develop a logical algebra for SchemaSQLby combining classical relational algebra with four restructuring operators {unfold; fold; split;and unite {originally introduced in the context of the tabular data model by Gyssens et al.GLS96]; and suitably adapted to t the needs of SchemaSQL. We give an algorithm fortranslating SchemaSQL queries/views involving restructuring; into the logical algebra above.We also provide physical algebraic operators which are useful for query optimization.

Interoperability on XML data,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri,Abstract We study the problem of interoperability among XML data sources. We propose alightweight infrastructure for this purpose that derives its inspiration from the recent semanticweb initiative. Our approach is based on enriching local sources with semantic declarationsso as to enable interoperability. These declarations expose the semantics of the informationcontent of sources by mapping the concepts present therein to a common (applicationspecific) vocabulary; in the spirit of RDF. In addition to this infrastructure; we discuss toolsthat may assist in generating semantic declarations; and formulation of global queries andaddress some interesting issues in query processing and optimization.,International Semantic Web Conference,2003,68
Recommendation diversification using explanations,Cong Yu; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Sihem Amer-Yahia,We introduce the novel notion of {\em explanation-based diversification} to address the well-known problem of {\em over-specialization} in item recommendations. Over-specialization inrecommender systems leads to result sets with items that are too similar to one another; thusreducing the diversity of results and limiting user choices. Traditionally; the problem isaddressed through {\em attribute-based diversification}| grouping items in the result set thatshare many common attributes (eg; genre for movies) and selecting only a limited number ofitems from each group. It is; however; not always applicable; especially for social contentrecommendations. For example; attributes may not be available as in the case ofrecommending URLs for users of del. icio. us.

Efficient OLAP query processing in distributed data warehouses,Michael O Akinde; Michael H Böhlen; Theodore Johnson; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract The success of Internet applications has led to an explosive growth in the demandfor bandwidth from Internet Service Providers. Managing an Internet protocol networkrequires collecting and analyzing network data; such as flow-level traffic statistics. Suchanalyses can typically be expressed as OLAP queries; eg; correlated aggregate queries anddata cubes. Current day OLAP tools for this task assume the availability of the data in acentralized data warehouse. However; the inherently distributed nature of data collectionand the huge amount of data extracted at each collection point make it impractical to gatherall data at a centralized site. One solution is to maintain a distributed data warehouse;consisting of local data warehouses at each collection point and a coordinator site; with mostof the processing being performed at the local sites. In this paper; we consider the …,Information Systems,2003,66
A compressed accessibility map for XML,Ting Yu; Divesh Srivastava; Laks VS Lakshmanan; HV Jagadish,Abstract XML is the undisputed standard for data representation and exchange. Ascompanies transact business over the Internet; letting authorized customers directly access;and even modify; XML data offers many advantages in terms of cost; accuracy; andtimeliness. Given the complex business relationships between companies; and the sensitivenature of information; access must be provided selectively; using sophisticated accesscontrol specifications. Using the specification directly to determine if a user has access to anXML data item can be extremely inefficient. The alternative of fully materializing; for eachdata item; the users authorized to access it can be space-inefficient. In this article; weintroduce a compressed accessibility map (CAM) as a space-and time-efficient solution tothe access control problem for XML data.

Interestingness and Pruning of Mined Patterns.,Devavrat Shah; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Krithi Ramamritham; S Sudarshan,Abstract We study the following question: when can a mined pattern; which may be anassociation; a correlation; ratio rule; or any other; be regarded as interesting? Previousapproaches to answering this question have been largely numeric. Speci cally; we show thatthe presence of some rules may make others redundant; and therefore uninteresting. Wearticulate these principles and formalize them in the form of pruning rules. Pruning rules;when applied to a collection of mined patterns; can be used to eliminate redundant ones. Asa concrete instance; we applied our pruning rules on association rules/positive associationrules derived from a census database; and demonstrate that signi cant pruning results.,1999 ACM SIGMOD workshop on research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,1999,63

On a theory of probabilistic deductive databases,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri,Abstract We propose a framework for modeling uncertainty where both belief and doubt canbe given independent; first-class status. We adopt probability theory as the mathematicalformalism for manipulating uncertainty. An agent can express the uncertainty in herknowledge about a piece of information in the form of a confidence level; consisting of a pairof intervals of probability; one for each of her belief and doubt. The space of confidencelevels naturally leads to the notion of a trilattice; similar in spirit to Fitting's bilattices.Intuitively; the points in such a trilattice can be ordered according to truth; information; orprecision. We develop a framework for probabilistic deductive databases by associatingconfidence levels with the facts and rules of a classical deductive database. While thetrilattice structure offers a variety of choices for defining the semantics of probabilistic …,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,2001,59
The generalized MDL approach for summarization,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng; Christine Xing Wang; Xiaodong Zhou; Theodore J Johnson,This chapter presents a generalization of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle;called GMDL; and shows that GMDL leads to fewer regions than MDL; and hence moreconcise “answers” are returned to the user. The key idea is that a region may contain “don'tcare” cells (up to a global maximum) if these “don't care” cells help to form bigger summaryregions; leading to a more concise overall summary. There are many applications in onlineanalytical processing (OLAP) and data analysis where one identifies regions of interest. Forexample; in OLAP; an analysis query involving aggregate sales performance of variousproducts in different locations and seasons could help identify interesting cells; such as cellsof a data cube having an aggregate sales higher than a threshold. While a normal answer tosuch a query merely returns all interesting cells; it may be far more informative to the user …,*,2002,57

Getting recommender systems to think outside the box,Zeinab Abbassi; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Sergei Vassilvitskii; Cong Yu,Abstract We examine the case of over-specialization in recommender systems; which resultsfrom returning items that are too similar to those previously rated by the user. We proposeOutside-The-Box (otb) recommendation; which takes some risk to help users make freshdiscoveries; while maintaining high relevance. The proposed formalization relies on itemregions and attempts to identify regions that are under-exposed to the user. We develop arecommendation algorithm which achieves a compromise between relevance and risk tofind otb items. We evaluate this approach on the MovieLens data set and compare our otbrecommendations against conventional recommendation strategies.,Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Recommender systems,2009,54
Mining unexpected rules by pushing user dynamics,Ke Wang; Yuelong Jiang; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Unexpected rules are interesting because they are either previously unknown ordeviate from what prior user knowledge would suggest. In this paper; we study threeimportant issues that have been previously ignored in mining unexpected rules. First; theunexpectedness of a rule depends on how the user prefers to apply the prior knowledge to agiven scenario; in addition to the knowledge itself. Second; the prior knowledge should beconsidered right from the start to focus the search on unexpected rules. Third; theunexpectedness of a rule depends on what other rules the user has seen so far. Thus; onlyrules that remain unexpected given what the user has seen should be consideredinteresting. We develop an approach that addresses all three problems above and evaluateit by means of experiments focusing on finding interesting rules.,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,54
Profit maximization over social networks,Wei Lu; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of influential users in a social networksuch that the expected spread of influence under a certain propagation model is maximized.Much of the previous work has neglected the important distinction between social influenceand actual product adoption. However; as recognized in the management science literature;an individual who gets influenced by social acquaintances may not necessarily adopt aproduct (or technology); due; eg; to monetary concerns. In this work; we distinguish betweeninfluence and adoption by explicitly modeling the states of being influenced and of adoptinga product. We extend the classical Linear Threshold (LT) model to incorporate prices andvaluations; and factor them into users' decision-making process of adopting a product.

Requirements are best viewed as “queries” and specifications as data; oftenrepresented in XML. We present a framework where requirements and specifications areboth registered with and are maintained by a registry. On a periodical basis; the registrymatches new incoming specifications; eg; of products and services; against requirements;and notifies the owners of the requirements of matches found.

To translate queries across peers; we assumeeach peer provides correspondences between its schema and a small number of other peerschemas. We focus on query reformulation in the presence of heterogeneous XML schemas;including data---metadata conflicts. We develop an algorithm for inferring precise mappingrules from informal schema correspondences. We define the semantics of query answeringin this setting and develop query translation algorithm. Our translation handles anexpressive fragment of XQuery and works both along and against the direction of mappingrules.

HeteroMF: recommendation in heterogeneous information networks using context dependent factor models,Mohsen Jamali; Laks Lakshmanan,Abstract With the growing amount of information available online; recommender systems arestarting to provide a viable alternative and complement to search engines; in helping usersto find objects of interest. Methods based on Matrix Factorization (MF) models are the state-of-the-art in recommender systems. The input to MF is user feedback; in the form of a ratingmatrix. However; users can be engaged in interactions with multiple types of entities acrossdifferent contexts; leading to multiple rating matrices. In other words; users can haveinteractions in a heterogeneous information network. Generally; in a heterogeneousnetwork; entities from any two entity types can have interactions with a weight (rating)indicating the level of endorsement.

Meeting-based methods including SimRank and P-Rankcapture structural similarity very well. Deriving inspiration from PageRank; SimRank hasgained popularity by a natural intuition and domain independence. Since it'scomputationally expensive; subsequent work has focused on optimizing and approximatingthe computation of SimRank.

Wealso explore methods to approximate the commute times and Katz scores from a node to allother nodes in the graph. Here; our approach for the commute times is based on a variationof the conjugate gradient algorithm; and it provides an estimate of all the diagonals of theinverse of a matrix. Our technique for the Katz scores is based on exploiting an empiricallocalization property of the Katz matrix. We adapt algorithms used for personalizedPageRank computing to these Katz scores and theoretically show that this approach is …,Internet Mathematics,2012,47
Exploratory mining via constrained frequent set queries,Raymond Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han; Teresa Mah,Abstract Although there have been many studies on data mining; to date there have beenfew research prototypes or commercial systems supporting comprehensive query-drivenmining; which encourages interactive exploration of the data. Our thesis is that constraintconstructs and the optimization they induce play a pivotal role in mining queries; thussubstantially enhancing the usefulness and performance of the mining system. This is basedon the analogy of declarative query languages like SQL and query optimization which havemade relational databases so successful. To this end; our proposed demo is not yet anotherdata mining system; but of a new paradigm in data mining-mining with constraints; as theimportant first step towards supporting ad-hoc mining in DBMS. In this demo; we will show aprototype exploratory mining system that implements constraint-based mining query …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,47
Snakes and sandwiches: Optimal clustering strategies for a data warehouse,HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Physical layout of data is a crucial determinant of performance in a data warehouse.The optimal clustering of data on disk; for minimizing expected I/O; depends on the queryworkload. In practice; we often have a reasonable sense of the likelihood of different classesof queries; eg; 40% of the queries concern calls made from some specific telephone numberin some month. In this paper; we address the problem of finding an optimal clustering ofrecords of a fact table on disk; given an expected workload in the form of a probabilitydistribution over query classes. Attributes in a data warehouse fact table typically havehierarchies defined on them (by means of auxiliary dimension tables). The product of thedimensional hierarchy levels forms a lattice and leads to a natural notion of query classes.Optimal clustering in this context is a combinatorially explosive problem with a huge …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,46
Incremental cluster evolution tracking from highly dynamic network data,Pei Lee; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Evangelos E Milios,Dynamic networks are commonly found in the current web age. In scenarios like socialnetworks and social media; dynamic networks are noisy; are of large-scale and evolvequickly. In this paper; we focus on the cluster evolution tracking problem on highly dynamicnetworks; with clear application to event evolution tracking. There are several previousworks on data stream clustering using a node-by-node approach for maintaining clusters.However; handling of bulk updates; ie; a subgraph at a time; is critical for achievingacceptable performance over very large highly dynamic networks. We propose a subgraph-by-subgraph incremental tracking framework for cluster evolution in this paper. To effectivelyillustrate the techniques in our framework; we consider the event evolution tracking task insocial streams as an application; where a social stream and an event are modeled as a …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,45
Trajectory anonymity in publishing personal mobility data,Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Hui Wendy Wang,Abstract Recent years have witnessed pervasive use of location-aware devices such asGSM mobile phones; GPS-enabled PDAs; location sensors; and active RFID tags. The useof these devices generates a huge collection of spatio-temporal data; variously calledmoving object data; trajectory data; or moblity data. These data can be used for various dataanalysis purposes such as city traffic control; mobility management; urban planning; andlocation-based service advertisements. Clearly; the spatio-temporal data so collected mayhelp an attacker to discover personal and sensitive information like user habits; socialcustoms; religious and sexual preferences of individuals. Consequently; it raises seriousconcerns about privacy. Simply replacing users' real identifiers (name; SSN; etc.) withpseudonyms is insufficient to guarantee anonymity. The problem is that due to the …,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2011,45
To do or not to do: the dilemma of disclosing anonymized data,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng; Ganesh Ramesh,Abstract Decision makers of companies often face the dilemma of whether to release datafor knowledge discovery; vis a vis the risk of disclosing proprietary or sensitive information.While there are various" sanitization" methods; in this paper we focus on anonymization;given its widespread use in practice. We give due diligence to the question of" just how safethe anonymized data is"; in terms of protecting the true identities of the data objects. Weconsider both the scenarios when the hacker has no information; and more realistically;when the hacker may have partial information about items in the domain. We conduct ouranalyses in the context of frequent set mining. We propose to capture the prior knowledge ofthe hacker by means of a belief function; where an educated guess of the frequency of eachitem is assumed. For various classes of belief functions; which correspond to different …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,44
TIMBER: A native system for querying XML,Stelios Paparizos; Shurug Al-Khalifa; Adriane Chapman; HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Andrew Nierman; Jignesh M Patel; Divesh Srivastava; Nuwee Wiwatwattana; Yuqing Wu; Cong Yu,Abstract XML has become ubiquitous; and XML data has to be managed in databases. Thecurrent industry standard is to map XML data into relational tables and store this informationin a relational database. Such mappings create both expressive power problems andperformance problems. In the T IMBER [7] project we are exploring the issues involved instoring XML in native format. We believe that the key intellectual contribution of this system isa comprehensive set-at-a-time query processing ability in a native XML store; with all thestandard components of relational query processing; including algebraic rewriting and acost-based optimizer.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,43
An epistemic foundation for logic programming with uncertainty,Laks VS Lakshmanan,The need for uncertainty management in database and knowledge-base systems hasmotivated much of the work on the logical foundations of reasoning with uncertainknowledge. Numerous formalisms have been proposed for modeling uncertainty (seeSection 6) and our concern in this paper is primarily with probabilistic extensions to logicprogramming and deductive databases. Substantial work has been done in this area (seeSection 6 for a brief survey). One criticism (eg see [17]) leveled against probabilistieapproaches for uncertainty management is how the probabilities representing degree oflikelihood can be derived. We note; following Pearl [17]; that when beliefs (and doubts) areformed by an agent; the agent must have had underlying scenarios or situations in thecontext of which the facts or rules are believed (or doubted).

Privacy-preserving data mining from outsourced databases,Fosca Giannotti; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Anna Monreale; Dino Pedreschi; Hui Wendy Wang,Abstract Spurred by developments such as cloud computing; there has been considerablerecent interest in the paradigm of data mining-as-service: a company (data owner) lacking inexpertise or computational resources can outsource its mining needs to a third party serviceprovider (server). However; both the outsourced database and the knowledge extract from itby data mining are considered private property of the data owner. To protect corporateprivacy; the data owner transforms its data and ships it to the server; sends mining queries tothe server; and recovers the true patterns from the extracted patterns received from theserver. In this paper; we study the problem of outsourcing a data mining task within acorporate privacy-preserving framework. We propose a scheme for privacy-preservingoutsourced mining which offers a formal protection against information disclosure; and …,*,2011,39
Efficient OLAP query processing in distributed data warehouses,Michael O Akinde; Michael H Böhlen; Theodore Johnson; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract The success of Internet applications has led to an explosive growth in the demandfor bandwidth from ISPs. Managing an IP network requires collecting and analyzing networkdata; such as flowlevel traffc statistics. Such analyses can typically be expressed as OLAPqueries; eg; correlated aggregate queries and data cubes. Current day OLAP tools for thistask assume the availability of the data in a centralized data warehouse. However; theinherently distributed nature of data collection and the huge amount of data extracted ateach collection point make it impractical to gather all data at a centralized site. One solutionis to maintain a distributed data warehouse; consisting of local data warehouses at eachcollection point and a coordinator site; with most of the processing being performed at thelocal sites. In this paper; we consider the problem of efficient evaluation of OLAP queries …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,37
The bang for the buck: fair competitive viral marketing from the host perspective,Wei Lu; Francesco Bonchi; Amit Goyal; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract The key algorithmic problem in viral marketing is to identify a set of influential users(called seeds) in a social network; who; when convinced to adopt a product; shall influenceother users in the network; leading to a large number of adoptions. When two or moreplayers compete with similar products on the same network we talk about competitive viralmarketing; which so far has been studied exclusively from the perspective of one of thecompeting players. In this paper we propose and study the novel problem of competitiveviral marketing from the perspective of the host; ie; the owner of the social network platform.The host sells viral marketing campaigns as a service to its customers; keeping control of theselection of seeds. Each company specifies its budget and the host allocates the seedsaccordingly. From the host's perspective; it is important not only to choose the seeds to …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,36
On social event organization,Keqian Li; Wei Lu; Smriti Bhagat; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Cong Yu,Abstract Online platforms; such as Meetup and Plancast; have recently become popular forplanning gatherings and event organization. However; there is a surprising lack of studieson how to effectively and efficiently organize social events for a large group of peoplethrough such platforms. In this paper; we study the key computational problem involved inorganization of social events; to our best knowledge; for the first time. We propose the SocialEvent Organization (SEO) problem as one of assigning a set of events for a group of users toattend; where the users are socially connected with each other and have innate levels ofinterest in those events. As a first step toward Social Event Organization; we introduce aformal definition of a restricted version of the problem and show that it is NP-hard and is hardto approximate. We propose efficient heuristic algorithms that improve upon simple …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,35
Expressive power of an algebra for data mining,Toon Calders; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng; Jan Paredaens,Abstract The relational data model has simple and clear foundations on which significanttheoretical and systems research has flourished. By contrast; most research on data mininghas focused on algorithmic issues. A major open question is: what's an appropriatefoundation for data mining; which can accommodate disparate mining tasks&quest; Weaddress this problem by presenting a database model and an algebra for data mining. Thedatabase model is based on the 3W-model introduced by Johnson et al.[2000]. This modelrelied on black box mining operators. A main contribution of this article is to open up theseblack boxes; by using generic operators in a data mining algebra. Two key operators in thisalgebra are regionize; which creates regions (or models) from data tuples; and a restrictedform of looping called mining loop. Then the resulting data mining algebra MA is studied …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,33
Comprec-trip: A composite recommendation system for travel planning,Min Xie; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Peter T Wood,Classical recommender systems provide users with a list of recommendations where eachrecommendation consists of a single item; eg; a book or a DVD. However; applications suchas travel planning can benefit from a system capable of recommending packages of items;under a user-specified budget and in the form of sets or sequences. In this context; there is aneed for a system that can recommend top-k packages for the user to choose from. In thispaper; we propose a novel system; CompRec-Trip; which can automatically generatecomposite recommendations for travel planning. The system leverages rating informationfrom underlying recommender systems; allows flexible package configuration andincorporates users' cost budgets on both time and money. Furthermore; the proposedCompRec-Trip system has a rich graphical user interface which allows users to customize …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,31
On domination game analysis for microeconomic data mining,Zhenjie Zhang; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Game theory is a powerful tool for analyzing the competitions among manufacturersin a market. In this article; we present a study on combining game theory and data mining byintroducing the concept of domination game analysis. We present a multidimensional marketmodel; where every dimension represents one attribute of a commodity. Every product orcustomer is represented by a point in the multidimensional space; and a product is said to“dominate” a customer if all of its attributes can satisfy the requirements of the customer. Theexpected market share of a product is measured by the expected number of the buyers inthe customers; all of which are equally likely to buy any product dominating him. A Nashequilibrium is a configuration of the products achieving stable expected market shares for allproducts. We prove that Nash equilibrium in such a model can be computed in …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2009,30
Preservation of patterns and input-output privacy,Shaofeng Bu; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng; Ganesh Ramesh,Privacy preserving data mining so far has mainly focused on the data collector scenariowhere individuals supply their personal data to an untrusted collector in exchange for value.In this scenario; random perturbation has proved to be very successful. An equallycompelling; but overlooked scenario; is that of a data custodian; which either owns the dataor is explicitly entrusted with ensuring privacy of individual data. In this scenario; we showthat it is possible to minimize disclosure while guaranteeing no outcome change. Weconduct our investigation in the context of building a decision tree and proposetransformations that preserve the exact decision tree. We show with a detailed set ofexperiments that they provide substantial protection to both input data privacy and miningoutput privacy.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

A declarative semantics for behavioral inheritance and conflict resolution,Hasan M Jamil; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract We propose a novel semantics for object-oriented deductive databases in thedirection of F-logic to logically account for behavioral inheritance; conflict resolution inmultiple inheritance hierarchies; and overriding. We introduce the ideas of withdrawal;locality; and inheritability of properties (ie methods and signatures). Exploiting these ideas;we develop a declarative semantics of behavioral inheritance and overriding without havingto resort to non-monotonic reasoning. Conflict resolution in our framework can be achievedboth via specification and by detection. The possibility of specification-based conflictresolution through withdrawal allows users to state inheritance preference. We present aformal account of the semantics of our language by defining a model theory; proof theoryand a fixpoint theory. We also show that the different characterizations of our language …,Proceedings of the 12th International Logic Programming Symposium,2001,30
The segment support map: Scalable mining of frequent itemsets,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Raymond T Ng,ABSTRACT Since its introduction; frequent set mining has been generalized to many forms;including online mining with Carma; and constrained mining with CAP. Regardless;scalability is always an important aspect of the development. In this paper; we propose anovel structure called segment support map to help mining of frequent itemsets of thevarious forms. A light-weight structure; the segment support map improves the performanceof frequent-set mining algorithms by:(i) obtaining sharper bounds on the support of itemsets;and/or (ii) better exploiting properties of constraints. Our experimental results show theeffectiveness of the segment support map.,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2000,28
On querying spreadsheets,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Subbu N Subramanian; Nita Goyal; Ravi Krishnamurthy,Considers the problem of querying the data in applications such as spreadsheets and wordprocessors. This problem has several motivations from the perspective of data integration;interoperability and OLAP. We provide an architecture for realizing interoperability amongsuch diverse applications and address the challenges that arise specifically in the context ofquerying data stored in spreadsheet applications. A fundamental challenge is the lack of awell-defined schema. We propose a framework in which the user can specify the layout ofdata in a spreadsheet; based on his perception of the important concepts underlying thatdata. Layout specifications can be viewed as the" physical schema" of a spreadsheet. Wemotivate the concept of an abstract database machine (ADM) that uses the layoutspecifications to provide a relational view of the data in spreadsheet applications and …,Data Engineering; 1998.

Mdl summarization with holes,Shaofeng Bu; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Summarization of query results is an important problem for many OLAPapplications. The Minimum Description Length principle has been applied in various studiesto provide summaries. In this paper; we consider a new approach of applying the MDLprinciple. We study the problem of finding summaries of the form S Θ H for kd cubes with treehierarchies. The S part generalizes the query results; while the H part describes all theexceptions to the generalizations. The optimization problem is to minimize the combinedcardinalities of S and H. We first characterize the problem by showing that solving the 1-dproblem can be done in time linear to the size of hierarchy; but solving the 2-d problem is NP-hard. We then develop three different heuristics; based on a greedy approach; a dynamicprogramming approach and a quadratic programming approach. We conduct a …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,27
A parametric approach to deductive databases with uncertainty,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Nematollaah Shiri,Abstract Numerous frameworks have been proposed in recent years for deductivedatabases with uncertainty. These frameworks differ in (i) their underlying notion ofuncertainty;(ii) the way in which uncertainties are manipulated; and (iii) the way in whichuncertainty is associated with the facts and rules of a program. On the basis of (iii); theseframeworks can be classified into implication based (IB) and annotation based (AB)frameworks. In this paper; we develop a generic framework called the parametric frameworkas a unifying umbrella for IB frameworks. We develop the declarative; fixpoint; and proof-theoretic semantics of programs in the parametric framework and show their equivalence.Using this as a basis; we study the query optimization problem of containment of conjunctivequeries in this framework; and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for …,*,1996,27
Approximate closest community search in networks,Xin Huang; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng,Abstract Recently; there has been significant interest in the study of the community searchproblem in social and information networks: given one or more query nodes; find denselyconnected communities containing the query nodes. However; most existing studies do notaddress the" free rider" issue; that is; nodes far away from query nodes and irrelevant tothem are included in the detected community. Some state-of-the-art models have attemptedto address this issue; but not only are their formulated problems NP-hard; they do not admitany approximations without restrictive assumptions; which may not always hold in practice.In this paper; given an undirected graph G and a set of query nodes Q; we study communitysearch using the k-truss based community model. We formulate our problem of finding aclosest truss community (CTC); as finding a connected k-truss subgraph with the largest k …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,25
Complex group-by queries for XML,Chaitanya Gokhale; Nitin Gupta; Pranav Kumar; Laks VS Lakshmanan; R Ng; B Aditya Prakash,The popularity of XML as a data exchange standard has led to the emergence of powerfulXML query languages like XQuery and studies on XML query optimization. Of late; there isconsiderable interest in analytical processing of XML data. As pointed out by Borkar andCarey; even for data integration; there is a compelling need for performing various group-bystyle aggregate operations. A core operator needed for analytics is the group-by operator;which is widely used in relational as well as OLAP database applications. XQuery requiresgroup-by operations to be simulated using nesting.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,26
XML Interoperability.,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri,ABSTRACT We study the problem of interoperability among XML data sources. We proposea lightweight infrastructure for this purpose that derives its inspiration from the recentsemantic web initiative. Our approach does not require either source-to-source or source-to-global mappings. Instead; it is based on enriching local sources with semantic declarationsso as to enable interoperability. These declarations expose the semantics of the informationcontent of sources by mapping the concepts present therein to a common (applicationspecific) vocabulary; in the spirit of RDF. In addition to this infrastructure; we discuss toolsthat may assist in generating semantic declarations; and formulation of global queries andaddress some interesting issues in query processing and optimization.,WebDB,2003,26
From competition to complementarity: comparative influence diffusion and maximization,Wei Lu; Wei Chen; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Influence maximization is a well-studied problem that asks for a small set ofinfluential users from a social network; such that by targeting them as early adopters; theexpected total adoption through influence cascades over the network is maximized.However; almost all prior work focuses on cascades of a single propagating entity or purely-competitive entities. In this work; we propose the Comparative Independent Cascade (Com-IC) model that covers the full spectrum of entity interactions from competition tocomplementarity. In Com-IC; users' adoption decisions depend not only on edge-levelinformation propagation; but also on a node-level automaton whose behavior is governedby a set of model parameters; enabling our model to capture not only competition; but alsocomplementarity; to any possible degree. We study two natural optimization problems …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,25
From group recommendations to group formation,Senjuti Basu Roy; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Rui Liu,Abstract There has been significant recent interest in the area of group recommendations;where; given groups of users of a recommender system; one wants to recommend top-$ k $items to a group that maximize the satisfaction of the group members; according to a chosensemantics of group satisfaction. Examples semantics of satisfaction of a recommendeditemset to a group include the so-called least misery (LM) and aggregate voting (AV). Weconsider the complementary problem of how to form groups such that the users in theformed groups are most satisfied with the suggested top-k recommendations. We assumethat the recommendations will be generated according to one of the two grouprecommendation semantics--LM or AV. Rather than assuming groups are given; or rely onad hoc group formation dynamics; our framework allows a strategic approach for forming …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2015,25
Efficient top-k query answering using cached views,Min Xie; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Peter T Wood,Abstract Top-k query processing has recently received a significant amount of attention dueto its wide application in information retrieval; multimedia search and recommendationgeneration. In this work; we consider the problem of how to efficiently answer a top-k queryby using previously cached query results. While there has been some previous work on thisproblem; existing algorithms suffer from either limited scope or lack of scalability. In thispaper; we propose two novel algorithms for handling this problem. The first algorithm LPTA+provides significantly improved efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art LPTA algorithm[26] by reducing the number of expensive linear programming problems that need to besolved. The second algorithm we propose leverages a standard space partition-based indexstructure in order to avoid many of the drawbacks of LPTA-based algorithms; thereby …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,25
Uncertain deductive databases: a hybrid approach,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri,Abstract Uncertainty in deductive databases and logic programming has been modeledusing a variety of (numeric and non-numeric) formalisms in the past; including probabilistic;possibilistic; and fuzzy set-theoretic approaches; and many valued logic programming. Inthis paper; we consider a hybrid approach to the modeling of uncertainty in deductivedatabases. Our model; called deductive IST (DIST) is based on an extension of theInformation Source Tracking (IST) model; recently proposed for relational databases. TheDIST model permits uncertainty to be modeled and manipulated in essentially qualitativeterms with an option to convert qualitative expressions of uncertainty into numeric form (eg;probabilities). An uncertain deductive database is modeled as a Horn clause program in theDIST framework; where each fact and rule is annotated with an expression indicating the “ …,Information Systems,1997,24
What-if OLAP queries with changing dimensions,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Alex Russakovsky; Vaishnavi Sashikanth,In a data warehouse; real-world activities can trigger changes to dimensions and theirhierarchical structure. Eg; organizations can be reorganized over time causing changes toreporting structure. Product pricing changes in select markets can result in changes tobundled options in those markets. Much of the previous work on trend analysis on datawarehouses has mainly focused on efficient evaluation of complex aggregations (eg; datacube) and data-driven hypothetical scenarios. In this paper; we consider hypotheticalscenarios driven by changes to dimension hierarchies and introduce the notion ofperspectives. Perspectives are parameters such as time or location that drive changes inother dimensions. We demonstrate how perspectives aid in capturing a whole suite of what-if analysis queries. We propose various semantics for OLAP queries under perspectives …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,23
Viral marketing meets social advertising: Ad allocation with minimum regret,Cigdem Aslay; Wei Lu; Francesco Bonchi; Amit Goyal; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Social advertisement is one of the fastest growing sectors in the digitaladvertisement landscape: ads in the form of promoted posts are shown in the feed of usersof a social networking platform; along with normal social posts; if a user clicks on a promotedpost; the host (social network owner) is paid a fixed amount from the advertiser. In thiscontext; allocating ads to users is typically performed by maximizing click-through-rate; ie;the likelihood that the user will click on the ad. However; this simple strategy fails to leveragethe fact the ads can propagate virally through the network; from endorsing users to theirfollowers. In this paper; we study the problem of allocating ads to users through the viral-marketing lenses. We show that allocation that takes into account the propensity of ads forviral propagation can achieve significantly better performance. However; uncontrolled …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,22
On semantic query optimization in deductive databases,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Rokia Missaoui,The focus is semantic query optimization in the presence of integrity constraints such asinclusion dependencies and context dependencies (CDs). The authors provide themotivation for the type of integrity constraints considered and for the work at large. Theyintroduce CDs formally and illustrate their power in capturing semantics with an example. Aninference mechanism is described for reasoning with these constraints. Sufficient conditionsfor testing redundancy of atoms in rules and rules in programs are described; andpolynomial time algorithms are provided for detecting and eliminating such redundancies.The technique uniformly applies to recursive as well as nonrecursive queries. The approachis illustrated with examples. The discussion and examples are presented in terms ofrecursive rules only.,Data Engineering; 1992. Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on,1992,22
Approximation analysis of influence spread in social networks,Amit Goyal; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,Abstract: In the context of influence propagation in a social graph; we can identify threeorthogonal dimensions-the number of seed nodes activated at the beginning (known asbudget); the expected number of activated nodes at the end of the propagation (known asexpected spread or coverage); and the time taken for the propagation. We can constrain oneor two of these and try to optimize the third. In their seminal paper; Kempe et al. constrainedthe budget; left time unconstrained; and maximized the coverage: this problem is known asInfluence Maximization. In this paper; we study alternative optimization problems which arenaturally motivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketing campaigns. In thefirst problem; termed Minimum Target Set Selection (or MINTSS for short); a coveragethreshold n is given and the task is to find the minimum size seed set such that by …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1008.2005,2010,21
On dual mining: From patterns to circumstances; and back,Gösta Grahne; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Xiaohong Wang; Ming Hao Xie,Previous work on frequent item set mining has focused on finding all itemsets that arefrequent in a specified part of a database. We motivate the dual question of finding underwhat circumstances a given item set satisfies a pattern of interest (eg; frequency) in adatabase. Circumstances form a lattice that generalizes the instance lattice associated withdatacube. Exploiting this; we adapt known cube algorithms and propose our own; minCirc;for mining the strongest (eg; minimal) circumstances under which an itemset satisfies apattern. Our experiments show that minCirc is competitive with the adapted algorithms. Wemotivate mining queries involving migration between item set and circumstance lattices andpropose the notion of Armstrong Basis as a structure that provides efficient support for suchmigration queries; as well as a simple algorithm for computing it.,Data Engineering; 2001.

Declarative Entity Resolution via Matching Dependencies and Answer Set Programs.,Zeinab Bahmani; Leopoldo E Bertossi; Solmaz Kolahi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Entity resolution (ER) is an important and common problem in data cleaning. It isabout identifying and merging records in a database that represent the same real-worldentity. Recently; matching dependencies (MDs) have been introduced and investigated asdeclarative rules that specify ER. An ER process induced by MDs over a dirty instance leadsto multiple clean instances; in general. In this work; we present disjunctive answer setprograms (with stable model semantics) that capture through their models the class ofalternative clean instances obtained after an ER process based on MDs. With theseprograms; we can obtain clean answers to queries; ie those that are invariant under theclean instances; by skeptically reasoning from the program. We investigate the ER programsin terms of expressive power for the ER task at hand. As an important special and …,KR,2012,20
ORLOG: A logic for semantic object-oriented models,M Hasan Jamil; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract We argue that powerful models for supporting next generation database andknowledge-base applications can be built by extending semantic data models (SDMs) in thedirection of Object Oriented (OO) modeling. SDMs possess several of the OO features; aswell as additional useful features (eg; relationships and the associated constraints) whichhave no counterpart in the OO models. We present a conceptual semantic OO data modelcalled Object Relationship (OR) model. OR model captures most of the semantic modelingas well as OO modeling features needed for the new database applications. As a secondstep; we lay down the logical foundations of the OR model and develop a logical languagecalled ORLOG in the spirit of deductive database languages such as Datalog; providing abasis for high level OO programming. Use of a logical language like Orlog opens up the …,Proc. of the First Intern. Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,1992,20

GuruMine is built upon a novel pattern miningframework for leaders discovery; that we introduced in [1]. In particular; we consider socialnetworks where users perform actions. Actions may be as simple as tagging resources (urls)as in del. icio. us; rating songs as in Yahoo! Music; or movies as in Yahoo! Movies; or usersbuying gadgets such as cameras; handholds; etc. and blogging a review on the gadgets.The assumption is that actions performed by a user can be seen by their network friends.Users seeing their friends actions are sometimes tempted to perform those actions. On thebasis of the propagation of such influence; in [1] we provided various notion of leaders …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,19

Unfortunately; HTMLis mainly presentation oriented and hard to query. In this paper; we develop a system toextract desired information (records) from thousands of HTML documents; starting from asmall set of examples. Duplicates in the result are automatically detected and eliminated.We propose a novel method to estimate the current coverage of results by the system; basedon capture-recapture models with unequal capture probabilities. We also proposetechniques for estimating the error rate of the extracted information and an interactive thetechnique for enhancing information quality.

Structural query optimization—a uniform framework for semantic query optimization in deductive databases,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Héctor J Hernández,Recursion is at once a source of increased expressive power and high complexity for querylanguages like Datalog. A major question therefore is efficient processing of recursivequeries. The first line of attack to process a recursive Datalog program P is to try to see if wecan remove its recursivity; this is equivalent to testing whether there is a nonrecursiveDatalog program which is equivalent to P. If this is the case; then P is said to bebounded[CGKV; GMSV; I; Nl; NS]. In general; the problem of testing whether a Datalogprogram is bounded is known to be undecidable even for linear programs with one idbpredicate [GMSV]. Some other decidable and undecidable results on boundedness ofDatalog programs are presented in [A; CGKV; K; Nl; NS; S; Var]. For a detailed summary ofthe present state-of-the-art of this problem see [KA].

TopRecs: Top-k algorithms for item-based collaborative filtering,Mohammad Khabbaz; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Recommender systems help users find their items of interest from large datacollections with little effort. Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most popular approachesfor making recommendations. While significant work has been done on improving accuracyof CF methods; some of the most popular CF approaches are limited in terms of scalabilityand efficiency. The size of data in modern recommender systems is growing rapidly in termsof both new users and items and new ratings. Item-based recommendation is one of the CFapproaches used widely in practice. It computes and uses an item-item similarity matrix inorder to predict unknown ratings. Previous works on item-based CF method confirm itsusefulness in providing high quality top-k results. In this paper; we design a scalablealgorithm for top-k recommendations using this method. We achieve this by probabilistic …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,18
Personalizing xml search in pimento,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Irini Fundulaki; Laks VS Lakshmanan,XML search is increasing in popularity as more and larger XML repositories are becomingavailable. The accuracy of XML search varies across different systems and a lot of effort isput into designing scoring functions tailored to specific users and datasets. We argue thatthere is no one scoring function that fits all and advocate incorporating user profiles into XMLsearch to personalize query answers by accounting for user profiles. First; we propose aframework for defining user profiles and for enforcing them during query processing.Second; we adapt the well-known top-k pruning to account for user profiles. Finally; wepresent effectiveness and efficiency experiments which show that query personalization inXML search dramatically improves the accuracy of query results while incurring negligibleprocessing overhead.

Discovering Leaders in a Social Network,*,As the popularity of the Internet has increased; so has the prevalence of social networking websitesand applications. Generally speaking; a social network refers to an application or service thatfacilitates the building online communities of people who share interests and activities; or whoare interested in exploring the interests and activities of others. Many social network servicesare web-based and provide a variety of ways for users to interact; such as e-mail and instantmessaging services. Some examples of social networking websites are del.icio.us (http://del.icio.us./); facebook (http://www.facebook.com); Yahoo! Movies (http://movies.yahoo.com);Yahoo!

On efficient recommendations for online exchange markets,Zeinab Abbassi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Presently several marketplace applications over online social networks are gainingpopularity. An important class of applications is online market exchange of items. Examplesinclude peerflix. com and readitswapit. co. uk. We model this problem as a social networkwhere each user has two associated lists. The item list consists of items the user is willing togive away to other users. The wish list consists of items the user is interested in receiving. Atransaction involves a user giving an item to another user. Users are motivated to transact inexpectation of realizing their wishes. Wishes may be realized by a pair of users swappingitems corresponding to each other's wishes; but more generally by means of usersexchanging items through a cycle; where each user gives an item to the next user in thecycle; in accordance with the receiving user's wishes. The problem we consider is how to …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,17
Geo-spatial Clustering with User-Specified Constraints,Anthony KH Tung; Raymond T Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Capturing application semantics and allowing a human analyst to express his focusin mining have been the motivation for several recent studies on constrained mining. In thispaper; we introduce and study the problem of constrained clustering—finding clusters thatsatisfy certain user-specified constraints. We argue that this problem arises naturally inpractice. Two types of constraints are discussed in this paper. The first type of constraints areimposed by physical obstacles that exist in the region of clustering. The second type ofconstraints are SQL constraints which every cluster must satisfy. We provide a prelimaryintroduction to both types of constraints and discuss some techniques for solving them.,Proceedings of the First International Conference on Multimedia Data Mining,2000,17
Optimal recommendations under attraction; aversion; and social influence,Wei Lu; Stratis Ioannidis; Smriti Bhagat; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract People's interests are dynamically evolving; often affected by external factors suchas trends promoted by the media or adopted by their friends. In this work; we model interestevolution through dynamic interest cascades: we consider a scenario where a user'sinterests may be affected by (a) the interests of other users in her social circle; as well as (b)suggestions she receives from a recommender system. In the latter case; we model userreactions through either attraction or aversion towards past suggestions. We study thisinterest evolution process; and the utility accrued by recommendations; as a function of thesystem's recommendation strategy. We show that; in steady state; the optimal strategy canbe computed as the solution of a semi-definite program (SDP). Using datasets of userratings; we provide evidence for the existence of aversion and attraction in real-life data …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,16
Hierarchical or relational?

Due to the recently increased importance of X. 500/LDAPdirectories; which are hierarchical; and the prevalence of aggregation hierarchies indatacubes; there is now renewed interest in the hierarchical organization of data. Wedevelop a framework for a modern hierarchical data model; substantially improved from theoriginal version by taking advantage of the lessons learned in the relational databasecontext.

Influence maximization with bandits,Sharan Vaswani; Laks Lakshmanan; Mark Schmidt,Abstract: We consider the problem of\emph {influence maximization}; the problem ofmaximizing the number of people that become aware of a product by finding thebest'setofseed'users to expose the product to. Most prior work on this topic assumes that we knowthe probability of each user influencing each other user; or we have data that lets usestimate these influences. However; this information is typically not initially available or isdifficult to obtain. To avoid this assumption; we adopt a combinatorial multi-armed banditparadigm that estimates the influence probabilities as we sequentially try different seed sets.We establish bounds on the performance of this procedure under the existing edge-levelfeedback as well as a novel and more realistic node-level feedback. Beyond our theoreticalresults; we describe a practical implementation and experimentally demonstrate its …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.00024,2015,14

While research in recommender systems has mostly focused onimproving the accuracy of recommendations; in this paper; we look at the" flip" side of a RS.That is; instead of improving existing recommender algorithms; we ask whether we can usean existing operational RS to launch a targeted marketing campaign. To this end; wepropose a novel problem called RecMax that aims to select a set of" seed" users for amarketing campaign for a new product; such that if they endorse the product by providingrelatively high ratings; the number of other users to whom the product is recommended bythe underlying RS algorithm is maximum. We motivate RecMax with real world applications.We show that seeding can make a substantial difference; if done carefully.

On bounding-schemas for LDAP directories,Sihem Amer-Yahia; HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract As our world gets more networked; ever increasing amounts of information arebeing stored in LDAP directories. While LDAP directories have considerable flexibility in themodeling and retrieval of information for network applications; the notion of schema theyprovide for enabling consistent and coherent representation of directory information is ratherweak. In this paper; we propose an expressive notion of bounding-schemas for LDAPdirectories; and illustrate their practical utility. Bounding-schemas are based on lower boundand upper bound specifications for the content and structure of an LDAP directory. Given abounding-schema specification; we present algorithms to efficiently determine:(i) if an LDAPdirectory is legal wrt the bounding-schema; and (ii) if directory insertions and deletionspreserve legality.

Truss decomposition of probabilistic graphs: Semantics and algorithms,Xin Huang; Wei Lu; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract A key operation in network analysis is the discovery of cohesive subgraphs. Thenotion of $ k $-truss has gained considerable popularity in this regard; based on its richstructure and efficient computability. However; many complex networks such as social;biological and communication networks feature uncertainty; best modeled usingprobabilities. Unfortunately the problem of discovering k-trusses in probabilistic graphs hasreceived little attention to date. In this paper; given a probabilistic graph G; number k andparameter γ--(0; 1]; we define a (k; γ)-truss as a maximal connected subgraph H⊆ G; inwhich for each edge; the probability that it is contained in at least (k-2) triangles is at least γ.We develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for decomposing a probabilisticgraph into such maximal (k; γ)-trusses.

In this setting; amediated global schema is unrealistic. Yet; users/applications wish to query the databasesvia one peer using its schema. We have recently developed HepToX; a P2P HeterogeneousXML database system. A key idea is that whenever a peer enters the system; it establishesan acquaintance with a small number of peer databases; possibly with different schema. Thepeer administrator provides correspondences between the local schema and theacquaintance schema using an informal and intuitive notation of arrows and boxes.

Efficient parallel algorithms for finding chordless cycles in graphs,N Chandrasekharan; VS Lakshmanan; Muralidhar Medidi,166 N. Chandrasekharan; VS Lakshmanan & M. Medidi A graph is said to be chordal(triangulated) if it has no chordless cycle of length greater than or equal to 4 (Golumbic [2]). Chordalgraphs arise in the study of sparse matrices [3] and also in acyclic relational database schemes[4]. A graph G is said to be weakly triangulated if both G and the complement of G have no chordlesscycles of length greater than or equal to 5 (Hayward [5]). Clearly; an algorithmic solution to theproblem CHORDLESS CYCLE for fixed k will pro- vide recognition algorithms for chordal andweakly triangulated graphs. We now briefly recall existing algorithmic (both sequential andparallel) results for detecting chordless cycles of length greater than or equal to 4 and 5.

However; inheritance has resisted many serious attempts at asatisfactory logical rendition.

Composite recommendations: from items to packages,Min Xie; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Peter T Wood,Abstract Classical recommender systems provide users with a list of recommendationswhere each recommendation consists of a single item; eg; a book or DVD. However; severalapplications can benefit from a system capable of recommending packages of items; in theform of sets. Sample applications include travel planning with a limited budget (price or time)and twitter users wanting to select worthwhile tweeters to follow; given that they can dealwith only a bounded number of tweets. In these contexts; there is a need for a system thatcan recommend the top-k packages for the user to choose from. Motivated by theseapplications; we consider composite recommendations; where each recommendationcomprises a set of items.

SOCQET: semantic OLAP with compressed cube and summarization,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jian Pei; Yan Zhao,Data warehouses form the essential infrastructure for many data analysis tasks. A coreoperation in a data warehouse is the construction of a data cube; which can be viewed as amulti-level; multi-dimensional database with aggregate data at multiple granularity.

On the Difference between Navigating Semi-structured Data and Querying It,Gösta Grahne; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Currently; there is tremendous interest in semi-structured (SS) data management.This is spurred by data sources; such as the ACeDB [29]; that are inherently less rigidlystructured than traditional DBMS; by WWW documents where no hard rules or constraintsare imposed and “anything goes;” and by integration of information coming from disparatesources exhibiting considerable differences in the way they structure information. Significantstrides have been made in the development of data models and query languages [2; 11; 17;6; 7]; and to some extent; the theory of queries on semi-structured data [1; 23; 3; 13; 9].

Evaluation of regular nonlinear recursions by deductive database techniques,Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Nonlinear recursion is one of the most challenging classes of logic programs forefficient evaluation in logic programming systems. We identify one popular class ofnonlinear recursion; regular nonlinear recursion; and investigate its efficient implementationby a deductive database approach. The approach performs a detailed query bindinganalysis based on query information; constraint information and the structure of a recursion;selects an appropriate predicate evaluation order and generates an efficient queryevaluation plan. Interesting query evaluation techniques; such as chain-following; chain-split; and constraint pushing; are developed for the efficient evaluation of different kinds ofqueries. Furthermore; the technique can be extended to the evaluation of regular nonlinearrecursions in HiLog and F-logic programs. The study not only presents a method for the …,Information Systems,1995,8
Generating top-k packages via preference elicitation,Min Xie; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Peter T Wood,Abstract There are several applications; such as play lists of songs or movies; and shoppingcarts; where users are interested in finding top-k packages; consisting of sets of items. Inresponse to this need; there has been a recent flurry of activity around extending classicalrecommender systems (RS); which are effective at recommending individual items; torecommend packages; or sets of items. The few recent proposals for package RS suffer fromone of the following drawbacks: they either rely on hard constraints which may be difficult tobe specified exactly by the user or on returning Pareto-optimal packages which are toonumerous for the user to sift through. To overcome these limitations; we propose analternative approach for finding personalized top-k packages for users; by capturing users'preferences over packages using a linear utility function which the system learns.

Ourapproach is based on (a) updaters providing an update certificate with each databaseupdate; and (b) the database system verifying the correctness of the update certificateprovided before performing the update. We formalize a certificate as a (challenge; response)pair; and characterize good certificates as those that are easy for updaters to provide and;when correct; give the system enough confidence that the update was indeed intended …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,7
Making designer schemas with colors,Nuwee Wiwatwattana; HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,XML schema design has two opposing goals: elimination of update anomalies requires thatthe schema be as normalized as possible; yet higher query performance and simpler queryexpression are often obtained through the use of schemas that permit redundancy. In thispaper; we show that the recently proposed MCT data model; which extends XML by addingcolors; can be used to address this dichotomy effectively. Specifically; we formalize theintuition of anomaly avoidance in MCT using notions of node normal and edge normalforms; and the goal of efficient query processing using notions of association recoverabilityand direct recoverability. We develop algorithms for transforming design specifications givenas ER diagrams into MCT schemas that are in a node or edge normal form and satisfyassociation or direct recoverability.

Revisiting the stop-and-stare algorithms for influence maximization,Keke Huang; Sibo Wang; Glenn Bevilacqua; Xiaokui Xiao; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Influence maximization is a combinatorial optimization problem that finds importantapplications in viral marketing; feed recommendation; etc. Recent research has led to anumber of scalable approximation algorithms for influence maximization; such as TIM+ andIMM; and more recently; SSA and D-SSA. The goal of this paper is to conduct a rigoroustheoretical and experimental analysis of SSA and D-SSA and compare them against thepreceding algorithms. In doing so; we uncover inaccuracies in previously reported technicalresults on the accuracy and efficiency of SSA and D-SSA; which we set right. We alsoattempt to reproduce the original experiments on SSA and D-SSA; based on which weprovide interesting empirical insights. Our evaluation confirms some results reported fromthe original experiments; but it also reveals anomalies in some other results and sheds …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,6
Diffusion independent semi-bandit influence maximization,Sharan Vaswani; Branislav Kveton; Zheng Wen; Mohammad Ghavamzadeh; Laks Lakshmanan; Mark Schmidt,Abstract: We consider\emph {influence maximization}(IM) in social networks; which is theproblem of maximizing the number of users that become aware of a product by selecting aset of" seed" users to expose the product to. While prior work assumes a known model ofinformation diffusion; we propose a parametrization in terms of pairwise reachability whichmakes our framework agnostic to the underlying diffusion model. We give a correspondingmonotone; submodular surrogate function; and show that it is a good approximation to theoriginal IM objective. We also consider the case of a new marketer looking to exploit anexisting social network; while simultaneously learning the factors governing informationpropagation. For this; we propose a pairwise-influence semi-bandit feedback model anddevelop a LinUCB-based bandit algorithm. Our model-independent regret analysis …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.00557,2017,6
Event evolution tracking from streaming social posts,Pei Lee; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Evangelos E Milios,Abstract: Online social post streams such as Twitter timelines and forum discussions haveemerged as important channels for information dissemination. They are noisy; informal; andsurge quickly. Real life events; which may happen and evolve every minute; are perceivedand circulated in post streams by social users. Intuitively; an event can be viewed as adense cluster of posts with a life cycle sharing the same descriptive words. There are manyprevious works on event detection from social streams. However; there has beensurprisingly little work on tracking the evolution patterns of events; eg; birth/death;growth/decay; merge/split; which we address in this paper. To define a tracking scope; weuse a sliding time window; where old posts disappear and new posts appear at eachmoment. Following that; we model a social post stream as an evolving network; where …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1311.5978,2013,6
Interactive Mining of Correlations-A Constraint Perspective.,Gösta Grahne; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Xiaohong Wang,Abstract The problem of nding minimal sets of objects; that are correlated and havestatistically signi cant number of occurrences in a database; has recently receivedconsiderable attention; as an alternative to association rules. A case for making mininghuman-centered; interactive; and exploratory via application speci c constraints was recentlymade in the papers 14; 12]. The technical results of these papers were established in thecontext of e cient computation of frequent sets satisfying user speci ed constraints.

Intuitionistic interpretation of deductive databases with incomplete information,Fangqing Dong; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract The aim of this paper is to build the relationship between deductive databases withincomplete information and hypothetical reasoning using embedded implications. We firstconsider the semantics of deductive databases with incomplete information in the form ofnull values. We motivate query answering against a deductive database with nulls as theproblem of extracting the maximal information from a (deductive) database in response toqueries; and formalize this in the form of conditional answers in a (syntactic) higher-orderlogic. We give a fixpoint semantics to deductive databases with nulls; and examine therelationship between existing recursive query processing techniques and the proofprocedure for deductive databases with nulls. We then examine hypothetical reasoningusing embedded implications and develop an intuitionistic model semantics for …,Theoretical Computer Science,1994,6
Attribute-driven community search,Xin Huang; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Recently; community search over graphs has gained significant interest. Inapplications such as analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks; citation graphs;and collaboration networks; nodes tend to have attributes. Unfortunately; most previouscommunity search algorithms ignore attributes and result in communities with poor cohesionwrt their node attributes. In this paper; we study the problem of attribute-driven communitysearch; that is; given an undirected graph G where nodes are associated with attributes; andan input query Q consisting of nodes V q and attributes W q; find the communities containingV q; in which most community members are densely inter-connected and have similarattributes. We formulate this problem as finding attributed truss communities (ATC); ie;finding connected and close k-truss subgraphs containing V q; with the largest attribute …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,5
Exploring rated datasets with rating maps,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Sofia Kleisarchaki; Naresh Kumar Kolloju; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Ruben H Zamar,Abstract Online rated datasets have become a source for large-scale population studies foranalysts and a means for end-users to achieve routine tasks such as finding a book club.Existing systems however only provide limited insights into the opinions of differentsegments of the rater population. In this paper; we develop a framework for finding andexploring population segments and their opinions. We propose rating maps; a collection of(population segment; rating distribution) pairs; where a segment; eg;{18-29 year old malesin CA} has a rating distribution in the form of a histogram that aggregates its ratings for a setof items (eg; movies starring Russel Crowe). We formalize the problem of building ratingmaps dynamically given desired input distributions. Our problem raises two challenges:(i)the choice of an appropriate measure for comparing rating distributions; and (ii) the …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,5
Recommending user generated item lists,Yidan Liu; Min Xie; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Existing recommender systems mostly focus on recommending individual itemswhich users may be interested in. User-generated item lists on the other hand have becomea popular feature in many applications. Eg; Goodreads provides users with an interface forcreating and sharing interesting book lists. These user-generated item lists complement themain functionality of the corresponding application; and intuitively become an alternativeway for users to browse and discover interesting items to be consumed. Unfortunately;existing recommender systems are not designed for recommending user-generated itemlists. In this work; we study properties of these user-generated item lists and propose aBayesian ranking model; called LIRE for recommending them. The proposed model takesinto consideration users' previous interactions with both item lists and with individual …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender systems,2014,5
Finding heavy paths in graphs: A rank join approach,Mohammad Khabbaz; Smriti Bhagat; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract: Graphs have been commonly used to model many applications. A natural problemwhich abstracts applications such as itinerary planning; playlist recommendation; and flowanalysis in information networks is that of finding the heaviest path (s) in a graph. Moreprecisely; we can model these applications as a graph with non-negative edge weights;along with a monotone function such as sum; which aggregates edge weights into a pathweight; capturing some notion of quality. We are then interested in finding the top-k heaviestsimple paths; ie; the $ k $ simple (cycle-free) paths with the greatest weight; whose lengthequals a given parameter $\ell $. We call this the\emph {Heavy Path Problem}(HPP). It iseasy to show that the problem is NP-Hard. In this work; we develop a practical approach tosolve the Heavy Path problem by leveraging a strong connection with the well-known …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1112.1117,2011,5
LockX: a system for efficiently querying secure XML,SungRan Cho; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Much of the work on XML access control to date has studied models for the specification ofXML access control policies; focusing on issues such as granularity of access and conflictresolution. However; there has been little work on enforcement of access control policies forqueries. A naive two-step solution to secure query evaluation is to first compute queryresults; and then use access control policies to filter the results. Consider the XML databaseof an online-seller; which has information on books and customers. Assume that a specificuser is allowed access to books and not to customer information. If only query results arefiltered for accessibility; the XPath query:,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,5

Thwarting passive privacy attacks in collaborative filtering,Rui Chen; Min Xie; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract While recommender systems based on collaborative filtering have become anessential tool to help users access items of interest; it has been indicated that collaborativefiltering enables an adversary to perform passive privacy attacks; a type of the mostdamaging and easy-to-perform privacy attacks. In a passive privacy attack; the dynamicnature of a recommender system allows an adversary with a moderate amount ofbackground knowledge to infer a user's transaction through temporal changes in the publicrelated-item lists (RILs). Unlike the traditional solutions that manipulate the underlying user-item rating matrix; in this paper; we respond to passive privacy attacks by directlyanonymizing the RILs; which are the real outputs rendered to an adversary. Thisfundamental switch allows us to provide a novel rigorous inference-proof privacy …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,4
View-based tree-language rewritings for XML,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Alex Thomo,Abstract We study query rewriting using views (QRV) for XML. Our queries and views areregular tree languages (RTLs) represented by tree automata over marked alphabets; wherethe markers serve as “node selectors”. We formally define query rewriting using views forRTLs and give an automata-based algorithm to compute the maximally contained rewriting.The formalism we use is equal in power with Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic; and ouralgorithm for computing QRV is the first to target this expressive class. Furthermore we provea tight lower bound; thus showing that our algorithm is optimal. Another strength of ourautomata-based approach is that we are able to cast computing QRV into executing asequence of intuitive operations on automata; thus rendering our approach practical as itcan be easily implemented utilizing off-the-shelf automata toolboxes.

Exploratory Search in Databases and the Web.,Georgia Koutrika; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Mirek Riedewald; Kostas Stefanidis,The traditional way a user interacts with a database system is through queries. Structuredquery languages; such as SQL for relational data; XQuery for XML; and SPARQL for RDFdata; allow users to submit queries that may precisely capture their information needs; butusers need to be familiar with the underlying ontology and data structure and of course thequery language itself. Moreover; users need to some extent be familiar with the content ofthe database and have a clear understanding of their information needs. Theserequirements stand as the weaknesses of this interaction mode. As data stored in databasesgrows in unprecedented rates and becomes accessible to diverse and less technicallyoriented audience; new forms of data exploration and interaction become increasingly moreattractive.

Mostof this research has been concerned with what we regard as first generation recommendersystems. Ever since the database community got interested in recommender systems;people have begun asking questions related to functionality.

Battling Predictability and Overconcentration in Recommender Systems.,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Sergei Vassilvitskii; Cong Yu,Today's recommendation systems have evolved far beyond the initial approaches from morethan a decade ago; and have seen a great deal of commercial success (cf; Amazon andNetflix). However; they are still far from perfect; and face tremendous challenges inincreasing the overall utility of the recommendations. These challenges are present in allstages of the recommendation process. They begin with the cold start problem: given a newuser how do we recommend items to the user without forcing her to give feedback on astarter set of items. Similarly; given a new item introduced into the system; how do we knowwhen (and to whom) we should recommend it. A different problem is that of data sparsity.Although every system has 'super'raters; that is people who rate thousands (and in somecases tens of thousands) of items; the number of such people is low.

Offline matching approximation algorithms in exchange markets,Zeinab Abbassi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Motivated by several marketplace applications on rapidly growing online socialnetworks; we study the problem of efficient offline matching algorithms for online exchangemarkets. We consider two main models of one-shot markets and exchange markets overtime. For one-shot markets; we study three main variants of the problem: one-to-oneexchange market problem; exchange market problem with short cycles; and probabilisticexchange market problem. We show that all the above problems are NP-hard; and proposeheuristics and approximation algorithms for these problems. Experiments show that thenumber of items exchanged will increase when exchanges through cycles are allowed.Exploring algorithms for markets over time is an interesting direction for future work.,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web,2008,4

On a theory of probabilistic deductive databases,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri,Abstract We propose a framework for modeling uncertainty where both belief and doubt canbe given independent; rst-class status. We adopt probability theory as the mathematicalformalism for manipulating uncertainty. An agent can express the uncertainty in herknowledge about a piece of information in the form of a con dence level; consisting of a pairof intervals of probability; one for each of her belief and doubt. The space of con dencelevels naturally leads to the notion of a trilattice; similar in spirit to Fitting's bilattices.Intuitively; the points in such a trilattice can be ordered according to truth; information; orprecision. We develop a framework for probabilistic deductive databases by associating condence levels with the facts and rules of a classical deductive database.

Combating the Cold Start User Problem in Model Based Collaborative Filtering,Sampoorna Biswas; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Senjuti Basu Ray,Abstract: For tackling the well known cold-start user problem in model-based recommendersystems; one approach is to recommend a few items to a cold-start user and use thefeedback to learn a profile. The learned profile can then be used to make goodrecommendations to the cold user. In the absence of a good initial profile; therecommendations are like random probes; but if not chosen judiciously; both badrecommendations and too many recommendations may turn off a user. We formalize thecold-start user problem by asking what are the $ b $ best items we should recommend to acold-start user; in order to learn her profile most accurately; where $ b $; a given budget; istypically a small number.

Report on the first international workshop on exploratory search in databases and the web (exploredb 2014),Georgia Koutrika; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Mirek Riedewald; Kostas Stefanidis,Databases are well-organized collections of data. Structured query languages; such as SQL;XQuery; and SPARQL; enable users to formulate precise queries over the data stored in adatabase. To be successful; users need to be familiar with the query language and theunderlying data organization. They also need to understand; to some extent; the data stored;and have a fairly clear idea of what they are looking for. In contrast; the World Wide Webrepresents the largest and arguably the most complex repository of content; where theabove assumptions do not hold.

Fair Recommendations for Online Barter Exchange Networks.,Zeinab Abbassi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Min Xie,ABSTRACT Of late online social networks have become popular; with interest spanningvarious aspects including search; analysis/mining; and their potential use for item barterexchange markets. The idea is that users can leverage their social network for exchangingitems they possess with other users. The problem of generating recommendations for itemexchanges between users; consisting of synchronous exchange cycles has beeninvestigated [2]. In this paper; we identify the shortcomings of the above exchange modeland propose an asynchronous model that makes use of credit points. Rather than insist onexchanging items synchronously; we award points to users whenever they give items toother users; which can be redeemed later. Points and their redemption raise an issue offairness which intuitively means users who contribute more should have a greater priority …,WebDB,2013,3
Exploiting conflict structures in inconsistent databases,Solmaz Kolahi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract For an inconsistent database that violates a set of (conditional) functionaldependencies; we define a basic conflict as a minimal set of attribute values; of which atleast one needs to be changed in any attribute-based repair. Assuming that the collection ofall basic conflicts is given; we show how we can exploit it in two important applications. Thefirst application is cleaning the answer to a query by deciding whether a set of tuples is apossible answer; ie; they are present in the result of the query applied to some minimalrepair. We motivate an alternative notion of answer with a consistent derivation; whichrequires that the tuples are obtained through the same occurrences of attribute values inboth the inconsistent database and the repair. The second application is cleaning data bygenerating repairs that are at a “reasonable” distance to the original database.

Efficient OLAP Query Processing in Distributed Data Warehouses,Michael Akinde Strategy; Michael Akinde; Michael Böhlen; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Theodore Johnson; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract sets of the detail data. Skalla generates distributed query evaluation plans (for thecoordinator architecture) as a sequence of rounds; where a round consists of:(i) each localsite performing some computation and communicating the result to the coordinator; and (ii)the coordinator synchronizing the results and (possibly) communicating with the sites. Thesemantics of the subqueries generated by Skalla ensure that the amount of data that has tobe shipped between sites is independent of the size of the underlying data at the sites. Thisis particularly important in our distributed OLAP setting. We note that such a bound does notexist for the distributed processing of traditional SQL join queries [3]. The Skalla evaluationscheme allows for a wide variety of optimizations that are easily expressed in the algebraand thus readily integrated into the query optimizer.

A relational data model for manipulating probabilistic knowledge,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Heather L Johnstone,Abstract Reasoning with uncertain knowledge is an activity that arises in many areas ofcomputer science; including knowledge-base systems and expert systems. It is well knownthat existing expert systems handle reasoning with uncertainty mostly with ad hoctechniques with little theoretical justification [12; 18]. Many systems of reasoning withuncertainty have been developed in recent times; including fuzzy set based approaches(eg.; see Zadeh [20]; Raju and Majumdar [15]); quantitative approaches to reason withknowledge (eg.; van Emden [19] and Steger et al [18]) and probabilistic approaches (eg.;[7];Halpern [9]); and the classical works (for example see Carnap [3]).

Validating network value of influencers by means of explanations,Glenn S Bevilacqua; Shealen Clare; Amit Goyal; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Recently; there has been significant interest in social influence analysis. One of the centralproblems in this area is the problem of identifying influencers; such that by convincing theseusers to perform a certain action (like buying a new product); a large number of other usersget influenced to follow the action. The client of such an application is essentially a marketerwho would target these influencers for marketing a given new product; say by providing freesamples or discounts. It is natural that before committing resources for targeting aninfluencer the marketer would be interested in validating the influence (or network value) ofinfluencers returned.

IPS: an interactive package configuration system for trip planning,Min Xie; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Peter T Wood,Abstract When planning a trip; one essential task is to find a set of Places-of-Interest (POIs)which can be visited during the trip. Using existing travel guides or websites such as LonelyPlanet and TripAdvisor; the user has to either manually work out a desirable set of POIs ortake pre-configured travel packages; the former can be time consuming while the latter lacksflexibility. In this demonstration; we propose an Interactive Package configuration System(IPS); which visualizes different candidate packages on a map; and enables users toconfigure a travel package through simple interactions; ie; comparing packages andfixing/removing POIs from a package. Compared with existing trip planning systems; webelieve IPS strikes the right balance between flexibility and manual effort.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,2
Adding structure to top-k: From items to expansions,Xueyao Liang; Min Xie; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Keyword based search interfaces are extremely popular as a means for efficientlydiscovering items of interest from a huge collection; as evidenced by the success of searchengines like Google and Bing. However; most of the current search services still returnresults as a flat ranked list of items. Considering the huge number of items which can matcha query; this list based interface can be very difficult for the user to explore and find importantitems relevant to their search needs. In this work; we consider a search scenario in whicheach item is annotated with a set of keywords. Eg; in Web 2.0 enabled systems such as flickrand del. icio. us; it is common for users to tag items with keywords. Based on this annotationinformation; we can automatically group query result items into different expansions of thequery corresponding to subsets of keywords.

Declarative Entity Resolution via Matching Dependencies and Answer Set Programs (extended version),Zeinab Bahmani; Leopoldo Bertossi; S Kolahi; L Lakshmanan,Abstract Entity resolution (ER) is an important and common problem in data cleaning.

On the information content of an XML database,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Fereidoon Sadri,Abstract While XML arrived as a syntax for data exchange; its use in the databasecommunity has blossomed beyond its origins into a flexible data model for managingstructured and semistructured data. However; the flexibility comes with the price of increasedcomplexity. Querying XML data is much more complicated than querying a relationaldatabase; even when the underlying schema is available. We contend that one of the rootcauses of this difficulty is that the information content modeled by an XML database has notbeen pinned down. In this paper; we make the following contributions. Using a notion ofvaluations from an XML database schema to the XML database; we capture the latter'sinformation content. We provide an alternative computational semantics for the informationcontent and show it is equivalent to the valuation-based notion of information content. We …,Manuscript.

Towards a Toolkit for Data Analysis and Mining.,Theodore Johnson; Raymond T Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Data analysis and mining is typically a multistep process; involving an iteratedprocess of data space partitioning; aggregate computation; and data transformations. Theseactivities typically require steps that cross disciplines; software packages; and le formats. Inthis paper; we articulate the vision behind some of our ongoing work of developing a dataand computational model that relies on a single concept {data space partition {to unify manyaspects of data mining and analysis. The uni ed model would simplify the task of the dataanalyst; and would present opportunities for query optimization.,1999 ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Research Issues in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,1999,2
Homomorphic tree embeddings and their applications to recursive program optimization,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Karima Ashraf; Jiawei Han,The problems of stage-preserving linearization and one-boundedness are studied for aclass of nonlinear single rule recursive programs; and syntactic characterizations aredeveloped for both. The characterizations lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for the formerand a linear-time algorithm for the latter. Stage-preserving linearization results in asignificant improvement in evaluation efficiency; compared to a linearization that does notpreserve stages. The class of nonlinear strips that are stage-preserving linearizable includesseveral classes of programs that can be linearized only using a mix of left and right linearrules; as well as programs that cannot be linearized using previously known techniques. Thestudy makes use of a technique based on the notion of homomorphic tree embeddings.,Logic in Computer Science; 1993. LICS'93.; Proceedings of Eighth Annual IEEE Symposium on,1993,2
Superfiniteness of query answers in deductive databases: An automata-theoretic approach,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Daniel A Nonen,Abstract Deciding finiteness of query answers is a problem of fundamental importance toquery systems supporting declarative logic based languages with function symbols.Unfortunately; this problem is undecidable in general. One of the recently proposedtechniques for coping with this situation consists in (i) approximating the original programwith function symbols by a datalog program with infinite base relations; together withfiniteness constraints (fc s) acting on them (fc s say that if certain columns of a relation arefinite; so are other columns); and (ii) using an approximation for finiteness; calledsuperfiniteness. A query is finite if it has finite answers in the least fixpoint model of theprogram; whereas it is superfinite if it has a finite answer in every fixpoint model of theprogram. While superfiniteness is decidable; the only known procedure for it takes time …,International Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science,1992,2
Revenue maximization in incentivized social advertising,Cigdem Aslay; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Wei Lu,Abstract Incentivized social advertising; an emerging marketing model; providesmonetization opportunities not only to the owners of the social networking platforms but alsoto their influential users by offering a" cut" on the advertising revenue. We consider a socialnetwork (the host) that sells ad-engagements to advertisers by inserting their ads; in the formof promoted posts; into the feeds of carefully selected" initial endorsers" or seed users: theseusers receive monetary incentives in exchange for their endorsements. The endorsementshelp propagate the ads to the feeds of their followers. Whenever any user engages with anad; the host is paid some fixed amount by the advertiser; and the ad further propagates tothe feed of her followers; potentially recursively. In this context; the problem for the host is isto allocate ads to influential users; taking into account the propensity of ads for viral …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Model-independent online learning for influence maximization,Sharan Vaswani; Branislav Kveton; Zheng Wen; Mohammad Ghavamzadeh; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Mark Schmidt,Abstract We consider influence maximization (IM) in social networks; which is the problem ofmaximizing the number of users that become aware of a product by selecting a set of “seed”users to expose the product to. While prior work assumes a known model of informationdiffusion; we propose a novel parametrization that not only makes our framework agnostic tothe underlying diffusion model; but also statistically efficient to learn from data. We give acorresponding monotone; submodular surrogate function; and show that it is a goodapproximation to the original IM objective. We also consider the case of a new marketerlooking to exploit an existing social network; while simultaneously learning the factorsgoverning information propagation. For this; we propose a pairwise-influence semi-banditfeedback model and develop a LinUCB-based bandit algorithm. Our model-independent …,International Conference on Machine Learning,2017,1
Query-driven maximum quasi-clique search,Pei Lee; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Quasi-cliques are an elegant way to model dense subgraphs; with each nodeadjacent to at least a fraction λ∊(0; 1] of other nodes in the subgraph. In this paper; we focuson a new graph mining problem; the query-driven maximum quasi-clique (QMQ) search;which aims to find the largest λ-quasi-clique containing a given query node set S. Thisproblem has many applications and is proved to be NP-Hard and inapproximable. To solvethe problem efficiently in practice; we propose the notion of core tree to organize densesubgraphs recursively; which reduces the search space and effectively helps find thesolution within a few tree traversals. To optimize a solution to a better solution; we introducethree refinement operations: Add; Remove and Swap.

Adaptive Influence Maximization in Social Networks: Why Commit when You can Adapt?,Sharan Vaswani; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract: Most previous work on influence maximization in social networks is limited to thenon-adaptive setting in which the marketer is supposed to select all of the seed users; togive free samples or discounts to; up front. A disadvantage of this setting is that the marketeris forced to select all the seeds based solely on a diffusion model. If some of the selectedseeds do not perform well; there is no opportunity to course-correct. A more practical settingis the adaptive setting in which the marketer initially selects a batch of users and observeshow well seeding those users leads to a diffusion of product adoptions. Based on this marketfeedback; she formulates a policy for choosing the remaining seeds. In this paper; we studyadaptive offline strategies for two problems:(a) MAXSPREAD--given a budget on number ofseeds and a time horizon; maximize the spread of influence and (b) MINTSS--given a …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.08171,2016,1
Modeling non-progressive phenomena for influence propagation,Vincent Yun Lou; Smriti Bhagat; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Sharan Vaswani,Abstract Most previous work on modeling influence propagation has focused on progressivemodels; ie; once a node is influenced (active) the node stays in that state and cannotbecome inactive. However; this assumption is unrealistic in many settings where nodes cantransition between active and inactive states. For instance; a user of a social network maystop using an app and become inactive; but again activate when instigated by a friend; orwhen the app adds a new feature or releases a new version. In this work; we study such non-progressive phenomena and propose an efficient model of influence propagation.Specifically; we model influence propagation as a continuous-time Markov process with 2states: active and inactive. Such a model is both highly scalable (we evaluated on graphswith over 2 million nodes); 17-20 times faster; and more accurate for estimating the …,Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Online social networks,2014,1

On efficient replacement policies for cache objects with non-uniform sizes and costs,Ying Su; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract—Replacement policies for cache management have been studied extensively.Most policies proposed in the literature tend to be ad hoc and typically exploit the retrievalcost or latency of the objects; object sizes; popularity of requests and temporal correlationsbetween requests. A recent paper [1] studied the caching problem and developed anoptimal replacement policy C∗ 0 under the independent reference model (IRM); assumingnonuniform object retrieval costs. In this paper; we consider the more general setting whereboth object sizes and their retrieval costs are non-uniform. This setting arises in a number ofapplications such as web caching and view management in databases and in datawarehouses. We consider static selection as a benchmark when evaluating the performanceof replacement policies. Our first result is negative: no dynamic policy can achieve a …,*,2009,1

Much of the previous work on trend analysison data warehouses has mainly focused on efficient evaluation of complex aggregations(eg; the data cube) and data driven hypothetical scenarios. In this paper; we considerhypothetical scenarios driven by semantics of changes to dimension hierarchies andintroduce the notion of perspectives. Perspectives are select members of an independentdimension such as time or location that drive changes in other dimensions.

Fueled by the extreme popularity of online socialnetworks and social media; computational social influence has emerged as a subfield ofdata mining whose goal is to analyze and optimize social influence using computationalframeworks such as algorithm design and theoretical modeling. One of the fundamentalproblems in this field is the problem of influence maximization; primarily motivated by theapplication of viral marketing.

Horde of Bandits using Gaussian Markov Random Fields,Sharan Vaswani; Mark Schmidt; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract: The gang of bandits (GOB) model\cite {cesa2013gang} is a recent contextualbandits framework that shares information between a set of bandit problems; related by aknown (possibly noisy) graph. This model is useful in problems like recommender systemswhere the large number of users makes it vital to transfer information between users.Despite its effectiveness; the existing GOB model can only be applied to small problems dueto its quadratic time-dependence on the number of nodes. Existing solutions to combat thescalability issue require an often-unrealistic clustering assumption. By exploiting aconnection to Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs); we show that the GOB model canbe made to scale to much larger graphs without additional assumptions. In addition; wepropose a Thompson sampling algorithm which uses the recent GMRF sampling-by …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.02626,2017,*

Nepal: a path query language for communication networks,Theodore Johnson; Yaron Kanza; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Vladislav Shkapenyuk,Abstract Communication networks are typically large; dynamic and extremely complicated.To deploy; maintain; and trouble-shoot such networks; it is essential to understand hownetwork elements---such as servers; switches; virtual machines; and virtual networkfunctions---are connected to one another; and be able to discover communication pathsbetween them. It is also essential to understand how connections change over time; and beable to pose time-travel queries to retrieve information about past network states. Thisproblem is becoming more acute with the advent of software defined networks; wherenetwork functions are virtualized and managed in a cloud infrastructure.

On Querying Temporal Deductive,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Daniel A Nonen,Information about the objects modeled by databases changes in real-world applications.However; time is not managed in a uniform manner in most databases. Temporal databaseshave been introduced to fill this gap [15]. A survey of works on historical and temporaldatabases can be found in [16]. In this paper; we consider primarily temporal databaseswhich associate a valid interval with each piece of temporal data. This can be done byadding a From and a To attribute to the data. For example; if t is a tuple in a temporal relationR; then t. From is the first time that t is valid and t. To is the final time t is valid.(If t is currentlyvalid; the value of t. To is the special system defined variable Now which evaluates to thecurrent system time.)

Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing: A Constraint-Based Clustering Approach,Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Privacy-preserving data publishing has drawn much research interest recently. Inthis chapter; we address this topic from the viewpoint of constrained clustering; ie; theproblem of finding clusters that satisfy certain user-specified constraints. More specifically;we begin with the problem of clustering under aggregate constraints (without privacyconsiderations) and explain how traditional algorithms for the unconstrained problem (eg;the c-means algorithm) break down in the presence of constraints. From there; we developscalable algorithms that overcome this problem and finally illustrate how our algorithm canalso be used for privacy-preserving data publishing.,Constrained Clustering: Advances in Algorithms; Theory; and Applications,2008,*

Efficient OLAP Query Processing,Michael O Akinde; Michael H Böhlen; Theodore Johnson; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract. The success of Internet applications has led to an explo-sive growth in the demandfor bandwidth from ISPs. Managing an IP network requires collecting and analyzing networkdata; such as flowlevel traffic statistics. Such analyses can typically be expressed as OLAPqueries; eg; correlated aggregate queries and data cubes. Current day OLAP tools for thistask assume the availability of the data in a centralized data warehouse. However; theinherently distributed nature of data collection and the huge amount of data extracted ateach collection point make it impractical to gather all data at a centralized site. One solutionis to maintain a distributed data warehouse; consisting of local data warehouses at eachcollection point and a coordinator site; with most of the processing being performed at thelocal sites.

The approach performs a detailed query binding analysisbased on query information; constraint information and the structure of a recursion; selectsan appropriate predicate evaluation order and generates an e cient query evaluation plan.Interesting query evaluation techniques; such as chainfollowing; chain-split; and constraintpushing; are developed for the e cient evaluation of di erent kinds of queries. Furthermore;the technique can be extended to the evaluation of regular nonlinear recursions in HiLogand F-logic programs. The study not only presents a method for the evaluation of regular …,Information Systems,1994,*

On Querying Temporal Deductive Databases,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Daniel A Nonen,Abstract Information about the objects modeled by databases changes in real-worldapplications. However; time is not managed in a uniform manner in most databases.Temporal databases have been introduced to fill this gap [15]. A survey of works onhistorical and temporal databases can be found in [16]. In this paper; we consider primarilytemporal databases which associate a valid interval with each piece of temporal data. Thiscan be done by adding a From and a To attribute to the data. For example; if t is a tuple in atemporal relation R; then t. From is the first time that t is valid and t. To is the final time t isvalid.(If t is currently valid; the value of t. To is the special system defined variable NOWwhich evaluates to the current system time.) The following problems arise in the context oftemporal databases: 1. Writing queries is more difficult because even 'Simple'queries may …,*,1993,*
Canonical Kripke models and the intuitionistic semantics of logic programs,Fangqing Dong; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Motivated by the problem of extending stable semantics (SS) and well-foundedsemantics (WFS) while avoiding their drawbacks; we propose a new simple and intuitivesemantics for (normal) logic programs; called canonical Kripke model semantics. Ourapproach is based on formulating stability in an intuitionistic framework which helps usovercome several drawbacks. As a consequence; every normal program has a unique"intended" canonical Kripke model. The canonical Kripke model semantics is a properextension of SS and WFS; and it avoids the drawbacks associated with SS and WFS. Thecanonical Kripke model of a normal program exactly captures the 3-valued mtoepistemicconsequences of the associated AE theory; and can be obtained as the greatest fixpoint of adeflationary operator Kp defined on Kripke structures.,Logic Programming and Non-Monotonic Reasoning: Proceedings of the Second International Workshop,1991,*

Appendix to the Paper: Schema Mapping and Query Translation in Heterogeneous P2P XML Databases,Angela Bonifati; Elaine Chang; Terence Ho; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Rachel Pottinger; Yongik Chung,We have presented a technique that takes as input a set of box and arrow correspondencesbetween a pair of DTDs and infers TreeLog rules involving tree expressions. How do weknow that the mappings captured using the inferred rules are meaningful? What can we sayabout the class of mappings (transformations) that are captured by the rules? To answerthese questions; in this appendix we introduce a small set of simple but powerful algebraicoperators for expressing transformations between (database instances of) DTDs. Wedemonstrate that transformations captured by expressions in this algebra are expressible asa set of TreeLog rules. The operators consist of three main groups:(1) unnest and nest;(2)flip and flop; and (3) split and merge. Additionally; we also allow individual node insertion;deletion; and tag modification for “completeness”. These latter operations are needed to …,*,*,*

Personalizing XML Full Text Search in PIMENTO,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Irini Fundulaki; Laks Lakshmanan,XML search is increasing in popularity as more and larger XML repositories are becomingavailable. The accuracy of XML search varies across different systems and a lot of effort isput into designing scoring functions tailored to specific datasets. For example; the INEX effort[8] aims at improving the search relevance of IEEE XML data collections. To the best of ourknowledge none of the existing XML search solutions incorporates user information todetermine relevant query answers. In PIMENTO we argue that there is no scoring functionthat can meet all user-related information and advocate the idea of incorporating userprofiles into XML search in order to customize query answers and improve search quality.Personalization is used in a variety of applications: in telecommunications it is used to directuser calls based on the caller context; in Web search the ranking of query answers may …,*,*,*

The 3W Model and Algebra for Uni ed Data Mining,Theodore Johnson; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Real data mining/analysis applications call for a framework which adequatelysupports knowledge discovery as a multi-step process; where the input of one miningoperation can be the output of another. Previous studies; primarily focusing on fastcomputation of one speci c mining task at a time; ignore this vital issue. Motivated by thisobservation; we develop a unied model supporting all major mining and analysis tasks. Ourmodel consists of three distinct worlds; corresponding to intensional and extensionaldimensions; and to data sets. The notion of dimension is a centerpiece of the model.Equipped with hierarchies; dimensions integrate the output of seemingly dissimilar miningand analysis operations in a clean manner.,*,*,*

CELF++: Optimizing the Greedy Algorithm for Influence Maximization in Social Networks (Technical Report),Amit Goyal; Wei Lu; Laks VS Lakshmanan,ABSTRACT Kempe et al.[4](KKT) showed the problem of influence maximization is NP-hardand a simple greedy algorithm guarantees the best possible approximation factor in PTIME.However; it has two major sources of inefficiency. First; finding the expected spread of anode set is# P-hard. Second; the basic greedy algorithm is quadratic in the number ofnodes. The first source is tackled by estimating the spread using Monte Carlo simulation orby using heuristics [4; 6; 2; 5; 1; 3]. Leskovec et al.[6] proposed the CELF algorithm fortackling the second. In this work; we propose CELF++ and empirically show that it is 17-34%faster than CELF.,*,*,*

Optimization of Constrained Frequent Set Queries with 2-variable Constraints Laks VS Lakshmanan IIT Bombay laks@ math. iitb. ernet. in,Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Currently; there is tremendous interest in providing ad-hoc mining capabilities indatabase management systems. As a first step towards this goal; in [15] we proposed anarchitecture for supporting constraint-based; human-centered; exploratory mining of variouskinds of rules including associations; introduced the notion of constrained frequent setqueries (CFQs); and developed effective pruning optimizations for CFQs with 1-variable (1-var) constraints. While 1-var constraints are useful for constraining the antecedent andconsequent separately; many natural examples of CFQs illustrate the need for constrainingthe antecedent and consequent jointly; for which 2-variable (2-var) constraints areindispensable. Developing pruning optimizations for CFQs with 2-var constraints is thesubject of this paper. But this is a diëcult problem because:(i) in 2-var constraints; both …,*,*,*
Indian Institute of Technology; Bombay University of British Columbia; Canada,C Gokhale; N Gupta; P Kumar; LVS Lakshmanan; R Ng; BA Prakash,The popularity of XML as a data exchange standard has led to the emergence of powerfulXML query languages like XQuery [21] and studies on XML query optimization. Of late; thereis considerable interest in analytical processing of XML data (eg;[2; 3]). As pointed out byBorkar and Carey in [3]; even for data integration; there is a compelling need for performingvarious group-by style aggregate operations. A core operator needed for analytics is thegroupby operator; which is widely used in relational as well as OLAP database applications.XQuery requires group-by operations to be simulated using nesting [2]. Studies addressingthe need for XML grouping fall into two broad categories:(1) Provide support for grouping atthe logical or physical level [6] and recognize grouping operations from nested queries andrewrite them with grouping operations [4; 5; 9; 12].(2) Extend XQuery FLWOR expressions …,*,*,*

We consider this problem for XML databases. We capturesecurity requirements of the data owner using a novel notion of security constraints. Forsecurity reasons; sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tensionbetween data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities ofencryption. We show that finding an optimal; secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. Forspeeding up query processing; we propose to keep metadata; consisting of structure andvalue indices; on the server. We want to prevent the server; or an attacker who gains accessto the server; from learning sensitive information in the database. We consider an attack …,*,*,*
