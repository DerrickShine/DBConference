Proactive re-optimization,Shivnath Babu; Pedro Bizarro; David DeWitt,Abstract Traditional query optimizers rely on the accuracy of estimated statistics to choosegood execution plans. This design often leads to suboptimal plan choices for complexqueries; since errors in estimates for intermediate subexpressions grow exponentially in thepresence of skewed and correlated data distributions. Reoptimization is a promisingtechnique to cope with such mistakes. Current re-optimizers first use a traditional optimizerto pick a plan; and then react to estimation errors and resulting suboptimalities detected inthe plan during execution. The effectiveness of this approach is limited because traditionaloptimizers choose plans unaware of issues affecting reoptimization. We address thisproblem using proactive reoptimization; a new approach that incorporates three techniques:i) the uncertainty in estimates of statistics is computed in the form of bounding boxes …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,157

Adaptive query processing in the looking glass,Shivnath Babu; Pedro Bizarro,A great deal of work on adaptive query processing has been done over the last few years:Adaptive query processing has been used to detect and correct optimizer errors due toincorrect statistics or simplified cost metrics; it has been applied to long-running continuousqueries over data streams whose characteristics change over time; and routing-basedadaptive query processing does away with the optimizer altogether. Despite this large bodyof interrelated work; no unifying comparison of adaptive query processing techniques orsystems has been attempted; we tackle this problem. We identify three families of systems(plan-based; CQ-based; and routing-based); and compare them in detail with respect to themost important aspects of adaptive query processing: plan quality; statistics monitoring andre-optimization; plan migration; and scalability. We also suggest two new approaches to …,Proceedings of the Second Biennial Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR); Jan. 2005,2005,129
Content-based routing: Different plans for different data,Pedro Bizarro; Shivnath Babu; David DeWitt; Jennifer Widom,Abstract Query optimizers in current database systems are designed to pick a single efficientplan for a given query based on current statistical properties of the data. However; differentsubsets of the data can sometimes have very different statistical properties. In suchscenarios it can be more efficient to process different subsets of the data for a query usingdifferent plans. We propose a new query processing technique called content-based routing(CBR) that eliminates the single-plan restriction in current systems. We present low-overhead adaptive algorithms that partition input data based on statistical propertiesrelevant to query execution strategies; and efficiently route individual tuples throughcustomized plans based on their partition. We have implemented CBR as an extension tothe Eddies query processor in the TelegraphCQ system; and we present an extensive …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,80
A performance study of event processing systems,Marcelo RN Mendes; Pedro Bizarro; Paulo Marques,Abstract Event processing engines are used in diverse mission-critical scenarios such asfraud detection; traffic monitoring; or intensive care units. However; these scenarios havevery different operational requirements in terms of; eg; types of events; queries/patternscomplexity; throughput; latency and number of sources and sinks. What are the performancebottlenecks? Will performance degrade gracefully with increasing loads? In this paper wemake a first attempt to answer these questions by running several micro-benchmarks onthree different engines; while we vary query parameters like window size; window expirationtype; predicate selectivity; and data values. We also perform some experiments to assessengines scalability with respect to number of queries and propose ways for evaluating theirability in adapting to changes in load conditions. Lastly; we show that similar queries …,Technology Conference on Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking,2009,65
Progressive parametric query optimization,Pedro Bizarro; Nicolas Bruno; David J DeWitt,Commercial applications usually rely on pre-compiled parameterized procedures to interactwith a database. Unfortunately; executing a procedure with a set of parameters different fromthose used at compilation time may be arbitrarily sub-optimal. Parametric query optimization(PQO) attempts to solve this problem by exhaustively determining the optimal plans at eachpoint of the parameter space at compile time. However; PQO is likely not cost-effective if thequery is executed infrequently or if it is executed with values only within a subset of theparameter space. In this paper we propose instead to progressively explore the parameterspace and build a parametric plan during several executions of the same query. Weintroduce algorithms that; as parametric plans are populated; are able to frequently bypassthe optimizer but still execute optimal or near-optimal plans.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,59
A framework for performance evaluation of complex event processing systems,Marcelo Mendes; Pedro Bizarro; Paulo Marques,Abstract Several new Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines have been recentlyreleased; many of which are intended to be used in performance sensitive scenarios-likefraud detection; traffic control; or health care systems. However; there is no standard meansto assess the performance of a CEP engine. This omission is all the more relevant as thereare currently many competing products; languages; architectures; data models; and dataprocessing CEP techniques. A performance evaluation framework can help identify gooddesign decisions and assist in improving engines. Here we demonstrate our work inprogress: FINCoS; a framework that can be used to benchmark CEP systems. The proposedframework has five relevant characteristics:,Proceedings of the second international conference on Distributed event-based systems,2008,41

Properdecisions are made by forecasting events prior to their occurrence. Motivation for proactivedecision making stems from social and economic factors; and is based on the fact thatprevention is often more effective than the cure. The decisions are made in real time andrequire swift and immediate processing of Big Data; that is; extremely large amounts of noisydata flooding in from various locations; as well as historical data. The methodology willrecognize and forecast opportunities and threats; making the decision to capitalize on theopportunities and mitigate the threats. This will be explained through user-interaction andthe decisions of human operators; in order to ultimately facilitate proactive decision making.,IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,2014,18

Flood: elastic streaming mapreduce,David Alves; Pedro Bizarro; Paulo Marques,Abstract Distributed data stream processing (DSP) is used to analyze information and raisealarms in business-critical scenarios such as financial fraud-detection; clickstreamprocessing; network security; traffic control; or real-time KPI computations. Processing thisinformation efficiently is very challenging because the nature of continuous streamingsources is varying in nature: often the amount of data and processing changes with time ofday and day of week and frequently has unexpected spikes. Thus; the result is that mostDSP computations are either over-provisioned; introducing increased cost and wastedenergy; or are under-provisioned and; either incur in performance degradation or denial-of-service; or have to resort to load shedding. We demonstrate Flood; a scalable; elastic DSPengine that addresses these problems.

Quiteoften; data warehouse administrators are lead to data models with little room forperformance improvement. However; the increasing demands for interactive response timefrom the users make query performance one of the central problems of data warehousingtoday. In this paper we defend that data warehouse design must take into account both thebusiness and the performance perspective from the beginning; and we propose theextension to typical design methodologies to include performance concerns in the earlydesign steps. Specific analysis to predicted data warehouse usage profile and meta-dataanalysis are proposed as new inputs for improving the transition from logical to physicalschema.

Deadline queries: Leveraging the cloud to produce on-time results,David Alves; Pedro Bizarro; Paulo Marques,MapReduce has become a widely used tool for computing complex tasks that processmassive amounts of data in large clusters. Support for MapReduce tasks in cloudenvironments has been provided but it is left to users to make best guesses on the numberof nodes needed for a task to complete within acceptable time. Moreover; the time a task willtake to complete is often unknown beforehand. Previous research addressed this problemby establishing time constraints for query execution and; when needed; reduce the accuracyof queries using result approximation and/or sampling. However; in many situations reducedaccuracy is not tolerable.

Use of virtualisation techniques for ground data systems,Juan Prieto; Jose Feiteirinha; Pedro Bizarro; Eduardo Gómez; Mauro Pecchioli,I. Introduction he infrastructure used by the European Space Agency to support spaceoperations has evolved across the years from centrally managed mainframes to networks ofworkstations. In such networks; a small number of server workstations (typically morepowerful than client workstations) do the centralised processing while a large number ofclient workstations perform the local processing. This approach is fully consistent with the ITtrends in the last years: processing power is relatively cheap and can be increased byreplacing workstations while bandwidth is relatively expensive and can only be increased byreplacing complex cabling infrastructures. By using this approach; the informationexchanged between client and servers can be tailored to the final user demands achieving areduction in bandwidth.,*,2008,7
Adaptive and robust query processing with SHARP,Pedro Bizarro; David DeWitt,Abstract Database catalogs often do not contain enough statistical information to correctlycost all possible physi-cal plans.

To address this problem for a sub-class of queries; we propose SHARP; a new multi-join; adaptive; relational operator thatjoins three or more relations of a star-join.

The Dimension-Join: A New Index for Data Warehouses.,Pedro Bizarro; Henrique Madeira,Abstract There are several auxiliary pre-computed access structures that allow fasteranswers by reading less base data. Examples are materialized views; join indexes; B-treeand bitmap indexes. This paper proposes dimension-join; a new type of index especiallysuited for data warehouses. The dimension-join borrows ideas from several concepts. It is abitmap index; it is a multi-table join and when being used one of the tables is not read toimprove performance. It is a multi-table join because it holds information belonging to twotables; which is similar to the join index proposed by Valduriez. However; instead of beingcomposed by the tables' primary keys; the dimension-join index is a bitmap index over thefact table using values from a dimension column. The dimension-join index is very usefulwhen selecting facts depending on dimension tables belonging to snowflakes. The …,SBBD,2001,6

Where the query has been previously submitted; the progressive optimizationcomponent locates an optimal or near-optimal execution plan based on previously persistedand similarly situated and optimized execution plans that can subsequently be used toevaluate the query and its associated parametric values thereby obviating unnecessary andrepeated calls to a database optimizer for queries that are similar though not necessarilyidentical.,*,2008,5
Contentbased routing for continuous query-optimization,Pedro Bizarro; Shivnath Babu; David DeWitt; Jennifer Widom,Abstract Current Data Stream Management Systems do not fully exploit their adaptive natureto handle complex queries. To date; such systems route stream tuples to operators oroperator paths based only on operator-level statistics. Their optimizers ignore non-independent distributions; attribute correlations; and tuple content. In this paper; we proposea content-based tuple routing approach which; together with histogram-like statistics; allowsa stream query processing system to exploit non-independent distributions and correlationsinstead of being hurt by them. We present a framework for content-based routing in a streamquery processing system and an algorithm for learning contentbased routes automaticallyand efficiently. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of content-based routingbased on a prototype implementation in TelegraphCQ. Our results clearly indicate that …,*,2004,4
Breachradar: Automatic detection of points-of-compromise,Miguel Araujo; Miguel Almeida; Jaime Ferreira; Luis Silva; Pedro Bizarro,Abstract Bank transaction fraud results in over $13 B annual losses for banks; merchants;and card holders worldwide.

We introduce this problem and present an automaticPoints-of-Compromise (POC) detection procedure. BreachRadar is a distributed alternatingalgorithm that assigns a probability of being compromised to the different possible locations.We implement this method using Apache Spark and show its linear scalability in the numberof machines and transactions. BreachRadar is applied to two datasets with billions of realtransaction records and fraud labels where we provide multiple examples of real Points-of-Compromise we are able to detect.

Overcoming memory limitations in high-throughput event-based applications,Marcelo Mendes; Pedro Bizarro; Paulo Marques,Abstract The last decade has witnessed the emergence of business critical applicationsprocessing streaming data for domains as diverse as credit card fraud detection; real-timerecommendation systems; call-center monitoring; ad selection; network monitoring; andmore. Most of those applications need to compute hundreds or thousands of metricscontinuously while coping with very high event input rates. As a consequence; largeamounts of state (ie; moving windows) need to be maintained; very often exceeding theavailable memory resources. Nonetheless; current event processing platforms have little orno memory management capabilities; hanging or simply crashing when memory isexhausted.

Adaptive query processing: dealing with incomplete and uncertain statistics,Pedro G Bizarro,ABSTRACT The standard Database Management Systems (DBMS) query processing modelpicks a single nonadaptive plan and executes it to completion. The chosen plan aims tominimize running time by carefully optimizing the use of secondary storage; memory; andCPU. DBMS optimizers estimate plan costs by using statistics–information describing thedatasets; the queries; and the system. When statistics needed to cost plans are not availablein the database catalog; the optimizer estimates them by using heuristics and default values.These estimates may contain errors and these errors grow exponentially with the number ofestimated statistics derived from other estimated statistics. This may lead to selecting queryplans that are sub-optimal by several orders of magnitude.

Query-Optimization,Pedro Bizarro; David DeWitt; Jennifer Widom,Abstract Current Data Stream Management Systems do not fully exploit their adaptive natureto handle complex queries. To date; such systems route stream tuples to operators oroperator paths based only on operator-level statistics. Their optimizers ignore non-independent distributions; attribute correlations; and tuple content. In this paper; we proposea content-based tuple routing approach which; together with histogram-like statistics; allowsa stream query processing system to exploit non-independent distributions and correlationsinstead of being hurt by them. We present a framework for content-based routing in a streamquery processing system and an algorithm for learning contentbased routes automaticallyand efficiently. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of content-based routingbased on a prototype implementation in TelegraphCQ. Our results clearly indicate that …,*,2004,*
Content-Based Routing for Continuous,Pedro Bizarre; Shivnath Babu; David DeWitt; Jennifer Widom,Abstract Current Data Stream Management Systems do not fully exploit their adaptive natureto handle complex queries.

Oracle Error Messages Glossary for Babylon,Pedro Bizarro,What do you do when you get one; let's say ORA-02429? You go to c:\orant\doc\index. html(or wherever you have your documentation set); and then you browse to Oracle ServerDocumentation; then to Oracle8 Error Messages; then to the right chapter;“Server Messages:ORA-02351 to ORA-29799;” and then to right section;“02420-02429: Schema Messages;”and finally; you scroll down to ORA-02429. Yes; it's too many clicks; too much time; and eventoo much memory wasted with the HTML browser (or PDF reader). Or you might have aquick lookup tool for Oracle Error Messages. There are some available in the market; butthey're going to cost you. Or you might use an Oracle Error Messages glossary for Babylon.What is Babylon?

New Subqueries in Oracle8i,Pedro Bizarro,THERE'S been much discussion recently about the many new features of Oracle8i.However; I haven't read anything about the new subqueries. In fact; I didn't even know therewere any new subqueries until a friend; who was asking for some SQL advice; wrote a SQLstatement. With my pre-Oracle8i perspective; I saw a mistake in the code regardingsubqueries. I was very surprised to see that the statement worked fine! And my friend wassurprised by my surprise. After that; I decided to do some research on this new kind ofsubquery. In short; what I found out is that you can use a subquery anywhere just as long asit returns only one value. In addition to this new kind of subquery; Oracle8i still supports allother previous ones.,Oracle professional,2001,*
The UNKNOWN Factor,Pedro Bizarro,Sometimes conditions might produce UNKNOWN instead of an expected Boolean value ofTRUE or FALSE. If you have several Boolean values ANDed; ORed; and NOTed together;and if one value is UNKNOWN; it might not be obvious what the final combined value is. Inthis article; Pedro Bizarro presents an example of an UNKNOWN value that propagates itsinsidious effects; producing a surprising result set.,Oracle professional,2001,*
Implementing the Time-Warp Simulation Model in Java,Pedro Bizarro; Luis M Silva; Joäo Gabriel Silva; Vila Franca POLO II,Abstract This paper presents JWarp; a Java library that implements an optimistic model ofdiscrete-event parallel simulation: the Time-Warp model. Java fits well in the field ofsimulation and offers some important advantages over other languages: modularity;flexibility; robustness; support for multithreading and exception handling. The paperpresents the main features of the library; the programming interface and some of itsimplementation details. JWarp is one of the first libraries to implement Time-Warp in Java.,vector and parallel processing,1998,*
Deadline Queries: Using Elastic MapReduce to Produce On-Time Results,David Alves; Pedro Bizarro; Paulo Marques,ABSTRACT MapReduce has become a widely used tool for computing complex tasks; oftensimilar to SQL queries; that process massive amounts of data in large clusters. As clustershave associated costs and often have to be shared; users commonly make best guesses onthe number of processing nodes required to complete a task within acceptable time. Theactual time the task will take to complete is; nonetheless; unknown. Previous researchaddressed this problem by establishing time constraints for query execution and; whenneeded; reduce the accuracy of queries using result approximation and/or sampling. Theseapproaches balance accuracy and speed towards meeting the deadline; however there aresituations where reduced accuracy is not tolerable. In this paper we present FloodDQ; aMapReduce system that implements deadlined queries–queries that must finish before a …,*,*,*
