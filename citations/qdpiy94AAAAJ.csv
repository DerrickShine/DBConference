C-SPARQL: A Continuous Query Language for RDF Data Streams,Davide Francesco Barbieri; Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Michael Grossniklaus,This article defines C-SPARQL; an extension of SPARQL whose distinguishing feature is thesupport of continuous queries; ie queries registered over RDF data streams and thencontinuously executed. Queries consider windows; ie the most recent triples of suchstreams; observed while data is continuously flowing. Supporting streams in RDF formatguarantees interoperability and opens up important applications; in which reasoners candeal with evolving knowledge over time. C-SPARQL is presented by means of a fullspecification of the syntax; a formal semantics; and a comprehensive set of examples;relative to urban computing applications; that systematically cover the SPARQL extensions.The expression of meaningful queries over streaming data is strictly connected to theavailability of aggregation primitives; thus C-SPARQL also includes extensions in this …,Int.

Querying RDF Streams with C-SPARQL,Davide Francesco Barbieri; Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract Continuous SPARQL (C-SPARQL) is a new language for continuous queries overstreams of RDF data. CSPARQL queries consider windows; ie; the most recent triples ofsuch streams; observed while data is continuously flowing. Supporting streams in RDFformat guarantees interoperability and opens up important applications; in which reasonerscan deal with knowledge evolving over time. Examples of such application domains includereal-time reasoning over sensors; urban computing; and social semantic data. In this paper;we present the C-SPARQL language extensions in terms of both syntax and examples.Finally; we discuss existing applications that already use C-SPARQL and give an outlook onfuture research opportunities.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2010,153
An execution environment for C-SPARQL queries,Davide Francesco Barbieri; Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract Continuous SPARQL (C-SPARQL) is proposed as new language for continuousqueries over streams of RDF data. It covers a gap in the Semantic Web abstractions which isneeded for many emerging applications; including our focus on Urban Computing. In thisdomain; sensor-based information on roads must be processed to deduce localized trafficconditions and then produce traffic management strategies. Executing C-SPARQL queriesrequires the effective integration of SPARQL and streaming technologies; which capitalizeover a decade of research and development; such integration poses several nontrivialchallenges. In this paper we (a) show the syntax and semantics of the C-SPARQL languagetogether with some examples;(b) introduce a query graph model which is an intermediaterepresentation of queries devoted to optimization;(c) discuss the features of an execution …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,144
Incremental reasoning on streams and rich background knowledge,Davide Francesco Barbieri; Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract This article presents a technique for Stream Reasoning; consisting in incrementalmaintenance of materializations of ontological entailments in the presence of streaminginformation. Previous work; delivered in the context of deductive databases; describes theuse of logic programming for the incremental maintenance of such entailments. Ourcontribution is a new technique that exploits the nature of streaming data in order toefficiently maintain materialized views of RDF triples; which can be used by a reasoner. Byadding expiration time information to each RDF triple; we show that it is possible to computea new complete and correct materialization whenever a new window of streaming dataarrives; by dropping explicit statements and entailments that are no longer valid; and thencomputing when the RDF triples inserted within the window will expire. We provide …,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2010,131
Search computing: Managing complex search queries,Stefano Ceri; Adnan Abid; Mamoun Abu Helou; Davide Barbieri; Alessandro Bozzon; Daniele Braga; Marco Brambilla; Alessandro Campi; Francesco Corcoglioniti; Emanuele Della Valle; Davide Eynard; Piero Fraternali; Michael Grossniklaus; Davide Martinenghi; Stefania Ronchi; Marco Tagliasacchi; Salvatore Vadacca,Search computing focuses on building answers to complex search queries (for example;"Where can I attend an interesting conference in my field near a sunny beach?") byinteracting with a constellation of cooperating search services; and using result ranking andjoining as the dominant factors for service composition. The service computing paradigmhas so far been neutral to the specific features of search applications and services. Toaddress this weakness; search computing advocates a new approach in which search; join;and ranking are the central aspects for service composition.,Internet Computing; IEEE,2010,94
Spatio-temporal proximity as a basis for collaborative filtering in mobile environments,Alexandre De Spindler; Moira C Norrie; Michael Grossniklaus; Beat Signer,We propose a new approach to collaborative filtering in mobile tourist information systemsbased on spatio-temporal proximity in social contexts. Users store ratings and reviews oflocations and events locally within their personal information system and then exchangethese with other users present in the same social contexts using ad-hoc networking andopportunistic information sharing. We describe some preliminary investigations on the use ofthese methods in a mobile information system for visitors to a festival.,CAISE,2006,46
Stream reasoning: Where we got so far,Davide Barbieri; Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Michael Grossniklaus,Data Streams-unbounded sequences of time-varying data elements-are pervasive. Theyoccur in a variety of modern applications including the Web where blogs; feeds; andmicroblogs are increasingly adopted to distribute and present information in real-timestreams. We foresee the need for languages; tools and methodologies for representing;managing and reasoning on data streams for the Semantic Web. We collectively name thoseresearch chapters Stream Reasoning. In this extended abstract; we motivate the need forinvestigating Steam Reasoning; we characterize the notion of Stream Reasoning; we reportthe results obtained by Politecnico di Milano in studying Stream Reasoning from 2008 to2010; and we close the paper with a short review of the related works and some outlooks.,NeFoRS 2010: 4th International Workshop on New Forms of Reasoning for the Semantic Web: Scalable and Dynamic,2010,35
Information concepts for content management,Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,Abstract Content delivery is rapidly emerging as a complex systems domain concerned withmulti-channel; multi-format publication of information across user and application domains.A variety of content management solutions have been developed in response to thesechallenges based on; not only differing technologies; but also heterogeneous approaches.However; none of these present a solution that is both sufficient and consistent. Here wepresent an analysis of requirements leading to a general model of the information conceptscentral to content management. This model is the basis for a web content managementsolution currently under development.,Third International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2002,34
Modelling context for information environments,Rudi Belotti; Corsin Decurtins; Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie; Alexios Palinginis,Abstract Context-awareness has become an important consideration in the development ofmobile and ubiquitous systems. While efforts have been made to develop general contextmodels and application frameworks; it remains the case that often the notion of contextsupported is very restrictive and/or the representation of context is based on simple key-value pairs. As a result; most existing systems lack well-defined semantics and typing forcontext that would facilitate the general implementation; maintenance and adaption ofcontext-aware systems. In this paper; we present a general context model that consolidatesthe models underlying many other approaches; while moving to a higher-level of abstractionin terms of semantic context description.,International Workshop on Ubiquitous Mobile Information and Collaboration Systems,2004,33
Interplay of content and context,Rudi Belotti; Corsin Decurtins; Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie; Alexios Palinginis,Abstract We examine general and abstract approaches to web engineering and context-awareness and how they interact with each other. This involves considering theappropriateness of approaches to context when used by a complex application such as acontent management system; while; at the same time; presenting how a contentmanagement system can use context information to enrich its functionality. We show that theintegration of such systems is feasible only if; in both fields; we make use of approachesbased on strong information models. Last but not least; we show that the relationshipbetween context engines and content management systems is not at all a one-sided client-server scenario; but rather a mutually important symbiosis.,Journal of Web Engineering,2005,32
Continuous queries and real-time analysis of social semantic data with c-sparql,Davide Francesco Barbieri; Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Michael Grossniklaus,Social semantic data are becoming a reality; but apparently their streaming nature has beenignored so far. Streams; being unboun-ded sequences of time-varying data elements;should not be treated as persistent data to be stored “forever” and queried on demand; butrather as transient data to be consumed on the fly by queries which are regis-tered once andfor all and keep analyzing such streams; producing an-swers triggered by the streamingdata and not by explicit invocation. In this paper; we propose an approach to continuousqueries and real-time analysis of social semantic data with C-SPARQL; an extension ofSPARQL for querying RDF streams.,ISWC 2009: Second Workshop on Social Data on the Web (SDoW2009),2009,28
Database-driven web mashups,Andrei Vancea; Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,In most web mashup applications; the content is generated using either web feeds or anapplication programming interface (API) based on web services. Both approaches havelimitations. Data models provided by web feeds are not powerful enough to permit complexdata structures to be transmitted. APIs based on web services are usually different for eachweb application; and thus different implementations of the APIs are required for each webservice that a web mashup application uses. We propose a database-driven approach toweb mashups that supports integration at the database level and enables mashupdevelopers to work with a uniform abstract model and have direct access to powerfulfeatures of database systems. We describe how we have implemented this approach basedon an object-oriented database system with a rich object model and a generic proxy …,Web Engineering; 2008. ICWE'08.

Context-aware platform for mobile data management,Moira C Norrie; Beat Signer; Michael Grossniklaus; Rudi Belotti; Corsin Decurtins; Nadir Weibel,Abstract Interaction design is a major issue for mobile information systems in terms of notonly the choice of input/output channels and presentation of information; but also theapplication of context-awareness. To support experimentation with these factors; we havedeveloped platforms to support the rapid prototyping of multi-channel; multi-modal; context-aware applications. The Java-based platform presented here is based on an integration of across-media link server and an object-oriented framework for advanced content publishing;along with a Client Controller and Context Engine. We also describe how this platform wasused to develop a mobile tourist information system for an international arts festival whereinteraction was based on a combination of interactive paper and speech output.,Wireless Networks,2007,23
Paper-based mobile access to databases,Beat Signer; Moira C Norrie; Michael Grossniklaus; Rudi Belotti; Corsin Decurtins; Nadir Weibel,Abstract Our demonstration is a paper-based interactive guide for visitors to the world'slargest international arts festival that was developed as part of a project investigating newforms of context-aware information delivery and interaction in mobile environments.Information stored in a database is accessed from a set of interactive paper documents;including a printed festival brochure; a city map and a bookmark. Active areas are definedwithin the documents and selection of these using a special digital pen causes thecorresponding query request along with context data to be sent to a festival applicationdatabase and the response is returned to the visitor in the form of generated speech output.In addition to paper-based information browsing and transactions such as ticket booking; thedigital pen can also be applied for data capture of event ratings and handwritten …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,21
Jump—from java annotations to uml profiles,Alexander Bergmayr; Michael Grossniklaus; Manuel Wimmer; Gerti Kappel,Abstract The capability of UML profiles to serve as annotation mechanism has beenrecognized in both industry and research. Today's modeling tools offer profiles specific toplatforms; such as Java; as they facilitate model-based engineering approaches. However;the set of available profiles is considerably smaller compared to the number of existing Javalibraries using annotations. This is because an effective mapping between Java and UML togenerate profiles from annotation-based libraries is missing. In this paper; we present JUMPto overcome this limitation; thereby continuing existing mapping efforts by emphasizing onannotations and profiles. We demonstrate the practical value of JUMP by contributingprofiles that facilitate reverse-engineering and forward-engineering scenarios for the Javaplatform. The evaluation of JUMP shows that profiles can be automatically generated from …,International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,2014,18
Semantic data management for db4o,Moira C Norrie; Michael Grossniklaus; Corsin Decurtins; Alexandre de Spindler; Andrei Vancea; Stefania Leone,Object databases such as db4o provide a very simple and effective way of makingapplication objects persistent. However; they offer limited support for high-level databaseapplication programming in terms of facilities for the management of complex interrelatedcollections of data objects over long periods of time. Concepts of semantic data models suchas role modelling; and associations are lacking and this results in a new impedancemismatch between the program and data models of the application. To address thisproblem; we have developed a semantic data management layer for db4o which supportsrole modelling; associations and a declarative query language.,ICOODB,2008,17
Capturing episodes: may the frame be with you,David Maier; Michael Grossniklaus; Sharmadha Moorthy; Kristin Tufte,Abstract We are interested in detecting episodes in a data stream that are characterized by aperiod of time over which a condition holds; usually with a minimum duration. For example;we might want to know whenever any router has a packet-drop rate above 0.3%continuously for more than two minutes. Such episodes can be interesting in their own rightfor monitoring purposes; but they can also specify target regions for examination over theoriginal or other stream. For instance; for each router-drop episode we detect; we might wantto count the number of control messages the router received. We assert the keyrequirements are to detect the episodes; detect them accurately; and detect them promptly.Current capabilities for data-stream management systems (DSMSs) include functionality;such as pattern-matching and windowed aggregates; that can help with detecting some …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2012,16
XCML: providing context-aware language extensions for the specification of multi-device web applications,Michael Nebeling; Michael Grossniklaus; Stefania Leone; Moira C Norrie,Abstract There is a vast body of research dealing with the development of context-awareweb applications that can adapt to different user; platform and device contexts. However; therange and growing diversity of new devices poses two significant problems to existingapproaches. First; many techniques require a number of additional design processes andmodelling steps before applications can be adapted. Second; the new generation ofplatforms and technologies underlying these devices as well as upcoming web standardsHTML5 and CSS3 have partly changed the way in which web applications are implementednowadays and often limit the way in which they can be adapted. In this paper; we presentXCML as one example of a domain-specific language that tightly integrates context-awareconcepts and adaptivity mechanisms to support developers in the specification and …,World Wide Web,2012,16
An object-oriented version model for context-aware data management,Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,Abstract Context-aware computing is a major trend in mobile computing; pervasivecomputing and web engineering. Several models; frameworks and infrastructures havebeen developed to represent; process and manage context. While most of these approachessupport the adaptation of application logic based on context; the requirements of context-aware systems in terms of data management have received little attention. This is mostapparent in the field of web engineering as many web sites are data-intensive and requirecontext-dependent content adaptation to support internationalisation; personalisation andmultiple channels. We present a version model featuring alternative versions for context-aware data management and query processing that has been integrated in an object-oriented database system. Finally; we also describe the implementation of a mobile …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2007,16
An algebra and equivalences to transform graph patterns in neo4j,Jürgen Hölsch; Michael Grossniklaus,Modern query optimizers of relational database systems embody more than three decadesof research and practice in the area of data management and processing. Key advances in-clude algebraic query transformation; intelligent search space pruning; and modularoptimizer architectures. Surprisingly; many of these contributions seem to have beenoverlooked in the emerging field of graph databases so far. In particular; we believe thatquery optimization based on a general graph algebra and its equivalences can greatlyimprove on the current state of the art. Although some graph algebras have already beenproposed; they have often been developed in a context; in which a relational databasesystem is used as a backend to process graph data. As a consequence; these algebras aretypically tightly coupled to the relational algebra; making them unsuitable for native graph …,EDBT/ICDT 2016 Workshops: EDBT Workshop on Querying Graph Structured Data (GraphQ),2016,15
Crowdsourced web site evaluation with crowdstudy,Michael Nebeling; Maximilian Speicher; Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,Abstract Many different automatic usability evaluation tools have been specificallydeveloped for web sites and web-based services; but they usually cannot replace usertesting. At the same time; traditional usability evaluation methods can be both expensive andtime consuming. We will demonstrate CrowdStudy; a toolkit for crowdsourced testing of webinterfaces that allows; not only to efficiently recruit larger amounts of test users; but also toevaluate web sites under many different conditions.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2012,15
Interactive paper as a mobile client for a multi-channel web information system,Beat Signer; Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,Abstract We describe how interactive paper can be used together with a multi-channel webinformation system to build a platform for experimenting with multi-modal context-awaremobile information services. As an application; we present a tourist guide for visitors to aninternational festival that was developed to investigate alternative modes of informationdelivery and interaction in mobile environments. The guide is based around a set ofinteractive paper documents—an event brochure; map and bookmark. The brochure andmap are augmented with digital services by using a digital pen to activate links and a text-to-speech engine for information delivery. The digital pen is also used for data capture of eventratings and reviews. The bookmark provides access to advanced searches and ticketreservations.

Putting location-based services on the map,Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie; Beat Signer; Nadir Weibel,Abstract Location-based services for users on the move provide a convenient means offiltering information based on current geographical position. However users also often wantto retrieve or capture information associated with past or future locations. We show how newtechnologies for interactive paper can be used to augment conventional paper maps withlocation-based services using a combination of user tracking and pointing to the map tospecify location.,International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems,2006,13
Run-time and task-based performance of event detection techniques for Twitter,Andreas Weiler; Michael Grossniklaus; Marc H Scholl,Abstract Twitter's increasing popularity as a source of up to date news and information aboutcurrent events has spawned a body of research on event detection techniques for socialmedia data streams. Although all proposed approaches provide some evidence as to thequality of the detected events; none relate this task-based performance to their run-timeperformance in terms of processing speed or data throughput. In particular; neither aquantitative nor a comparative evaluation of these aspects has been performed to date. Inthis paper; we study the run-time and task-based performance of several state-of-the-artevent detection techniques for Twitter. In order to reproducibly compare run-timeperformance; our approach is based on a general-purpose data stream managementsystem; whereas task-based performance is automatically assessed based on a series of …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2015,12
Chapter 12: Panta Rhei: Flexible Execution Engine for Search Computing Queries,Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Francesco Corcoglioniti; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract The efficient execution of data-intensive computations over services is achallenging task: data are retrieved from remote sources and therefore are not available inthe query engine until after the execution of these calls; but the system must be inherentlyefficient thereafter; by guaranteeing that data is immediately cached and processedefficiently; according to the best query plan. In this chapter; we present a flexible executionmodel for search computing queries; named Panta Rhei. The proposed execution engineparadigm adopts the producer/consumer model and supports both data-driven and event-driven synchronization; and their interplay. Query plans are modeled as directed graphs;whose nodes are processing units and whose edges are either control or data flows. Whilecontrol flows synchronize service calls and unit execution; data flows transfer data …,Search Computing,2010,12
Java framework for database-centric web engineering,Beat Signer; Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,We present a database-centric approach to web site development in which both applicationand web content data are managed by a database. The development process is based onthree main stages of information modelling; document content design and presentationspecification. A Java framework based on the OMS object-oriented data managementsystem has been developed to support the development life cycle from rapid prototypingthrough to operation.

Cloud modeling languages by example,Alexander Bergmayr; Manuel Wimmer; Gerti Kappel; Michael Grossniklaus,Recently; several proposals towards a cloud modeling language have emerged. As theyaddress the diversity of cloud environments; it is not surprising that these modelinglanguages support different scenarios. Using a by-example approach based on the scenarioof software migration; we demonstrate their representational capabilities and review themaccording to characteristics common to all modeling languages as well as specific to thecloud computing domain. We report on our findings and present research guidelines forfuture efforts towards a better alignment of the different cloud modeling languages.,Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA); 2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on,2014,11
Event identification and tracking in social media streaming data,Andreas Weiler; Michael Grossniklaus; Marc H Scholl,In recent years; the growing popularity and active use of social media services on the webhave resulted in massive amounts of user-generated data. With these data available; thereis also an increasing interest in analyzing it and to extract information from it. Since socialmedia analysis is concerned with investigating current events around the world; there is astrong emphasis on identifying these evens as quickly as possible; ideally in real-time. Inorder to scale with the rapidly increasing volume of social media data; we propose toexplore very simple event identification mechanisms; rather than applying the more complexapproaches that have been proposed in the literature. In this paper; we present a firstinvestigation along this motivation. We discuss a simple sliding window model; which usesshifts in the inverse document frequency (IDF) to capture trending terms as well as to track …,EDBT/ICDT,2014,11
Recommendation based on opportunistic information sharing between tourists,Alexandre De Spindler; Moira C Norrie; Michael Grossniklaus,We propose a new approach to collaborative filtering in mobile tourist information systemsbased on spatiotemporal proximity in social contexts. The approach is motivated by a surveyof festival visitors confirming that similarities of interests extend beyond events definingspecific social contexts. We show how opportunistic information sharing in mobile ad hocnetworks can be used to realize decentralized collaborative filtering appropriate for mobileenvironments and show its equivalence to existing centralized approaches.,Information Technology & Tourism,2008,11
Evaluation measures for event detection techniques on Twitter data streams,Andreas Weiler; Michael Grossniklaus; Marc H Scholl,Abstract Twitter's popularity as a source of up-to-date news and information is constantlyincreasing. In response to this trend; numerous event detection techniques have beenproposed to cope with the rate and volume of social media data streams. Although most ofthese works conduct some evaluation of the proposed technique; a comparative study isoften omitted. In this paper; we present a series of measures that we designed to support thequantitative and qualitative comparison of event detection techniques. In order todemonstrate the effectiveness of these measures; we apply them to state-of-the-art eventdetection techniques as well as baseline approaches using real-world Twitter streamingdata.,British International Conference on Databases,2015,10
Dynamic metamodel extension modules to support adaptive data management,Michael Grossniklaus; Stefania Leone; Alexandre De Spindler; Moira C Norrie,Abstract Databases are now used in a wide variety of settings resulting in requirementswhich may differ substantially from one application to another; even to the point of conflict.Consequently; there is no database product that can support all forms of information systemsranging from enterprise applications to personal information systems running on mobiledevices. Further; domains such as the Web have demonstrated the need to cope with rapidlyevolving requirements. We define dynamic metamodel extension modules that supportadaptive data management by evolving a system in the event of changing requirements andshow how this technique was applied to cater for specific application settings.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2010,10

OMS Java: Providing Information; Storage and Access Abstractions in an Object-OrientedFramework,Adrian Kobler; Moira C Norrie; Beat Signer; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract In this paper; we present the main objectives and components of the OMS Javadata management framework. We argue that developers of modern information systemsrequire high-level application programming interfaces; storage platform independence andsupport for universal client access. We describe how the OMS Java framework providesthree level of abstractions—storage; information and access in order to realise theseobjectives. We then present each of these layers in turn—starting with the informationabstractions which lie at the core of the system and then going on to the storage and accesslayers.,*,2001,9
How to make sense of team sport data: From acquisition to data modeling and research aspects,Manuel Stein; Halldór Janetzko; Daniel Seebacher; Alexander Jäger; Manuel Nagel; Jürgen Hölsch; Sven Kosub; Tobias Schreck; Daniel A Keim; Michael Grossniklaus,Automatic and interactive data analysis is instrumental in making use of increasing amountsof complex data. Owing to novel sensor modalities; analysis of data generated inprofessional team sport leagues such as soccer; baseball; and basketball has recentlybecome of concern; with potentially high commercial and research interest. The analysis ofteam ball games can serve many goals; eg; in coaching to understand effects of strategiesand tactics; or to derive insights improving performance. Also; it is often decisive to trainersand analysts to understand why a certain movement of a player or groups of playershappened; and what the respective influencing factors are. We consider team sport as groupmovement including collaboration and competition of individuals following specific rule sets.Analyzing team sports is a challenging problem as it involves joint understanding of …,Data,2017,8
Efficient computation of search computing queries,Daniele Braga; Michael Grossniklaus; Francesco Corcoglioniti; Salvatore Vadacca,Abstract This chapter gives a high-level overview of how query processing is carried out inSeCo. At the highest level of abstraction; queries are expressed in a conjunctive declarativequery language over service interfaces; named SeCoQL; chosen to be a compact andreadable formulation to serve both experts users and system developers. Queries are thenexpressed at a logical level in the form of acyclic invocation workflows; after a compile-timeanalysis that decides a cost-driven scheduling of service invocations. At a lower; physicallevel queries are then translated into executable specifications that distinguish between thedata flow and the control flow; support parallelism; account for stateless and statefulcomputation tasks; and support backward and forward control. The query engine isimplemented as an interpreter of these physical plans. A workbench and testing …,*,2011,8
Producing interactive paper documents based on multi-channel content publishing,Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie; Beat Signer; Nadir Weibel,Digital pen and paper technologies provide the basis for linking digital content and servicesto printed materials in the form of interactive paper publications. To realise the potential ofthese technologies; it is important to develop platforms and tools that can support the large-scale publishing of interactive paper documents. We show how an extensible contentmanagement system that was developed to support context-aware publishing was used forthe production of interactive paper documents. The publishing process consists of twophases and requires one channel to support the production of the document together withcross-media link definitions and a second channel to support interaction with the document.,Automated Production of Cross Media Content for Multi-Channel Distribution; 2007.

Frames: data-driven windows,Michael Grossniklaus; David Maier; James Miller; Sharmadha Moorthy; Kristin Tufte,Abstract Traditional Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) segment data streamsusing windows that are defined either by a time interval or a number of tuples. Suchwindows are fixed---the definition unvarying over the course of a stream---and are definedbased on external properties unrelated to the data content of the stream. However; streamsand their content do vary over time---the rate of a data stream may vary or the datadistribution of the content may vary. The mismatch between a fixed stream segmentation anda variable stream motivates the need for a more flexible; expressive and physicallyindependent stream segmentation. We introduce a new stream segmentation technique;called frames. Frames segment streams based on data content. We present a theory andimplementation of frames and show the utility of frames for a variety of applications.,Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems,2016,7
Panta rhei: Optimized and ranked data processing over heterogeneous sources,Daniele Braga; Francesco Corcoglioniti; Michael Grossniklaus; Salvatore Vadacca,Abstract In the era of digital information; the value of data resides not only in its volume andquality; but also in the additional information that can be inferred from the combination(aggregation; comparison and join) of such data. There is a concrete need for dataprocessing solutions that combine distributed and heterogeneous data sources; such asWeb services; relational databases; and even search engines; that can all be modeled asservices. In this demonstration; we show how our Panta Rhei model addresses thechallenge of processing data over heterogeneous sources to provide feasible and rankedcombinations of these services.,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2010,7
Information sharing modalities for mobile ad-hoc networks,Alexandre de Spindler; Michael Grossniklaus; Christoph Lins; Moira C Norrie,Abstract Current mobile phone technologies have fostered the emergence of a newgeneration of mobile applications. Such applications allow users to interact and shareinformation opportunistically when their mobile devices are in physical proximity or close tofixed installations. It has been shown how mobile applications such as collaborative filteringand location-based services can take advantage of ad-hoc connectivity to use physicalproximity as a filter mechanism inherent to the application logic. We discuss the differentmodes of information sharing that arise in such settings based on the models of persistenceand synchronisation. We present a platform that supports the development of applicationsthat can exploit these modes of ad-hoc information sharing and; by means of an example;show how such an application can be realised based on the supported event model.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2009,7

Efficient structural bulk updates on the pre/dist/size XML encoding,Lukas Kircher; Michael Grossniklaus; Christian Grün; Marc H Scholl,In order to manage XML documents; native XML databases use specific encodings that mapthe hierarchical structure of a document to a flat representation. Several encodings havebeen proposed that differ in terms of their support for certain query workloads. While someencodings are optimized for query processing; others focus on data manipulation. Forexample; the Pre/Dist/Size XML encoding has been designed to support queries over allXPath axes efficiently; but processing atomic updates in XML documents can be costly. Inthis paper; we present a technique; so-called structural bulk updates; that works in concertwith the XQuery Update Facility to support efficient updates on the Pre/Dist/Size encoding.We demonstrate the benefits of our technique in a detailed performance evaluation basedon the XMark benchmark.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,6
Context-Aware Data Management-An Object-Oriented Version Model,Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract Context-awareness is a requirement of many modern applications. While severalsolutions exist to gather; represent and process context; very few provide management ofcontext-aware data. In this book; a two-dimensional version model is presented; that allowsmanaging context-dependent variants; while; at the same time; keeping track of the revisionhistory. Queries are processed based on a matching algorithm that uses the current contextof the system to select the best object. As an application of this extended database; a contentmanagement system has been designed and implemented. This Extensible ContentManagement System (XCM) provides a flexible platform for web engineering; built on theseparation of content; structure; view and presentation. Metadata about these concepts ismanaged within the extended database and therefore all aspects of a web system …,*,2007,6
On-line clustering for real-time topic detection in social media streaming data,Robert Popovici; Andreas Weiler; Michael Grossniklaus,The continuous growth of social networks and the active use of social media services resultin massive amounts of user-generated data. Worldwide; more and more people report anddistribute up-to-date information about al-most any topic. At the same time; there is anincreasing interest in information that can be gathered from this data. The popularity of newservices and technologies that produce and consume data streams imposes newchallenges on the analysis; namely; in terms of handling high volumes of noisy data in real-time. Since social media analysis is concerned with investigating current topics and actualevents around the world; there is a pronounced need to detect topics in the data and todirectly display their occurrence to analysts or other users. In this paper; we present an on-line clustering approach; which builds on traditional data mining methods to address the …,SNOW 2014 Data Challenge,2014,5
Synchronising personal data with web 2.0 data sources,Stefania Leone; Michael Grossniklaus; Alexandre de Spindler; Moira C Norrie,Abstract Web 2.0 users may publish a rich variety of personal data to a number of sites byuploading personal desktop data or actually creating it on the Web 2.0 site.

The case for object databases in cloud data management,Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract With the emergence of cloud computing; new data management requirements havesurfaced. Currently; these challenges are studied exclusively in the setting of relationaldatabases. We believe that there exist strong indicators that the full potential of cloudcomputing data management can only be leveraged by exploiting object databasetechnologies. Object databases are a popular choice for analytical data managementapplications which are predicted to profit most from cloud computing. Furthermore; objectsand relationships might be useful units to model and implement data partitions; while; at thesame time; helping to reduce join processing. Finally; the service-oriented view taken bycloud computing is in its nature a close match to object models. In this position paper; weexamine the challenges of cloud computing data management and show opportunities for …,International Conference on Object and Databases,2010,5
Join methods and query optimization,Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract Joins between data sources are an essential ingredient of multi-domain queries; asthey exploit connection patterns defined between service marts or between serviceinterfaces. This chapter moves from the definition of a query language over serviceinterfaces; sketching how queries can be directly expressed over service marts and howthese can be translated over service interfaces. The fundamental operation discussed in thischapter is the binary join between two sources; which is influenced by the type (search vs.exact) of services and by the management (parallel vs. sequential) of service calls. Then;this chapter presents an optimization framework for queries over several service interfaces;which considers several cost metrics for mapping queries into query plans; consisting ofspecific operations over services; and includes a branch and bound approach to the …,*,2010,5
Unified event model for object databases,Michael Grossniklaus; Stefania Leone; Alexandre de Spindler; Moira C Norrie,Abstract Most object databases offer little or no support for event-based programming overand above what is provided in the programming language. Consequently; functionalityoffered by traditional database triggers and event-condition-action (ECA) rules has to becoded in each application. We believe that a notion of triggers should be offered by objectdatabases to facilitate application development and a clear separation of concerns. Wepresent a general and flexible event model that unifies concepts from programminglanguages and database triggers. We describe an implementation of the model and how itcan support the requirements of a rich variety of applications.,International Conference on Object Databases,2009,5

Development framework for mobile social applications,Alexandre de Spindler; Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,Abstract Developments in mobile phone technologies have opened the way for a newgeneration of mobile social applications that allow users to interact and share information.However; current programming platforms for mobile phones provide limited support forinformation management and sharing; requiring developers to deal with low-level issues ofdata persistence; data exchange and vicinity sensing. We present a framework designed tosupport the requirements of mobile social applications based on a notion of P2P datacollections and a flexible event model that controls how and when data is exchanged. Weshow how the framework can be used by describing the development of a mobileapplication for collaborative filtering based on opportunistic information sharing.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2009,5
Metatemplate driven multi-channel presentation,Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie; P Biichler,The separation of content; layout; structure and view that is enforced by the variousemerging content management systems and Web modelling tools; renders theimplementation of suitable editors for content providers very difficult. As most of thesesystems work on the basis of XML and XSLT and support multiple languages andpresentation channels; creating and editing content has become more tedious andchallenging. Various attempts at creating graphical XSLT editors have been made but mostof them lack the versatility to be used in conjunction with a content management system. Inthis paper; we present a solution based on generic metatemplates. We then describe howwe exploited this approach for an editor integrated into a content management system thatwe have developed.,Web Information Systems Engineering Workshops; 2003. Proceedings.

An evaluation of the run-time and task-based performance of event detection techniques for Twitter,Andreas Weiler; Michael Grossniklaus; Marc H Scholl,Abstract Twitter׳ s increasing popularity as a source of up-to-date news and informationabout current events has spawned a body of research on event detection techniques forsocial media data streams. Although all proposed approaches provide some evidence as tothe quality of the detected events; none relate this task-based performance to their run-timeperformance in terms of processing speed; data throughput; or memory usage. In particular;neither a quantitative nor a comparative evaluation of these aspects has been performed todate. In this article; we study the run-time and task-based performance of several state-of-the-art event detection techniques for Twitter. In order to reproducibly compare run-timeperformance; our approach is based on a general-purpose data stream managementsystem; whereas task-based performance is automatically assessed based on a series of …,Information Systems,2016,4
Optimization of nested queries using the NF2 algebra,Jürgen Hölsch; Michael Grossniklaus; Marc H Scholl,Abstract A key promise of SQL is that the optimizer will find the most efficient execution plan;regardless of how the query is formulated. In general; query optimizers of modern databasesystems are able to keep this promise; with the notable exception of nested queries. Whileseveral optimization techniques for nested queries have been proposed; their adoption inpractice has been limited. In this paper; we argue that the NF2 (non-first normal form)algebra; which was originally designed to process nested tables; is a better approach tonested query optimization as it fulfills two key requirements. First; the NF2 algebra canrepresent all types of nested queries as well as both existing and novel optimizationtechniques based on its equivalences. Second; performance benefits can be achieved withlittle changes to existing transformation-based query optimizers as the NF2 algebra is an …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,4
Situation monitoring of urban areas using social media data streams,Andreas Weiler; Michael Grossniklaus; Marc H Scholl,Abstract The continuous growth of social networks and the active use of social mediaservices result in massive amounts of user-generated data. Our goal is to leverage socialmedia users as “social sensors” in order to increase the situational awareness within andabout urban areas. In addition to the well-known challenges of event and topic detection andtracking; this task involves a spatial and temporal dimension. In this paper; we present avisualization that supports analysts in monitoring events/topics and emotions both in timeand in space. The visualization uses a clock-face metaphor to encode temporal and spatialrelationships; a color map to reflect emotion; and tag clouds for events and topics. Ahierarchy of these clock-faces supports drilling down to finer levels of granularity as well asrolling up the vast and fast flow of information. In order to showcase these functionalities …,Information Systems,2016,4
Bridging java annotations and UML profiles with JUMP,Alexander Bergmayr; Michael Grossniklaus; Manuel Wimmer; Gerti Kappel,UML profiles support annotations at the modeling level. However; current modeling toolslack the capabilities to generate such annotations required for the programming level; whichis desirable for reverse engineering and for-ward engineering scenarios. To overcome thisshortcoming; we defined an effec-tive conceptual mapping between Java annotations andUML profiles as a basis for implementing the JUMP tool. It automates the generation ofprofiles from annotation-based libraries and their application to generate profiled UML mod-els. In this demonstration; we (i) compare our mapping with the different rep-resentationalcapabilities of current UML modeling tools;(ii) apply our tool to a model-based softwaremodernization scenario; and (iii) evaluate its scalability with real-world libraries andapplications.,ACM/IEEE 17th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MoDELS 2014),2014,4
A flexible object model and algebra for uniform access to object databases,Michael Grossniklaus; Alexandre de Spindler; Christoph Zimmerli; Moira C Norrie,Abstract In contrast to their relational counterparts; object databases are moreheterogeneous in terms of their architecture; data model and functionality. To this day; thisheterogeneity poses substantial difficulties when it comes to benchmark or interoperateobject databases. While standardisation proposals have been made in the past; they havehad limited impact as neither industry nor research has fully adopted them. We believe thatone reason for this lack of adoption is that these standards were too restrictive and thus notcapable of dealing with the heterogeneity of object databases. In this paper; we propose auniform interface for access to object databases that is based on a flexible object model andalgebra.,International Conference on Object and Databases,2010,4
Modelling safe interface interactions in web applications,Marco Brambilla; Jordi Cabot; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract Current Web applications embed sophisticated user interfaces and business logic.The original interaction paradigm of the Web based on static content pages that are browsedby hyperlinks is; therefore; not valid anymore. In this paper; we advocate a paradigm shift forbrowsers and Web applications; that improves the management of user interaction andbrowsing history. Pages are replaced by States as basic navigation nodes; andBack/Forward navigation along the browsing history is replaced by a full-fledged interactiveapplication paradigm; supporting transactions at the interface level and featuringUndo/Redo capabilities. This new paradigm offers a safer and more precise interactionmodel; protecting the user from unexpected behaviours of the applications and the browser.,Conceptual Modeling-ER 2009,2009,4
Supporting different patterns of interaction through context-aware data management,Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,Ubiquitous and mobile computing often introduce novel modes of interaction with differentinteraction patterns than those typical of traditional desktop applications. Therefore; there isa need to extend general models and systems for context-awareness to include adaptationof interaction styles to context. We present an object-oriented data management system thatsupports context-awareness through a notion of multi-variant objects and describe how itwas used to implement context-aware interaction patterns. Our approach was motivated byour experiences of developing a mobile application that offered an interface based on a setof interactive paper documents alongside a regular web interface and we use this exampleto explain the issues and our solution in detail.,Journal of Web Engineering,2008,4

OMS jp A Uniform JavaTM Interface to Heterogenous OMS Platforms,Michael Grossniklaus,The research done in the field of object-oriented data management systems within theGlobal Information Systems Group has lead to a number of implementations of the ObjectModel (OM) data model. The family of Object Model System (OMS) implementationscomprises platforms implemented in Prolog; Java and C++. Rapid prototyping with thesesystems can only be achieved; if it is possible to move freely from one system to another.Therefore all implementations of the OM model share a common language for datadefinition; manipulation and querying. As OM standardises the way data is represented; theObject Model Language (OML) standardises the way in which to interact with data. What ismissing is an Application Programming Interface (API) that defines how programmes canwork with an OMS database.,*,2005,4
Survey and experimental analysis of event detection techniques for twitter,Andreas Weiler; Michael Grossniklaus; Marc H Scholl,Abstract Twitter's popularity as a source of up-to-date news and information is constantlyincreasing. In response to this trend; numerous event detection techniques have beenproposed to cope with the rate and volume of Twitter data streams. Although most of theseworks conduct some evaluation of the proposed technique; a comparative study is oftenomitted. In this paper; we present a survey and experimental analysis of state-of-the-artevent detection techniques for Twitter data streams. In order to conduct this study; we definea series of measures to support the quantitative and qualitative comparison. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of these measures by applying them to event detectiontechniques as well as to baseline approaches using real-world Twitter streaming data.,The Computer Journal,2017,3
Towards a benchmark for graph data management and processing,Michael Grossniklaus; Stefania Leone; Tilmann Zäschke,Graph data is used in an increasing number of analytical data processing applications;ranging from social network analysis; to monitoring of network traffic; and to ontologies in thesemantic web. Both application-specific and general graph data management systems havebeen proposed to address this trend. Nevertheless; it would be foolish to dismiss relationaland object databases as possible solutions for graph data management and processing;due to the vast amount of experience that they encompass. As a consequence; graph dataanalysts are faced with a broad variety of choices and approaches. However; regardless ofthe approach taken; users need to be able to evaluate and assess which of the manypossible solutions works best in their use case.

Realising Proactive Behaviour in Mobile Data-Centric Applications,Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie; Julian Sgier,Abstract. Mobile data-centric applications gather; process and disseminate relevantinformation to users on the move. The reduced information bandwidth characteristic ofmobile platforms and the division of the user's attention over multiple tasks are majorchallenges in such systems. To compensate for these limitations; most mobile applicationspropose the use of context information to realise adaptive and proactive behaviour. Althoughlightweight object-oriented databases have become a popular choice for storing data inmobile systems; they rarely provide event handling facilities sophisticated enough to supportproactivity. We present an approach that combines mechanisms introduced by notificationsystems and modern programming languages with the notion of traditional databasetriggers. The resulting unified event model has been implemented as an extension of an …,Ubiquitous Mobile Information and Collaboration Systems,2007,3

Therefore; an application has to adhere to a welldefined security policy on one hand and be highly adaptable to context on the other. Wehave extended the OM data model; with its rich support for role modelling; with concepts formodelling interactions between users and applications. In this paper; we show how theresulting interaction model can be used for role-based access control; as well as formodelling interactions in context-aware applications.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2006,3

Leveraging annotation-based modeling with JUMP,Alexander Bergmayr; Michael Grossniklaus; Manuel Wimmer; Gerti Kappel,Abstract The capability of UML profiles to serve as annotation mechanism has beenrecognized in both research and industry. Today's modeling tools offer profiles specific toplatforms; such as Java; as they facilitate model-based engineering approaches. However;considering the large number of possible annotations in Java; manually developing thecorresponding profiles would only be achievable by huge development and maintenanceefforts. Thus; leveraging annotation-based modeling requires an automated approachcapable of generating platform-specific profiles from Java libraries. To address thischallenge; we present the fully automated transformation chain realized by Jump; therebycontinuing existing mapping efforts between Java and UML by emphasizing on annotationsand profiles. The evaluation of Jump shows that it scales for large Java libraries and …,Software & Systems Modeling,2018,2
The Stor-e-Motion visualization for topic evolution tracking in text data streams,Andreas Weiler; Michael Grossniklaus; Marc H Scholl,Nowadays; there are plenty of sources generating massive amounts of text data streams in acontinuous way.

Harnessing facebook for the evaluation of recommender systems based on physical copresence,Alexandre de Spindler; Stefania Leone; Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,Various mobile social applications have proposed the use of ad-hoc network connectivity asa means of detecting user encounters and shared social contexts. These applications rangefrom simple opportunistic information sharing to techniques for collaborative filtering inmobile settings. However; it can be difficult and costly to test the underlying assumption thatrepeated physical copresence can be used as a measure of user similarity. We havetherefore developed a framework that allows existing online social platforms such asFacebook to be coupled with simple; standard mobile applications in order to test suchhypotheses. The central idea is to map the physical copresence of users to connections invirtual social networks and then exploit the rich support for developing pluggableapplications to measure user similarity within these networks.,European Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2008,2

On the performance of analytical and pattern matching graph queries in neo4j and a relational database,Jürgen Hölsch; Tobias Schmidt; Michael Grossniklaus,Graph databases with a custom non-relational backend promote themselves to outperformrelational databases in answering queries on large graphs. Recent empirical studies showthat this claim is not always true. However; these studies focus only on pattern matchingqueries and neglect analytical queries used in practice such as shortest path; diameter;degree centrality or closeness centrality. In addition; there is no distinction between differenttypes of pattern matching queries. In this paper; we introduce a set of analytical and patternmatching queries; and evaluate them in Neo4j and a market-leading commercial relationaldatabase system. We show that the relational database system outperforms Neo4j for ouranalytical queries and that Neo4j is faster for queries that do not filter on specific edge types.,EDBT/ICDT 2017 Joint Conference: 6th International Workshop on Querying Graph Structured Data (GraphQ),2017,1

Run-time adaptivity for search computing,Daniele Braga; Michael Grossniklaus; Norman W Paton,Abstract In Search Computing; queries act over internet resources; and combine access tostandard web services with exact results and to ranked search services. Such resourcesoften provide limited statistical information that can be used to inform static queryoptimization; and correlations between the values and ranks associated with differentresources may only become clear at query runtime. As a result; search computing seemslikely to benefit from adaptive query processing; where information obtained during queryevaluation is used to change the way in which a query is executing. This chapter provides aperspective on how run-time adaptivity can be achieved in the context of Search Computing.,*,2011,1

Bucket Selection: A Model-Independent Diverse Selection Strategy for Widening,Alexander Fillbrunn; Leonard Wörteler; Michael Grossniklaus; Michael R Berthold,Abstract When using a greedy algorithm for finding a model; as is the case in many datamining algorithms; there is a risk of getting caught in local extrema; ie; suboptimal solutions.Widening is a technique for enhancing greedy algorithms by using parallel resources tobroaden the search in the model space. The most important component of widening is theselector; a function that chooses the next models to refine. This selector ideally enforcesdiversity within the selected set of models in order to ensure that parallel workers exploresufficiently different parts of the model space and do not end up mimicking a simple beamsearch. Previous publications have shown that this works well for problems with a suitabledistance measure for the models; but if no such measure is available; applying widening ischallenging.

Towards Adaptive Event Detection Techniques for the Twitter Social Media Data Stream,Michael Grossniklaus; Marc H Scholl; Andreas Weiler,Abstract Social media data streams are an invaluable source for timely and up-to-dateinformation about current events. As a consequence; several event detection techniqueshave been proposed in the literature in order to tap this information source. However; mostof these proposals focus on the information extraction aspect of the problem and tend toignore the streaming nature of the input. The work conducted in our research grouptherefore intends to address these stream-related challenges; such as detecting eventsincrementally; reporting them in (near) real-time; and coping with fluctuations and spikes inthe social media data stream.

We then present each of these layers in turn–starting with the informationabstractions which lie at the core of the system and then going on to the storage and accesslayers.,OOIS 2001: 7th International Conference on Object-Oriented Information Systems 27–29 August 2001; Calgary; Canada,2012,*

A collection-oriented framework for social applications,Alexandre De Spindler; Michael Grossniklaus; Moira C Norrie,Abstract Personal mobile devices and mobile ad-hoc networks are the technical ingredientsto build social networks in mobile environments. We present a framework that leveragessocial networks in order to obtain a collaborative environment for social applications. Theframework provides a flexible means for the specification of collaboration protocols andallows their transparent integration with the application logic. Consequently; the frameworksupports a clean separation of collaboration and application logic which simplifies thedevelopment of social applications.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2007,*
Visualization of dispatching strategies,Michael Grossniklaus,This document will help you to get an insight of what VISUAL DISPATCHER does; how itworks and how you can extend it to do what you want it to do. The document is partitionedinto four major sections. Each section can be read independently from the others. First youwill find a short introduction to the topic of my semester work and a reminiscence about thedevelopment of VISUAL DISPATCHER. The second chapter provides a quick user manualexplaining what can be done with VISUAL DISPATCHER and how it is done. If you just wantto experiment with the dispatching strategies of JAVA and LOOTION; then chapter two iswhat you should read. In chapter three; there will be a discussion of the software architectureof VISUAL DISPAT-CHER. One major goal of this project was to keep the architecture of thesoftware open; so that later on other dispatching strategies of different programming …,*,2000,*
