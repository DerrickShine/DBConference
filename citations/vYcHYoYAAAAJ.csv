Hermes: A distributed event-based middleware architecture,Peter R Pietzuch; Jean M Bacon,In this paper; we argue that there is a need for an event-based middleware to build large-scale distributed systems. Existing publish/subscribe systems still have limitations comparedto invocation-based middlewares. We introduce Hermes; a novel event-based distributedmiddleware architecture that follows a type-and attribute-based publish/subscribe model. Itcentres around the notion of an event type and supports features commonly known fromobject-oriented languages like type hierarchies and super-type subscriptions. A scalablerouting algorithm using an overlay routing network is presented that avoids globalbroadcasts by creating rendezvous nodes. Fault-tolerance mechanisms that can cope withdifferent kinds of failures in the middleware are integrated with the routing algorithmresulting in a scalable and robust system.,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops; 2002.

Distributed event-based systems,Gero Mühl; Ludger Fiege; Peter Pietzuch,In today's world; services and data are integrated in ever new constellations; requiring theeasy; flexible and scalable integration of autonomous; heterogeneous components intocomplex systems at any time. Event-based architectures inherently decouple systemcomponents. Event-based components are not designed to work with specific othercomponents in a traditional request/reply mode; but separate communication fromcomputation through asynchronous communication mechanisms via a dedicated notificationservice. Mühl; Fiege; and Pietzuch provide the reader with an in-depth description of event-based systems. They cover the complete spectrum of topics; ranging from a treatment oflocal event matching and distributed event forwarding algorithms; through a more practicaldiscussion of software engineering issues raised by the event-based style; to a …,*,2006,513
Network-aware operator placement for stream-processing systems,Peter Pietzuch; Jonathan Ledlie; Jeffrey Shneidman; Mema Roussopoulos; Matt Welsh; Margo Seltzer,To use their pool of resources efficiently; distributed stream-processing systems push queryoperators to nodes within the network. Currently; these operators; ranging from simple filtersto custom business logic; are placed manually at intermediate nodes along the transmissionpath to meet application-specific performance goals. Determining placement locations ischallenging because network and node conditions change over time and because streamsmay interact with each other; opening venues for reuse and repositioning of operators. Thispaper describes a stream-based overlay network (SBON); a layer between a stream-processing system and the physical network that manages operator placement for stream-processing systems. Our design is based on a cost space; an abstract representation of thenetwork and on-going streams; which permits decentralized; large-scale multi-query …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Hermes: A scalable event-based middleware,Peter R Pietzuch,Abstract Large-scale distributed systems require new middleware paradigms that do notsuffer from the limitations of traditional request/reply middleware. These limitations includetight coupling between components; a lack of information filtering capabilities; and supportfor one-to-one communication semantics only. We argue that event-based middleware is ascalable and powerful new type of middleware for building large-scale distributed systems.However; it is important that an event-based middleware platform includes all the standardfunctionality that an application programmer expects from middleware.,*,2004,242
Hourglass: An infrastructure for connecting sensor networks and applications,Jeff Shneidman; Peter Pietzuch; Jonathan Ledlie; Mema Roussopoulos; Margo Seltzer; Matt Welsh,Abstract The emergence of computationally-enabled sensors and the applications that usesensor data introduces the need for a software infrastructure designed specifically to enablethe rapid development and deployment of applications that draw upon data from multiple;heterogeneous sensor networks. We present the Hourglass infrastructure; which addressesthis need. Hourglass is an Internet-based infrastructure for connecting a wide range ofsensors; services; and applications in a robust fashion. In Hourglass; a stream of dataelements is routed to one or more applications. These data elements are generated fromsensors inside of sensor networks whose internals can be entirely hidden from participantsin the Hourglass system. The Hourglass infrastructure consists of an overlay network of well-connected dedicated machines that provides service registration; discovery; and routing …,*,2004,200
Integrating scale out and fault tolerance in stream processing using operator state management,Raul Castro Fernandez; Matteo Migliavacca; Evangelia Kalyvianaki; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract As users of" big data" applications expect fresh results; we witness a new breed ofstream processing systems (SPS) that are designed to scale to large numbers of cloud-hosted machines. Such systems face new challenges:(i) to benefit from the" pay-as-you-go"model of cloud computing; they must scale out on demand; acquiring additional virtualmachines (VMs) and parallelising operators when the workload increases;(ii) failures arecommon with deployments on hundreds of VMs-systems must be fault-tolerant with fastrecovery times; yet low per-machine overheads. An open question is how to achieve thesetwo goals when stream queries include stateful operators; which must be scaled out andrecovered without affecting query results. Our key idea is to expose internal operator stateexplicitly to the SPS through a set of state management primitives. Based on them; we …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2013,199
Composite event detection as a generic middleware extension,Peter R Pietzuch; Brian Shand; Jean Bacon,Event-based communication provides a flexible and robust approach to monitoring andmanaging large-scale distributed systems. Composite event detection extends the scopeand flexibility of these systems by allowing application components to express interest incomplex patterns of events. This makes it possible to handle the large numbers of eventsgenerated in Internet-wide systems; and in network monitoring and pervasive computingapplications. In this article; we introduce a novel generic composite event detectionframework that can be added on top of existing middleware architectures; as demonstratedin our implementation over JMS. We argue that the framework is flexible; expressive andeasy to implement.

A framework for event composition in distributed systems,Peter R Pietzuch; Brian Shand; Jean Bacon,Abstract For large-scale distributed applications such as internet-wide or ubiquitoussystems; event-based communication is an effective messaging mechanism betweencomponents. In order to handle the large volume of events in such systems; composite eventdetection enables application components to express interest in the occurrence of complexpatterns of events. In this paper; we introduce a general composite event detectionframework that can be added on top of existing middleware architectures--as demonstratedin our implementation over JMS.

Peer-to-peer overlay broker networks in an event-based middleware,Peter R Pietzuch; Jean Bacon,Abstract Overlay broker networks are an important part of an event-based middleware. Inthis paper; we investigate the requirements of overlay broker networks and argue that usingpeer-to-peer techniques for their creation and the content-based routing of events has manyadvantages. We support our claims with an experimental evaluation of Hermes; an event-based middleware architecture that uses a peer-to-peer routing substrate; in comparisonwith a standard publish/subscribe system that has a simple; predefined overlay topology.The results reveal that Hermes has better routing efficiency and keeps less routing state atthe event brokers.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Distributed event-based systems,2003,164
Distributed complex event processing with query rewriting,Nicholas Poul Schultz-Møller; Matteo Migliavacca; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract The nature of data in enterprises and on the Internet is changing. Data used to bestored in a database first and queried later. Today timely processing of new data;represented as events; is increasingly valuable. In many domains; complex eventprocessing (CEP) systems detect patterns of events for decision making. Examples includeprocessing of environmental sensor data; trades in financial markets and RSS web feeds.Unlike conventional database systems; most current CEP systems pay little attention toquery optimisation. They do not rewrite queries to more efficient representations or makedecisions about operator distribution; limiting their overall scalability. This paper describesthe NEXT CEP system that was especially designed for query rewriting and distribution.Event patterns are specified in a high-level query language and; before being translated …,Proceedings of the Third ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2009,153
Role-based access control for publish/subscribe middleware architectures,András Belokosztolszki; David M Eyers; Peter R Pietzuch; Jean Bacon; Ken Moody,Abstract Research into publish/subscribe messaging has so far done little to proposearchitectures for the support of access control; yet this will be an increasingly criticalrequirement as systems move to Internet-scale. This paper discusses the generalrequirements of publish/subscribe systems with access control. We then present our specificintegration of OASIS role-based access control into the Hermes publish/subscribemiddleware platform. Our system supports many advanced features; such as the ability towork within a network where nodes are attributed different levels of trust; and employs avariety of access restriction methods which balance expressiveness with the content-basedrouting optimisations available. We illustrate our achievements by discussing an applicationscenario in which our system will be of particular use.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Distributed event-based systems,2003,114
NaaS: Network-as-a-Service in the Cloud.,Paolo Costa; Matteo Migliavacca; Peter R Pietzuch; Alexander L Wolf,Abstract Cloud computing realises the vision of utility computing. Tenants can benefit fromon-demand provisioning of computational resources according to a pay-per-use model andcan outsource hardware purchases and maintenance. Tenants; however; have only limitedvisibility and control over network resources. Even for simple tasks; tenants must resort toinefficient overlay networks. To address these shortcomings; we propose Networkas-a-Service (NaaS); a framework that integrates current cloud computing offerings with direct; yetsecure; tenant access to the network infrastructure. Using NaaS; tenants can easily deploycustom routing and multicast protocols. Further; by modifying the content of packets onpath;they can efficiently implement advanced network services; such as in-network dataaggregation; redundancy elimination and smart caching.

Access control in publish/subscribe systems,Jean Bacon; David M Eyers; Jatinder Singh; Peter R Pietzuch,Abstract Two convincing paradigms have emerged for achieving scalability in widelydistributed systems: publish/subscribe communication and role-based; policy-driven controlof access to the system by applications. A strength of publish/subscribe is its many-to-manycommunication paradigm and loose coupling of components; so that publishers need notknow the recipients of their data and subscribers need not know the number and location ofpublishers. But some data is sensitive; and its visibility must be controlled carefully forpersonal and legal reasons. We describe the requirements of several application domainswhere the event-based paradigm is appropriate yet where security is an issue. Typical arethe large-scale systems required by government and public bodies for domains such ashealthcare; police; transport and environmental monitoring. We discuss how a publish …,Proceedings of the second international conference on Distributed event-based systems,2008,96
Stable and accurate network coordinates,Jonathan Ledlie; Peter Pietzuch; Margo Seltzer,Network coordinates provide a scalable way to estimate latencies among large numbers ofhosts. While there are several algorithms for producing coordinates; none account for thefact that nodes observe a stream of distinct observations that may vary by as much as threeorders-ofmagnitude. With such variable data; coordinate systems are prone to high error andinstability in live deployments. In addition; dynamics such as triangle violations can lead tocoordinate oscillations; producing further instability and making it difficult for applications toknow when their coordinates have truly changed. Because simulation results demonstratethat network coordinates are capable of providing low cost and sufficiently accurate answersto common queries; it is vital that we develop the ability to obtain similar results in practice.We propose two filters which combined to improve network coordinate accuracy by 54 …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2006.

SCONE: Secure Linux Containers with Intel SGX.,Sergei Arnautov; Bohdan Trach; Franz Gregor; Thomas Knauth; Andre Martin; Christian Priebe; Joshua Lind; Divya Muthukumaran; Dan O'Keeffe; Mark Stillwell; David Goltzsche; David M Eyers; Rüdiger Kapitza; Peter R Pietzuch; Christof Fetzer,Abstract In multi-tenant environments; Linux containers managed by Docker or Kuberneteshave a lower resource footprint; faster startup times; and higher I/O performance comparedto virtual machines (VMs) on hypervisors. Yet their weaker isolation guarantees; enforcedthrough software kernel mechanisms; make it easier for attackers to compromise theconfidentiality and integrity of application data within containers. We describe SCONE; asecure container mechanism for Docker that uses the SGX trusted execution support of IntelCPUs to protect container processes from outside attacks. The design of SCONE leads to (i)a small trusted computing base (TCB) and (ii) a low performance overhead: SCONE offers asecure C standard library interface that transparently encrypts/decrypts I/O data; to reducethe performance impact of thread synchronization and system calls within SGX enclaves …,OSDI,2016,93
Information flow control for secure cloud computing,Jean Bacon; David Eyers; Thomas FJ-M Pasquier; Jatinder Singh; Ioannis Papagiannis; Peter Pietzuch,Security concerns are widely seen as an obstacle to the adoption of cloud computingsolutions. Information Flow Control (IFC) is a well understood Mandatory Access Controlmethodology. The earliest IFC models targeted security in a centralised environment; butdecentralised forms of IFC have been designed and implemented; often within academicresearch projects. As a result; there is potential for decentralised IFC to achieve better cloudsecurity than is available today. In this paper we describe the properties of cloud computing-Platform-as-a-Service clouds in particular-and review a range of IFC models andimplementations to identify opportunities for using IFC within a cloud computing context.Since IFC security is linked to the data that it protects; both tenants and providers of cloudservices can agree on security policy; in a manner that does not require them to …,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2014,88
Network-aware overlays with network coordinates,Peter Pietzuch; Jonathan Ledlie; Michael Mitzenmacher; Margo Seltzer,Network coordinates; which embed network distance measurements in a coordinate system;were introduced as a method for determining the proximity of nodes for routing table updatesin overlay networks. Their power has far broader reach: due to their low overhead andautomatic adaptation to changes in the network; network coordinates provide a newparadigm for managing dynamic overlay networks. We compare network coordinates toother proposals for network-aware overlays and show how they permit the lucid expressionof a range of distributed systems problems in well-understood geometric terms.,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops; 2006.

Towards a common api for publish/subscribe,Peter Pietzuch; David Eyers; Samuel Kounev; Brian Shand,Abstract Over the last decade a wide range of publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems havecome out of the research community. However; there is little consensus on a commonpub/sub API; which would facilitate innovation; encourage application building; and simplifythe evaluation of existing prototypes. Industry pub/sub standards tend to be overly complex;technology-centric; and hard to extend; thus limiting their applicability in research systems.In this paper we propose a common API for pub/sub that is tailored towards researchrequirements. The API supports three levels of compliance (with optional extensions): thelowest level specifies abstract operations without prescribing an implementation or datamodel; medium compliance describes interactions using a light-weight XML-RPCmechanism; finally; the highest level of compliance enforces an XML-RPC data model …,Proceedings of the 2007 inaugural international conference on Distributed event-based systems,2007,56
Supporting Network Coordinates on PlanetLab.,Peter R Pietzuch; Jonathan Ledlie; Margo Seltzer,Abstract Large-scale distributed applications need latency information to make network-aware routing decisions. Collecting these measurements; however; can impose a highburden. Network coordinates are a scalable and efficient way to supply nodes with up-to-date latency estimates. We present our experience of maintaining network coordinates onPlanetLab. We present two different APIs for accessing coordinates: a per-applicationlibrary; which takes advantage of application-level traffic; and a stand-alone service; which isshared across applications. Our results show that statistical filtering of latency samplesimproves accuracy and stability and that a small number of neighbors is sufficient whenupdating coordinates.,WORLDS,2005,54
Congestion control in a reliable scalable message-oriented middleware,Peter R Pietzuch; Sumeer Bhola,Abstract This paper presents congestion control mechanisms for reliable and scalablemessage-oriented middleware following the publish/subscribe communication model. Weidentify the key requirements of congestion control in this environment; how it differs fromcongestion control for the Internet; and propose a combination of two congestion controlmechanisms;(1) driven by a publisher hosting broker (PDCC);(2) driven by a subscriberhosting broker (SDCC). SDCC decouples the notion of a receive window and a NACKwindow; and is used by subscriber hosting brokers in recovery mode. PDCC implements ascalable and low latency feedback loop between a publisher hosting broker and allsubscriber hosting brokers; which is used to adjust the rate of publishing new messages; toallow brokers in recovery to eventually catch up; and other brokers to keep up.

Guaranteeing information security in such systems is challengingbecause of their strict performance requirements in terms of high event throughput and lowprocessing latency. We describe DEFCON; an event processing system that enforcesconstraints on event flows between event processing units. DEFCON uses a combination ofstatic and runtime techniques for achieving light-weight isolation of event flows; whilesupporting efficient sharing of events.

SQPR: Stream query planning with reuse,Evangelia Kalyvianaki; Wolfram Wiesemann; Quang Hieu Vu; Daniel Kuhn; Peter Pietzuch,When users submit new queries to a distributed stream processing system (DSPS); a queryplanner must allocate physical resources; such as CPU cores; memory and networkbandwidth; from a set of hosts to queries. Allocation decisions must provide the correct mixof resources required by queries; while achieving an efficient overall allocation to scale inthe number of admitted queries. By exploiting overlap between queries and reusing partialresults; a query planner can conserve resources but has to carry out more complex planningdecisions. In this paper; we describe SQPR; a query planner that targets DSPSs in datacentre environments with heterogeneous resources. SQPR models query admission;allocation and reuse as a single constrained optimisation problem and solves anapproximate version to achieve scalability.

Balancing load in stream processing with the cloud,Wilhelm Kleiminger; Evangelia Kalyvianaki; Peter Pietzuch,Stream processing systems must handle stream data coming from real-time; high-throughputapplications; for example in financial trading. Timely processing of streams is important andrequires sufficient available resources to achieve high throughput and deliver accurateresults. However; static allocation of stream processing resources in terms of machines isinefficient when input streams have significant rate variations-machines remain under-utilised for long periods of average load. We present a combined stream processing systemthat; as the input stream rate varies; adaptively balances workload between a dedicatedlocal stream processor and a cloud stream processor. This approach only utilises cloudmachines when the local stream processor becomes overloaded. We evaluate a prototypesystem with financial trading data.

Enforcing end-to-end application security in the cloud (big ideas paper),Jean Bacon; David Evans; David M Eyers; Matteo Migliavacca; Peter Pietzuch; Brian Shand,Abstract Security engineering must be integrated with all stages of application specificationand development to be effective. Doing this properly is increasingly critical as organisationsrush to offload their software services to cloud providers. Service-level agreements (SLAs)with these providers currently focus on performance-oriented parameters; which runs therisk of exacerbating an impedance mismatch with the security middleware. Not only do wewant cloud providers to isolate each of their clients from others; we also want to have meansto isolate components and users within each client's application.

The aim is to guarantee that---above a small trusted code base---data …,Proceedings of the ACM/IFIP/USENIX 11th International Conference on Middleware,2010,41
Wired Geometric Routing.,Jonathan Ledlie; Michael Mitzenmacher; Margo I Seltzer; Peter R Pietzuch,Abstract Routing substrates for overlay networks are an important building block for largedistributed applications. Many existing substrates are based on a random identifier spaceand therefore do not respect node locality when routing data. This can lead to lowerperformance for locality-sensitive applications; such as web caching; distributed gaming;and resource discovery. This paper examines the problem of building a locality-awarerouting substrate on top of a locality-based coordinate system; where the distance betweencoordinates approximates network latencies. As a starting point; As a starting point we takethe scaled θ-routing proposal for geometric routing in a Euclidean space.

PHP Aspis: using partial taint tracking to protect against injection attacks,Ioannis Papagiannis; Matteo Migliavacca; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Web applications are increasingly popular victims of security attacks. Injectionattacks; such as Cross Site Scripting or SQL Injection; are a persistent problem. Even thoughdevelopers are aware of them; the suggested best practices for protection are error prone:unless all user input is consistently filtered; any application may be vulnerable. Whenhosting web applications; administrators face a dilemma: they can only deploy applicationsthat are trusted or they risk their system's security. To prevent injection vulnerabilities; weintroduce PHP Aspis: a source code transformation tool that applies partial taint tracking atthe language level. PHP Aspis augments values with taint meta-data to track their origin inorder to detect injection vulnerabilities. To improve performance; PHP Aspis carries out taintpropagation only in an application's most vulnerable parts: thirdparty plugins.

Resource allocation across multiple cloud data centres,Barnaby Malet; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Web applications with rich AJAX-driven user interfaces make asynchronous server-side calls to switch application state. To provide the best user experience; the response timeof these calls must be as low as possible. Since response time is bounded by network delay;it can be minimised by placing application components closest to the network location of themajority of anticipated users. However; with a limited budget for hosting applications;developers need to select data centre locations strategically. In practice; the best choice isdifficult to achieve manually due to dynamic client workloads and effects such as flashcrowds. In this paper; we propose a cloud management middleware that automaticallyadjusts the placement of web application components across multiple cloud data centres.Based on observations and predictions of client request rates; it migrates application …,Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Middleware for Grids; Clouds and e-Science,2010,38
AsyncShock: Exploiting synchronisation bugs in Intel SGX enclaves,Nico Weichbrodt; Anil Kurmus; Peter Pietzuch; Rüdiger Kapitza,Abstract Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provide a new hardware-based trustedexecution environment on Intel CPUs using secure enclaves that are resilient to accesses byprivileged code and physical attackers. Originally designed for securing small services; SGXbears promise to protect complex; possibly cloud-hosted; legacy applications. In this paper;we show that previously considered harmless synchronisation bugs can turn into severesecurity vulnerabilities when using SGX. By exploiting use-after-free and time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) bugs in enclave code; an attacker can hijack its control flow orbypass access control.

Third-party coordination services such as ZooKeeperand Consul are fundamental building blocks for cloud applications; but are exposed topotentially sensitive application data. Recently; hardware trust mechanisms such as Intel'sSoftware Guard Extensions (SGX) offer trusted execution environments to shield applicationdata from untrusted software; including the privileged Operating System (OS) andhypervisors.

Adaptive Provisioning of Stream Processing Systems in the Cloud,Javier Cervino; Evangelia Kalyvianaki; Joaquın Salvachúa; Peter Pietzuch,With the advent of data-intensive applications that generate large volumes of real-time data;distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) become increasingly important in domainssuch as social networking and web analytics. In practice; DSPSs must handle highlyvariable workloads caused by unpredictable changes in stream rates. Cloud computingoffers an elastic infrastructure that DSPSs can use to obtain resources on-demand; but anopen problem is to decide on the correct resource allocation when deploying DSPSs in thecloud. This paper proposes an adaptive approach for provisioning virtual machines (VMs)for the use of a DSPS in the cloud. We initially perform a set of benchmarks acrossperformance metrics such as network latency and jitter to explore the feasibility of cloud-based DSPS deployments.

Path optimization in stream-based overlay networks,Peter Pietzuch; Jeffrey Shneidman; Matt Welsh; Margo Seltzer; Mema Roussopoulos,Abstract The emergence of sensor networks and distributed applications that generate datastreams has created a need for Internet overlays designed for streaming data. Such stream-based overlay network (SBONs) consist of a set of Internet hosts that collect; process; anddeliver stream-based data to multiple applications. A key challenge in the design andimplementation of SBONs is efficient path optimization when mapping logical query streamsto physical network hosts and paths. Suboptimal placements can induce poor utilization ofnetwork resources; leading to severe performance penalties; link saturation; and networkhotspots. Our goal is to realize efficient stream placement that takes the physical topology ofthe Internet into account; thereby minimizing overall network utilization.

Making State Explicit for Imperative Big Data Processing.,Raul Castro Fernandez; Matteo Migliavacca; Evangelia Kalyvianaki; Peter R Pietzuch,Abstract Data scientists often implement machine learning algorithms in imperativelanguages such as Java; Matlab and R. Yet such implementations fail to achieve theperformance and scalability of specialised data-parallel processing frameworks. Our goal isto execute imperative Java programs in a data-parallel fashion with high throughput and lowlatency. This raises two challenges: how to support the arbitrary mutable state of Javaprograms without compromising scalability; and how to recover that state after failure withlow overhead. Our idea is to infer the dataflow and the types of state accesses from a Javaprogram and use this information to generate a stateful dataflow graph (SDG). By explicitlyseparating data from mutable state; SDGs have specific features to enable this translation: toensure scalability; distributed state can be partitioned across nodes if computation can …,USENIX Annual Technical Conference,2014,28
A cost-space approach to distributed query optimization in stream based overlays,Jeffrey Shneidman; Peter Pietzuch; Matt Welsh; Margo Seltzer; Mema Roussopoulos,Distributed stream-based applications; such as continuous query systems; have networkscale and time characteristics that challenge traditional distributed query optimization. Theoptimization sub-problems of plan generation and service placement should be integrated tomeet these challenges. These tasks have typically been treated as independent sub-problems because of the complexity of their integration. We suggest cost spaces as one wayto mitigate this complexity. We further consider how cost spaces can be used to allowtractable multi-query optimization.,Data Engineering Workshops; 2005. 21st International Conference on,2005,28

SafeWeb: A Middleware for Securing Ruby-Based Web Applications,Petr Hosek; Matteo Migliavacca; Ioannis Papagiannis; David Eyers; David Evans; Brian Shand; Jean Bacon; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Web applications in many domains such as healthcare and finance must processsensitive data; while complying with legal policies regarding the release of different classesof data to different parties. Currently; software bugs may lead to irreversible disclosure ofconfidential data in multi-tier web applications. An open challenge is how developers canguarantee these web applications only ever release sensitive data to authorised userswithout costly; recurring security audits. Our solution is to provide a trusted middleware thatacts as a" safety net" to event-based enterprise web applications by preventing harmful datadisclosure before it happens.

Netagg: Using middleboxes for application-specific on-path aggregation in data centres,Luo Mai; Lukas Rupprecht; Abdul Alim; Paolo Costa; Matteo Migliavacca; Peter Pietzuch; Alexander L Wolf,Abstract Data centre applications for batch processing (eg map/reduce frameworks) andonline services (eg search engines) scale by distributing data and computation across manyservers. They typically follow a partition/aggregation pattern: tasks are first partitioned acrossservers that process data locally; and then those partial results are aggregated. This dataaggregation step; however; shifts the performance bottleneck to the network; which typicallystruggles to support many-to-few; high-bandwidth traffic between servers. Instead ofperforming data aggregation at edge servers; we show that it can be done more efficientlyalong network paths.

This is particularly significant yet challenging in a cloudenvironment; in which a large set of different workloads multiplex on a shared;heterogeneous infrastructure.

Distributed content delivery using load-aware network coordinates,Nicholas Ball; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract To scale to millions of Internet users with good performance; content deliverynetworks (CDNs) must balance requests between content servers while assigning clients tonearby servers. In this paper; we describe a new CDN design that associates synthetic load-aware coordinates with clients and content servers and uses them to direct content requeststo cached content. This approach helps achieve good performance when request workloadsand resource availability in the CDN are dynamic. A deployment and evaluation of oursystem on PlanetLab demonstrates how it achieves low request times with high cache hitratios when compared to other CDN approaches.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM CoNEXT Conference,2008,21
Event-based middleware: A new paradigm for wide-area distributed systems,Peter R Pietzuch,Abstract: Large-scale; internet-wide applications are becoming commonplace. Such systemscan consist of many heterogeneous components distributed over several continents.Whereas middleware platforms like CORBA or Java RMI are useful for building distributedapplications at a small to moderate scale; we do not have similar tools for large-scalesystems. However; without a middleware abstraction it is difficult to deal with the complexityof global systems.,6th CaberNet Radicals Workshop,2002,21
Cloudfilter: practical control of sensitive data propagation to the cloud,Ioannis Papagiannis; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract A major obstacle for the adoption of cloud services in enterprises is the potentialloss of control over sensitive data. Companies often have to safeguard a subset of their databecause it is crucial to their business or they are required to do so by law. In contrast; cloudservice providers handle enterprise data without providing guarantees and may putconfidentiality at risk. In order to maintain control over their sensitive data; companiestypically block all access to a wide range of cloud services at the network level. Suchrestrictions significantly reduce employee productivity while offering limited practicalprotection in the presence of malicious employees. In this paper; we suggest a practicalmechanism to ensure that an enterprise maintains control of its sensitive data whileemployees are allowed to use cloud services. We observe that most cloud services use …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Workshop on Cloud computing security workshop,2012,20
Living in the present: on-the-fly information processing in scalable web architectures,David Eyers; Tobias Freudenreich; Alessandro Margara; Sebastian Frischbier; Peter Pietzuch; Patrick Eugster,Abstract Today's social web platforms; such as Facebook; Twitter; Google+; and LinkedIn;increasingly have to process large volumes of user-generated data on the fly. As the role ofsuch platforms shifts from being portals for largely historic data towards providing platformsfor real-time data analytics; we observe that their architectures incrementally move fromstorage-centric designs; based on distributed data management technologies; towardsevent-based models exploiting queueing and stream processing systems. We believe that itis time to rethink fundamentally the software architecture for social web platforms and basethem on a content-based communication model; that is explicitly designed to disseminateand partition incoming request flows on a cluster of servers. A content-basedpublish/subscribe system thus acts as a scalable and elastic; highly responsive data …,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on cloud computing platforms,2012,20
Distributed middleware enforcement of event flow security policy,Matteo Migliavacca; Ioannis Papagiannis; David M Eyers; Brian Shand; Jean Bacon; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Distributed; event-driven applications that process sensitive user data and involvemultiple organisational domains must comply with complex security requirements. Ideally;developers want to express security policy for such applications in data-centric terms;controlling the flow of information throughout the system. Current middleware does notsupport the specification of such end-to-end security policy and lacks uniform mechanismsfor enforcement. We describe DEFCon-Policy; a middleware that enforces security policy inmulti-domain; event-driven applications. Event flow policy is expressed in a high-levellanguage that specifies permitted flows between distributed software components. Themiddleware limits the interaction of components based on the policy and the data thatcomponents have observed. It achieves this by labelling data and assigning privileges to …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2010,19
Saber: Window-based hybrid stream processing for heterogeneous architectures,Alexandros Koliousis; Matthias Weidlich; Raul Castro Fernandez; Alexander L Wolf; Paolo Costa; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Modern servers have become heterogeneous; often combining multi-core CPUswith many-core GPGPUs. Such heterogeneous architectures have the potential to improvethe performance of data-intensive stream processing applications; but they are notsupported by current relational stream processing engines. For an engine to exploit aheterogeneous architecture; it must execute streaming SQL queries with sufficient data-parallelism to fully utilise all available heterogeneous processors; and decide how to useeach in the most effective way. It must do this while respecting the semantics of streamingSQL queries; in particular with regard to window handling. We describe Saber; a hybrid high-performance relational stream processing engine for CPUs and GPGPUs. Saber executeswindow-based streaming SQL queries in a data-parallel fashion using all available CPU …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,18
Cloudsafetynet: Detecting data leakage between cloud tenants,Christian Priebe; Divya Muthukumaran; Dan O'Keeffe; David Eyers; Brian Shand; Ruediger Kapitza; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract When tenants deploy applications under the control of third-party cloud providers;they must trust the provider's security mechanisms for inter-tenant isolation; resource sharingand access control. Despite a provider's best efforts; accidental data leakage may occur dueto misconfigurations or bugs in the cloud platform. Especially in Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS) clouds; which rely on weaker forms of isolation; the potential for unnoticed dataleakage is high. Prior work to raise tenants' trust in clouds relies on attestation; which limitsthe management flexibility of providers; or fine-grained data tracking; which has highoverheads. We describe CloudSafetyNet (CSN); a lightweight monitoring framework thatgives tenants visibility into the propagation of their application data in a cloud environmentwith low performance overhead. It exploits the incentive of tenants to co-operate with …,Proceedings of the 6th edition of the ACM Workshop on Cloud Computing Security,2014,18
Multiplicity computing: a vision of software engineering for next-generation computing platform applications,Cristian Cadar; Peter Pietzuch; Alexander L Wolf,Abstract New technologies have recently emerged to challenge the very nature ofcomputing: multicore processors; virtualized operating systems and networks; and data-center clouds. One can view these technologies as forming levels within a new; globalcomputing platform. We aim to open a new area of research; called multiplicity computing;that takes a radically different approach to the engineering of applications for this platform.Unlike other efforts; which are largely focused on innovations within specific levels;multiplicity computing embraces the platform as a virtually unlimited space of essentiallyredundant resources. This space is formed as a whole from the cross product of resourcesavailable at each level in the platform; offering a" multiplicity" of end-to-end resources.

Evaluating DHT-based service placement for stream-based overlays,Peter Pietzuch; Jeffrey Shneidman; Jonathan Ledlie; Matt Welsh; Margo Seltzer; Mema Roussopoulos,Abstract Stream-based overlay networks (SBONs) are one approach to implementing large-scale stream processing systems. A fundamental consideration in an SBON is that of serviceplacement; which determines the physical location of in-network processing services oroperators; in such a way that network resources are used efficiently. Service placementconsists of two components: node discovery; which selects a candidate set of nodes onwhich services might be placed; and node selection; which chooses the particular node tohost a service. By viewing the placement problem as the composition of these two processeswe can trade-off quality and efficiency between them. We evaluate the appropriateness ofusing DHT routing paths for service placement in an SBON; when aiming to minimizenetwork usage. For this; we consider two DHT-based algorithms for node discovery …,International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems,2005,18
Rule-based verification of network protocol implementations using symbolic execution,JaeSeung Song; Tiejun Ma; Cristian Cadar; Peter Pietzuch,The secure and correct implementation of network protocols for resource discovery; deviceconfiguration and network management is complex and error-prone. Protocol specificationscontain ambiguities; leading to implementation flaws and security vulnerabilities in networkdaemons. Such problems are hard to detect because they are often triggered by complexsequences of packets that occur only after prolonged operation. The goal of this work is tofind semantic bugs in network daemons. Our approach is to replay a set of input packets thatresult in high source code coverage of the daemon and observe potential violations of rulesderived from the protocol specification. We describe SYMNV; a practical verification tool thatfirst symbolically executes a network daemon to generate high coverage input packets andthen checks a set of rules constraining permitted input and output packets.

Channel islands in a reflective ocean: Large-scale event distribution in heterogeneous networks,Jon Crowcroft; Jean Bacon; Peter Pietzuch; George Coulouris; Hani Naguib,We discuss the design of a multicast event distribution service intended to support extremelylarge-scale event distribution. To date; event notification services have been limited in theirscope due to limitations of the infrastructure. At the same time; Internet network and transportlayer multicast services have seen limited deployment due to lack of user demand (with theexception of streaming services; eg; on Sprint's US core network and in the Internet II).Research in active networks and reflective middleware suggests a way to resolve these twoproblems at one go. The goal of this article is to describe a reflective middleware system thatintegrates the network; transport; and distributed middleware services into a seamlesswhole. The system integrates this" low-level" technology into an event middleware system;suitable for telemetry; novel mobile network services; and other as yet unforeseen …,IEEE Communications Magazine,2002,17
SYMBEXNET: testing network protocol implementations with symbolic execution and rule-based specifications,JaeSeung Song; Cristian Cadar; Peter Pietzuch,Implementations of network protocols; such as DNS; DHCP and Zeroconf; are prone toflaws; security vulnerabilities and interoperability issues caused by developer mistakes andambiguous requirements in protocol specifications. Detecting such problems is not easybecause (i) many bugs manifest themselves only after prolonged operation;(ii) reasoningabout semantic errors requires a machine-readable specification; and (iii) the state space ofcomplex protocol implementations is large. This article presents a novel approach thatcombines symbolic execution and rule-based specifications to detect various types of flawsin network protocol implementations. The core idea behind our approach is to (1)automatically generate high-coverage test input packets for a network protocolimplementation using single-and multi-packet exchange symbolic execution (targeting …,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2014,16

In this framework; users can utilize the available heterogeneousresources productively and efficiently. The distributed application is highly modularized tosupport dynamic system configuration with changing types and number of the accelerators.Multiple layers of communication interface are introduced to reduce the overhead in bothcontrol messages and data transfers. Parallelism can be achieved by controlling theaccelerators in various schemes through scheduling extension. The framework has beenused to support physics simulation and financial application development.

Cloudscope: Diagnosing and managing performance interference in multi-tenant clouds,Xi Chen; Lukas Rupprecht; Rasha Osman; Peter Pietzuch; Felipe Franciosi; William Knottenbelt,Virtual machine consolidation is attractive in cloud computing platforms for several reasonsincluding reduced infrastructure costs; lower energy consumption and ease of management.However; the interference between co-resident workloads caused by virtualization canviolate the service level objectives (SLOs) that the cloud platform guarantees. Existingsolutions to minimize interference between virtual machines (VMs) are mostly based oncomprehensive micro-benchmarks or online training which makes them computationallyintensive. In this paper; we present CloudScope; a system for diagnosing interference formulti-tenant cloud systems in a lightweight way. CloudScope employs a discrete-timeMarkov Chain model for the online prediction of performance interference of co-residentVMs. It uses the results to optimally (re) assign VMs to physical machines and to optimize …,Modeling; Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS); 2015 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on,2015,15
Scalable stateful stream processing for smart grids,Raul Castro Fernandez; Matthias Weidlich; Peter Pietzuch; Avigdor Gal,Abstract We describe a solution to the ACM DEBS Grand Challenge 2014; which evaluatesevent-based systems for smart grid analytics. Our solution follows the paradigm of statefuldata stream processing and is implemented on top of the SEEP stream processing platform.It achieves high scalability by massive data-parallel processing and the option of performingsemantic load-shedding. In addition; our solution is fault-tolerant; ensuring that the largeprocessing state of stream operators is not lost after failure. Our experimental results showthat our solution processes 1 month worth of data for 40 houses in 4 hours. When we scaleout the system; the time reduces linearly to 30 minutes before the system bottlenecks at thedata source. We then apply semantic load-shedding; maintaining a low median predictionerror and reducing the time further to 17 minutes. The system achieves these results with …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2014,15
ASIA: application-specific integrated aggregation for publish/subscribe middleware,Sebastian Frischbier; Alessandro Margara; Tobias Freudenreich; Patrick Eugster; David Eyers; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract The publish/subscribe (pub/sub) communications paradigm is suitable for buildinglarge-scale; widely distributed applications. Distributed pub/sub middleware scales wellbecause it decouples communicating clients. However; complete decoupling of clients makeit more challenging to design distributed applications using pub/sub middleware: oftenclients want some information about each other. We thus augment the pub/subcommunication model through addition of an integrated aggregation mechanism---ASIA---that facilitates bidirectional exchange of information without compromising scalability. Ourprototype implementation demonstrates that ASIA can be integrated into a typical distributedpub/sub middleware with little effort; and that the aggregation capability adds little overheadin terms of message throughput and latency.,Proceedings of the Posters and Demo Track,2012,14
A routing mechanism based on the sensing relevancies of source nodes for time-critical applications in visual sensor networks,Daniel G Costa; Luiz Affonso Guedes; Francisco Vasques; Paulo Portugal,Wireless sensor networks may be deployed to retrieve visual information from the monitoredfield; enriching monitoring and control applications. Whenever a set of camera-enabledsensor nodes are deployed for time-critical monitoring; visual information as still images andvideo streams may need to reach the sink as soon as possible; requiring a differentiatedtreating of the network when compared with non-critical visual data. In such way;considering that source nodes may have different sensing relevancies for the application;according to the desired monitoring tasks and the current sensors' poses and fields of view;we propose a delay-aware multihop routing mechanism where higher relevant visual datapackets are routed through paths with lower end-to-end delay. As sensor nodes areexpected to be energy-constrained; transmitting only high-relevant packets through …,Wireless Days (WD); 2012 IFIP,2012,14
Exploring algorithmic trading in reconfigurable hardware,Stephen Wray; Wayne Luk; Peter Pietzuch,This paper describes an algorithmic trading engine based on reconfigurable hardware;derived from a software implementation. Our approach exploits parallelism andreconfigurability of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. FPGAs offer manybenefits over software solutions; including a reduction in latency; while increasing overallthroughput and computational density. All of which are important attributes to a successfulalgorithmic trading engine. Experiments show that the peak performance of our hardwarearchitecture for algorithmic trading is 133 times faster than the corresponding softwareimplementation. Six implementations can operate simultaneously on a Xilinx Vertex 5xc5vlx30 FPGA on average; maximising performance and available resource usage.,Application-specific Systems Architectures and Processors (ASAP); 2010 21st IEEE International Conference on,2010,14
Enforcing user privacy in web applications using Erlang,Ioannis Papagiannis; Matteo Migliavacca; David M Eyers; Brian Shand; Jean Bacon; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract—Social networking applications on the web handle the personal data of a largenumber of concurrently active users. These applications must comply with complex privacyrequirements; while achieving scalability and high performance. Applying constraints to theflow of data through such applications to enforce privacy policy is challenging becauseindividual components process data belonging to many different users. We introduce apractical approach for uniformly enforcing privacy requirements in such applications usingthe actor-based Erlang programming language. To isolate the personal data of users; weexploit Erlang's inexpensive process model and use Erlang's message passing mechanismto add policy checks. We illustrate this approach by describing the architecture of a privacy-preserving message dispatcher in a micro-blogging service. Our performance evaluation …,*,2010,14
Scalable XML query processing using parallel pushdown transducers,Peter Ogden; David Thomas; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract In online social networking; network monitoring and financial applications; there is aneed to query high rate streams of XML data; but methods for executing individual XPathqueries on streaming XML data have not kept pace with multicore CPUs. For data-parallelprocessing; a single XML stream is typically split into well-formed fragments; which are thenprocessed independently. Such an approach; however; introduces a sequential bottleneckand suffers from low cache locality; limiting its scalability across CPU cores. We describe adata-parallel approach for the processing of streaming XPath queries based on pushdowntransducers. Our approach permits XML data to be split into arbitrarilysized chunks; witheach chunk processed by a parallel automaton instance. Since chunks may be malformed;our automata consider all possible starting states for XML elements and build mappings …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,13
Distributed event-based systems: An emerging community,Peter Pietzuch; Gero Muhl; Ludger Fiege,Events and messaging have been in use in industry for years. With the advent of service-oriented and event-driven architectures; however; the eventing paradigm becomes a centralbuilding block of business IT. Event-based techniques have established themselves as anefficient way to structure such systems and handle challenging interaction patterns betweencomponents. Event-driven design offers the flexibility to address these issues and reflectsthe real world's event-driven nature,IEEE Distributed Systems Online,2007,13
FlowWatcher: Defending against data disclosure vulnerabilities in web applications,Divya Muthukumaran; Dan O'Keeffe; Christian Priebe; David Eyers; Brian Shand; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Bugs in the authorisation logic of web applications can expose the data of one userto another. Such data disclosure vulnerabilities are common---they can be caused by asingle omitted access control check in the application. We make the observation that; whilethe implementation of the authorisation logic is complex and therefore error-prone; most webapplications only use simple access control models; in which each piece of data isaccessible by a user or a group of users. This makes it possible to validate the correctoperation of the authorisation logic externally; based on the observed data in HTTP traffic toand from an application. We describe FlowWatcher; an HTTP proxy that mitigates datadisclosure vulnerabilities in unmodified web applications. FlowWatcher monitors HTTP trafficand shadows part of an application's access control state based on a rule-based …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2015,11
Outsourcing multi-version key-value stores with verifiable data freshness,Yuzhe Tang; Ting Wang; Xin Hu; Reiner Sailer; Ling Liu; Peter Pietzuch,In the age of big data; key-value data updated by intensive write streams is increasinglycommon; eg; in social event streams. To serve such data in a cost-effective manner; apopular new paradigm is to outsource it to the cloud and store it in a scalable key-valuestore while serving a large user base. Due to the limited trust in third-party cloudinfrastructures; data owners have to sign the data stream so that the data users can verify theauthenticity of query results from the cloud. In this paper; we address the problem ofverifiable freshness for multi-version key-value data. We propose a memory-resident digeststructure that utilizes limited memory effectively and can have efficient verificationperformance. The proposed structure is named IncBM-Tree because it can INCrementallybuild a Bloom filter-embedded Merkle Tree.

Chams: Churn-aware overlay construction for media streaming,Mouna Allani; Benoît Garbinato; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Overlay networks support a wide range of peer-to-peer media streamingapplications on the Internet. The user experience of such applications is affected by thechurn resilience of the system. When peers disconnect from the system; streamed data maybe delayed or lost due to missing links in the overlay topology. In this paper; we explore aproactive strategy to create churn-aware overlay networks that reduce the potential ofdisruptions caused by churn events. We describe C hams; a middleware for constructingoverlay networks that mitigates the impact of churn. Chams uses a “hybrid” approach—itimplicitly defines an overlay topology using a gossip-style mechanism; while taking thereliability of peers into account. Unlike systems for overlay construction; C hams supports avariety of topologies used in media streaming systems; such as trees; multi-trees and …,Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications,2012,11
On the feasibility of bandwidth detouring,Thom Haddow; Sing Wang Ho; Jonathan Ledlie; Cristian Lumezanu; Moez Draief; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Internet applications that route data over default Internet paths can often increaseperformance by sending their traffic over alternative “detour” paths. Previous work hasshown that applications can use detour routing to improve end-to-end metrics such aslatency and path availability. However; the potential of detour routing has yet to be appliedwhere it may be most important: improving TCP throughput. In this paper; we study thefeasibility of bandwidth detouring on the Internet. We find that bandwidth detours areprevalent: between 152 Planetlab nodes; 74.8% of the paths can benefit from detours with atleast 1 Mbps and 20% improvement. To understand how to exploit bandwidth detours inpractice; we explore the trade-offs between network-and transport-level mechanisms fordetouring. We show; both analytically and experimentally; that direct; TCP-based detour …,International Conference on Passive and Active Network Measurement,2011,11
Deconstructing internet paths: an approach for AS-level detour route discovery.,Sing Wang Ho; Thom Haddow; Jonathan Ledlie; Moez Draief; Peter R Pietzuch,Abstract Detour paths provide overlay networks with improved performance and resilience.Finding good detour routes with methods that scale to millions of nodes is a challengingproblem. We propose a novel approach for decentralised discovery of detour paths basedon the observation that Internet paths that traverse overlapping sets of autonomous systemsmay benefit from the same detour nodes. We show how nodes can learn about overlapbetween Internet paths at the level of autonomous systems and demonstrate how they canexploit detours that other nodes have already found. Our approach is to cluster paths basedon the extent to which the autonomous systems traversed overlap and gossip potentialdetours among nodes. We find that our centralised path clustering algorithm correctlyclassified over $90\% $ of potential latency detours in a $176 $-node dataset drawn from …,IPTPS,2009,11
Teechan: Payment channels using trusted execution environments,Joshua Lind; Ittay Eyal; Peter Pietzuch; Emin Gün Sirer,Abstract: Blockchain protocols are inherently limited in transaction throughput and latency.Recent efforts to address these performance metrics and scale blockchains have focused onoff-chain payment channels. While such channels can achieve low latency and highthroughput; deploying them securely on top of the Bitcoin blockchain has been difficult;partly because building a secure and robust implementation requires changes to theunderlying protocol as well as the overall ecosystem. We present Teechan; a full-duplexpayment channel framework that exploits trusted execution environments. Teechan can bedeployed securely on the existing Bitcoin blockchain without having to modify the protocol.Teechan:(i) achieves a higher transaction throughput and lower transaction latency thanprior solutions;(ii) enables unlimited full-duplex payments as long as the balance does …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.07766,2016,9
Aggregation for implicit invocations,Sebastian Frischbier; Alessandro Margara; Tobias Freudenreich; Patrick Eugster; David Eyers; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Implicit invocations are a popular mechanism for exchanging information betweensoftware components without binding these strongly. This decoupling is particularlyimportant in distributed systems when interacting components are not known until runtime. Inmost realistic distributed systems though; components require some information about eachother; be it only about their presence or their number. Runtime systems for implicitinvocations--so-called publish/subscribe systems--are thus often combined with othersystems providing such information. Given the variety of requirements for information aboutinteracting components across applications; this paper proposes a generic augmentation ofimplicit invocations: rather than extending a given publish/subscribe API and system in orderto convey a particular type of information across interacting components; we describe …,Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Aspect-oriented software development,2013,9
Overload management in data stream processing systems with latency guarantees,Evangelia Kalyvianaki; Themistoklis Charalambous; Marco Fiscato; Peter Pietzuch,ABSTRACT Stream processing systems are becoming increasingly important to analyse real-time data generated by modern applications such as online social networks. Their maincharacteristic is to produce a continuous stream of fresh results as new data are beinggenerated at real-time. Resource provisioning of stream processing systems is difficult dueto time-varying workload data that induce unknown resource demands over time. Despitethe development of scalable stream processing systems; which aim to provision for workloadvariations; there still exist cases where such systems face transient resource shortages.During overload; there is a lack of resources to process all incoming data in real-time; dataaccumulate in memory and their processing latency grows uncontrollably compromising thefreshness of stream processing results.

Towards automated verification of autonomous networks: A case study in self-configuration,JaeSeung Song; Tiejun Ma; Peter Pietzuch,In autonomic networks; the self-configuration of network entities is one of the most desirableproperties. In this paper; we show how formal verification techniques can verify thecorrectness of self-configuration. As a case study; we describe the configuration of physicalcell identifiers (PCIs); a radio configuration parameter in cellular base stations. We provideformal models of PCI assignment algorithms and their desired properties. We thendemonstrate how the potential for conflicting PCI assignments can be detected using modelchecking and resolved in the design stage. Through this case study; we argue that bothsimulation and verification should be adopted and highlight the potential of runtimeverification approaches in this space.,Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops); 2010 8th IEEE International Conference on,2010,9

While prior work has shown that legacyapplications can run in their entirety inside enclaves; this results in a large trusted computingbase (TCB). Instead; we explore an approach in which we partition an application and usean enclave to protect only security-sensitive data and functions; thus obtaining a smallerTCB. We describe Glamdring; the first source-level partitioning framework that securesapplications written in C using Intel SGX. A developer first annotates securitysensitiveapplication data. Glamdring then automatically partitions the application into untrusted andenclave parts:(i) to preserve data confidentiality; Glamdring uses dataflow analysis to identifyfunctions that may be exposed to sensitive data;(ii) for data integrity; it uses backward …,2017 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC 17); Santa Clara; CA,2017,8
Themis: Fairness in federated stream processing under overload,Evangelia Kalyvianaki; Marco Fiscato; Theodoros Salonidis; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Federated stream processing systems; which utilise nodes from multipleindependent domains; can be found increasingly in multi-provider cloud deployments;internet-of-things systems; collaborative sensing applications and large-scale grid systems.To pool resources from several sites and take advantage of local processing; submittedqueries are split into query fragments; which are executed collaboratively by different sites.When supporting many concurrent users; however; queries may exhaust availableprocessing resources; thus requiring constant load shedding.

The event-based paradigm; if used for event transport; provides loose coupling between components;many-to-many communication and mutual anonymity of event producers and eventconsumers. This communication style has been adopted enthusiastically for convenience ofprogramming; particularly for financial processing; healthcare applications and sensor-based systems. But some data is sensitive; and its visibility must be controlled carefully forpersonal and legal reasons.

Proxy network coordinates,Jonathan Ledlie; Margo Seltzer; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Network coordinates can be used in large-scale overlay applications to reduce thecost of latency estimation. Previous proposals assumed that all nodes for which latencieswere to be estimated actively participated in measurement and computation of networkcoordinates. In this paper; we introduce proxy network coordinates; a method that enablesan overlay network to calculate network coordinates for external nodes without their directinvolvement. We describe an algorithm for maintaining proxy network coordinates and showthat their accuracy and stability properties are comparable to directlymaintained networkcoordinates.,Target,2008,8
Configuring large‐scale storage using a middleware with machine learning,David M Eyers; Ramani Routray; Rui Zhang; Douglas Willcocks; Peter Pietzuch,SUMMARY The proliferation of cloud services and other forms of service-oriented computingcontinues to accelerate. Alongside this development is an ever-increasing need for storagewithin the data centres that host these services. Management applications used by cloudproviders to configure their infrastructure should ideally operate in terms of high-level policygoals; and not burden administrators with the details presented by particular instances ofstorage systems. One common technology used by cloud providers is the Storage AreaNetwork (SAN). Support for seamless scalability is engineered into SAN devices. However;SAN infrastructure has a very large parameter space: their optimal deployment is a difficultchallenge; and subsequent management in cloud storage continues to be difficult.,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2011,7

Security policy and information sharing in distributed event-based systems,Brian Shand; Peter Pietzuch; Ioannis Papagiannis; Ken Moody; Matteo Migliavacca; David M Eyers; Jean Bacon,Abstract Linking security policy into event-based systems allows formal reasoning aboutinformation security. In the applications we address; highly confidential data must be sharedboth dynamically and for historical analysis. Principals with rights to access the data may bewidely distributed; existing in a federation of independent administrative domains. Domainmanagers are responsible for the data held within domains and transmitted from them;security policy must be specified and enforced in order to meet these obligations. Wemotivate the event-driven paradigm and take healthcare as a running example; because theconfidentiality of healthcare data must be guaranteed over many years.

Run-time reconfiguration for a reconfigurable algorithmic trading engine,Stephen Wray; Wayne Luk; Peter Pietzuch,In this paper we present an analysis of using run-time reconfiguration of reconfigurablehardware to modify trading algorithms during use. This provides flexibility in algorithmdesign; enabling the implementation to be reactive to changes in market conditions;increasing in performance. We study what can be achieved to reduce performance loss inalgorithms while reconfiguration takes place; such as buffering information during this time.Our results show our average partial reconfiguration time is 0.002091 seconds; usinghistoric highest market data rates would result in about 5;000 messages being missed orrequire buffering. This is the worst case scenario; normally the system would only require afraction of messages.

Big ideas paper: enforcing end-to-end application security in the cloud,Jean Bacon; David Evans; David M Eyers; Matteo Migliavacca; Peter Pietzuch; Brian Sh,Abstract. Security engineering must be integrated with all stages of application specificationand development to be effective. Doing this properly is increasingly critical as organisationsrush to offload their software services to cloud providers. Service-level agreements (SLAs)with these providers currently focus on performance-oriented parameters; which runs therisk of exacerbating an impedance mismatch with the security middleware. Not only do wewant cloud providers to isolate each of their clients from others; we also want to have meansto isolate components and users within each client's application. We propose a principledapproach to designing and deploying end-to-end secure; distributed software by means ofthorough; relentless tagging of the security meaning of data; analogous to what is alreadydone for data types. The aim is to guarantee that—above a small trusted code base—data …,*,2010,6
Towards a middleware for configuring large-scale storage infrastructures,David M Eyers; Ramani Routray; Rui Zhang; Douglas Willcocks; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract The rapid proliferation of cloud and service-oriented computing infrastructure iscreating an ever increasing thirst for storage within data centers. Ideally managementapplications in cloud deployments should operate in terms of high-level goals; and notpresent specific implementation details to administrators. Cloud providers often employStorage Area Networks (SANs) to gain storage scalability. SAN configurations have a vastparameter space; which makes them one of the most difficult components to configure andmanage in a cloud storage offering. As a step towards a general cloud storage configurationplatform; this paper introduces a SAN configuration middleware that aids managementapplications in their task of updating and troubleshooting heterogeneous SAN deployments.The middleware acts as a proxy between management applications and a central …,Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Middleware for Grids; Clouds and e-Science,2009,6
Privateflow: decentralised information flow control in event based middleware,Ioannis Papagiannis; Matteo Migliavacca; P Pietzuch; Brian Shand; D Eyers; Jean Bacon,Abstract Complex middleware frameworks are made out of interacting components whichmay include bugs. These frameworks are often extended to provide additional features bythird-party extensions that may not be completely trusted and; as a result; compromise thesecurity of the whole platform. Aiming to minimize these problems; we propose ademonstration of PrivateFlow; a publish/subscribe prototype supported by DecentralizedInformation Flow Control (DIFC). DIFC is a taint-tracking mechanism that can preventcomponents from leaking information. We will showcase a simple deployment of PrivateFlowthat incorporates third-party untrusted components. In our demonstration; one of thesecomponents will try to leak sensitive information about the system's operation and it will failonce DIFC is activated.,Proceedings of the Third ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2009,6
Challenges in dependable Internet-scale stream processing,Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Today we lack an infrastructure for globally processing stream data from sensornetworks and making this data available to millions of users in real-time. To build such asystem; we need to address a set of challenges and; in particular; rethink what dependabilitymeans in this context: it is infeasible to guarantee perfect data processing at a global scale.Instead; the degradation of result quality due to failure and resource shortages should bemade explicit to users. We briefly describe one such model to achieve a dependable Internet-scale stream processing service.,Proceedings of the 2nd workshop on Dependable distributed data management,2008,6
A Framework for Object-Based Event Composition in Distributed Systems,Peter R Pietzuch; Brian Shand,Large-scale distributed systems benefit from new scalable communication mechanisms. Inevent-based publish/subscribe communication; components are either event sources thatpublish new events or event sinks that subscribe to events. Events can be seen asnotifications that something of interest has happened in the system. Composite eventsrepresent complex patterns of activity from distributed sources. Using mobile detectionobjects; we aim to distribute the detection of composite events too; increasing scalability;together with a novel composite event language; this improves the efficiency of detectionand the reuse of computations in publishsubscribe systems; and also provides a naturalobjectbased representation for composite events. Consider a distributed computer systemsuch as a stock exchange information service; in which users can be notified of changes …,12th International Network for PhD Students in Object Oriented Systems (PhDOOS’02) Workshop.

Effective runtime monitoring of distributed event-based enterprise systems with ASIA,Sebastian Frischbier; Erman Turan; Michael Gesmann; Alessandro Margara; David Eyers; Patrick Eugster; Peter Pietzuch; Alejandro Buchmann,Cyber Physical Systems (CPS); interconnected smart devices in the Internet of Things (IoT)and other data sources are increasingly bridging the gap between the physical and digitalworld by providing fine-grained data about real-world events. Enterprise software systemsare adopting the paradigm of event-based systems (EBS) to enable them to react tomeaningful events in a timely manner. Smart supply chains fusing dynamic sensor data withinformation provided by backend-systems are one such example of event-based enterprisesystems.

Policy generation framework for large-scale storage infrastructures,Ramani Routray; Rui Zhang; David Eyers; Douglas Willcocks; Peter Pietzuch; Prasenjit Sarkar,Cloud computing is gaining acceptance among mainstream technology users. Storagecloud providers often employ Storage Area Networks (SANs) to provide elasticity; rapidadaptability to changing demands; and policy based automation. As storage capacity grows;the storage environment becomes heterogeneous; increasingly complex; harder to manage;and more expensive to operate. This paper presents PGML (Policy Generation forlargescale storage infrastructure configuration using Machine Learning); an automated;supervised machine learning framework for generation of best practices for SANconfiguration that can potentially reduce configuration errors by up to 70% in a data center.A best practice or policy is nothing but a technique; guideline or methodology that; throughexperience and research; has proven to lead reliably to a better storage configuration …,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks (POLICY); 2010 IEEE International Symposium on,2010,5
TrustJS: Trusted Client-side Execution of JavaScript,David Goltzsche; Colin Wulf; Divya Muthukumaran; Konrad Rieck; Peter Pietzuch; Rüdiger Kapitza,Abstract Client-side JavaScript has become ubiquitous in web applications to improve userexperience and reduce server load. However; since clients are untrusted; servers cannotrely on the confidentiality or integrity of client-side JavaScript code and the data that itoperates on. For example; client-side input validation must be repeated at server side; andconfidential business logic cannot be offloaded. In this paper; we present TrustJS; aframework that enables trustworthy execution of security-sensitive JavaScript insidecommodity browsers. TrustJS leverages trusted hardware support provided by Intel SGX toprotect the client-side execution of JavaScript; enabling a flexible partitioning of webapplication code.

Ako: Decentralised deep learning with partial gradient exchange,Pijika Watcharapichat; Victoria Lopez Morales; Raul Castro Fernandez; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Distributed systems for the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) with largeamounts of data have vastly improved the accuracy of machine learning models for imageand speech recognition. DNN systems scale to large cluster deployments by having workernodes train many model replicas in parallel; to ensure model convergence; parameterservers periodically synchronise the replicas. This raises the challenge of how to splitresources between workers and parameter servers so that the cluster CPU and networkresources are fully utilised without introducing bottlenecks. In practice; this requires manualtuning for each model configuration or hardware type. We describe Ako; a decentraliseddataflow-based DNN system without parameter servers that is designed to saturate clusterresources.

Flick: Developing and running application-specific network services,Abdul Alim; Richard G Clegg,Abstract Data centre networks are increasingly programmable; with application-specificnetwork services proliferating; from custom load-balancers to middleboxes providingcaching and aggregation. Developers must currently implement these services usingtraditional low-level APIs; which neither support natural operations on application data norprovide efficient performance isolation. We describe FLICK; a framework for theprogramming and execution of application-specific network services on multi-core CPUs.Developers write network services in the FLICK language; which offers high-levelprocessing constructs and application-relevant data types.

Managing expectations: Runtime negotiation of information quality requirements in event-based systems,Sebastian Frischbier; Peter Pietzuch; Alejandro Buchmann,Abstract Interconnected smart devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) provide fine-granulardata about real-world events; leveraged by service-based systems using the paradigm ofevent-based systems (EBS) for invocation. Depending on the capabilities and state of thesystem; the information propagated in EBS differs in content but also in properties likeprecision; rate and freshness. At runtime; consumers have different dynamic requirementsabout those properties that constitute quality of information (QoI) for them. Currentapproaches to support quality-related requirements in EBS are either domain-specific orlimited in terms of expressiveness; flexibility and scope as they do not allow participants toadapt their behavior. We introduce the generic concept of expectations to express; negotiateand enforce arbitrary requirements about information quality in EBS at runtime.

Mccat: Multi-cloud cost-aware transport,Sebastian Frischbier; Alessandro Margara; T Freundenreich; Patrick Eugster; David Eyers; Peter Pietzuch,Motivation and idea. Distributed applications in use today; such as monitoring systems (egGanglia); data-parallel processing frameworks (eg Hadoop) and replicated databases (egMySQL); were originally developed for use in clusters. Cluster applications often assumethat the network is well-provisioned and its usage is effectively free; as long as it remainswithin capacity bounds. As cluster applications are deployed in cloud environments; or evenacross multiple data centre sites; these assumptions no longer hold: cloud tenants wouldlike to control the network usage of distributed cluster applications; eg to minimise theircosts. Our observation is that the network usage of many cluster applications can bereduced in a controlled fashion. For example; in a multi-site Ganglia deployment; it ispossible to reduce network traffic between sites by aggregating multiple updates of …,EuroSys Poster Track,2014,4
Supporting application-specific in-network processing in data centres,Luo Mai; Lukas Rupprecht; Paolo Costa; Matteo Migliavacca; Peter Pietzuch; Alexander L Wolf,Modern data centers (DCs) host a range of distributed applications that process large datasets; such as Google MapReduce and Microsoft Scope; or respond to user requests foronline services; such as search engines [1]; distributed data stores [13]; and interactivequery systems [12]. These DC applications manage to handle large amounts of data andhigh numbers of concurrent requests through" scale out"–computation is executed in aparallel fashion by distributing data across a large number of machines. Typically; suchapplications operate on data following a partition-aggregate paradigm: In the partitionphase; a master node partitions a job or user request into sub-tasks; which are scheduled todifferent worker nodes for concurrent execution.

Scalable and Fault-tolerant Stateful Stream Processing,Raul Castro Fernandez; Matteo Migliavacca; Evangelia Kalyvianaki; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract As users of" big data" applications expect fresh results; we witness a new breed ofstream processing systems (SPS) that are designed to scale to large numbers of cloud-hosted machines. Such systems face new challenges:(i) to benefit from the" pay-as-you-go"model of cloud computing; they must scale out on demand; acquiring additional virtualmachines (VMs) and parallelising operators when the workload increases;(ii) failures arecommon with deployments on hundreds of VMs—systems must be fault-tolerant with fastrecovery times; yet low per-machine overheads. An open question is how to achieve thesetwo goals when stream queries include stateful operators; which must be scaled out andrecovered without affecting query results. Our key idea is to expose internal operator stateexplicitly to the SPS through a set of state management primitives. Based on them; we …,OASIcs-OpenAccess Series in Informatics,2013,4
Femtocell coverage optimisation using statistical verification,Tiejun Ma; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Femtocells are small base stations that provide radio coverage for mobile devicesin homes or office areas. In this paper; we consider the optimisation of a number offemtocells that provide joint coverage in enterprise environments. In such an environment;femtocells should minimise coverage overlap and coverage holes and ensure a balancedtraffic workload among them. We use statistical verification techniques to monitor theprobabilistic correctness of a given femtocell configuration at runtime. If there is any violationof the desired level of service; a self-optimisation procedure is triggered to improve thecurrent configuration. Our evaluation results show that; compared with fixed time; interval-based optimisation; our approach achieves better coverage and can detect goal violationsquickly with a given level of confidence when they occur frequently. It can also avoid …,International Conference on Research in Networking,2011,4

Towards enabling hyper-responsive mobile apps through network edge assistance,Miguel Báguena; George Samaras; Andreas Pamboris; Mihail L Sichitiu; Peter Pietzuch; Pietro Manzoni,Poor Internet performance currently undermines the efficiency of hyper-responsive mobileapps such as augmented reality clients and online games; which require low-latency accessto real-time backend services. While edge-assisted execution; ie moving entire services tothe edge of an access network; helps eliminate part of the communication overheadinvolved; this does not scale to the number of users that share an edge infrastructure. This isdue to a mismatch between the scarce availability of resources in access networks and theaggregate demand for computational power from client applications. Instead; this paperproposes a hybrid edge-assisted deployment model in which only part of a service executeson LTE edge servers. We provide insights about the conditions that must hold for such amodel to be effective by investigating in simulation different deployment and application …,Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC); 2016 13th IEEE Annual,2016,3

A quality-centric data model for distributed stream management systems,Marco Fiscato; Quang Hieu Vu; Peter Pietzuch,ABSTRACT It is challenging for large-scale stream management systems to return alwaysperfect results when processing data streams originating from distributed sources. Datasources and intermediate processing nodes may fail during the lifetime of a stream query. Inaddition; individual nodes may become overloaded due to processing demands. In practice;users have to accept incomplete or inaccurate query results because of failure or overload.In this case; stream processing systems would benefit from knowing the impact of imperfectprocessing on data quality when making decisions about query optimisation and faultrecovery. In addition; users would want to know how much the result quality was degraded.In this paper; we propose a quality-centric relational stream data model that can be usedtogether with existing query processing methods over distributed data streams.

SquirrelJoin: network-aware distributed join processing with lazy partitioning,Lukas Rupprecht; William Culhane; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract To execute distributed joins in parallel on compute clusters; systems partition andexchange data records between workers. With large datasets; workers spend aconsiderable amount of time transferring data over the network. When compute clusters areshared among multiple applications; workers must compete for network bandwidth withother applications. These variances in the available network bandwidth lead to networkskew; which causes straggling workers to prolong the join completion time. We describeSquirrelJoin; a distributed join processing technique that uses lazy partitioning to adapt totransient network skew in clusters. Workers maintain in-memory lazy partitions to withhold asubset of records; ie not sending them immediately to other workers for processing. Lazypartitions are then assigned dynamically to other workers based on network conditions …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,2
Java2SDG: Stateful big data processing for the masses,Raul Castro Fernandez; Panagiotis Garefalakis; Peter Pietzuch,Big data processing is no longer restricted to specially-trained engineers.

Data transfers between mobile client applications and their Internet backendservices contribute significantly to the contention in radio access networks (RANs). Clientapplications; however; typically transfer unnecessary data because (i) backend service APIsdo not support a fine-grained specification of the data actually required by clients and (ii)clients aggressively prefetch data that is never used.

Hyphen: a hybrid protocol for generic overlay construction in P2P environments,Mouna Allani; Benoît Garbinato; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Overlay networks form the core part of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications such asapplication-level multicast; content distribution and media streaming. To ease development;middleware solutions and toolkit libraries have been proposed in the past to help with theimplementation of overlay networks. Existing solutions; however; are either too generic byonly providing low-level communication abstractions; requiring developers to implementalgorithms for overlay networks from scratch; or too restrictive by only supporting a particularoverlay topology with fixed properties.

Recently; the increasing availabilityof machines with large amounts of main memory and improving processor speeds have ledto a surge in the popularity of in-memory OLAP systems; which can process multi-dimensional queries faster than their on-disk counterparts.

Such mechanisms need to be written into theprogram itself. This is done using ad hoc methods and primitive tools when compared toCPU programming. This complicates the programming and debugging of reconfigurablehardware.

It is typical for regular users to violate data disclosure policies accidentally; egwhen sharing text between documents in browser tabs. Our goal is to help such userscomply with data disclosure policies: we want to alert them about potentially unauthoriseddata disclosure from trusted to untrusted cloud services. This is particularly challengingwhen users can modify data in arbitrary ways; they employ multiple cloud services; andcloud services cannot be changed.

Better performance in LTE networks with edge assistance: The world of warcraft case,Miguel Báguena; Andreas Pamboris; Peter Pietzuch; Mihail Sichitiu; Pietro Manzoni,Abstract To improve the performance of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) inmobile networks; we explore the potential benefits of an edge-assisted deployment model:part of the MMOG backend service executes closer to the end user at the edge of the LTEnetwork. We investigate the impact on game latency of (1) the exact placement of such edgeservers;(2) the number of cooperating game clients;(3) the amount of client requests servedat the network edge;(4) the hardware capabilities of edge servers; and (5) user roaming.Based on our analysis; we show that edge assistance can in fact increase the performanceof online games over LTE networks as long as at most 50% of the user requests areprocessed at the network edge. Furthermore; we argue that the Packet Data NetworkGateway (PGW) is the most appropriate place for hosting edge servers and show that …,proceedings of the 12th EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing; Networking and Services on 12th EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing; Networking and Services,2015,1

Securing Event-Based Systems.,Jean Bacon; David M Eyers; Jatinder Singh,ABSTRACT The scalability properties of event-based communication paradigms make themsuitable for building large-scale distributed systems. For effective management at theapplication level; such systems often comprise multiple administrative domains; althoughtheir underlying communication infrastructure can be shared. Examples of such systemsinclude those required by government and public bodies for domains such as healthcare;police; transport and environmental monitoring. We investigate how to build security intothese systems. We outline point-to-point and publish/subscribe event-based communication;and examine security implications in each. Publish/subscribe decouples communicatingentities. This allows for efficient event dissemination; however it makes controlling datavisibility more difficult.

SABER: hybrid data processing with heterogeneous servers,Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Modern servers in data centres have become increasingly heterogeneous; egcombining multi-core CPUs with many-core GPUs. This has implications on the design offuture data-intensive systems for stream processing or machine learning: first; systems mustexploit all the available parallelism of the hardware; independently of the processingsemantics; and; second; instead of offloading computation entirely to an accelerator;systems must fully utilise all heterogeneous processors in a server; thus making acceleratorsfirst-class compute elements. In this talk; I will describe SABER; a new hybrid streamprocessing engine for CPUs and GPUs. Under a hybrid execution model; SABER executesstreaming SQL queries in a data-parallel fashion on all available CPUs and GPUssimultaneously. Instead of statically assigning query tasks to heterogeneous processors …,Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Active Middleware on Modern Hardware,2017,*
A DSL approach to reconcile equivalent divergent program executions,Luís Pina; Daniel Grumberg; Anastasios Andronidis; Cristian Cadar,Abstract Multi-Version Execution (MVE) deploys multiple versions of the same program;typically synchronizing their execution at the level of system calls. By default; MVE requiresall deployed versions to issue the same sequence of system calls; which limits the types ofversions which can be deployed. In this paper; we propose a Domain-Specific Language(DSL) to reconcile expected divergences between different program versions deployedthrough MVE. We evaluate the DSL by adding it to an existing MVE system (Varan) andtesting it via three scenarios:(1) deploying the same program under differentconfigurations;(2) deploying different releases of the same program; and (3) deployingdynamic analyses in parallel with the native execution. We also present an algorithm toautomatically extract DSL rules from pairs of system call traces.

It has been a challenge for a long time though to make FPGAprogramming accessible to a large audience of developers. An appealing solution is tocompile code from a general-purpose language to hardware using high-level synthesis.Unfortunately; current approaches to implement rich network functionality are insufficientbecause they lack:(i) libraries with abstractions for common network operations and datastructures;(ii) bindings to the underlying “substrate” on the FPGA; and (iii) debugging andprofiling support.

Intercepting Suspicious Chrome Extension Actions,Michael Cypher; Peter Pietzuch; Peter McBrien,Abstract Browser users have increasingly fallen victim to a variety of attacks carried out bymalicious browser extensions. These extensions often have powerful privileges and canexecute within the context of sensitive web-pages. Popular attacks include hijacking users'social media accounts; injecting or replacing advertisements and tracking users. Previouswork to detect malice in extensions has not succeeded in providing adequate securityguarantees about extensions running within browsers. We present a novel extensionsecurity model that categorises certain actions as suspicious and prompts users to allow orprevent suspicious operations when executed by extensions. We propose minimal changesto the Chrome browser that implement this model and that provide guarantees that maliciousextension actions cannot evade detection.

Large-Scale Stream Graph Processing: Doctoral Symposium,Domagoj Margan; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Dynamically changing graphs are a powerful abstraction used to representtemporal relationships and connections occurring between data entities in various real-world organizations; such as social and telecommunication networks. The increasingvolume; variety and velocity of graph-structured data in many application domains have ledto a development of large-scale graph processing systems. However; current state-of-the-artgraph processing systems do not provide efficient support for streaming graph scenarios. Inthis report; we describe and discuss stream graph processing; which narrows the problem oftraditional graph processing by focusing on near real-time analysis of dynamic graph dataconstructed and maintained from stream sources; as opposed to processing of historicalgraph datasets loaded from a disk storage.

SwiftAnalytics: Optimizing Object Storage for Big Data Analytics,Lukas Rupprecht; Rui Zhang; Bill Owen; Peter Pietzuch; Dean Hildebrand,Due to their scalability and low cost; object-based storage systems are an attractive storagesolution and widely deployed. To gain valuable insight from the data residing in objectstorage but avoid expensive copying to a distributed filesystem (eg HDFS); it would benatural to directly use them as a storage backend for data-parallel analytics frameworkssuch as Spark or MapReduce. Unfortunately; executing data-parallel frameworks on objectstorage exhibits severe performance problems; reducing average job completion times byup to 6.5×. We identify the two most severe performance problems when running data-parallel frameworks on the OpenStack Swift object storage system in comparison to theHDFS distributed filesystem:(i) the fixed mapping of object names to storage nodes preventslocal writes and adds delay when objects are renamed;(ii) the coarser granularity of …,Cloud Engineering (IC2E); 2017 IEEE International Conference on,2017,*

Increasingly end-hosts in aconference are assisted by cloud-based servers that improve the quality of experience forend users. This paper evaluates the impact of strategies for placement of such servers onuser experience and deployment cost. We consider scenarios based upon the Amazon EC2infrastructure as well as future scenarios in which cloud instances can be located at a largernumber of possible sites across the planet. We compare a number of possible strategies forchoosing which cloud locations should host services and how traffic should route throughthem. Our study is driven by real data to create demand scenarios with realistic geographicaluser distributions and diurnal behaviour.

The SABER system for window-based hybrid stream processing with GPGPUs,Alexandros Koliousis; Matthias Weidlich; Raul Castro Fernandez; Alexander L Wolf; Paolo Costa; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Heterogeneous architectures that combine multi-core CPUs with many-coreGPGPUs have the potential to improve the performance of data-intensive stream processingapplications. Yet; a stream processing engine must execute streaming SQL queries withsufficient data-parallelism to fully utilise the available heterogeneous processors; anddecide how to use each processor in the most effective way. Addressing these challenges;we demonstrate S aber; a hybrid high-performance relational stream processing engine forCPUs and GPGPUs. S aber executes window-based streaming SQL queries in a data-parallel fashion and employs an adaptive scheduling strategy to balance the load on thedifferent types of processors. To hide data movement costs; S aber pipelines the transfer ofstream data between CPU and GPGPU memory.

Network-aware stream query processing in mobile ad-hoc networks,Dan O'Keeffe; Theodoros Salonidis; Peter Pietzuch,Many real-time decision support and sensing applications can be expressed as continuousstream queries over time-varying data streams; following a data stream management model.We consider the problem of the efficient and resilient execution of continuous stream queriesin tactical edge networks formed from mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) with limitedbackend connectivity. Previous approaches for distributed stream query execution targetdata center environments in which networks are static; and centralized control is feasible.The distributed; bandwidth-constrained and highly dynamic nature of MANETs render suchapproaches insufficient-while a stream query executes in a MANET; changes in the networktopology mean that any fixed query plan eventually becomes outdated.

Efficient Task Placement in Large Computing Clusters,Andrei Bogdan Antonescu; Peter Pietzuch; Raul Castro Fernandez,Abstract The exponential increases in information encouraged the need for large clusters toanalyse huge quantities of data in sub-second latency. This environment triggered anincrease use case for streaming computation in contrast to more classical batchcomputations. Over a decade of academic research was invested in crafting state-of-the-artbatch schedulers. However; with the rise of streaming computation the former cannot adaptefficiently to this new class of workloads characterized by dynamic resource consumptionand very long execution cycles. In this report we describe a new scheduler that dynamicallyadjusts to workload changes by migrating tasks at runtime. This way we constantly ensurethe system throughput is maximized and each job has a fair share of resources during thelong lifespan of streaming applications.

Our solution follows the paradigm ofstateful data stream processing and is implemented on top of the SEEP stream processingplatform. It achieves high scalability by massive data-parallel processing and the option ofperforming semantic load-shedding. In addition; our solution is fault-tolerant; ensuring thatthe large processing state of stream operators is not lost after failure. Our experimentalresults show that our solution processes 1 month worth of data for 40 houses in 4 hours.When we scale out the system; the time reduces linearly to 30 minutes before the systembottlenecks at the data source. We then apply semantic load-shedding; maintaining a lowmedian prediction error and reducing the time further to 17 minutes.

NetAgg: Middleboxes for Application-Specific Traffic Aggregation,PR Pietzuch; L Mai; L Rupprecht; A Alim; P Costa; M Migliavacca; P Pietzuch; A Wolf,© 2014 ACM. Data centre applications for batch processing (eg map/reduce frameworks)and online services (eg search engines) scale by distributing data and computation acrossmany servers. They typically follow a partition/aggregation pattern: tasks are first partitionedacross servers that process data locally; and then those partial results are aggregated. Thisdata aggregation step; however; shifts the performance bottleneck to the network; whichtypically struggles to support many-to-few; high-bandwidth traffic between servers. Instead ofperforming data aggregation at edge servers; we show that it can be done more efficientlyalong network paths.

CrossBow: Scaling Deep Learning on Multi-GPU Servers,Alexandros Koliousis; Pijika Watcharapichat; Matthias Weidlich; Paolo Costa; Peter Pietzuch,ABSTRACT With the widespread availability of servers with 4 or more GPUs; scalability interms of the number of GPUs in a server when training deep learning models becomes aparamount concern. Systems such as TensorFlow and MXNet train using synchronousstochastic gradient descent—an input batch is partitioned across the GPUs; each computinga partial gradient. The gradients are then combined to update the model parameters beforeproceeding to the next batch. For many deep learning models; this introduces a scalabilitychallenge: to keep multiple GPUs fully utilised; the batch size must be sufficiently large; but alarge batch size slows down model convergence due to the less frequent model updates;thus prolonging the time to reach a desired level of accuracy.

Ako: Decentralised Deep Learning with Partial Gradient Exchange,P Pietzuch; P Watcharapichat; V Lopez Morales; R Castro Fernandez,Distributed systems for the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) with large amounts ofdata have vastly improved the accuracy of machine learning models for image and speechrecognition. DNN systems scale to large cluster deployments by having worker nodes trainmany model replicas in parallel; to ensure model convergence; parameter serversperiodically synchronise the replicas. This raises the challenge of how to split resourcesbetween workers and parameter servers so that the cluster CPU and network resources arefully utilised without introducing bottlenecks. In practice; this requires manual tuning for eachmodel configuration or hardware type. We describe Ako; a decentralised dataflow-basedDNN system without parameter servers that is designed to saturate cluster resources. Allnodes execute workers that fully use the CPU resources to update model replicas. To …,*,*,*

However; it is not straightforward to achieve thenecessary simplicity of a first language in a music live coding setting; for reasons largelyrelated to the manipulation of time. The original version of Sonic Pi used a 'sleep'function formanaging time; blocking computation for a specified time period. However; while thisapproach was conceptually simple; it resulted in badly timed music; especially whenmultiple musical threads were executing concurrently. This paper describes an alternativeprogramming approach for timing (implemented in Sonic Pi v2. 0) which maintains syntacticcompatibility with v1. 0; yet provides accurate timing via interaction between real time and a“virtual time”.

Managing expectations: runtime negotiation of information quality requirements in event-based systems,PR Pietzuch; S Frischbier; Alejandro Buchmann,© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014. Interconnected smart devices in the Internet ofThings (IoT) provide fine-granular data about real-world events; leveraged by service-basedsystems using the paradigm of event-based systems (EBS) for invocation. Depending on thecapabilities and state of the system; the information propagated in EBS differs in content butalso in properties like precision; rate and freshness. At runtime; consumers have differentdynamic requirements about those properties that constitute quality of information (QoI) forthem. Current approaches to support quality-related requirements in EBS are either domain-specific or limited in terms of expressiveness; flexibility and scope as they do not allowparticipants to adapt their behavior. We introduce the generic concept of expectations toexpress; negotiate and enforce arbitrary requirements about information quality in EBS at …,*,*,*

in Scalable Web Applications,Panagiotis Garefalakis; Raul Castro Fernandez; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract. Web applications that include personalised recommendations; targetedadvertising; and other analytics functions must maintain complex prediction models; whichare trained over large datasets. Such applications typically separate stored data into offlineand online data based on its time to compute and freshness requirements. To serverequests robustly and with low latency; applications then cache data from the analytics layer;constructing responses from this data; to train models and offer analytics; they useasynchronous offline computation in the analytics layer; which leads to stale data beingserved to clients. Instead; our goal is to offer a unified model to developers when writing webapplications that serve data while using big data analytics. Our idea is to express the onlineand offline logic of a web application as a single stateful distributed dataflow graph. The …,*,*,*

CloudSafetyNet: Detecting Data Leakage between Cloud Tenants,PR Pietzuch; C Priebe; D Muthukumaran; D O'Keeffe; D Eyers; B Shand; R Kapitza,Copyright© 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery; Inc.(ACM). When tenantsdeploy applications under the control of third-party cloud providers; they must trust theproviders security mechanisms for inter-tenant isolation; resource sharing and accesscontrol. Despite a providers best efforts; accidental data leakage may occur due tomisconfigurations or bugs in the cloud platform. Especially in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)clouds; which rely on weaker forms of isolation; the potential for unnoticed data leakage ishigh. Prior work to raise tenants trust in clouds relies on attestation; which limits themanagement flexibility of providers; or fine-grained data tracking; which has high overheads.We describe CloudSafetyNet (CSN); a lightweight monitoring framework that gives tenantsvisibility into the propagation of their application data in a cloud environment with low …,*,*,*

Security in Multi-domain Event-based Systems,P Pietzuch; M Migliavacca; J Bacon; D Eyers; J Sigh; B Shand,Summary Event-based systems give the potential for active information sharing. The event-based paradigm; if used for event transport; provides loose coupling between components;many-to-many communication and mutual anonymity of event producers and eventconsumers. This communication style has been adopted enthusiastically for convenience ofprogramming; particularly for financial processing; healthcare applications and sensor-based systems. But some data is sensitive; and its visibility must be controlled carefully forpersonal and legal reasons. Our research projects have explored this space for some time;investigating application domains in which the event-based paradigm is appropriate yetwhere security is an issue. We discuss security issues for multi-domain; event-basedsystems; considering the requirements of applications and the risk associated with failure …,*,*,*

Adaptive Data Stream Processing for Hybrid Coalition Networks: Challenges and Initial Solutions,Jim Kurose; Dan O’Keeffe; Peter Pietzuch; Theodoros Salonidis; Anand Seetharam; Don Towsley,Abstract—In this paper; we consider the problem of adaptive stream processing in hybridcoalition networks (HCNs). We first introduce and motivate the data stream management(DSM) model that naturally captures the processing; communication and data accesscharacteristics of several real-time applications. Using a situational awareness scenario asmotivation; we identify the key challenges and requirements for efficient DSM operation inan HCN environment and then focus on two specific issues. First; we consider routing of real-time; streamed tuples of data (eg; objects extracted from images) that must be matchedagainst data stored in an archival database in the backend cloud. We outline twoapproaches; Minimum Delay routing and backpressure; that can be used to dynamicallyroute tuples either to the backend cloud infrastructure for processing; or to a virtual cluster …,*,*,*

Skyler: Dynamic; Workload-Aware Data Sharding across Multiple Data Centres,Nicholas Ball; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Popular online services such as Facebook and Twitter use multiple data centers(DCs) to service globally distributed user requests with the lowest possible latency. Existingdistributed data stores either fully replicate or statically shard data across DCs. Fullreplication limits scalability and static sharding fixes data to a single sharding policy; unableto adapt with user and popularity shifts frequently encountered. We present SKYLER; adynamic data sharding layer for distributed data stores deployed across multiple DCs. Bymigrating and sharding data based on access patterns; SKYLER is both locality andworkload aware. It can serve user requests with lower latency compared to a randomsharding policy and adapt to workload changes within minutes.,*,*,*
