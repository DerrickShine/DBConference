Tetraarylphosphonium polyelectrolyte chromophores: synthesis; stability; photophysics; film morphology and critical surface energy,Monte S Bedford; Xiaoyan Yang; Kara M Jolly; Rachel L Binnicker; Samuel B Cramer; Caitlin E Keen; Connor J Mairena; Amar P Patel; Meredith T Rivenbark; Yuriy Galabura; Igor Luzinov; Rhett C Smith,Three ionic polymers featuring main chain tetraarylphosphonium units have been preparedby an underexplored polymerisation route that employs Ni-catalysed P–C bond formation.The three polymers include chromophores comprised of 2; 5-dihexyloxy-p-phenylene; 9; 9-dioctyl-2; 7-fluorenylene; or 2; 7-fluorenone segments between phosphonium sites so thatthe composite ionic polymers exhibit absorption and photoluminescence in the UV-visibleregion of the spectrum. The photophysical properties of the materials were evaluated toassess the applicability of the polymers for optoelectronic applications. The wettability andcritical surface energies of dip-coated neat polymer films were also determined from contactangle measurements.,Polymer Chemistry,2015,9
Convenient route to tetraarylphosphonium polyelectrolytes via metal-catalysed P–C coupling polymerisation of aryl dihalides and diphenylphosphine,Wang Wan; Xiaoyan Yang; Rhett C Smith,AP–C bond-forming reaction has been applied to the convenient preparation oftetraarylphosphonium polyelectrolytes (TPELs) from aryl dihalides and diphenylphosphine.A TPEL having a thermal decomposition temperature of 460° C that is also stable to heatingat 65° C in 6 M NaOH (aq) for at least 24 h has been prepared by this method.,Chemical Communications,2017,2
Influence of spacer length and rigidity on properties of phosphonium polymers and on their supramolecular assembly with a conjugated polyelectrolyte,Xiaoyan Yang; Catherine A Conrad; Wang Wan; Monte S Bedford; Longyu Hu; George Chumanov; Rhett C Smith,A series of seven cationic polymers have been prepared wherein the length of spacerbetween charge-bearing sites has been varied. Thermal stability of the polymers wascharacterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry(DSC). The length of spacer has obvious effect on thermal stability as well as on the extent ofcrystallinity as revealed by X-ray powder diffraction. The cationic polymers were tested fortheir ability to form supramolecularly-assembled films with an anionic polythiophenederivative by a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition process. Film growth was followed byspectroscopic techniques and surface morphologies were examined by atomic forcemicroscopy (AFM). Interesting dependence of film morphology and composition wasobserved depending on whether an even-or odd-number of methylene spacers was …,Journal of Materials Chemistry C,2015,2
A new route to phosphonium polymer network solids via cyclotrimerization,Xiaoyan Yang; Yimei Wen; George Chumanov; Rhett C Smith,ABSTRACT An organo-main group network solid having tetrahedral phosphonium verticeswas prepared from a diacetyl monomer via a straightforward cyclotrimerization reaction. Thenetwork solid composition was examined by FT-IR spectroscopy and elementalmicroanalysis; revealing quantitative reaction of carbonyl moieties and a 67% degree ofcross-linking. The reaction yielded a material having a layered structure that is comprised ofan amorphous polymer and which is thermally stable up to 370 C in air with a char yield of40% upon heating as high as 800 C under N 2. The polymer is stable to 6 M NaOH (aq) at60 C for 24 h and takes up only 10.63% of water by mass at room temperature. The surfacemorphology; as examined by AFM; revealed a very smooth as-prepared film (RMSroughness of 3 nm). The specific surface area measured by BET analysis with N 2 gas is …,Journal of Polymer Science Part A: Polymer Chemistry,2017,1
Convenient synthetic route to tetraarylphosphonium polyelectrolytes via palladium‐catalyzed P–C coupling of aryl triflates and diphenylphosphine,Wang Wan; Xiaoyan Yang; Rhett C Smith,ABSTRACT A series of eight tetraarylphosphonium polyelectrolytes (TPELs) has beensuccessfully synthesized by polymerization of diphenylphosphine and bis (aryl triflate) s. Thebis (aryl triflate) s are readily prepared from bisphenols; some of which are commodityfeedstocks such as bisphenol A. The polymerization via palladium catalyzed P–C bondformation produces degrees of polymerization up to 65. All polymeric triflates havereasonable thermal stability in the range of 350–450 C. The stability of the TPELs to alkalinesolution is strongly depending on the spacer between adjacent phosphonium sites.Polymers with electron-releasing and bulky substituent para-to the phosphonium site haveimproved stability while those with electron-withdrawing substituent para-to phosphoniumsite have decreased alkaline stability due to decomposition via a nucleophilic aromatic …,Journal of Polymer Science Part A: Polymer Chemistry,2017,*
