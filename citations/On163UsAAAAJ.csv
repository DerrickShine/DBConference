Generic knowledge strategies in the US pharmaceutical industry,Paul Bierly; Alok Chakrabarti,Summary The purpose of this study is to identify groups of firms with similar genericknowledge strategies; determine how these strategies change over time; and compare profitmargins of the groups. Knowledge strategies of 21 US pharmaceutical firms are analyzedfrom 1977 to 1991. Cluster analysis is used to group firms over different time periods basedon:(a) balance between internal and external learning;(b) preference for radical orincremental learning;(c) learning speed; and (d) breadth of knowledge base. Our findingsindicate that there are four generic knowledge strategy groups:'Explorers';'Exploiters';'Loners'; and 'Innovators'. Most firms remain in the same knowledge group over time. The firms inthe 'Innovator'and 'Explorer'groups tend to be more profitable than the firms in the'Exploiter'and 'Loner'groups.,*,1999,1358
Innovation speed: A conceptual model of context; antecedents; and outcomes,Eric H Kessler; Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract There is a growing recognition that innovation speed is important to a firm's creatingand sustaining competitive advantage amidst rapidly changing business environments.However; there has been little theoretical advancement or model building regarding wheninnovation speed is appropriate; what factors speed up innovations; and how differences inspeed affect project outcomes. In this article; we organize and integrate the innovationspeed literature; develop a conceptual framework of innovation speed; and offerresearchable propositions relating to the need for and antecedents and outcomes ofinnovation speed. Specifically; we argue that innovation speed (a) is most appropriate inenvironments characterized by competitive intensity; technological and market dynamism;and low regulatory restrictiveness;(b) can be positively or negatively affected by strategic …,Academy of Management Review,1996,919
Firm size and technology centrality in industry–university interactions,Michael D Santoro; Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract University research centers can be beneficial to industrial firms by providing firmswith a number of relationship alternatives that facilitate the advancement of knowledge andnew technologies. This multi-method field study indicates that larger more mechanistic firmsespecially those in resource intense industrial sectors use knowledge transfer and researchsupport relationships to build competencies in non-core technological areas. In contrast;smaller more organic firms particularly those in high tech industrial sectors focus more onproblem solving in core technological areas through technology transfer and cooperativeresearch relationships. We also found that champions at the firm play a key role in thesedynamics. Implications for industry and universities are discussed.,Research policy,2002,596
Computer anxiety and attitudes towards microcomputer use,Magid Igbaria; Alok Chakrabarti,Abstract Survey data gathered from 187 participants were used to examine the relationshipbetween demographic variables; computer training and experience; management supportand system quality and computer anxiety; and attitudes toward microcomputers. Results ofhierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that the quality of the computer-basedinformation system which represents the interface and the interaction between theparticipants and the system has a strong positive effect on attitudes toward microcomputers;and a significant reduction on computer anxiety. Computer training contributes strongly todecrease in computer anxiety and has an indirect effect on attitudes toward microcomputers.However; computer experience and management support were found to affect the attitudestoward microcomputers directly. Among the demographic variables; gender was the only …,Behaviour & Information Technology,1990,591
The role of champion in product innovation,Alok K Chakrabarti,In observing that the primary reasons for lack of innovation in organizations are (I) inertia inputting forth the idea;(2) fear of criticism if the idea is offered;(3) feeling of futility about thelikelihood that the idea will be well received or acted on;(4) lack of attention paid to the ideaat early stages; Marvin Bower; Managing Director ofMcKinsey & Company advocated thatsuccessful innovation requires attention of the top management and a nurturing atmosphere.I From his experiences as the Chief Executive of Bell and Howell; Peter G. Petersonconcluded that the following three conditions are necessary for successful innovations in anorganization:(I) some amount of flexible structure is necessary for defining the problem andneed ofthe organization;(2) a minimum number of people to prevent mangling the idea; and(3) a moderate amount of humility toward intellectual ability is needed to generate some …,California management review,1974,467
Factors influencing innovation success at the project level,Albert H Rubenstein; Alok K Chakrabarti; Robert D O'Keefe; William E Souder; HC Young,The project covered by this paper was aimed at: 1) identifying those barriers and facilitatorswhich are actually encountered in the innovation process in US industrial organizations atthe project level; 2) assessing the type and range of these factors; and 3) attempting toassess their impact on the research and development (RD/1) process. There have been anumber of studies of the RD/1 process at the organizational level; including the oneconducted by AD Little and the Industrial Research Institute; which have yielded sets ofbarriers perceived as inhibiting the process (1). Prior studies have served to identify factorsbelieved to be potentially relevant for industrial RD/1 in general. This study attempted tocarry our understanding one step further by investigating how these factors enter into theongoing RD/1 process at the points where decisions are being made and the work is …,Research management,1976,375
Speeding up the pace of new product development,Eric H Kessler; Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract This study empirically investigates a wide array of factors that have been argued todifferentiate fast from slow innovation processes from the perspective of the research anddevelopment organization. We test the effects of strategic orientation (criteria-and scope-related variables) and organizational capability (staffing-and structuring-related variables)on the speed of 75 new product development projects from ten large firms in severalindustries. Backward-elimination regression analysis revealed that (a) clear time-goals;longer tenure among team members; and parallel development increased speed; whereas(b) design for manufacturability; frequent product testing; and computer-aided designsystems decreased speed. However; when projects were sorted by magnitude of change;different factors were found to influence the speed of radical and incremental projects …,Journal of product innovation management,1999,365
Arbeitsteilung im Innovationsmanagement,Jürgen Hauschildt; Alok K Chakrabarti,Zusammenfassung Entgegen weit verbreiteten Vorstellungen war es Joseph Schumpeter;der darauf aufmerksam machte; daß Innovation; das “Durchsetzen neuer Kombinationen”;das Zusammenwirken höchst unterschiedlicher Menschen erfordert:“Und die Funktion desDurchführens neuer Kombinationen und die der Erweiterung unsrer Erkenntnis; dieFunktion des Unternehmers und die Funktion des Erfinders sind ganz verschiedene Dinge.Der Unternehmer ist weder prinzipiell selbst Erfinder—wo er es ist; liegt eine zufälligeVereinigung verschiedener Funktionen vor—; noch ist er der Handlanger undOrdonnanzoffizier des Erfinders; so daß der Erfmder der eigentliche Unternehmer wäre.”(1.Aufl.; 1912; S. 178).,*,1999,345
Innovation and the productivity crisis,Martin Neil Baily; Alok K Chakrabarti,The collapse of US productivity growth since the late 1960s has been the most severe andpersistent of recent economic problems. This volume reviews the extent of the growthslowdown; evaluates several contributing factors; and suggests strategies for improvement.The authors find that inflation; recessions; oil price fluctuations; and other economicdisruptions in the 1970s had an averse effect on economic performance; but; they suggest; aslowing in the pace of innovation and a failure to exploit the benefits of innovation alsocontributed to the weakness in productivity. Baily and Chakrabarti provide a comprehensiveassessment of US technology policy and its importance to growth. They argue for continuedsupport of basic science; even though strength in this area does not give the US economyan immediate competitive advantage; and advocate increased support for" middle ground …,*,2011,306

The role of incubator interactions in assisting new ventures,Joanne L Scillitoe; Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract Past literature on the development of new technology-based firms (NTBF) withinbusiness incubators suggests that the incubation process of these ventures includes bothbusiness and technical assistance. In addition; past literature suggests that this assistance isaccessible through direct and networking interactions with the incubator management.However; research on the influence of each of these types of interactions on the types ofbeneficial assistance gained by ventures is unclear. Drawing predominately from socialcapital theory; this study examines the role of counseling and networking interactions withincubator management on both beneficial business and technical assistance for NTBFs.Results of this study suggest that business assistance; in the form of venture learning aboutbuyer preferences; is best enabled through counseling interactions with incubator …,Technovation,2010,242
The R&D/marketing interface: results from an empirical study of innovation projects,William E Souder; Alok K Chakrabarti,Explores the effect of organizational factors which characterize the interface betweenmarketing and R&D; with respect to the innovation process. The basic premise is that thedegree of collaboration/integration between functional units; such as marketing and R&D;has a profound influence on the success/failure outcome of innovation projects in industrialsettings. Several important variables which influence the quality of the R&D/marketinginterface are defined. These variables are related in an overall model which identifiesseveral actions managers can take to improve the quality of the interface.,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,1978,233
Technological learning; strategic flexibility; and new product development in the pharmaceutical industry,Paul E Bierly; Alok K Chakrabarti,The objective of this study was to better understand strategic management using thedynamic capabilities approach. The authors have focused on two fundamental constructs ofdynamic capabilities; technological learning and strategic flexibility; and discerned theirinfluence on organizational performance. Their main argument has been that a firm'sstrategic flexibility moderates the relationship between technological learning andtechnological performance as evidenced by new product development. Their model isbased on the synthesis of the traditions of research in strategic and technologymanagement. Technological learning has been defined in two dimensions: internal andexternal learning. Strategic flexibility has been operationalized in financial; marketing;manufacturing; and technological dimensions.

The division of labour in innovation management,Alok K Chakrabarti; Juergen Hauschildt,Abstract The literature shows a plethora of roles in innovation management. These roleshave not provided a systematic and unique pattern of relationship which can serve as aninstrument of organization. An analysis of the empirical findings shows the existence ofdivision of labour in innovation management in a multiple role concept. The concepts like'product champion';'gatekeeper';'sponsor';'business innovator';'technical innovator';'promoter'etc. have some elements of commonality and complementarity. Two underlying principlescan be delineated: division of labour according to phases of the innovation process andaccording to sources of power of the incumbents. An interaction model and a processlinkage model for innovation management are developed to explain the different findings.These models help to integrate these empirical concepts and serve as guidelines for …,R&D Management,1989,179
Does it pay to acquire technological firms?,Alok Chakrabarti; Jurger Hauschildt; Christian Süverkrüp,Abstract The paper focuses on several research questions: How do the firms differ in termsof their strategic objectives for foreign acquisitions?

R&D/marketing linkage and innovation strategy: Some West German experience,Klaus Brockhoff; Alok K Chakrabarti,In focusing on R&D and marketing departments within the same business units in 31German companies; data were obtained on the success rate of innovations; causes forfailure of innovations; marketing and technology strategy; and the dynamics of thetechnological environment. Semistructured interview protocols were used for obtaining thedata. Although marketing was mentioned as the most important cause for innovation failure;it was found that the reasons for the failure of product innovation were embedded in complexmultidimensional factors related to the fit between strategic behavior and the demands of thecompetitive environment. Four different technology strategies were identified: defensiveimitator; process developer; aggressive specialist; and aggressive innovator.

Corporate strategic objectives for establishing relationships with university research centers,Michael D Santoro; Alok K Chakrabarti,Organizations face increased pressures to continually advance knowledge and newtechnologies long-term success and prosperity. University research centers offer importantinterorganizational linkages for industry-university collaboration; conducive for advancingknowledge and new technologies. This study examined industry's strategic objectives forestablishing relationships with university research centers. As a result of this multimethodexploratory field study; the authors have identified three clusters of industrial firms withdifferent strategic objectives: collegial players; aggressive players; and targeted players.Collegial players are predominately large firms working with university research centers ontopics of interest to the firm which are perceived to have long-term value rather than thepromise of immediate commercial opportunities.

Building industry–university research centers: some strategic considerations,Michael D Santoro; Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract This paper reviews the importance of industry–university relationships and thestrategic considerations within the context of these partnerships in university researchcenters. We have identified several factors that are particularly important to industry inbuilding relationships with university centers. These include: acquiring skills; knowledge andgaining access to university facilities; organizational cultures that are more organic; flexibleuniversity policies for intellectual property rights; patents and licenses; and the presence ofchampions. Firms also have explicit collaborative strategies for partnering with universitieswhere firms can be segmented into three distinct clusters: Collegial Players; AggressivePlayers and Targeted Players.

Organizational factors in post-acquisition performance,Alok K Chakrabarti,A study is reported based on 31 acquisitions for which data have been obtained fromexecutives in the acquired divisions as well as the corporate officers by structured interviewsand questionnaires. The study shows a lack of relationship between the professed motivesof acquisition and post-acquisition performance. It seems that the lure of quick profitablegrowth through acquisition does not often materialize regardless of motive. The level ofintegration between the acquired division and its parent is shown to affect performancemeasured in terms of sales; profit; return on investment; market share growth; innovation;and broadening of customer base. The post-acquisition performance is also dependent on avariety of other factors including the assistance accorded to the division by the corporateorganization.

Corporate strategies in environmental management,Klaus Brockhoff; Alok K Chakrabarti; Manfred Kirchgeorg,OVERVIEW: Environmental management has become an issue of substantial concern;particularly in the chemical industry. A comparative study of US and German chemicalcompanies shows that they adopt substantially different strategies to express this concern.Four different strategies have been identified; and the characteristics that indicate responsesto environmental factors are substantially different among the clusters. It is suggested thatregulatory agencies should take these differences into account; and that companies thathave adopted a particular strategy should be aware of alternative approaches by theircompetitors. The choice of new technology and the R&D portfolio will be affected by thestrategies chosen.,Research-Technology Management,1999,93
Competition in high technology: analysis of patents of US; Japan; UK; France; West Germany; and Canada,Alok K Chakrabarti,Using US patents as a surrogate measure of technological positions; the competitivepositions of the industrial nations (the US; United Kingdom; France; West Germany; Canada;and Japan) in high-technology areas during the period from 1975 to 1988 are examined.High-technology industry is defined as one which requires a high proportion of R&Dexpenditure and employs a high proportion of scientists and engineers. High-tech industriesare further subdivided into four categories (equipment; consumer durable; nondurable; andintermediate products) in terms of their market and/or use. How different countries havespecialized in different product market areas within the high tech sector is also examined.

We have collected new data on innovation that support the view that aslowing of innovation played an important part in the decline in productivity growth. Wereport here the first stage in an in-depth investigation of productivity in particular industries.This first stage focuses on two manufacturing industries; chemicals and textiles. Certainly;more industries are needed to verify the findings; but the two industries chosen provide agood contrast. The chemical industry is capital-intensive and processbased; and reliesheavily on its own research and development.

Building social capital and learning environment in university–industry relationships,Alok K Chakrabarti; Michael D Santoro,University–industry interactions have become an important phenomenon in recent years.Universities are viewed as engines of economic growth in the era of a knowledge economy.The recent literature on this topic is somewhat restrictive; as it has taken a resource-basedview. We have argued here that an often over looked contribution that a university can makein its relationships with industrial firms is the building of social capital. On the basis of a studyof university-industry research centres in the US; we have identified three dimensions of theinteraction patterns analogous to the dimensions of social capital in terms of communicationstructure; sharing of visions and priorities; and building of a trusting relationship. We alsoexplore the factors that help build these dimensions and their effect.,International Journal of Learning and Intellectual Capital,2004,65
Interorganizational transfer of knowledge: An analysis of patent citations of a defense firm,Alok K Chakrabarti; Israel Dror; Nopphdol Eakabuse,It is argued that although technology is considered to be a strategic asset for anorganization; interplay in technology among organizations is necessary. Technology may beconsidered a bank which organizations both contribute to and draw from. Such interactionsamong organizations in technology follow different patterns. Some preliminary results from astudy that aims at addressing this issue are presented.

Scientific output of small and medium size firms in high tech industries,Alok K Chakrabarti,The author focuses on the scientific output of small and medium-sized firms in high-techindustries in the US. The indicators for technological output have been defined differently bydifferent researchers. Economists have used patents as the measure of research anddevelopment (R&D) output; partly because they are easier to delineate than other indicators.Behavioral researchers interested in the R&D management process have relied onpublications as a surrogate measure for R&D output; while research in science policy andinnovation has focused on products and processes as indicators of innovation and technicaloutput. The author focuses on all three measures as indicators of R&D output andinvestigates the interrelationship among them as well as the correlates for this output. Exceptfor the chemical industry.

Technology indicators: Conceptual issues and measurement problems,Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract This paper discusses some of the studies where attempts have been made to“measure” technological development for comparative purposes. Conceptual issues relatedto definition and measurement of “technology indicators” are presented here. The differentindicators measure the different aspects of technology and consequently have differentimplication for policy issues at both macro and micro levels. Three approaches to researchon technology indicators have been identified. The first approach initiated by the GellmanResearch Associates in the United States uses literature as the primary source for definingthe population of innovations. The second approach used by the researchers at theUniversity of Sussex uses a large panel of experts to define population of innovations. Thethird approach used in many countries in Europe relies on surveys of firms. Problems …,Journal of engineering and technology management,1989,42
Defense R&D; technology; and economic performance: A longitudinal analysis of the US experience,Alok K Chakrabarti; C Lenard Anyanwu,The impact of defense expenditure is discussed in terms of the direct relationships betweendefense R&D and economic performance as well as the indirect relationships between thedevelopment of technical and scientific skills and new technology. The model is estimatedfor the period 1955-1988 on a time-series set measured as elasticities. The effect of defenseR&D is observed through technological change as measured by the number of patentsgranted to US organizations and individuals. Results indicate no statistically visibleevidence of direct effect from defense R&D to the economy. The nonR&D aspect of defensespending appears to have no statistically significant effect on the major components ofcivilian economic performance; technical skills formation or technological change.

New technologies arediffusing across industry boundaries at an increasing rate primarily because of thetremendous increase in access to information through the advances in computers andcommunications. This “sharing” of technologies among industries creates new competitorsfrom surprising sources. Additionally; the globalization of almost all major industries hasincreased the rivalry; and hence the rate of innovation; in many industries by introducingplayers with different knowledge sets; different perspectives of the future; and a different …,*,1999,38

Information about innovations has beenobtained from published sources. Although the linkage between innovation and productivitycan be a complex one; it is observed that the slowdown of the productivity growth in thechemical industry coincided with a significant slowdown in innovation. An opposite trend isobserved in the textile industry. Although the machine tool industry showed an increase ininnovation; the productivity growth slowed down consistently during 1967–1984. Cyclicalfluctuation in the demand for machine tools might have created a difficult problem.

An empirical analysis of innovation strategies of biotechnology firms in the US,Alok K Chakrabarti; Ursula Weisenfeld,Abstract The paper explores the strategies of biotechnology firms in the US through a mailquestionnaire study. Based on the responses of 89 companies we have developed strategyarchetypes of these firms in R&D; marketing; and technology acquisition. In R&D; we foundthe firms to follow either incremental or radical strategy. In marketing; the firms use either adefender or an innovator strategy. In technology acquisition; firms differ in terms of theiremphasis on licensing or developing new technology. The interrelationship among thestrategy groups is weak.

The sources of social capital within technology incubators: the roles of historical ties and organisational facilitation,Joanne L Scillitoe; Alok K Chakrabarti,There are currently three divergent views regarding the sources of beneficial social capitalwithin collectivities or networks: historical ties; organisational facilitation; and trust-basedshared pursuit of common goals. Technology incubators are newer organisational forms thatare created to support and accelerate the development and success of affiliated technology-based ventures. However; it is unclear how social capital that benefits the technologicaldevelopment of affiliated ventures is created within technology incubators. Drawing from thesocial capital; technology; and organisational learning literature; this study seeks tounderstand how technology incubators can create social capital that enables acceleratedtechnological learning of affiliated ventures. Based upon a survey of 43 technology-basedventures affiliated with US and Finnish technology incubators; results of this study …,International Journal of Learning and Intellectual Capital,2005,25
Technology transfers and knowledge interactions among defence firms in the USA: an analysis of patent citations,Alok K Chakrabarti; Israel Dror,The role of military R&D in the civilian economy has been a controversial one. With rapidchanges in the geopolitical power structure; the debate about the defence technology hasassumed a higher level of significance. The defence sector has been a driving force in manynew technologies; such as developments in micro–electronics; computers; semiconductors;aviation etc. While one can marvel at the contributions of these technologies on the growthof the civilian economy; one can argue about the effectiveness of defence R&D in producingand diffusing technology suitable for the civilian sector. This paper investigates the pattern oftransfer of technology between defence firms and other organizations. Using eight largedefence contractors; Boeing; General Dynamics; Grumman; Lockheed; Martin Marietta;McDonnell Douglas; Raytheon and United Technologies; as sample; we have analysed …,International Journal of Technology Management,1994,23

Take a proactive approach to negotiating your R&D budget,Klaus K Brockhoff; Alok K Chakrabarti,OVERVIEW: R&D directors continue to behave defensively when negotiating their budgets;while their colleagues who represent other business functions use more aggressiveapproaches. It is argued that at least four different reasons can explain this behavior: culturaldifferences between business functions; lack of appropriate data; distance from valuecreation in the market; and smaller degree of activity standardization. A more offensiveapproach could be supported by developing R&D metrics that resemble the standardbusiness metrics used in other functional areas. One could also simulate R&D budgetingprocedures; the resulting budgets and their consequences.,Research-technology management,1997,22
Trends in innovation and productivity: The case of chemical and textile industries in the US,Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract This paper attempts to investigate an empirical linkage between technologicalinnovation and productivity in two industries in the United States. During the period 1967—82; the chemical and textile industries experienced different rates of productivity growth. Inspite of stiff competition from foreign manufacturers; American textile firms maintained asteady growth in productivity. This industry benefitted from major technological innovationsoccurring in industries supplying to it. The chemical industry faced crisis due to suddenchanges in petroleum prices. Changes in regulatory requirements also imposed a differentset of constraints on the chemical industry. Rate of innovation decreased quite severely inthis industry during this time period.,R&D Management,1988,21
Critical factors in technological innovation and their policy implications,Alok K Chakrabarti; William E Souder,Abstract This paper explores the critical factors which affect the innovation proccess. Someways in which some of these factors can be influenced by appropriate policy measures arediscussed. In particular; the role of the federal government in promoting innovation isdiscussed. The role of the government in stimulating and nurturing the innovation process isa controversial one. Proponents of the free enterprise system; many of whom arespokespersons for various industries; have persistently pointed out the deleterious effects ofregulation and control on the innovation process. By contrast; advocates of an activistgovernment role are often able to cite the protection of the common welfare as a primaryneed for government intervention. In truth; the “government” is a patchwork of manygovernments; operating through many agencies and affecting firms and individuals at …,Technovation,1984,21

An empirical investigation into methods affecting the quality of new product innovations,Eric H Kessler; Alok K Chakrabarti,Seventy-five new product development projects were studied in ten large companies to testpotential strategic and process antecedents to quality. Seven factors were found tosignificantly increase product quality: high importance placed on quality by topmanagement; high reward for process speed; high project stream breadth; high use ofinternal (versus external) sources of ideas and technology; low overlap or concurrency of thedevelopment process; low turfguarding or “silo” orientation; and high development milestonefrequency. These results suggest that managers need to pay attention to both strategicorientation factors and structure-related organizational capability factors to increase productquality. Staffing-related factors did not seem to have a strong impact on quality; this suggeststhat quality is more a function of systemic versus individual factors. Additionally; it was …,International Journal of Quality Science,1998,20
Marketing and R&D strategies for biotechnology firms in the USA,Alok K Chakrabarti; Ursula Weisenfeld,This pape reports on a survey of 64 biotechnology firms in the USA about their R&D strategy;marketing focud and sources of technology.

Innovation and US competitiveness,Martin Neil Baily; Alok K Chakrabarti,The United States has traditionally been able to pay higher wages than other countries andyet still compete internationally because of superior technology. Productivity was higher thanin other countries; and often the items produced were more advanced and could commandpremium prices. Because of its tech nological sophistication; the United States was able todevelop a unique position in the world economy; and US industries and workers were thebeneficiaries. The unique status of the United States has been eroding; as other countrieshave been catching up in productivity and product technology. From 1973 to 1984; outputper hour in manufacturing grew at only 2.0 percent a year in the United States; compared to6.7 percent in Japan; 4.5 percent in France; and 3.5 percent in Germany.

Defence and space expenditures in the US: an inter‐firm analysis,Alok K Chakrabarti; Hans H Glismann; Ernst‐Jjürgen Horn,The economic impact of defence and space expenditures has been an important policyissue because of the secondary benefits expected to be accruing from it. In order to capturethe scientific and technological value added of defence and space financed productions; wetook as indicators patents and scientific and technical publications. The economicperformance was measured by firm growth (in terms of rates of change in the number ofemployees); and by rates of return on sales. Firm level analysis showed that military R&Dcontracts did not contribute to economic or technical performance. NASA contracts were alsonot associated with economic performance and with technical progress as measured bypatents; but they helped to raise the number of scientific publications. On the other hand; thestandard variables (capital formation and own R&D activities) proved to be mostly …,Defence and Peace Economics,1992,15

The effects of techno-economic and organizational factors on the adoption of NASA-innovations by commercial firms in the US,Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract This paper reports the effects of several organizational and techno-economicfactors which tend in facilitate and/or inhibit the successful transfer and commercialutilization of technology generated outside the organizational setting of a potential industrialuser. The essential difference between the two traditions of research--technology transferand the diffusion of innovations--is that technology transfer studies have tended toemphasize the point-to-point transfer mechanism whereas the diffusion literature had dealtwith the pattern of spending an item over time. These tradition are not mutually exclusive anstudies in both can help us to increase our understanding of technology transfer. Thetransfer of technology between different institutional settings; such as between the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration an various potential commercial users; was the …,Academy of Management Proceedings,1973,15
Effectiveness of integrated marketing communications: Empirical analysis of two brands in India,Mehir Baidya; Bipasha Maity,Purpose–Integrated marketing communications (IMC) has emerged as a promising area ofstudy in the past decade. However; this area has received disproportionate attention forresearch around the world. This paper aims to determine the effectiveness of differentcomponents and total IMC on two brands in India. Design/methodology/approach–Data onphysical sales (200 ml bottles); advertising; sales force; promotion; distribution; and price inrupees (Indian currency) have been collected for two sample brands. A multiplicativeregression model has been hypothesized and fitted on the data to estimate the elasticities ofsales (in units) to individual components and total IMC. Findings–Results suggest that all theindividual components of IMC have significant unequal positive effects on physical sales forboth the brands. Further; the effects of total IMC on sales are also positive and significant …,Journal of Indian Business Research,2010,14
A conceptual model of the incubation of new technology-based ventures: a social capital perspective,Joanne L Scillitoe; A Chakrabarti,Abstract Technology incubators are newer organizational forms that are created to supportand accelerate the development and success of affiliated ventures; particularly newtechnology-based ventures. Current literature regarding incubators has suggested that anunderstanding of the incubation process is important when seeking to understand howaffiliated ventures develop and grow. However; very little is known about the incubationprocess; particularly the incubation of technology-based ventures. Prior literature suggeststhat technology-based ventures develop in terms of both business and technologicaldevelopment and that the incubation process varies along these dimensions. Thus;understanding the incubation of technology–based ventures must consider the differing butsimultaneous dynamics of business and technological development.

Forecasting the diffusion of innovation: a stochastic Bass model with log-normal and mean-reverting error process,Juho Kanniainen; Saku J Mäkinen; Robert Piché; Alok Chakrabarti,Forecasting the diffusion of innovations plays a major role in managing technologydevelopment and in engineering management overall. In this paper; we extend theconventional Bass model stochastically by specifying the error process of sales as log-normal and mean-reverting. Our model satisfies the following reasonable properties; whichare generally ignored in the existing literature: sales cannot be negative; the error processcan have a memory; and sales fluctuate more when they are high and less when they arelow. The conventional and widely used model that assumes normally distributed error termdoes not have these properties. We address how to forecast properly under the log-normaland mean-reverting error process; and show analytically and numerically that in ourextended model sales forecasts can substantially alter conventional Bass forecasts.

Concurrent development and product innovations,Eric H Kessler; Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract Concurrent development; or simultaneously executing multiple stages of theproduct development process; is regarded by many as an efficient and effective method forincreasing the speed of innovation (see Figure 1) while also providing a means forcontaining development costs and improving the quality of the end product (Gilbert 1995;Zairi; Youssef 1995). It has also been referred to as parallel versus linear processing of tasks(Millson et al. 1992); coordinating efforts rather than “throwing the product over the wall” fromone stage to another (Brown; Karagozoglu 1993); and as a “rugby” method of constant; multi-disciplinary team interplay rather than a “relay race” method of phase-to-phase progressionwith functionally specialized and segmented divisions (Smith; Reinertsen 1991; Souder;Chakrabarti 1980; Takeuchi; Nonaka 1986).

Strategic change of firms in response to economic liberalisation in an emerging market economy,Sougata Ray; Alok K Chakrabarti,This paper presents an analysis of how policy induced changes in the institutionalenvironment in India; a big emerging market undergoing economic liberalisation; haveinfluenced strategic behaviour of firms. An exploratory multivariate model is empirically fittedusing LISREL. Results suggest that environment was to be the most dominant exogenousfactor influencing corporate strategy and performance of firms. However; firms having betterenvironment-strategy'fit'achieved superior performance. Initial resource position seems tohave limited influence on strategy and performance. The results also suggest that increasedtheir scale of business and diversified into deregulated industries selectively butaggressively achieved superior performance.,International Journal of Strategic Change Management,2006,6

Socio-psychological correlates in the adoption of health innovations among tribals within intensive service zone of primary health centre.,AK Chakrabarti; JP Gupta; BN Tyagi,96 heads of households belonging to a tiny village predominantly inhabited by Gond Tribals(India) were interviewed to identify sociopsychological factors acting as facilitators orinhibitors of the acceptance of health innovations provided through the Primary HealthCenter. It also analyzed the tribal communitys existing health behavior pattern related tomedical care. The levels of adoption behavior were: awareness of health innovations--theprimary level; trial with the health innovations--the intermediate level; and adoption or thepractice of the health innovations--the optimal level. Even after 15 years after the inception ofthe Primary Health Center located 3.5 kilometers from the village adoption behavior of thevillagers remained at a low level. Only 43 (45%) of the 96 villagers interviewed wereadequately aware of the various health innovations introduced by the Primary Health …,Health and Population: Perspectives and Issues,1984,1

Towards a Framework of Ecosystem Genesis: The Story of Taxol,Ozgur Dedehayir; Roland J Ortt; Saku J Mäkinen; Alok Chakrabarti,Abstract This article aims to understand the roles enacted by actors during the birth ofinnovation ecosystems; and the episodes that demarcate this volatile phase of ecosystemevolution. The authors employ an inductive research design and examine the case of taxol;one of the best-selling anti-cancer drug of all time; commercialised by Bristol-Myers Squibbfor the treatment of breast cancer. Using archival data sources; they trace the events thatunfolded during the birth of taxol's ecosystem between 1967 until 1992 to arrive at emergentroles and episodes. The results of this study suggest three sequential episodes(preconception; conception; and formation) to characterise ecosystem genesis; and anumber of seminal roles undertaken by actors; including the administrator; investigator; andthe advocator.,ISPIM Innovation Symposium,2015,*
Technology development in Latin America and the Caribbean: an evaluation of the process in Brazil using patent data,Alok K Chakrabarti; Pradip K Bhaumik,In this paper we take a look at the process of technology development in Latin America andthe Caribbean using the surrogate measure of US patents granted as a tangible; quantifiedand recorded output of the technology development process. Our data include all the USpatents granted between 1991-2008; in which at least one inventor was a resident of thecountry studied. We first compared the growth of patents developed in the top 10 economiesin Latin America and the Caribbean with those of the top 10 economies of Asia. As expected;in terms of technology development; we observed wide variation among the countries ineach of the two regions. We also observed the rapid growth exhibited by the Asian asopposed to the Latin American and Caribbean countries.

Bird's Nest network-a logical approach in product development,AK Chakrabarti,To produce an item defect-free has been a challenge in engineering industry. Well-established statistical methods are available to estimate the reliability of the product; butsuch methods are mostly applicable when a large data base is available. Attempts havebeen made through various logical means to design and produce a component with highreliability. Identifying the critical parameters and essentially their inter-connectivity are majorissues to ensure reliability. A concept christened as Bird's Nest is evolved to bring out allissues of design; manufacturing; marketing etc. in a single frame. Availability of suchinformation in the beginning of a development process helps in a big way to achieve defectfree and safe system.,Reliability; Safety and Hazard (ICRESH); 2010 2nd International Conference on,2010,*

Book Review_,Alok Chakrabarti,This is a serious book on the analysis of patents to build and test a few important hypotheseson technological change. Economists have studied patents to understand the evolution andgrowth of various industries. Joseph Schmookler was the pioneer in the field and led theway for many of us. Andersen has followed the path of emerging discipline of evolutionaryeconomists. She is quite ambitious in her research agenda and has presented her workbased on seven interrelated themes: 1) evolution of technological paradigms governing thetrajectories of opportunities; 2) the S-shaped image of the technological growth cycle andthe diversity of technology; 3) the long wave phenomenon; 4) industrial dynamics; 5)corporate profiles; 6) diffusion of corporate technological leadership; 7) the overall nature oftransformation process.

4.11 Productivity,Alok K Chakrabarti,Productivity is the measure of efficiency of using factors of production. Labor productivity;denoting the productive efficiency of labor; is the most important factor in any policy analysis.However; we are increasingly becoming concerned with total factor productivity; measuringthe efficiency of using all other factors of production. Productivity has been the mostimportant economic indicator for understanding and predicting economic prosperity. Theeconomic decline in the United States and elsewhere during the mid-1970s through early1980s had much to do with decline in both labor and total factor productivity. Consequentlymany speculations have been proffered to explain the slowdown of productivity.

A Prognosticative Approach to Conflict Management in University Interdisciplinary,ALOK K CHAKRABARTI; RICHARD W SCHNEIDER,Interdisciplinary research has become increasingly prevalent for multiple reasons. Asfederal funds for university-based research become less available; universities seek othersources; such as private industry; for their sup-port. Moreover; there are a few federalprograms that either encourage or mandate supplemental funding from private sources.These sources generally fund mission-oriented or problem-focused research rather thandiscipline-bound programs. Many of the federal programs are also mission-oriented andinterdisciplinary in nature. Funding prospects are not the only motivation.

Economists have used patents as the measure ofresearch and development (R&D) output; partly because they are easier to delineate thanother indicators. Behavioral researchers interested in the R&D management process haverelied on publications as a surrogate measure for R&D output; while research in sciencepolicy and innovation has focused on products and processes as indicators of innovationand technical output. There has not been any consensus about the validity of the differentmeasures.

High Tech America: The what; how; where; and why of the sunrise industries—Ann Markusen; Peter Hall; and Amy Glasmeier,Alok K Chakrabarti,This book seems to lack a definite focus. Leadership is presented in a kind of abstract milieu.There is; for example; no concept of organizational form and no notion of managerialimperative. Presum ably the need for technical leadership exists in formal organizationssuch as corporations and research laboratories; or even in govern ment service. However;there is no contextual anchor for the subject of leadership in Weinberg's book. There are noissues as such raised in this book. The only subject is leadership which clearly is importantin the management of organiza tions. Regrettably; the author doesn't tell us why leadershipis important. Is it important for: 1) society; 2) the organization; 3) the leader; 4) the followers;or 5) all of the above?

Technology and Productivity: The Contributions of William J. Abernathy,Alok K Chakrabarti,Abernathy's research was focused on productivity. His early work in the late 60s and early70s concentrated on the productivity of research and development organizations. His laterwork expanded as he investigated the “productivity dilemma” in American industry;particularly the auto industry; leading him to study the “new industrial competition” in the US.,Interfaces,1984,*

About this issue,Alok K Chakrabarti,The importance of the subject of this special issue cannot be over-emphasized'to thereaders of this Transactions. A large number of the members of the IEEE and our otherreaders are intimately involved in the process of innovation as active participants gropingwith the nitty-gritty aspects of technical innovation in their day-to-day work. A number of usare also making significant efforts to understand and report on the phenomenon asobservers and researchers. In publishing this special issue; we fully empathize with thecomments by Langrish; Gibbons; Evans and Jevons in their preface:“The process oftechnological innovation is so universally recognized to be of salient importance for the lifeof modern man; and yet so imperfect is our understanding of what makes it happen in theways that it does; there need be no undue academic reticence about bursting into print …,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,1976,*

Field Studies of Barriers to R&D/Innovation in Industry.,Albert H Rubenstein; Alok K Chakrabarti,Abstract The objective of this study was to explore the incidence and perceived importanceof organizational; technical; environmental; and other factors which significantly affect theR&D/Innovation (RD/I) process in industrial firms. A series of field studies in seven firms wasconducted over a period of three to eight months each. The sample firms and the sampleprojects (approximately 6-50 in each field site) covered a wide range of technologies andmarkets; including: electronics; primary materials; chemicals; machinery; and consumerproducts. The principal gross units of analysis were" projects" and the principal micro units ofanalysis were" events;"" decisions;" and" situations" encountered in the innovation process.The field methodology involved an instrument package; consisting of several kinds ofinterviews; questionnaires; and unobtrusive data-collection techniques (eg; examination …,Academy of Management Proceedings,1974,*
