Scalable similarity-based neighborhood methods with mapreduce,Sebastian Schelter; Christoph Boden; Volker Markl,Abstract Similarity-based neighborhood methods; a simple and popular approach tocollaborative filtering; infer their predictions by finding users with similar taste or items thathave been similarly rated. If the number of users grows to millions; the standard approach ofsequentially examining each item and looking at all interacting users does not scale. Tosolve this problem; we develop a MapReduce algorithm for the pairwise item comparisonand top-N recommendation problem that scales linearly with respect to a growing number ofusers. This parallel algorithm is able to work on partitioned data and is general in that itsupports a wide range of similarity measures. We evaluate our algorithm on a large datasetconsisting of 700 million song ratings from Yahoo! Music.,Proceedings of the sixth ACM conference on Recommender systems,2012,50
All roads lead to rome: optimistic recovery for distributed iterative data processing,Sebastian Schelter; Stephan Ewen; Kostas Tzoumas; Volker Markl,Abstract Executing data-parallel iterative algorithms on large datasets is crucial for manyadvanced analytical applications in the fields of data mining and machine learning. Currentsystems for executing iterative tasks in large clusters typically achieve fault tolerancethrough rollback recovery. The principle behind this pessimistic approach is to periodicallycheckpoint the algorithm state. Upon failure; the system restores a consistent state from apreviously written checkpoint and resumes execution from that point. We propose anoptimistic recovery mechanism using algorithmic compensations. Our method leverages therobust; self-correcting nature of a large class of fixpoint algorithms used in data mining andmachine learning; which converge to the correct solution from various intermediateconsistent states. In the case of a failure; we apply a user-defined compensate function …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,38
Distributed matrix factorization with mapreduce using a series of broadcast-joins,Sebastian Schelter; Christoph Boden; Martin Schenck; Alexander Alexandrov; Volker Markl,Abstract The efficient; distributed factorization of large matrices on clusters of commoditymachines is crucial to applying latent factor models in industrial-scale recommendersystems. We propose an efficient; data-parallel low-rank matrix factorization with AlternatingLeast Squares which uses a series of broadcast-joins that can be efficiently executed withMapReduce. We empirically show that the performance of our solution is suitable for real-world use cases. We present experiments on two publicly available datasets and on asynthetic dataset termed Bigflix; generated from the Netflix dataset. Bigflix contains 25million users and more than 5 billion ratings; mimicking data sizes recently reported asNetflix'production workload. We demonstrate that our approach is able to run an iteration ofAlternating Least Squares in six minutes on this dataset.

Iterative parallel data processing with stratosphere: an inside look,Stephan Ewen; Sebastian Schelter; Kostas Tzoumas; Daniel Warneke; Volker Markl,Abstract Iterative algorithms occur in many domains of data analysis; such as machinelearning or graph analysis. With increasing interest to run those algorithms on very largedata sets; we see a need for new techniques to execute iterations in a massively parallelfashion. In prior work; we have shown how to extend and use a parallel data flow system toefficiently run iterative algorithms in a shared-nothing environment. Our approach supportsthe incremental processing nature of many of those algorithms. In this demonstrationproposal we illustrate the process of implementing; compiling; optimizing; and executingiterative algorithms on Stratosphere using examples from graph analysis and machinelearning. For the first step; we show the algorithm's code and a visualization of the produceddata flow programs. The second step shows the optimizer's execution plan choices; while …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,30

Optimistic recovery for iterative dataflows in action,Sergey Dudoladov; Chen Xu; Sebastian Schelter; Asterios Katsifodimos; Stephan Ewen; Kostas Tzoumas; Volker Markl,ABSTRACT Over the past years; parallel dataflow systems have been employed for advancedanalytics in the field of data mining where many al- gorithms are iterative. These systems typicallyprovide fault tolerance by periodically checkpointing the algorithm's state and; in case offailure; restoring a consistent state from a checkpoint. In prior work; we presented an optimisticrecovery mechanism that in certain cases eliminates the need to checkpoint the interme- diatestate of an iterative algorithm. In case of failure; our mech- anism uses a compensation functionto transit the algorithm to a consistent state; from which the execution can continue and suc- cessfullyconverge. Since this recovery mechanism does not check- point any state; it achieves optimalfailure-free performance while guaranteeing fault tolerance. In this paper; we demonstrate ourrecovery mechanism with the Apache Flink data processing engine.

Factorbird-a parameter server approach to distributed matrix factorization,Sebastian Schelter; Venu Satuluri; Reza Zadeh,Abstract: We present Factorbird; a prototype of a parameter server approach for factorizinglarge matrices with Stochastic Gradient Descent-based algorithms. We designed Factorbirdto meet the following desiderata:(a) scalability to tall and wide matrices with dozens ofbillions of non-zeros;(b) extensibility to different kinds of models and loss functions as longas they can be optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD); and (c) adaptability toboth batch and streaming scenarios. Factorbird uses a parameter server in order to scale tomodels that exceed the memory of an individual machine; and employs lock-free Hogwild!-style learning with a special partitioning scheme to drastically reduce conflicting updates.We also discuss other aspects of the design of our system such as how to efficiently gridsearch for hyperparameters at scale. We present experiments of Factorbird on a matrix …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1411.0602,2014,17
Efficient sample generation for scalable meta learning,Sebastian Schelter; Juan Soto; Volker Markl; Douglas Burdick; Berthold Reinwald; Alexandre Evfimievski,Meta learning techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble learning are crucial forapplying machine learning to real-world use cases. These techniques first generate samplesfrom input data; and then train and evaluate machine learning models on these samples. Formeta learning on large datasets; the efficient generation of samples becomes problematic;especially when the data is stored distributed in a block-partitioned representation; andprocessed on a shared-nothing cluster. We present a novel; parallel algorithm for efficientsample generation from large; block-partitioned datasets in a shared-nothing architecture.This algorithm executes in a single pass over the data; and minimizes inter-machinecommunication. The algorithm supports a wide variety of sample generation techniquesthrough an embedded user-defined sampling function.

Gilbert: Declarative Sparse Linear Algebra on Massively Parallel Dataflow Systems,Till Rohrmann; Sebastian Schelter; Tillman Rabl; Volker Markl,In recent years; the generated and collected data is increasing at an almost exponential rate.At the same time; the data's value has been identified in terms of insights that can beprovided. However; retrieving the value requires powerful analysis tools; since valuableinsights are buried deep in large amounts of noise. Unfortunately; analytic capacities did notscale well with the growing data. Many existing tools run only on a single computer and arelimited in terms of data size by its memory. A very promising solution to deal with large-scaledata is scaling systems and exploiting parallelism. In this paper; we propose Gilbert; adistributed sparse linear algebra system; to decrease the imminent lack of analyticcapacities. Gilbert offers a MATLAB®-like programming language for linear algebraprograms; which are automatically executed in parallel.

Structural patterns in the rise of Germany’s new right on Facebook,Sebastian Schelter; Felix Biessmann; Malisa Zobel; Nedelina Teneva,In the last years a new right-wing; populist and eurosceptic party emerged in Germany;the'Alternative für Deutschland'. Topics that were used by the party to draw attention totheir program included the Euro-crisis and the so-called'refugee crisis'. We investigate someaspects of social media use of the AfD. Our goal is to relate the rise of this party to somequantitative measures of their social media usage. A particular focus will be placed on usersthat interact with AfD content as well as with content of other parties. Our analysis is basedon more than 11 million interactions of more than one million users with the public Facebookpages of the major German political parties during the years 2014 and 2015. Investigatingthe time courses of social media activity and user interaction; we find that the rise of the AfDcan be associated with an amount of social media coverage and user engagement that is …,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,2
Blockjoin: efficient matrix partitioning through joins,Andreas Kunft; Asterios Katsifodimos; Sebastian Schelter; Tilmann Rabl; Volker Markl,Abstract Linear algebra operations are at the core of many Machine Learning (ML)programs. At the same time; a considerable amount of the effort for solving data analyticsproblems is spent in data preparation. As a result; end-to-end ML pipelines often consist of(i) relational operators used for joining the input data;(ii) user defined functions used forfeature extraction and vectorization; and (iii) linear algebra operators used for model trainingand cross-validation. Often; these pipelines need to scale out to large datasets. In this case;these pipelines are usually implemented on top of dataflow engines like Hadoop; Spark; orFlink. These dataflow engines implement relational operators on row-partitioned datasets.However; efficient linear algebra operators use block-partitioned matrices. As a result;pipelines combining both kinds of operators require rather expensive changes to the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
'Dark Germany': Temporal Characteristics and Connectivity Patterns in Online Far-Right Protests Against Refugee Housing,Sebastian Schelter; Jérôme Kunegis,Abstract We present a quantitative study of the social media activities of a contemporarynationwide protest movement against local refugee housing in Germany; which organizesitself via dedicated city-level Facebook pages. We analyse data from 2015; containing morethan one million interactions by more than 200;000 users. We investigate the temporalcharacteristics of the social media activities of this protest movement; as well as theconnectedness of the interactions of its participants. We find several activity metrics such asthe number of posts issued; negative polarity in comments; and user engagement to peak inlate 2015; coinciding with chancellor Angela Merkel's much criticized decision of September2015 to temporarily admit the entry of Syrian refugees to Germany.

Declarative Metadata Management: A Missing Piece in End-To-End Machine Learning,Sebastian Schelter; Joos-Hendrik Böse; Johannes Kirschnick; Thoralf Klein; Stephan Seufert,ABSTRACT We argue for the necessity of managing the metadata and lineage of commonartifacts in machine learning (ML). We discuss a recently presented lightweight system builtfor this task; which accelerates users in their ML workflows; and provides a basis forcomparability and repeatability of ML experiments. This system tracks the lineage ofproduced artifacts in ML workloads and automatically extracts metadata such ashyperparameters of models; schemas of datasets and layouts of deep neural networks. Itprovides a general declarative representation of common ML artifacts; is integrated withpopular frameworks such as MXNet; SparkML and scikit-learn; and meets the demands ofvarious production use cases at Amazon.,*,2018,*
‘Dark Germany’: Hidden Patterns of Participation in Online Far-Right Protests Against Refugee Housing,Sebastian Schelter; Jérôme Kunegis,Abstract The political discourse in Western European countries such as Germany hasrecently seen a resurgence of the topic of refugees; fueled by an influx of refugees fromvarious Middle Eastern and African countries. Even though the topic of refugees evidentlyplays a large role in online and offline politics of the affected countries; the fact that protestsagainst refugees stem from the right-wight political spectrum has lead to correspondingmedia to be shared in a decentralized fashion; making an analysis of the underlying socialand mediatic networks difficult. In order to contribute to the analysis of these processes; wepresent a quantitative study of the social media activities of a contemporary nationwideprotest movement against local refugee housing in Germany; which organizes itself viadedicated Facebook pages per city. We analyse data from 136 such protest pages in …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2017,*

Doubly stochastic large scale kernel learning with the empirical kernel map,Nikolaas Steenbergen; Sebastian Schelter; Felix Bießmann,Abstract: With the rise of big data sets; the popularity of kernel methods declined and neuralnetworks took over again. The main problem with kernel methods is that the kernel matrixgrows quadratically with the number of data points. Most attempts to scale up kernelmethods solve this problem by discarding data points or basis functions of someapproximation of the kernel map. Here we present a simple yet effective alternative forscaling up kernel methods that takes into account the entire data set via doubly stochasticoptimization of the emprical kernel map. The algorithm is straightforward to implement; inparticular in parallel execution settings; it leverages the full power and versatility of classicalkernel functions without the need to explicitly formulate a kernel map approximation. Weprovide empirical evidence that the algorithm works on large data sets. Subjects …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.00585,2016,*
Scaling data mining in massively parallel dataflow systems,Sebastian Schelter,Abstract The demand for mining large datasets using shared-nothing clusters is steadily onthe rise. Despite the availability of parallel processing paradigms such as MapReduce;scalable data mining is still a tough problem. Naïve ports of existing algorithms to platformslike Hadoop exhibit various scalability bottlenecks; which prevent their application to largereal-world datasets. These bottlenecks arise from various pitfalls that have to be overcome;including the scalability of the mathematical operations of the algorithm; the performance ofthe system when executing iterative computations; as well as its ability to efficiently executemeta learning techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble learning. In this paper; wepresent our work on overcoming these pitfalls. In particular; we show how to scale themathematical operations of two popular recommendation mining algorithms; discuss an …,Proceedings of the 2014 SIGMOD PhD symposium,2014,*
Predicting political party affiliation from text,Felix Biessmann; Pola Lehmann; Daniel Kirsch; Sebastian Schelter,Abstract Every day a large amount of text is produced during public discourse. Some of thistext is produced by actors whose political colour is very obvious. However; though manyactors cannot clearly be associated with a political party; their statements may be biasedtowards a specific party. Identifying such biases is crucial for political research as well as formedia consumers; especially when analysing the influence of the media on politicaldiscourse and vice versa. In this study; we investigate the extent to which political partyaffiliation can be predicted from textual content. Results indicate that automatedclassification of political affiliation is possible with an accuracy better than chance; evenacross different text domains. We propose methods to better interpret these results; and findthat features not related to political policies; such as speech sentiment; can be …,*,*,*
