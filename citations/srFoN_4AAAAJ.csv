Dwarf: Shrinking the petacube,Yannis Sismanis; Antonios Deligiannakis; Nick Roussopoulos; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Dwarf is a highly compressed structure for computing; storing; and querying datacubes. Dwarf identifies prefix and suffix structural redundancies and factors them out bycoalescing their store. Prefix redundancy is high on dense areas of cubes but suffixredundancy is significantly higher for sparse areas. Putting the two together fuses theexponential sizes of high dimensional full cubes into a dramatically condensed datastructure. The elimination of suffix redundancy has an equally dramatic reduction in thecomputation of the cube because recomputation of the redundant suffixes is avoided. Thiseffect is multiplied in the presence of correlation amongst attributes in the cube. A Petabyte25-dimensional cube was shrunk this way to a 2.3 GB Dwarf Cube; in less than 20 minutes;a 1: 400000 storage reduction ratio. Still; Dwarf provides 100% precision on cube queries …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,359
Hierarchical in-network data aggregation with quality guarantees,Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract Earlier work has demonstrated the effectiveness of in-network data aggregation inorder to minimize the amount of messages exchanged during continuous queries in largesensor networks. The key idea is to build an aggregation tree; in which parent nodesaggregate the values received from their children. Nevertheless; for large sensor networkswith severe energy constraints the reduction obtained through the aggregation tree mightnot be sufficient. In this paper we extend prior work on in-network data aggregation tosupport approximate evaluation of queries to further reduce the number of exchangedmessages among the nodes and extend the longevity of the network. A key ingredient to ourframework is the notion of the residual mode of operation that is used to eliminate messagesfrom sibling nodes when their cumulative change is small. We introduce a new algorithm …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,205
Compressing historical information in sensor networks,Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract We are inevitably moving into a realm where small and inexpensive wirelessdevices would be seamlessly embedded in the physical world and form a wireless sensornetwork in order to perform complex monitoring and computational tasks. Such networkspose new challenges in data processing and dissemination because of the limitedresources (processing; bandwidth; energy) that such devices possess. In this paper wepropose a new technique for compressing multiple streams containing historical data fromeach sensor. Our method exploits correlation and redundancy among multiplemeasurements on the same sensor and achieves high degree of data reduction whilemanaging to capture even the smallest details of the recorded measurements.

Sketch-based querying of distributed sliding-window data streams,Odysseas Papapetrou; Minos Garofalakis; Antonios Deligiannakis,Abstract While traditional data-management systems focus on evaluating single; ad-hocqueries over static data sets in a centralized setting; several emerging applications require(possibly; continuous) answers to queries on dynamic data that is widely distributed andconstantly updated. Furthermore; such query answers often need to discount data that is"stale"; and operate solely on a sliding window of recent data arrivals (eg; data updatesoccurring over the last 24 hours). Such distributed data streaming applications mandatenovel algorithmic solutions that are both time-and space-efficient (to manage high-speeddata streams); and also communication-efficient (to deal with physical data distribution). Inthis paper; we consider the problem of complex query answering over distributed; high-dimensional data streams in the sliding-window model.

Extended wavelets for multiple measures,Antonios Deligiannakis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract While work in recent years has demonstrated that wavelets can be efficiently usedto compress large quantities of data and provide fast and fairly accurate answers to queries;little emphasis has been placed on using wavelets in approximating datasets containingmultiple measures. Existing decomposition approaches will either operate on each measureindividually; or treat all measures as a vector of values and process them simultaneously.We show in this paper that the resulting individual or combined storage approaches for thewavelet coefficients of different measures that stem from these existing algorithms may leadto suboptimal storage utilization; which results to reduced accuracy to queries. To alleviatethis problem; we introduce in this work the notion of an extended wavelet coefficient as aflexible storage method for the wavelet coefficients; and propose novel algorithms for …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,64
Prediction-based geometric monitoring over distributed data streams,Nikos Giatrakos; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis; Izchak Sharfman; Assaf Schuster,Abstract Many modern streaming applications; such as online analysis of financial; network;sensor and other forms of data are inherently distributed in nature. An important query typethat is the focal point in such application scenarios regards actuation queries; where properaction is dictated based on a trigger condition placed upon the current value that amonitored function receives. Recent work studies the problem of (non-linear) sophisticatedfunction tracking in a distributed manner. The main concept behind the geometric monitoringapproach proposed there; is for each distributed site to perform the function monitoring overan appropriate subset of the input domain. In the current work; we examine whether thedistributed monitoring mechanism can become more efficient; in terms of the number ofcommunicated messages; by extending the geometric monitoring framework to utilize …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,56
Processing approximate aggregate queries in wireless sensor networks,Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract In-network data aggregation has been recently proposed as an effective means toreduce the number of messages exchanged in wireless sensor networks. Nodes of thenetwork form an aggregation tree; in which parent nodes aggregate the values receivedfrom their children and propagate the result to their own parents. However; this schemaprovides little flexibility for the end-user to control the operation of the nodes in a datasensitive manner. For large sensor networks with severe energy constraints; the reduction(in the number of messages exchanged) obtained through the aggregation tree might not besufficient. In this paper; we present new algorithms for obtaining approximate aggregatestatistics from large sensor networks. The user specifies the maximum error that he is willingto tolerate and; in turn; our algorithms program the nodes in a way that seeks to minimize …,Information Systems,2006,54
Hierarchical dwarfs for the rollup cube,Yannis Sismanis; Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract The data cube operator exemplifies two of the most important aspects of OLAPqueries: aggregation and dimension hierarchies. In earlier work we presented Dwarf; ahighly compressed and clustered structure for creating; storing and indexing data cubes.Dwarf is a complete architecture that supports queries and updates; while also including atunable granularity parameter that controls the amount of materialization performed.However; it does not directly support dimension hierarchies. Rollup and drilldown querieson dimension hierarchies that naturally arise in OLAP need to be handled externally andare; thus; very costly. In this paper we present extensions to the Dwarf architecture forincorporating rollup data cubes; ie cubes with hierarchical dimensions. We show that theextended Hierarchical Dwarf retains all its advantages both in terms of creation time and …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2003,54
Detecting outliers in sensor networks using the geometric approach,Sabbas Burdakis; Antonios Deligiannakis,The topic of outlier detection in sensor networks has received significant attention in recentyears. Detecting when the measurements of a node become" abnormal''is interesting;because this event may help detect either a malfunctioning node; or a node that startsobserving a local interesting phenomenon (ie; a fire). In this paper we present a newalgorithm for detecting outliers in sensor networks; based on the geometric approach. Unlikeprior work. our algorithms perform a distributed monitoring of outlier readings; exhibit 100%accuracy in their monitoring (assuming no message losses); and require the transmission ofmessages only at a fraction of the epochs; thus allowing nodes to safely refrain fromtransmitting in many epochs. Our approach is based on transforming common similaritymetrics in a way that admits the application of the recently proposed geometric approach …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,52

This vast amount ofinformation that is either digitized or born-digital needs to be collected; organized andpreserved in a way that ensures that our digital assets and the information they carry remainavailable for future use. Digital curation has emerged as a new inter-disciplinary practicethat seeks to set guidelines for disciplined management of information. In this paper wereview two recent models for digital curation introduced by the Digital Curation Centre(DCC) and the Digital Curation Unit (DCU) of the Athena Research Centre.

Another outlier bites the dust: Computing meaningful aggregates in sensor networks,Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Vasilis Vassalos; Vassilis Stoumpos; Alex Delis,Recent work has demonstrated that readings provided by commodity sensor nodes are oftenof poor quality. In order to provide a valuable sensory infrastructure for monitoringapplications; we first need to devise techniques that can withstand" dirty" and unreliable dataduring query processing. In this paper we present a novel aggregation framework thatdetects suspicious measurements by outlier nodes and refrains from incorporating suchmeasurements in the computed aggregate values. We consider different definitions of anoutlier node; based on the notion of a user-specified minimum support; and discusstechniques for properly routing messages in the networkin order to reduce the bandwidthconsumption and the energy drain during the query evaluation.

Geometric monitoring of heterogeneous streams,Daniel Keren; Guy Sagy; Amir Abboud; David Ben-David; Assaf Schuster; Izchak Sharfman; Antonios Deligiannakis,Interest in stream monitoring is shifting toward the distributed case. In many applications thedata is high volume; dynamic; and distributed; making it infeasible to collect the distinctstreams to a central node for processing. Often; the monitoring problem consists ofdetermining whether the value of a global function; defined on the union of all streams;crossed a certain threshold. We wish to reduce communication by transforming the globalmonitoring to the testing of local constraints; checked independently at the nodes. Geometricmonitoring (GM) proved useful for constructing such local constraints for general functions.Alas; in GM the constraints at all nodes share an identical structure and are thus unsuitablefor handling heterogeneous streams. Therefore; we propose a general approach formonitoring heterogeneous streams (HGM); which defines constraints tailored to fit the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,31
Extended wavelets for multiple measures,Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Haar waveletdecomposition as a tool for reducing large amounts of data down to compact waveletsynopses that can be used to obtain fast; accurate approximate answers to user queries.Although originally designed for minimizing the overall mean-squared (ie; L 2-norm) error inthe data approximation; recently proposed methods also enable the use of Haar wavelets inminimizing other error metrics; such as the relative error in data value reconstruction; whichis arguably the most important for approximate query answers. Relatively little attention;however; has been paid to the problem of using wavelet synopses as an approximate queryanswering tool over complex tabular datasets containing multiple measures; such as thosetypically found in real-life OLAP applications.

Dissemination of compressed historical information in sensor networks,Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract Sensor nodes are small devices that “measure” their environment andcommunicate feeds of low-level data values to a base station for further processing andarchiving. Dissemination of these multi-valued feeds is challenging because of the limitedresources (processing; bandwidth; energy) available in the nodes of the network. In thispaper; we first describe the SBR algorithm for compressing multi-valued feeds containinghistorical data from each sensor. The key to our technique is the base signal; a series ofvalues extracted from the real measurements that is used to provide piece-wiseapproximation of the measurements. While our basic technique exploits correlations amongmeasurements taken on a single node; we further show how it can be adapted to exploitcorrelations among multiple nodes in a localized setting.

Lightweight authentication of linear algebraic queries on data streams,Stavros Papadopoulos; Graham Cormode; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract We consider a stream outsourcing setting; where a data owner delegates themanagement of a set of disjoint data streams to an untrusted server. The ownerauthenticates his streams via signatures. The server processes continuous queries on theunion of the streams for clients trusted by the owner. Along with the results; the server sendsproofs of result correctness derived from the owner's signatures; which are easily verifiableby the clients. We design novel constructions for a collection of fundamental problems overstreams represented as linear algebraic queries. In particular; our basic schemesauthenticate dynamic vector sums and dot products; as well as dynamic matrix products.These techniques can be adapted for authenticating a wide range of important operations instreaming environments; including group by queries; joins; in-network aggregation …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,26
Semi-streamed index join for near-real time execution of ETL transformations,Mihaela A Bornea; Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Vasilis Vassalos,Active data warehouses have emerged as a new business intelligence paradigm wheredata in the integrated repository is refreshed in near real-time. This shift of practicesachieves higher consistency between the stored information and the latest updates; which inturn influences crucially the output of decision making processes. In this paper we focus onthe changes required in the implementation of Extract Transform Load (ETL) operationswhich now need to be executed in an online fashion. In particular; the ETL transformationsfrequently include the join between an incoming stream of updates and a disk-resident tableof historical data or metadata. In this context we propose a novel Semi-Streaming Index Join(SSIJ) algorithm that maximizes the throughput of the join by buffering stream tuples andthen judiciously selecting how to best amortize expensive disk seeks for blocks of the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,26

Optimizing query shortcuts in RDF databases,Vicky Dritsou; Panos Constantopoulos; Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract The emergence of the Semantic Web has led to the creation of large semanticknowledge bases; often in the form of RDF databases. Improving the performance of RDFdatabases necessitates the development of specialized data management techniques; suchas the use of shortcuts in the place of path queries. In this paper we deal with the problem ofselecting the most beneficial shortcuts that reduce the execution cost of path queries in RDFdatabases given a space constraint. We first demonstrate that this problem is an instance ofthe quadratic knapsack problem. Given the computational complexity of solving suchproblems; we then develop an alternative formulation based on a bi-criterion linearrelaxation; which essentially seeks to minimize a weighted sum of the query cost and of therequired space consumption. As we demonstrate in this paper; this relaxation leads to …,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2011,25

Probabilistic histograms for probabilistic data,Graham Cormode; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis; Andrew McGregor,Abstract There is a growing realization that modern database management systems(DBMSs) must be able to manage data that contains uncertainties that are represented inthe form of probabilistic relations.

Practical private range search revisited,Ioannis Demertzis; Stavros Papadopoulos; Odysseas Papapetrou; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract We consider a data owner that outsources its dataset to an untrusted server. Theowner wishes to enable the server to answer range queries on a single attribute; withoutcompromising the privacy of the data and the queries. There are several schemes on"practical" private range search (mainly in Databases venues) that attempt to strike a trade-offbetween efficiency and security. Nevertheless; these methods either lack provable securityguarantees; or permit unacceptable privacy leakages. In this paper; we take aninterdisciplinary approach; which combines the rigor of Security formulations and proofs withefficient Data Management techniques. We construct a wide set of novel schemes withrealistic security/performance trade-offs; adopting the notion of Searchable SymmetricEncryption (SSE) primarily proposed for keyword search.

Hierarchically compressed wavelet synopses,Dimitris Sacharidis; Antonios Deligiannakis; Timos Sellis,Abstract The wavelet decomposition is a proven tool for constructing concise synopses oflarge data sets that can be used to obtain fast approximate answers. Existing researchstudies focus on selecting an optimal set of wavelet coefficients to store so as to minimizesome error metric; without however seeking to reduce the size of the wavelet coefficientsthemselves. In many real data sets the existence of large spikes in the data values results inmany large coefficient values lying on paths of a conceptual tree structure known as theerror tree. To exploit this fact; we introduce in this paper a novel compression scheme forwavelet synopses; termed hierarchically compressed wavelet synopses; that fully exploitshierarchical relationships among coefficients in order to reduce their storage.

Thus; reducing energy drain is of utmostimportance when designing algorithms and applications for such networks. Aggregatequeries are often used by monitoring applications to assess the status of the network anddetect abnormal behavior. Since radio transmission often constitutes the biggest factor ofenergy drain in a node; in this paper we propose novel algorithms for the evaluation ofbandwidth-constrained queries over sensor networks.

In such tasks the state of thenetwork is evaluated either at regular intervals at a base-station; which constitutes acentralized location where the data collected by the sensor nodes can be collected andprocessed; or continuously through the use of; potentially multiple; continuous queries. Inorder to increase the network lifetime; multiple techniques have been proposed in order toreduce the data transmitted in the network; since the data communication often constitutesthe main source of energy drain in sensor networks.

Issues in complex event processing systems,Ioannis Flouris; Nikos Giatrakos; Minos Garofalakis; Antonios Deligiannakis,Many Big Data technologies were built to enable the processing of human generated data;setting aside the enormous amount of data generated from Machine-to-Machine (M2M)interactions. M2M interactions create real-time data streams that are much more structured;often in the form of series of event occurrences. In this paper; we provide an overview on themain research issues confronted by existing Complex Event Processing (CEP) techniques;as a starting point for Big Data applications that enable the monitoring of complex eventoccurrences in M2M interactions.,Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA; 2015 IEEE,2015,5

Towards Flexible Event Processing in Distributed Data Streams.,Sebastian Bothe; Vasiliki Manikaki; Antonios Deligiannakis; Michael Mock,ABSTRACT The FERARI project aims to develop a highly scalable distributed streamingarchitecture supporting complex event processing in a communication-efficient manner. Twokey requirements for our system are that its architecture is not tied to the underlyingstreaming platform used in its implementation and that it allows the easy definition ofcommunication-efficient methods for monitoring a global condition over a distributed set ofstates. In this paper we present the architecture of our system and explain how these keyrequirements are met. Concerning the actual implementation of our system in a scalabledistributed streaming platform; it is reasonable not to re-invent the wheel but to use one ofthe actual Big Data Streaming platforms as a starting point. For this reason; we evaluatesome popular platforms and discuss whether they meet our requirements.,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2015,4
Shortcut selection in RDF databases,Vicky Dritsou; Panos Constantopoulos; Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis,An increasing amount of data produced nowadays is in RDF format. While significant workhas been performed on view selection and query optimization algorithms in relationaldatabase systems; little attention has been paid to the problem of optimizing theperformance of query workloads in RDF databases. In this paper we propose the notion ofshortcuts; as a method for reducing the query processing cost. We then devise a greedyalgorithm that; given a space constraint and a query workload in an RDF database; seeks toselect the optimal shortcuts to materialize. Our experiments validate our approach anddemonstrate that our algorithm manages to significantly reduce the query processing costwhile keeping space requirements low.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,4
Scalable approximate query tracking over highly distributed data streams,Nikos Giatrakos; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract The recently-proposed Geometric Monitoring (GM) method has provided a generaltool for the distributed monitoring of arbitrary non-linear queries over streaming dataobserved by a collection of remote sites; with numerous practical applications. Unfortunately;GM-based techniques can suffer from serious scalability issues with increasing numbers ofremote sites. In this paper; we propose novel techniques that effectively tackle theaforementioned scalability problems by exploiting a carefully designed sample of the remotesites for efficient approximate query tracking. Our novel sampling-based scheme utilizes asample of cardinality proportional to√ N (compared to N for the original GM); where $ N $ isthe number of sites in the network; to perform the monitoring process.

Collection trees for event-monitoring queries,Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Vassilis Stoumpos; Alex Delis,Abstract In this paper we present algorithms for building and maintaining efficient collectiontrees that provide the conduit to disseminate data required for processing monitoring queriesin a wireless sensor network. While prior techniques base their operation on the assumptionthat the sensor nodes that collect data relevant to a specified query need to include theirmeasurements in the query result at every query epoch; in many event monitoringapplications such an assumption is not valid. We introduce and formalize the notion of eventmonitoring queries and demonstrate that they can capture a large class of monitoringapplications. We then show techniques which; using a small set of intuitive statistics; cancompute collection trees that minimize important resources such as the number of messagesexchanged among the nodes or the overall energy consumption.

Compressed data acquisition from water tanks,Sabbas Burdakis; Antonios Inglezakis; Antonios Deligiannakis,Abstract The Aquanet project builds a low-cost monitoring system for the water resources inthe city of Chania in Greece. This monitoring process is performed by installing sensornodes at distribution tanks and periodically transmitting measurements regarding the waterlevel to a remote base station. In this paper we present the data management aspects of thisnetwork; focusing on how the transmitted data is compressed in order to minimize theenergy consumption and how information concerning the water level at the distribution tankscan be used to derive a water management policy in the network.,Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems for Smart Water Networks,2015,2
Detecting proximity events in sensor networks,Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Sensor networks are often used to perform monitoring tasks; such as animal andvehicle tracking; or the surveillance of enemy forces in military applications. In this paper weintroduce the concept of proximity queries; which allow us to report interesting events;observed by nodes in the network that lie within a certain distance from each other. An eventis triggered when a user-programmable predicate is satisfied on a sensor node. We studythe problem of computing proximity queries in sensor networks and propose severalalternative techniques that differ in the number of messages exchanged by the nodes andthe quality of the returned answers. Our solutions utilize a distributed routing index;maintained by the nodes in the network; that is dynamically updated as new observationsare obtained by the nodes. This distributed index allows us to efficiently process multiple …,Information Systems,2011,2

Events report on state changes of asystem and its environment. Complex Event Recognition (CER) in turn; refers to theidentification of complex/composite events of interest; which are collections of simple eventsthat satisfy some pattern; thereby providing the opportunity for reactive and proactivemeasures. Examples include the recognition of attacks in computer network nodes; humanactivities on video content; emerging stories and trends on the Social Web; traffic andtransport incidents in smart cities; fraud in electronic marketplaces; cardiac arrhythmias; andepidemic spread.

Spatial cohesion queries,Dimitris Sacharidis; Antonios Deligiannakis,Abstract Given a set of attractors and repellers; the cohesion query returns the point indatabase that is as close to the attractors and as far from the repellers as possible. Cohesionqueries find applications in various settings; such as facility location problems; location-based services. For example; when attractors represent favorable plases; eg; touristattractions; and repellers denote undesirable locations; eg; competitor stores; the cohesionquery would return the ideal location; among a database of possible options; to open a newstore. These queries are not trivial to process as the best location; unlike aggregate nearestor farthest neighbor queries; may be far from the optimal point in space. Therefore; toachieve sub-linear performance in practice; we employ novel best-first search and branchand bound paradigms that take advantage of the geometrical interpretation of the …,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,1

Monitoring distributed; heterogeneous data streams: The emergence of safe zones,Daniel Keren; Guy Sagy; Amir Abboud; David Ben-David; Assaf Schuster; Izchak Sharfman; Antonios Deligiannakis,Abstract In many emerging applications; the data to be monitored is of very high volume;dynamic; and distributed; making it infeasible to collect the distinct data streams to a centralnode and process them there. Often; the monitoring problem consists of determiningwhether the value of a global function; which depends on the union of all streams; crossed acertain threshold. A great deal of effort is directed at reducing communication overhead bytransforming the monitoring of the global function to the testing of local constraints; checkedindependently at the nodes. Recently; geometric monitoring (GM) proved to be very usefulfor constructing such local constraints for general (non-linear; non-monotonic) functions.Alas; in all current variants of geometric monitoring; the constraints at all nodes share anidentical structure and are; thus; unsuitable for handling heterogeneous streams; which …,International Conference on Applied Algorithms,2014,1

Specifically; a network of amplify-and-forward (AF) relays is studied and the GMmethod is appropriately adapted.

Discovering Attractive Products based on Influence Sets,Anastasios Arvanitis; Antonios Deligiannakis,Abstract: Skyline queries have been widely used as a practical tool for multi-criteria decisionanalysis and for applications involving preference queries. For example; in a typical onlineretail application; skyline queries can help customers select the most interesting; among apool of available; products. Recently; reverse skyline queries have been proposed;highlighting the manufacturer's perspective; ie how to determine the expected buyers of agiven product. In this work we develop novel algorithms for two important classes of queriesinvolving customer preferences. We first propose a novel algorithm; termed as RSA; foranswering reverse skyline queries. We then introduce a new type of queries; namely the k-Most Attractive Candidates k-MAC query.

Practical Private Range Search In Depth,IOANNIS DEMERTZIS; STAVROS PAPADOPOULOS; ODYSSEAS PAPAPETROU; ANTONIOS DELIGIANNAKIS; MINOS GAROFALAKIS; CHARALAMPOS PAPAMANTHOU,We focus on a setting with two parties; a data owner and a server. The owner outsources itsdataset to the server; and gives the latter the authority to answer range queries on a singleattribute. The server is untrusted; and the goal is to protect the privacy of the dataset and thequeries. The owner encrypts its data prior to sending them to the server. The challenge liesin enabling the server to process the owner's queries directly on the encrypted data; whileachieving performance and costs close to the non-private case. The benefits of dataoutsourcing and the importance of privacy have been stressed in numerous earlier works(eg;[18; 59; 62; 66]). Prior work.

Accurate Data Approximation in Constrained Environments,Antonios Deligiannakis,Several data reduction techniques have been proposed recently as methods for providingfast and fairly accurate answers to complex queries over large quantities of data. Their usehas been widespread; due to the multiple benefits that they may offer in several constrainedenvironments and applications. Compressed data representations require less space tostore; less bandwidth to communicate and can provide; due to their size; very fast responsetimes to queries. Sensor networks represent a typical constrained environment; due to thelimited processing; storage and battery capabilities of the sensor nodes. Large-scale sensornetworks require tight data handling and data dissemination techniques. Transmitting a full-resolution data feed from each sensor back to the base-station is often prohibitive due to (i)limited bandwidth that may not be sufficient to sustain a continuous feed from all sensors …,*,2005,*
