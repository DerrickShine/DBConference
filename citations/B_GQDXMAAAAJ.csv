A vision for management of complex models,Phillip A Bernstein; Alon Y Halevy; Rachel A Pottinger,Abstract Many problems encountered when building applications of database systemsinvolve the manipulation of models. By" model;" we mean a complex structure thatrepresents a design artifact; such as a relational schema; object-oriented interface; UMLmodel; XML DTD; web-site schema; semantic network; complex document; or softwareconfiguration. Many uses of models involve managing changes in models andtransformations of data from one model into another. These uses require an explicitrepresentation of" mappings" between models. We propose to make database systemseasier to use for these applications by making" model" and" model mapping" first-classobjects with special operations that simplify their use. We call this capability modelmanagement. In addition to making the case for model management; our main …,ACM Sigmod Record,2000,413
MiniCon: A scalable algorithm for answering queries using views,Rachel Pottinger; Alon Halevy,Abstract. The problem of answering queries using views is to find efficient methods ofanswering a query using a set of previously materialized views over the database; ratherthan accessing the database relations. The problem has received significant attentionbecause of its relevance to a wide variety of data management problems; such as dataintegration; query optimization; and the maintenance of physical data independence. Todate; the performance of proposed algorithms has received very little attention; and inparticular; their scale up in the presence of a large number of views is unknown. We firstanalyze two previous algorithms; the bucket algorithm and the inverse-rules; and show theirdeficiencies. We then describe the MiniCon; a novel algorithm for finding the maximally-contained rewriting of a conjunctive query using a set of conjunctive views. We present …,The VLDB Journal,2001,411
-Merging Models Based on Given Correspondences,Rachel A Pottinger; Philip A Bernstein,This chapter defines the Merge operator for model merging; both generically and for aspecific meta-meta-model; Vanilla. It defines and classifies the conflicts that arise incombining two models and describes when conflicts from different classes must be resolved.Resolution strategies for conflicts that must be resolved in Merge; both for Vanilla and ingeneral are presented. The chapter evaluates Merge by showing how Merge in Vanilla canbe used to subsume some previous merging algorithms and by testing Merge on two largereal-world ontologies. The chapter envisions several future directions. The first involvesshowing that the Merge result; when applied to models and mappings that are templates forinstances; has an appropriate interpretation on instances. This will demonstrate theusefulness of Merge in specific applications such as data integration and view integration …,*,2003,354

HePToX: marrying XML and heterogeneity in your P2P databases,Angela Bonifati; Elaine Qing Chang; Aks VS Lakshmanan; Terence Ho; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract We present HePToX; a full-fledged peer-to-peer database system that efficientlyhandles XML data heterogeneity. In a highly dynamic P2P network; it is unrealistic for a peerentering the network to be forced to agree on a global mediated schema; or to performheavy-weight operations for mapping its schema to neighboring schemas. In our demo; weshow that to enter the HePToX network a peer user is only asked to draw a simple set ofvisual annotations to a few other schemas. We show how the mapping rules are thenautomatically generated and how efficient query translation is performed on top of thesemappings.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,92
Semi-automatic web service composition for the life sciences using the BioMoby semantic web framework,Michael DiBernardo; Rachel Pottinger; Mark Wilkinson,Abstract Researchers in the life-sciences are currently limited to small-scale informaticsexperiments and analyses because of the lack of interoperability among life-sciences webservices. This limitation can be addressed by annotating services and their interfaces withsemantic information; so that interoperability problems can be reasoned aboutprogrammatically. The Moby semantic web framework is a popular and mature platform thatis used for this purpose. However; the number of services that are available to select fromwhen building a workflow is becoming unmanageable for users. As such; attempts havebeen made to assist with service selection and composition. These tasks fall under thegeneral label of automated service composition. We present a prototype workflow assemblyclient that reduces the number of choices that users have to make by (1) restricting the …,Journal of biomedical informatics,2008,70
Schema merging and mapping creation for relational sources,Rachel Pottinger; Philip A Bernstein,Abstract We address the problem of generating a mediated schema from a set of relationaldata source schemas and conjunctive queries that specify where those schemas overlap.Unlike past approaches that generate only the mediated schema; our algorithm alsogenerates view definitions; ie; source-to-mediated schema mappings. Our main goal is tounderstand the requirements that a mediated schema and views should satisfy; such ascompleteness; preservation of overlapping information; normalization; and minimality. Weshow how these requirements influence the detailed structure of schemas and viewdefinitions that are produced. We introduce a normal form for mediated schemas and viewdefinitions; show how to generate them; and prove that schemas and views in this normalform satisfy our requirements.,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,68
Querying a building information model for construction-specific spatial information,Madhav Prasad Nepal; Sheryl Staub-French; Rachel Pottinger; April Webster,Abstract The design and construction community has shown increasing interest in adoptingbuilding information models (BIMs). The richness of information provided by BIMs has thepotential to streamline the design and construction processes by enabling enhancedcommunication; coordination; automation and analysis. However; there are manychallenges in extracting construction-specific information out of BIMs. In most cases;construction practitioners have to manually identify the required information; which isinefficient and prone to error; particularly for complex; large-scale projects. This paperdescribes the process and methods we have formalized to partially automate the extractionand querying of construction-specific information from a BIM.

Schema mapping and query translation in heterogeneous P2P XML databases,Angela Bonifati; Elaine Chang; Terence Ho; Laks V Lakshmanan; Rachel Pottinger; Yongik Chung,Abstract Peers in a peer-to-peer data management system often have heterogeneousschemas and no mediated global schema. To translate queries across peers; we assumeeach peer provides correspondences between its schema and a small number of other peerschemas. We focus on query reformulation in the presence of heterogeneous XML schemas;including data---metadata conflicts. We develop an algorithm for inferring precise mappingrules from informal schema correspondences. We define the semantics of query answeringin this setting and develop query translation algorithm. Our translation handles anexpressive fragment of XQuery and works both along and against the direction of mappingrules. We describe the HePToX heterogeneous P2P XML data management system whichincorporates our results. We report the results of extensive experiments on HePToX on …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,49
Ontology-based feature modeling for construction information extraction from a building information model,Madhav Prasad Nepal; Sheryl Staub-French; Rachel Pottinger; Jiemin Zhang,Abstract A building information model (BIM) provides a rich representation of a building'sdesign. However; there are many challenges in receiving construction-specific informationfrom a BIM; limiting the usability of BIMs for construction and other downstream processes.This paper describes a novel approach that utilizes ontology-based feature modeling;automatic feature extraction based on a well-established AEC XML standard schema; andquery processing to extract information relevant to construction practitioners from a givenBIM. The feature ontology generically represents construction-specific information that isuseful for a broad range of construction management functions. The software prototype usesthe ontology to transform the designer-focused BIM into a construction-specific feature-based model (FBM). The formal query methods operate on the FBM to further help …,Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering,2012,42
Creating a mediated schema based on initial correspondences,Rachel Pottinger; Philip A.  Bernstein,Video Place; a company that sells videos through its website; has entered a partnership withMovie Reviews; a website that lists movie facts and reviews. Video Place and MovieReviews wish to set up a data integration system to allow both databases to be accessed atonce. Much schema level work is required to do this: a mediated schema must bedeveloped; mappings must be created between the source schemas and the mediatedschema; and a mechanism must be provided for translating queries over the mediatedschema into queries over source schemas. In addition; if Video Place and Movie Reviewswant to change their previous queries to retrieve data from both sources; queries must betranslated from the source schemas to the mediated schema. First; we must create themediated schema. We can reduce the problem of creating the mediated schema to three …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2002,26
Creating flexible mappings between Building Information Models and cost information,Michael Lawrence; Rachel Pottinger; Sheryl Staub-French; Madhav Prasad Nepal,Abstract During the early design stages of construction projects; accurate and timely costfeedback is critical to design decision making. This is particularly challenging for costestimators; as they must quickly and accurately estimate the cost of the building when thedesign is still incomplete and evolving. State-of-the-art software tools typically use a rule-based approach to generate detailed quantities from the design details present in a buildingmodel and relate them to the cost items in a cost estimating database. In this paper; wepropose a generic approach for creating and maintaining a cost estimate using flexiblemappings between a building model and a cost estimate. The approach uses queries on thebuilding design that are used to populate views; and each view is then associated with oneor more cost items. The benefit of this approach is that the flexibility of modern query …,Automation in Construction,2014,23
Challenges in precisely aligning models of human anatomy using generic schema matching,Peter Mork; Philip A.

We summarize the generic schema matchingalgorithms we used to identify correspondences. We present sample results that highlightthe similarities and differences between the FMA and the CRM. We also identify uses ofaggregation; transitivity; and reification; for which generic schema matching fails to producean accurate mapping and present manually constructed solutions for them.,Medinfo 2004: Proceedings of the 11th World Congress on Medical Informatics,2004,23
Comparative visualization of construction schedules,Melanie Tory; Sheryl Staub-French; Dandan Huang; Yu-Ling Chang; Colin Swindells; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract Managing change in project schedules is a complex problem in constructionmanagement. To effectively manage; analyze; and revise schedules; planners need toidentify when and how activities and constraints can be changed; develop various schedulealternatives; and determine the effect of changes on related activities. Existing software toolsenable users to generate and visualize a schedule from a list of activities and time-basedconstraints; and to show multiple bars for an activity to reflect different versions of aschedule. However; there is little visual support for interacting with schedules; and forexploring and comparing alternative versions of a schedule. We present a schedulevisualization tool called TASM (Tool for Advanced Schedule Management) that addressesthese limitations.

Schema repository for database schema evolution,Hassina Bounif; Rachel Pottinger,The paper presents a schema repository; an original repository containing different kinds ofdatabase schemas. The repository is part of a multidisciplinary approach for schemaevolution called the predictive approach for database evolution. The schema repository hasa dual role in the approach:(1) During the data-mining process; the repository identifies andanalyzes trends on collected schemas belonging to the same domain.(2) The repository isused in the building of the requirements ontology-a domain ontology that contributes in thedatabase design and its evolution.

The conceptual integration modeling framework: Abstracting from the multidimensional model,Flavio Rizzolo; Iluju Kiringa; Rachel Pottinger; Kwok Wong,Abstract: Data warehouses are overwhelmingly built through a bottom-up process; whichstarts with the identification of sources; continues with the extraction and transformation ofdata from these sources; and then loads the data into a set of data marts according todesired multidimensional relational schemas. End user business intelligence tools areadded on top of the materialized multidimensional schemas to drive decision making in anorganization. Unfortunately; this bottom-up approach is costly both in terms of the skilledusers needed and the sheer size of the warehouses. This paper proposes a top-downframework in which data warehousing is driven by a conceptual model. The frameworkoffers both design time and run time environments. At design time; a business user first usesthe conceptual modeling language as a multidimensional object model to specify what …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1009.0255,2010,15
Semap: a generic mapping construction system,Ting Wang; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract Most previous schema mapping works focus on creating mappings in specific datamodels for data transformation; failing to capture a richer set of possible relationshipsbetween schema elements. For example; most schema matching approaches mightdiscover that'TA'in one schema equals' grad TA'in another one; even though the relationshipcan be modeled more accurately by saying that'grad TA'is a specialization of'TA'. Deepeningthe mapping semantics in turn allow richer application semantics. This paper presents andproves the effectiveness of SeMap; a system that constructs a complex; semantically richermapping (including'Has-a';'Is-a';'Associates' and'Equivalent'relationship types) that can beused across data models. We achieve this goal by:(1) exploiting semantic evidence forpossible matches;(2) finding a globally optimal match assignment;(3) identifying the …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,14
Deriving construction features from an IFC model,Madhav Prasad Nepal; Sheryl Staub-French; Jiemin Zhang; Michael Lawrence; Rachel Pottinger,In recent years; there has been a growing interest from the design and constructioncommunity to adopt Building Information Models (BIM). BIM provides semantically-richinformation models that explicitly represent both 3D geometric information (eg; componentdimensions); along with non-geometric properties (eg; material properties). While therichness of design information offered by BIM is evident; there are still tremendouschallenges in getting construction-specific information out of BIM; limiting the usability ofthese models for construction. In this paper; we describe our approach for extractingconstruction-specific design conditions from a BIM model based on user-defined queries.This approach leverages an ontology of features we are developing to formalize the designconditions that affect construction.

Visualization techniques for schedule comparison,Dandan Huang; Melanie Tory; Sheryl Staub‐French; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract Project schedules are effectively represented by Gantt charts; but comparingmultiple versions of a schedule is difficult. To compare versions with current methods; usersmust search and navigate through multiple large documents; making it difficult to identifydifferences. We present two novel visualization techniques to support the comparison ofGantt charts. First; we encode two Gantt charts in one view by overlapping them to showdifferences. Second; we designed an interactive visual technique; the 'TbarView'; that allowsusers to compare multiple schedules within one single view. We evaluated the overlap andTbarView techniques via a user study. The study results showed that our design provided aquick overview of the variances among two or more schedules; and the techniques alsoimproved efficiency by minimizing view switching.

While the richness of design information offered by BIM is evident;there are still tremendous challenges in getting construction-specific information out of BIM;particularly from IFC-based product models.

Improving the usability of standard schemas,Jiemin Zhang; April Webster; Michael Lawrence; Madhav Nepal; Rachel Pottinger; Sheryl Staub-French; Melanie Tory,Abstract Due to the development of XML and other data models such as OWL and RDF;sharing data is an increasingly common task since these data models allow simple syntactictranslation of data between applications. However; in order for data to be sharedsemantically; there must be a way to ensure that concepts are the same. One approach is toemploy commonly usedschemas—called standard schemas—which help guarantee thatsyntactically identical objects have semantically similar meanings. As a result of the spreadof data sharing; there has been widespread adoption of standard schemas in a broad rangeof disciplines and for a wide variety of applications within a very short period of time.However; standard schemas are still in their infancy and have not yet matured or beenthoroughly evaluated. It is imperative that the data management research community …,Information Systems,2011,10

Processing queries and merging schemas in support of data integration,Rachel Amanda Pottinger; Philip A Bernstein; Alon Y Halevy,In Chapter 1; we motivated the problem of answering queries using views as a method forreformulating queries asked in a Local-As-View (LAV) data integration system. In thischapter; we assume that a data integration system has been set up using LAV as themapping language between the mediated schema and the data sources; and focus on howto translate user queries into queries over the data sources using a technique calledanswering queries using views (aka rewriting queries using views). We defined answeringqueries using views in Chapter 2; both for finding equivalent rewritings (Definition 2.4) inquery optimization of physical data independence and for data integration where the goal isto find maximally-contained rewritings (Definition 2.8).

Integrating domain heterogeneous data sources using decomposition aggregation queries,Jian Xu; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract The decomposition aggregation query (DAQ) we introduce in this paper extendssemantic integration queries by allowing query translation to create aggregate queriesbased on the DAQ's novel three role structure. We describe the application of DAQs inintegrating domain heterogeneous data sources; the new semantics of DAQ answers andthe query translation algorithm called “aggregation rewriting”. A central problem ofoptimizing DAQ processing requires determining the data sources towards which the DAQ istranslated. Our source selection algorithm has cover-finding and partitioning steps which areoptimized to 1. lower the processing overhead while speeding up query answering and 2.eliminate duplicates with minimal overhead.

Data coordination: supporting contingent updates,Michael Lawrence; Rachel Pottinger; Sheryl Staub-French,ABSTRACT In many scenarios; a contingent data source may benefit by coordinating withexternal heterogeneous sources upon which it depends. The administrator of this contingentsource needs to update it when changes are made to the external base sources. Forexample; when a building design is updated; the contractor's cost estimate must be updated;too. The goal of data coordination is to update a contingent source; C; based on changes toan independently maintained base source; B. This paper introduces a data coordinationsystem which allows C to coordinate its data without imposing significant requirements on B.Our system uses declarative mappings between B and C and performs coordination in twostages View Differencing—finding changes to an intermediate view of B based on itsmapping to C; and Update Translation—translating the view differencing result into …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,8
Requirements ontology and multi-representation strategy for database schema evolution,Hassina Bounif; Stefano Spaccapietra; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract With the emergence of enterprise-wide information systems; ontologies havebecome by definition a valuable aid for efficient database schema modeling and integration;in addition to their use in other disciplines such as the semantic web and natural languageprocessing. This paper presents another important utilization of ontologies in databaseschemas: schema evolution. Specifically; our research concentrates on a new three-layeredapproach for schema evolution. These three layers are 1) a schema repository; 2) a domainontology called a requirements ontology; and 3) a multi-representation strategy to enablepowerful change management. This a priori approach for schema evolution; in contrast withexisting a posteriori solutions; can be employed for any data model and for both 1) designfrom scratch and evolution and 2) redesign and evolution of the database.

Evaluating the alignment of organizational and project contexts for BIM adoption: a case study of a large owner organization,Hasan Burak Cavka; Sheryl Staub-French; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract Building information modeling (BIM) has been presented as a potential solution tocurrent facilities management problems related to information exchange during handover;and facilities information management during operations. However; implementing BIM in anowner organization is a complex challenge that necessitates reconfiguration of workpractices and internal structures to fully realize the benefits. Owners are often unsure abouthow or whether they should go through the challenges related to implementation. Althoughprevious studies have documented the potential benefits of BIM adoption for owners; suchas improvements in work order processing; very little research has specifically looked at thetransition to BIM and the scale of the effort required for large and diverse ownerorganizations.

Associativity and commutativity in generic merge,Rachel Pottinger; Philip A Bernstein,Abstract A model is a formal description of a complex application artifact; such as a databaseschema; an application interface; a UML model; an ontology; or a message format. Theproblem of merging such models lies at the core of many meta data applications; such asview integration; mediated schema creation for data integration; and ontology merging. Thispaper examines the problem of merging two models given correspondences between them.In particular it concentrates on the associativity and commutativity of Merge; which arecrucial properties if Merge is to be composed with other operators.,*,2009,4
Optimizing acquaintance selection in a PDMS,Jian Xu; Rachel Pottinger,In a Peer Data Management System (PDMS); autonomous peers share semantically richdata. For queries to be translated across peers; a peer must provide a mapping to otherpeers in the PDMS; peers connected by such mappings are called acquaintances. Tomaximize PDMS query answering performance; a peer needs to optimize its choice ofacquaintances. This paper investigates the acquaintance selection problem and introducesa novel framework for performing this acquaintance selection. Our framework includes twoselection schemes that effectively and efficiently estimate mapping effectiveness. The" one-shot" scheme clusters peers and estimates the improvement in query answering based oncluster properties. The" two-hop" scheme estimates using locally available information atmultiple rounds. Our empirical study shows that both schemes effectively help …,International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems,2011,3

Information quality assessment for facility management,Puyan A Zadeh; Guan Wang; Hasan B Cavka; Sheryl Staub-French; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract Assessing the quality of building information models (BIMs) is an important yetchallenging task within the construction industry as projects are increasingly being deliveredwith BIM. This is particularly essential for facility management (FM) users as downstreaminformation consumers that depend on the quality of models developed in the previousproject phases. The research presented in this paper addresses this challenge byintroducing a framework for information quality assessment (IQA) of BIMs for FM uses. TheIQA framework is the outcome of an extensive study of two large owner organizationsinvolving numerous BIM projects. The framework is structured based on the essential FMsubjects: assets; spaces; and systems; and the model characteristics: objects; attributes;relationships; and spatial information. The framework is then operationalized through the …,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2017,2
Review of BIM quality assessment approaches for facility management,P Zadeh; Sheryl Staub-French; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract: Assessing the quality of information in building information models (BIM) at the timeof project handover is critical for owners. Lack of quality information in delivered BIMs cancause significant issues in using BIM for facility management purposes; potentially limiting orpreventing their use in building operations. Our studies of numerous BIM projects anddeliverables have found that most BIMs created for design and construction today containsignificant quality issues including inaccurate; incomplete; or unnecessary information. Tomake these models useful for building operations requires significant adjustment to themodels; which can be very time-consuming and costly.

Extracting aggregate answer statistics for integration,Zainab Zolaktaf; Jian Xu; Rachel Pottinger,ABSTRACT Aggregate queries in integration contexts often do not have one “true” answer;there can be multiple correct answers for the same aggregate query. This is due to theexistence of duplicate or overlapping data points; possibly with different values; across thedata sources. Depending on the choice of data source combinations that are used to answerthe query; different answers can be generated. Thus; representing the answer to theaggregate query as an answer distribution instead of a single scalar value; will allow theusers to better understand the range of possible answers. This work provides a suite ofmethods for extracting statistics that convey meaningful information about aggregate queryanswers in heterogeneous integration settings. We focus on the following challenges: 1.determining which statistics best represent an answer's distribution; and 2. efficiently …,City,2015,1
Schema mediation in peer data management systems,Jie Zhao; Rachel Pottinger; Cody Brown; Shriram Rajagopalan,Peer Data Management Systems (PDMSs) allow the efficient sharing of data between peerswith overlapping sources of information. These sources share data through mappingsbetween peers. In current systems; queries are asked over each peer's local schema andthen translated using the mappings between peers. While this allows the data to beaccessed uniformly; users lack access to information that is not in their own schemas. In thispaper; we propose a light-weight; automatic method to create a mediated schema in aPDMS. Our work benefits PDMSs by allowing access to more data and without undulystressing the peer's resources or requiring additional resources such as ontologies.

A Generic Top-N Recommendation Framework For Trading-off Accuracy; Novelty; and Coverage,Zainab Zolaktaf; Reza Babanezhad; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract: Standard collaborative filtering approaches for top-N recommendation are biasedtoward popular items. As a result; they recommend items that users are likely aware of andunder-represent long-tail items. This is inadequate; both for consumers who prefer novelitems and because concentrating on popular items poorly covers the item space; whereashigh item space coverage increases providers' revenue. We present an approach that relieson historical rating data to learn user long-tail novelty preferences. We integrate thesepreferences into a generic re-ranking framework that customizes balance between accuracyand coverage. We empirically validate that our proposedframework increases the novelty ofrecommendations. Furthermore; by promoting long-tail items to the right group of users; wesignificantly increase the system's coverage while scalably maintaining accuracy. Our …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.00146,2018,*

A decadelater; there was a shift to more interactive content that presented how the business wasperforming at the present time; answering questions like" How are we doing right now?"Today the focus of BI users are looking into the future." Given what I did before and how I amcurrently doing this quarter; how will I do next quarter?" Furthermore; fuelled by the demandsof Big Data; BI systems are going through a time of incredible change.

Reputation Enhancement for Felis Domesticus,Rachel Pottinger; Steve Wolfman; Fauna NMI Xerxon,Abstract Fauna NMI Xerxon (NMI)(Figure 1) is a ravishingly elegant member of FelisDomesticus who deigns to dally in the domicile of the authors. That she is the Platonic idealof cat is self-evident (compare; eg; to Figure 2). That her likeness is the informationretrievalideal of “cat” is the story of this paper. That these three sentences all begin with “that” isutterly irrelevant. This paper details NMI's meteoric rise to fame and the shenanigans thatoccured on the way.,*,2003,*

An evaluation of the coulomb integral for a cuboid with uniform density ispresented in analytic form; leading to the development of non-overlapping cube basisfunctions. The coulomb energy of the hydrogen molecule is determined with these functionsfitted to the molecular orbital; and this result is compared with the ab initio coulomb energy.,Theoretical Chemistry Accounts,1995,*
Integrating GIS and BIM for Community-Scale Energy Modeling,Y Bai; PA Zadeh; S Staub-French; R Pottinger,To achieve energy-efficient design in urban communities; the design phase needs to adoptreliable energy modeling approaches. However; current urban modeling approaches oftenuse abstract and low level information to describe buildings because of the difficulties ofcollecting and managing building data on the large scale required of such urbancommunities. This abstraction of building data creates large uncertainties in the modelingand simulation of energy scenarios at the community level. An important part of the solutionto this challenge relies on the integration of information systems at the scale of both urbancommunities and individual buildings; which are based on geographic information system(GIS) and building information modeling (BIM) respectively. Since current technologies donot sufficiently address the interoperability between GIS and BIM; the existing conversion …,*,*,*

Appendix to the Paper: Schema Mapping and Query Translation in Heterogeneous P2P XML Databases,Angela Bonifati; Elaine Chang; Terence Ho; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Rachel Pottinger; Yongik Chung,We have presented a technique that takes as input a set of box and arrow correspondencesbetween a pair of DTDs and infers TreeLog rules involving tree expressions. How do weknow that the mappings captured using the inferred rules are meaningful? What can we sayabout the class of mappings (transformations) that are captured by the rules? To answerthese questions; in this appendix we introduce a small set of simple but powerful algebraicoperators for expressing transformations between (database instances of) DTDs. Wedemonstrate that transformations captured by expressions in this algebra are expressible asa set of TreeLog rules. The operators consist of three main groups:(1) unnest and nest;(2)flip and flop; and (3) split and merge. Additionally; we also allow individual node insertion;deletion; and tag modification for “completeness”. These latter operations are needed to …,*,*,*

An Extensible System for Merging Two Models Rachel Pottinger University of WashingtonSupervisors: Phil Bernstein and Alon Halevy Page 2. Model Management A model managementsystem consists of three key abstractions: • Models – a formal description of any complex structurethat describes how data is organized (eg; schemas; interface definitions) • Mappings – whichdescribe how two models are related • Operators – which manipulate models and mappings asatomic objects. The main operators are: • Match – create a mapping between two given models •Merge – combine two given models based on a given mapping between them • Apply – applya function to all of the items in a given model • Compose – given a mapping between models Aand B and a mapping between models B and C; create the mapping between A and C • Difference –given two models and a mapping between them …,*,*,*
TR-2007-18: Optimizing Acquaintance Selection in a PDMS,Jian Xu; Rachel Pottinger,ABSTRACT In a Peer Data Management System (PDMS); autonomous peers sharesemantically rich data. For queries to be translated across peers; a peer must provide amapping to other peers in the PDMS; peers connected by such mappings are calledacquaintances. To maximize query answering ability; a peer needs to optimize its choice ofacquaintances. This paper introduces a novel framework for performing acquaintanceselection. Our framework includes two selection schemes that effectively and efficientlyestimate mapping quality. The “one-shot” scheme clusters peers and estimates theimprovement in query answering based on cluster properties. The “two-hop” scheme;estimates using locally available information at multiple rounds. Our empirical study showsthat both schemes effectively help acquaintance selection and scale to PDMSs with large …,*,*,*
