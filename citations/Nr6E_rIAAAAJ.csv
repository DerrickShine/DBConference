Efficient querying and maintenance of network provenance at internet-scale,Wenchao Zhou; Micah Sherr; Tao Tao; Xiaozhou Li; Boon Thau Loo; Yun Mao,Abstract Network accountability; forensic analysis; and failure diagnosis are becomingincreasingly important for network management and security. Such capabilities often utilizenetwork provenance-the ability to issue queries over network meta-data. For example;network provenance may be used to trace the path a message traverses on the network aswell as to determine how message data were derived and which parties were involved in itsderivation. This paper presents the design and implementation of ExSPAN; a generic andextensible framework that achieves efficient network provenance in a distributedenvironment. We utilize the database notion of data provenance to" explain" the existence ofany network state; providing a versatile mechanism for network provenance. To achievesuch flexibility at Internet-scale; ExSPAN uses declarative networking in which network …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,121
Secure network provenance,Wenchao Zhou; Qiong Fei; Arjun Narayan; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Micah Sherr,Abstract This paper introduces secure network provenance (SNP); a novel technique thatenables networked systems to explain to their operators why they are in a certain state--eg;why a suspicious routing table entry is present on a certain router; or where a given cacheentry originated. SNP provides network forensics capabilities by permitting operators to trackdown faulty or misbehaving nodes; and to assess the damage such nodes may have causedto the rest of the system. SNP is designed for adversarial settings and is robust tomanipulation; its tamper-evident properties ensure that operators can detect whencompromised nodes lie or falsely implicate correct nodes. We also present the design ofSNooPy; a general-purpose SNP system. To demonstrate that SNooPy is practical; we applyit to three example applications: the Quagga BGP daemon; a declarative implementation …,Proceedings of the Twenty-Third ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles,2011,92
Hidden voice commands,Nicholas Carlini; Pratyush Mishra; Tavish Vaidya; Yuankai Zhang; Micah Sherr; Clay Shields; David Wagner; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract Voice interfaces are becoming more ubiquitous and are now the primary inputmethod for many devices. We explore in this paper how they can be attacked with hiddenvoice commands that are unintelligible to human listeners but which are interpreted ascommands by devices. We evaluate these attacks under two different threat models. In theblack-box model; an attacker uses the speech recognition system as an opaque oracle. Weshow that the adversary can produce difficult to understand commands that are effectiveagainst existing systems in the black-box model. Under the white-box model; the attackerhas full knowledge of the internals of the speech recognition system and uses it to createattack commands that we demonstrate through user testing are not understandable byhumans.,25th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 16); Austin; TX,2016,58
Private and verifiable interdomain routing decisions,Mingchen Zhao; Wenchao Zhou; Alexander JT Gurney; Andreas Haeberlen; Micah Sherr; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Existing secure interdomain routing protocols can verify validity properties aboutindividual routes; such as whether they correspond to a real network path. It is often useful toverify more complex properties relating to the route decision procedure-for example;whether the chosen route was the best one available; or whether it was consistent with thenetwork's peering agreements. However; this is difficult to do without knowing a network'srouting policy and full routing state; which are not normally disclosed. In this paper; we showhow a network can allow its peers to verify a number of nontrivial properties of itsinterdomain routing decisions without revealing any additional information. If all theproperties hold; the peers learn nothing beyond what the interdomain routing protocolalready reveals; if a property does not hold; at least one peer can detect this and prove …,Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2012 conference on Applications; technologies; architectures; and protocols for computer communication,2012,47

Let SDN be your eyes: Secure forensics in data center networks,Adam Bates; Kevin Butler; Andreas Haeberlen; Micah Sherr; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract—Discovering the causes of incorrect behavior in large networks is often difficult.This difficulty is compounded when some machines in the network are compromised; sincethese compromised machines may use deception or tamper with data to frustrate forensicanalysis. Recently proposed forensic tools enable administrators to learn the causes ofsome system states in a partially compromised network; but these tools are inherentlyunable to (1) observe covert communication between compromised nodes or (2) detectattempts to exfiltrate sensitive data. In this paper; we observe that the emergence of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers interesting new opportunities for network forensics.

Recursive computation of regions and connectivity in networks,Mengmeng Liu; Nicholas E Taylor; Wenchao Zhou; Zachary G Ives; Boon Thau Loo,In recent years; the data management community has begun to consider situations in whichdata access is closely tied to network routing and distributed acquisition: examples include;sensor networks that execute queries about reachable nodes or contiguous regions;declarative networks that maintain information about shortest paths and reachableendpoints; and distributed and peer-to-peer stream systems that detect associations (eg;transitive relationships) among data at the distributed sources. In each case; thefundamental operation is to maintain a view over dynamic network state. This view istypically distributed; recursive; and may contain aggregation; eg; describing transitiveconnectivity; shortest paths; least costly paths; or region membership.

In this paper; we take an alternativeperspective and propose a data-centric view of cloud security. In particular; we explore thesecurity properties of secure data sharing between applications hosted in the cloud.

Diagnosing missing events in distributed systems with negative provenance,Yang Wu; Mingchen Zhao; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract When debugging a distributed system; it is sometimes necessary to explain theabsence of an event-for instance; why a certain route is not available; or why a certainpacket did not arrive. Existing debuggers offer some support for explaining the presence ofevents; usually by providing the equivalent of a backtrace in conventional debuggers; butthey are not very good at answering'Why not?'questions: there is simply no starting point fora possible backtrace. In this paper; we show that the concept of negative provenance can beused to explain the absence of events in distributed systems. Negative provenance relies oncounterfactual reasoning to identify the conditions under which the missing event could haveoccurred. We define a formal model of negative provenance for distributed systems; and wepresent the design of a system called Y! that tracks both positive and negative …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM conference on SIGCOMM,2014,33
Distributed time-aware provenance,Wenchao Zhou; Suyog Mapara; Yiqing Ren; Yang Li; Andreas Haeberlen; Zachary Ives; Boon Thau Loo; Micah Sherr,Abstract The ability to reason about changes in a distributed system's state enables networkadministrators to better diagnose protocol misconfigurations; detect intrusions; and pinpointperformance bottlenecks. We propose a novel provenance model called Distributed Time-aware Provenance (DTaP) that aids forensics and debugging in distributed systems byexplicitly representing time; distributed state; and state changes. Using a distributed Datalogabstraction for modeling distributed protocols; we prove that the DTaP model provides asound and complete representation that correctly captures dependencies among events in adistributed system. We additionally introduce DistTape; an implementation of the DTaPmodel that uses novel distributed storage structures; query processing; and cost-basedoptimization techniques to efficiently query time-aware provenance in a distributed setting …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,32

A³ allows applications to tailor their anonymity properties and performancecharacteristics according to specific communication requirements. To support flexible pathconstruction; A³ exposes a declarative language (A³LOG) that enables applications tocompactly specify path selection and instantiation policies executed by a declarativenetworking engine. We demonstrate that our declarative language is sufficiently expressiveto encode novel multi-metric performance constraints as well as existing relay selectionalgorithms employed by Tor and other anonymity systems; using only a few lines of concisecode.

Datalog and Recursive Query Processing.,Todd J Green; Shan Shan Huang; Boon Thau Loo; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract In recent years; we have witnessed a revival of the use of recursive queries in avariety of emerging application domains such as data integration and exchange; informationextraction; networking; and program analysis. A popular language used for expressing thesequeries is Datalog. This paper surveys for a general audience the Datalog language;recursive query processing; and optimization techniques. This survey differs from priorsurveys written in the eighties and nineties in its comprehensiveness of topics; its coverageof recent developments and applications; and its emphasis on features and techniquesbeyond" classical" Datalog which are vital for practical applications. Specifically; the topicscovered include the core Datalog language and various extensions; semantics; queryoptimizations; magic-sets optimizations; incremental view maintenance; aggregates …,Foundations and Trends in Databases,2013,28
Detecting covert timing channels with time-deterministic replay,Ang Chen; W Brad Moore; Hanjun Xiao; Andreas Haeberlen; Linh Thi Xuan Phan; Micah Sherr; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract This paper presents a mechanism called timedeterministic replay (TDR) that canreproduce the execution of a program; including its precise timing. Without TDR;reproducing the timing of an execution is difficult because there are many sources of timingvariability–such as preemptions; hardware interrupts; cache effects; scheduling decisions;etc. TDR uses a combination of techniques to either mitigate or eliminate most of thesesources of variability. Using a prototype implementation of TDR in a Java Virtual Machine;we show that it is possible to reproduce the timing to within 1.85% of the original execution;even on commodity hardware.,USENIX Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation (OSDI),2014,26
Provenance-aware secure networks,Wenchao Zhou; Eric Cronin; Boon Thau Loo,Network accountability and forensic analysis have become increasingly important; as ameans of performing network diagnostics; identifying malicious nodes; enforcing trustmanagement policies; and imposing diverse billing over the Internet. This has led to a seriesof work to provide better network support for accountability; and efficient mechanisms totrace packets and information flows through the Internet. In this paper; we make the followingcontributions. First; we show that network accountability and forensic analysis can be posedgenerally as data provenance computations and queries over distributed streams.

Maintaining recursive views of regions and connectivity in networks,Mengmeng Liu; Nicholas E Taylor; Wenchao Zhou; Zachary G Ives; Boon Thau Loo,The data management community has recently begun to consider declarative networkrouting and distributed acquisition: eg; sensor networks that execute queries aboutcontiguous regions; declarative networks that maintain shortest paths; and distributed andpeer-to-peer stream systems that detect transitive relationships among data at the distributedsources. In each case; the fundamental operation is to maintain a view over dynamicnetwork state. This view is typically distributed; recursive; and may contain aggregation; eg;describing shortest paths or least costly paths. Surprisingly; solutions to computing suchviews are often domain-specific; expensive; and incomplete. We recast the problem asincremental recursive view maintenance given distributed streams of updates to tuples: newstream data becomes insert operations and tuple expirations become deletions.

A batch of PNUTS: Experiences connecting cloud batch and serving systems,Adam E Silberstein; Russell Sears; Wenchao Zhou; Brian Frank Cooper,Abstract Cloud data management systems are growing in prominence; particularly at largeInternet companies like Google; Yahoo!; and Amazon; which prize them for their scalabilityand elasticity. Each of these systems trades off between low-latency serving performanceand batch processing throughput. In this paper; we discuss our experience running batch-oriented Hadoop on top of Yahoo's serving-oriented PNUTS system instead of the standardHDFS file system. Though PNUTS is optimized for and primarily used for serving; a numberof applications at Yahoo! must run batch-oriented jobs that read or write data that is stored inPNUTS. Combining these systems reveals several key areas where the fundamentalproperties of each system are mismatched. We discuss our approaches to accommodatingthese mismatches; by either bending the batch and serving abstractions; or inventing new …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,23
The Good; the Bad; and the Differences: Better Network Diagnostics with Differential Provenance,Ang Chen; Yang Wu; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new approach to diagnosing problems in complexdistributed systems. Our approach is based on the insight that many of the trickiest problemsare anomalies. For instance; in a network; problems often affect only a small fraction of thetraffic (eg; perhaps a certain subnet); or they only manifest infrequently. Thus; it is quitecommon for the operator to have “examples” of both working and non-working traffic readilyavailable–perhaps a packet that was misrouted; and a similar packet that was routedcorrectly. In this case; the cause of the problem is likely to be wherever the two packets weretreated differently by the network. We present the design of a debugger that can leveragethis information using a novel concept that we call differential provenance. Differentialprovenance tracks the causal connections between network states and state changes …,Proceedings of the 2016 conference on ACM SIGCOMM 2016 Conference,2016,20

Declarative reconfigurable trust management,William Marczak; David Zook; Wenchao Zhou; Molham Aref; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract: In recent years; there has been a proliferation of declarative logic-based trustmanagement languages and systems proposed to ease the description; configuration; andenforcement of security policies. These systems have different tradeoffs in expressivenessand complexity; depending on the security constructs (eg authentication; delegation;secrecy; etc.) that are supported; and the assumed trust level and scale of the executionenvironment. In this paper; we present LBTrust; a unified declarative system forreconfigurable trust management; where various security constructs can be customized andcomposed in a declarative fashion.

FSR: Formal analysis and implementation toolkit for safe interdomain routing,Anduo Wang; Limin Jia; Wenchao Zhou; Yiqing Ren; Boon Thau Loo; Jennifer Rexford; Vivek Nigam; Andre Scedrov; Carolyn Talcott,Abstract Interdomain routing stitches the disparate parts of the Internet together; makingprotocol stability a critical issue to both researchers and practitioners. Yet; researcherscreate safety proofs and counterexamples by hand and build simulators and prototypes toexplore protocol dynamics. Similarly; network operators analyze their router configurationsmanually or using homegrown tools. In this paper; we present a comprehensive toolkit foranalyzing and implementing routing policies; ranging from high-level guidelines to specificrouter configurations. Our Formally Safe Routing (FSR) toolkit performs all of these functionsfrom the same algebraic representation of routing policy.

Network provenance describes thehistory and derivations of network state that result from the execution of a distributedprotocol. It has broad applicability in the management; diagnosis; and security analysis ofnetworks.

Having your cake and eating it too: Routing security with privacy protections,Alexander JT Gurney; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Micah Sherr; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Internet Service Providers typically do not reveal details of their interdomain routingpolicies due to security concerns; or for commercial or legal reasons. As a result; it is difficultto hold ISPs accountable for their contractual agreements. Existing solutions can checkbasic properties; eg; whether route announcements correspond to valid routes; but they donot verify how these routes were chosen. In essence; today's Internet forces us to choosebetween per-AS privacy and verifiability. In this paper; we argue that making this difficulttradeoff is unnecessary. We propose private and verifiable routing (PVR); a technique thatenables ISPs to check whether their neighbors are fulfilling their contractual promises tothem; and to obtain evidence of any violations; without disclosing information that the routingprotocol does not already reveal. As initial evidence that PVR is feasible; we sketch a …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks,2011,15

Data Provenance at Internet Scale: Architecture; Experiences; and the Road Ahead.,Ang Chen; Yang Wu; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Wenchao Zhou,A BSTRACT Provenance is a way to answer “why” questions about computations. It hasfound a number of uses in the database community; such as debugging query answers ortracing unexpected results to database tuples. In fact; the ability to ask “why” can be usefulfor a much broader range of applications. In this paper; we summarize our experiences overthe past few years in adapting provenance for diagnostic and forensic uses in networks anddistributed systems.

Automated network repair with meta provenance,Yang Wu; Ang Chen; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract When debugging an SDN application; diagnosing the problem is merely the firststep--the operator must still implement a solution that works; and that does not cause newproblems elsewhere. However; most existing SDN debuggers focus exclusively onidentifying the problem and offer the network operator little or no help with finding aneffective fix. Finding a fix is challenging because the number of potential repairs can beenormous. In this paper; we propose a first step towards automated repair for SDNapplications. Our approach consists of two elements. The first is a data structure we callmeta provenance; which can be used to efficiently find good candidate repairs. Metaprovenance is inspired by the provenance concept from the database community. However;whereas standard provenance can only reason about changes to data; meta-provenance …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks,2015,9
A program logic for verifying secure routing protocols,Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Hao Xu; Cheng Luo; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract The Internet; as it stands today; is highly vulnerable to attacks. However; little hasbeen done to understand and verify the formal security guarantees of proposed secure inter-domain routing protocols; such as Secure BGP (S-BGP). In this paper; we develop a soundprogram logic for SANDLog—a declarative specification language for secure routingprotocols—for verifying properties of these protocols. We prove invariant properties ofSANDLog programs that run in an adversarial environment. As a step towards automatedverification; we implement a verification condition generator (VCGen) to automatically extractproof obligations. VCGen is integrated into a compiler for SANDLog that can generateexecutable protocol implementations; and thus; both verification and empirical evaluation ofsecure routing protocols can be carried out in this unified framework.

Dispersing Asymmetric DDoS Attacks with SplitStack.,Ang Chen; Akshay Sriraman; Tavish Vaidya; Yuankai Zhang; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Linh Thi Xuan Phan; Micah Sherr; Clay Shields; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract This paper presents SplitStack; an architecture targeted at mitigating asymmetricDDoS attacks. These attacks are particularly challenging; since attackers can use a limitedamount of resources to trigger exhaustion of a particular type of system resource on theserver side. SplitStack resolves this by splitting the monolithic stack into many separablecomponents called minimum splittable units (MSUs). If part of the application stack isexperiencing a DDoS attack; SplitStack massively replicates just the affected MSUs;potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separatelyfrom the rest of the application stack; so that resources can be precisely added whereneeded to combat the attack. We validate SplitStack via a preliminary case study; and showthat it outperforms naive replication in defending against asymmetric attacks.,HotNets,2016,6

Data-plane Defenses against Routing Attacks on Tor,Henry Tan; Micah Sherr; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract Tor is susceptible to traffic correlation attacks in which an adversary who observesflows entering and leaving the anonymity network can apply statistical techniques tocorrelate flows and de-anonymize their endpoints. While an adversary may not be naturallypositioned to conduct such attacks; a recent study shows that the Internet's control-plane canbe manipulated to increase an adversary's view of the network; and consequently; improveits ability to perform traffic correlation. This paper explores; in-depth; the effects of control-plane attacks on the security of the Tor network. Using accurate models of the live Tornetwork; we quantify Tor's susceptibility to these attacks by measuring the fraction of the Tornetwork that is vulnerable and the advantage to the adversary of performing the attacks.

Reduction-based security analysis of internet routing protocols,Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Boon Thau Loo; Wenchao Zhou,In recent years; there have been strong interests in the networking community in designingnew Internet architectures that provide strong security guarantees. However; none of theseproposals back their security claims by formal analysis. In this paper; we use a reduction-based approach to prove the route authenticity property in secure routing protocols. Theseproperties require routes announced by honest nodes in the network not to be tamperedwith by the adversary. We focus on protocols that rely on layered signatures to providesecurity: each route announcement is associated with a list of signatures attesting theauthenticity of its subpaths. Our approach combines manual proofs with automated analysis.We define several reduction steps to reduce proving route authenticity properties to simpleconditions that can be automatically checked by the Proverif tool.

The (surprising) computational power of the sdn data plane,Calvin Newport; Wenchao Zhou,A software defined network (SDN) separates the centralized control plane from thedistributed data plane. This approach simplifies control logic at the cost of a heavy burdenon the software-based controller and potential long reaction time to data plane events. Onesolution to this problem is to distribute control logic to multiple controllers spread across thenetwork. Such a solution; however; requires additional mechanisms to enforce correctnessproperties (eg; consistency) among the controllers and it still does not fully eliminate latency;as controller decisions happen in software. In this paper; we explore a novel approach tothis problem: configuring the rules used by the data plane switches to allow these switchesto effectively handle latency-sensitive network management tasks without the directintervention of the control plane.

Meta provenance is inspired by the provenance concept from thedatabase community; however; whereas standard provenance can only reason aboutchanges to data; meta provenance can also reason about changes to programs.

Proof-based verification of software defined networks,Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Software defined network (SDN) eases the task of programming and managing computernetworks. The conceptually centralized nature of the control plane provides a holistic view ofthe network; thereby making it feasible to verify SDN's functionalities. Verification of SDN isgaining attention in the last few years [1; 5]. There are two main challenges of SDN:(1) SDNsare often programmed in general-purpose programming languages (eg Java; Python);which makes it tedious and error-prone to apply formal methods over controllerapplications;(2) the sheer scale of modern networks makes state explosion problem aninsurmountable challenge for model checking. Model checking techniques combined withlimiting the expressiveness of the programming language have demonstrated as an effectiveapproach to verifying basic properties. However; due to the highly dynamic nature of SDN …,Open Networking Summit,2014,3
Software-Defined Networks as Databases,Anduo Wang; Wenchao Zhou; Brighten Godfrey; Matthew Caesar,In software-defined networks (SDN); the separation of the control and data-plane moves theconcurrency control from the data-plane to a separate; now logically centralized controllerprogram. As a result; despite its intention to simplify programming; the separation forces theprogrammer to deal with a spectrum of concurrent events (eg execution of controllerprograms; in-flight packets); a task that is notoriously challenging and error-prone. It is noteven clear what concurrency problems the programmer shall account for. Although earlystage works propose specific correctness conditions and point solutions [4; 1]; acomprehensive study is still lacking. Most existing work focuses on the concurrency problemwe call atomicity1; which concerns one single networkwide update transaction. We usenetwork-wide transaction (or transaction) to refer to a logical network operation that …,Presented as part of the Open Networking Summit,2014,3
Declarative secure distributed information systems,Wenchao Zhou; Tao Tao; Boon Thau Loo; Yun Mao,Abstract We present a unified declarative platform for specifying; implementing; andanalyzing secure networked information systems. Our work builds upon techniques fromlogic-based trust management systems and declarative networking. We make the followingcontributions. First; we propose the Secure Network Datalog (SeNDlog) language thatunifies Binder; a logic-based language for access control in distributed systems; andNetwork Datalog; a distributed recursive query language for declarative networks.

Declarative Networking,Boon Thau Loo; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract Declarative Networking is a programming methodology that enables developers toconcisely specify network protocols and services; which are directly compiled to a dataflowframework that executes the specifications. Declarative networking proposes the use of adeclarative query language for specifying and implementing network protocols; and employsa dataflow framework at runtime for communication and maintenance of network state. Theprimary goal of declarative networking is to greatly simplify the process of specifying;implementing; deploying and evolving a network design. In addition; declarative networkingserves as an important step towards an extensible; evolvable network architecture that cansupport flexible; secure and efficient deployment of new network protocols.

Distributed Provenance Compression,Chen Chen; Harshal Tushar Lehri; Lay Kuan Loh; Anupam Alur; Limin Jia; Boon Thau Loo; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract Network provenance; which records the execution history of network events asmeta-data; is becoming increasingly important for network accountability and failurediagnosis. For example; network provenance may be used to trace the path that a messagetraversed in a network; or to reveal how a particular routing entry was derived and theparties involved in its derivation. A challenge when storing the provenance of a live networkis that the large number of the arriving messages may incur substantial storage overhead. Inthis paper; we explore techniques to dynamically compress distributed provenance stored atscale. Logically; the compression is achieved by grouping equivalent provenance trees andmaintaining only one concrete copy for each equivalence class. To efficiently identifyequivalent provenance; we (1) introduce distributed event-based linear programs (DELP) …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,2
Automated verification of safety properties of declarative networking programs,Chen Chen; Lay Kuan Loh; Limin Jia; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Networks are complex systems that unfortunately are ridden with errors. Such errorscan lead to disruption of services; which may have grave consequences. Verification ofnetworks is key to eliminating errors and building robust networks. In this paper; we proposean approach to verify networks using declarative networking; where networks are specifiedin NDlog; a declarative language. We focus on analyzing safety properties. We develop atechnique to statically analyze NDlog programs: first; we build a dependency graph of thepredicates of NDlog programs; then; we build a summary data structure called a derivationpool to represent all possible derivations and their associated constraints for predicates inthe program; finally; properties specified in first-order logic are checked on the data structurewith the help of the SMT solver Z3.

Validating web content with Senser,Jordan Wilberding; Andrew Yates; Micah Sherr; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract This paper introduces Senser; a system for validating retrieved web content. Senserdoes not rely on a PKI and operates even when SSL/TLS is not supported by the web server.Senser operates as a network of proxies located at different vantage points on the Internet.Clients query a random subset of Senser proxies for compact descriptions of a desired webpage; and apply consensus and matching algorithms to the returned results to locally rendera" majority" web page. To ensure diverse selections of proxies (and consequently decreasean adversary's ability to manipulate a majority of the proxies' requests); Senser leveragesInternet mapping systems that accurately predict AS-level paths between available proxiesand the desired web page. We demonstrate using a deployment of Senser on Amazon EC2that Senser detects and mitigates attempts by adversaries to manipulate web content …,Proceedings of the 29th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference,2013,2
One Primitive to Diagnose Them All: Architectural Support for Internet Diagnostics.,Ang Chen; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Today; network operators are increasingly playing the role of part-time detectives:they must routinely diagnose intricate problems and malfunctions; eg; routing orperformance issues; and they must often perform forensic investigations of past misbehavior;eg; intrusions or cybercrimes. However; the current Internet architecture offers little directsupport for them. A variety of solutions have been proposed; but each solution tends toaddress only one specific problem. Moreover; each solution proposes a different fix that isincompatible with the others; which complicates deployment. In this paper; we make theobservation that most of the existing solutions share a common" functional core"; whichsuggests that it may be possible to add a single primitive to the Internet architecture that cansupport a wide variety of diagnostic and forensic tasks.

The design and implementation of the A 3 application-aware anonymity platform,Micah Sherr; Harjot Gill; Taher Aquil Saeed; Andrew Mao; William R Marczak; Saravana Soundararajan; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo; Matt Blaze,Abstract This paper presents the design and implementation of Application-AwareAnonymity (A 3); an extensible platform for rapidly prototyping and evaluating anonymityprotocols on the Internet. A 3 supports the development of highly tunable anonymousprotocols that enable applications to tailor their anonymity properties and performancecharacteristics according to specific communication requirements. To support flexible pathconstruction; A 3 uses a declarative language to compactly specify path selection andinstantiation policies. We demonstrate that our declarative language is sufficientlyexpressive to encode novel multi-metric performance constraints as well as existing relayselection algorithms employed by Tor and other anonymity systems; using only a few lines ofconcise code. We experimentally evaluate A 3 using a combination of trace-driven …,Computer Networks,2014,1
A formal framework for secure routing protocols,Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Hao Xu; Cheng Luo; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,The Internet infrastructure; as it stands today; is highly vulnerable to attacks. The Internetruns the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP); where routers are grouped into AutonomousSystems (ASes) administered by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Since routeadvertisements are not authenticated; ASes can; for example; advertise nonexistent routesor claim to own arbitrary destination addresses. In response to these vulnerabilities; therehas been a considerable amount of work to design new architectures and protocols for amore secure Internet; including direct secure extensions (Secure-BGP; ps-BGP and so-BGP)and “clean-slate” Internet architectural redesigns such as SCION and ICING.

Using substructure mining to identify misbehavior in network provenance graphs,David DeBoer; Wenchao Zhou; Lisa Singh,Abstract As distributed systems become more ubiquitous and more complex; the need forefficient; scalable tools to analyze these systems increases. Network provenance graphsoffer a rich framework for this task; mapping dependencies between system states andallowing one to explain these states. In this paper; we investigate methods for more efficientsubstructure mining in the context of network provenance graphs. Specifically; we areinterested in identifying frequent substructures that can be used as a feature set for modelingcommon execution patterns. Knowing these will help network administrators detect nodes inthe distributed system that are misbehaving. Therefore; this paper focuses on applying andscaling up substructure mining for network provenance graphs by incorporating a graphdatabase (neo4j) into the substructure mining process and implementing optimizations …,First International Workshop on Graph Data Management Experiences and Systems,2013,1

A Demonstration of the DeDoS Platform for Defusing Asymmetric DDoS Attacks in Data Centers,Henri Maxime Demoulin; Tavish Vaidya; Isaac Pedisich; Nik Sultana; Bowen Wang; Jingyu Qian; Yuankai Zhang; Ang Chen; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Linh Thi Xuan Phan; Micah Sherr; Clay Shields; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract We propose a demonstration of DeDoS; a platform for mitigating asymmetric DDoSattacks. These attacks are particularly challenging since attackers using limited resourcescan exhaust the resources of even well-provisioned servers. DeDoS resolves this by splittingmonolithic software stacks into separable components called minimum splittable units(MSUs). If part of the application stack is experiencing a DDoS attack; DeDoS can massivelyreplicate only the affected MSUs; potentially across many machines. This allows scaling ofthe impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack so that resources canbe precisely added where needed to combat the attack. Our demonstration will show thatDeDoS incurs reasonable overheads in normal operations and that it significantlyoutperforms naïve replication when defending against a range of asymmetric attacks.,Proceedings of the SIGCOMM Posters and Demos,2017,*

Methods; systems; and computer readable media for detecting covert timing channels,*,A mechanism called time-deterministic replay (TOR) that can reproduce the execution of aprogram; including its precise timing. Without TOR; reproducing the timing of an execution isdifficult because there are many sources of timing variability. TOR uses a combination oftechniques to either mitigate or eliminate most of these sources of variability. Using aprototype implementation of TOR in a Java Virtual Machine; we show it is possible toreproduce the timing to within 1.85% of the original execution. A study of one of theapplications of TOR is described: the detection of a covert timing channel. Timing channelscan be used to exfiltrate information from a compromised machine by subtly varying timing ofthe machine's outputs; TOR can detect this variation. Unlike prior solutions; which generallylook for a specific type of timing channel; our approach can detect a wide variety of …,*,2015,*
Towards a Data-centric Approach to Attribution in the Cloud,Wenchao Zhou,Abstract With an increasing number of applications being mirgrated to cloud; it becomesevident that faults in these applications or the underlying cloud platform can be costly.

Towards Self-Explaining Networks,Wenchao Zhou; Qiong Fei; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Micah Sherr,Abstract In this paper; we argue that networks should be able to explain to their operatorswhy they are in a certain state; even if–and particularly if–they have been compromised byan attacker. Such a capability would be useful in forensic investigations; where an operatorobserves an unexpected state and must decide whether it is benign or an indication that thesystem has been compromised. Using a very pessimistic threat model in which a maliciousadversary can completely compromise an arbitrary subset of the nodes in the network; weargue that we cannot expect to get a complete and correct explanation in all possible cases.However; we also show that; based on recent advances in the systems and the databasecommunities; it seems possible to get a slightly weaker guarantee: for any state change thatdirectly or indirectly affects a correct node; we can either obtain a correct explanation or …,*,2011,*

A Program Logic for Verifying Secure Routing Protocols (Technical Report),Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Hao Xu; Cheng Luo; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract. The Internet; as it stands today; is highly vulnerable to attacks. However; little hasbeen done to understand and verify the formal security guarantees of proposed secure inter-domain routing protocols; such as Secure BGP (S-BGP). In this paper; we develop a soundprogram logic for SANDLog—a declarative specification language for secure routingprotocols—for verifying properties of these protocols. We prove invariant properties ofSANDLog programs that run in an adversarial environment. As a step towards automatedverification; we implement a verification condition generator (VCGen) to automatically extractproof obligations. VCGen is integrated into a compiler for SANDLog that can generateexecutable protocol implementations; and thus; both verification and empirical evaluation ofsecure routing protocols can be carried out in this unified framework.

Our Formally Safe Routing (FSR) toolkit assists in each stage of the designprocess:(i) demonstrating that specific configurations (“gadgets”) diverge;(ii) verifying thatproposed constraints on routing policy ensure convergence; and (iii) generating a provably-correct protocol implementation to use in experiments. FSR uses routing algebra to analyzeconvergence and declarative networking to generate implementations from algebraicspecifications. Our implementation of FSR uses the RapidNet declarative networkingsystem; Yices SMT solver; and Maude logic-based model checker.
