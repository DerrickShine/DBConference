In-memory big data management and processing: A survey,Hao Zhang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Meihui Zhang,Growing main memory capacity has fueled the development of in-memory big datamanagement and processing. By eliminating disk I/O bottleneck; it is now possible to supportinteractive data analytics. However; in-memory systems are much more sensitive to othersources of overhead that do not matter in traditional I/O-bounded disk-based systems. Someissues such as fault-tolerance and consistency are also more challenging to handle in in-memory environment. We are witnessing a revolution in the design of database systems thatexploits main memory as its data storage layer. Many of these researches have focusedalong several dimensions: modern CPU and memory hierarchy utilization; time/spaceefficiency; parallelism; and concurrency control. In this survey; we aim to provide a thoroughreview of a wide range of in-memory data management and processing proposals and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,169
Cdas: a crowdsourcing data analytics system,Xuan Liu; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Yanyan Shen; Sai Wu; Meihui Zhang,Abstract Some complex problems; such as image tagging and natural language processing;are very challenging for computers; where even state-of-the-art technology is yet able toprovide satisfactory accuracy. Therefore; rather than relying solely on developing new andbetter algorithms to handle such tasks; we look to the crowdsourcing solution--employinghuman participation--to make good the shortfall in current technology. Crowdsourcing is agood supplement to many computer tasks. A complex job may be divided into computer-oriented tasks and human-oriented tasks; which are then assigned to machines and humansrespectively. To leverage the power of crowdsourcing; we design and implement aCrowdsourcing Data Analytics System; CDAS. CDAS is a framework designed to support thedeployment of various crowdsourcing applications. The core part of CDAS is a quality …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,167
Effectively indexing uncertain moving objects for predictive queries,Meihui Zhang; Su Chen; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract Moving object indexing and query processing is a well studied research topic; withapplications in areas such as intelligent transport systems and location-based services.While much existing work explicitly or implicitly assumes a deterministic object movementmodel; real-world objects often move in more complex and stochastic ways. This paperinvestigates the possibility of a marriage between moving-object indexing and probabilisticobject modeling. Given the distributions of the current locations and velocities of movingobjects; we devise an efficient inference method for the prediction of future locations. Wedemonstrate that such prediction can be seamlessly integrated into existing index structuresdesigned for moving objects; thus improving the meaningfulness of range and nearestneighbor query results in highly dynamic and uncertain environments.

A hybrid machine-crowdsourcing system for matching web tables,Ju Fan; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Wang-Chiew Tan; Meihui Zhang,The Web is teeming with rich structured information in the form of HTML tables; whichprovides us with the opportunity to build a knowledge repository by integrating these tables.An essential problem of web data integration is to discover semantic correspondencesbetween web table columns; and schema matching is a popular means to determine thesemantic correspondences. However; conventional schema matching techniques are notalways effective for web table matching due to the incompleteness in web tables. In thispaper; we propose a two-pronged approach for web table matching that effectivelyaddresses the above difficulties. First; we propose a concept-based approach that mapseach column of a web table to the best concept; in a well-developed knowledge base; thatrepresents it. This approach overcomes the problem that sometimes values of two web …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,67
On multi-column foreign key discovery,Meihui Zhang; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Beng Chin Ooi; Cecilia M Procopiuc; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract A foreign/primary key relationship between relational tables is one of the mostimportant constraints in a database. From a data analysis perspective; discovering foreignkeys is a crucial step in understanding and working with the data. Nevertheless; more oftenthan not; foreign key constraints are not specified in the data; for various reasons; eg; someassociations are not known to designers but are inherent in the data; while others becomeinvalid due to data inconsistencies. This work proposes a robust algorithm for discoveringsingle-column and multi-column foreign keys. Previous work concentrated mostly ondiscovering single-column foreign keys using a variety of rules; like inclusion dependencies;column names; and minimum/maximum values. We first propose a general rule; termedRandomness; that subsumes a variety of other rules. We then develop efficient …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,59
InfoGather+: semantic matching and annotation of numeric and time-varying attributes in web tables,Meihui Zhang; Kaushik Chakrabarti,Abstract Users often need to gather information about" entities" of interest. Recent efforts tryto automate this task by leveraging the vast corpus of HTML tables; this is referred to as"entity augmentation". The accuracy of entity augmentation critically depends on semanticrelationships between web tables as well as semantic labels of those tables. Currenttechniques work well for string-valued and static attributes but perform poorly for numericand time-varying attributes. In this paper; we first build a semantic graph that (i) labelscolumns with unit; scale and timestamp information and (ii) computes semantic matchesbetween columns even when the same numeric attribute is expressed in different units orscales. Second; we develop a novel entity augmentation API suited for numeric and time-varying attributes that leverages the semantic graph. Building the graph is challenging as …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,44
Reverse engineering complex join queries,Meihui Zhang; Hazem Elmeleegy; Cecilia M Procopiuc; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract We study the following problem: Given a database D with schema G and an outputtable Out; compute a join query Q that generates OUT from D. A simpler variant allows Q toreturn a superset of Out. This problem has numerous applications; both by itself; and as abuilding block for other problems. Related prior work imposes conditions on the structure ofQ which are not always consistent with the application; but simplify computation. We discussseveral natural SQL queries that do not satisfy these conditions and cannot be discoveredby prior work. In this paper; we propose an efficient algorithm that discovers queries witharbitrary join graphs. A crucial insight is that any graph can be characterized by thecombination of a simple structure; called a star; and a series of merge steps over the star.The merge steps define a lattice over graphs derived from the same star. This allows us to …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,36

However; the deep complex model structure and massive training data make itexpensive to train. In this paper; we present a distributed deep learning system; calledSINGA; for training big models over large datasets. An intuitive programming model basedon the layer abstraction is provided; which supports a variety of popular deep learningmodels. SINGA architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous trainingframeworks. Hybrid training frameworks can also be customized to achieve good scalability.SINGA provides different neural net partitioning schemes for training large models.

Automatic discovery of attributes in relational databases,Meihui Zhang; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Beng Chin Ooi; Cecilia M Procopiuc; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In this work we design algorithms for clustering relational columns into attributes; ie;for identifying strong relationships between columns based on the common properties andcharacteristics of the values they contain. For example; identifying whether a certain set ofcolumns refers to telephone numbers versus social security numbers; or names ofcustomers versus names of nations. Traditional relational database schema languages usevery limited primitive data types and simple foreign key constraints to express relationshipsbetween columns. Object oriented schema languages allow the definition of custom datatypes; still; certain relationships between columns might be unknown at design time or theymight appear only in a particular database instance. Nevertheless; these relationships arean invaluable tool for schema matching; and generally for better understanding and …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,22
Crowdop: Query optimization for declarative crowdsourcing systems,Ju Fan; Meihui Zhang; Stanley Kok; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,We study the query optimization problem in declarative crowdsourcing systems. Declarativecrowdsourcing is designed to hide the complexities and relieve the user of the burden ofdealing with the crowd. The user is only required to submit an SQL-like query and thesystem takes the responsibility of compiling the query; generating the execution plan andevaluating in the crowdsourcing marketplace. A given query can have many alternativeexecution plans and the difference in crowdsourcing cost between the best and the worstplans may be several orders of magnitude. Therefore; as in relational database systems;query optimization is important to crowdsourcing systems that provide declarative queryinterfaces. In this paper; we propose CROWDOP; a cost-based query optimization approachfor declarative crowdsourcing systems. CROWDOP considers both cost and latency in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,21
Efficient spatial keyword search in trajectory databases,Gao Cong; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Dongxiang Zhang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: An increasing amount of trajectory data is being annotated with text descriptions tobetter capture the semantics associated with locations. The fusion of spatial locations andtext descriptions in trajectories engenders a new type of top-$ k $ queries that take intoaccount both aspects. Each trajectory in consideration consists of a sequence of geo-spatiallocations associated with text descriptions. Given a user location $\lambda $ and a keywordset $\psi $; a top-$ k $ query returns $ k $ trajectories whose text descriptions cover thekeywords $\psi $ and that have the shortest match distance. To the best of our knowledge;previous research on querying trajectory databases has focused on trajectory data withoutany text description; and no existing work has studied such kind of top-$ k $ queries ontrajectories. This paper proposes one novel method for efficiently computing top-$ k …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1205.2880,2012,20
Contextual crowd intelligence,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian Lee Tan; Quoc Trung Tran; James WL Yip; Gang Chen; Zheng Jye Ling; Thi Nguyen; Anthony KH Tung; Meihui Zhang,Abstract Most data analytics applications are industry/domain specific; eg; predictingpatients at high risk of being admitted to intensive care unit in the healthcare sector orpredicting malicious SMSs in the telecommunication sector. Existing solutions are based on"best practices"; ie; the systems' decisions are knowledge-driven and/or data-driven.However; there are rules and exceptional cases that can only be precisely formulated andidentified by subject-matter experts (SMEs) who have accumulated many years ofexperience.

Deep learning at scale and at ease,Wei Wang; Gang Chen; Haibo Chen; Tien Tuan Anh Dinh; Jinyang Gao; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Sheng Wang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract Recently; deep learning techniques have enjoyed success in various multimediaapplications; such as image classification and multimodal data analysis. Large deeplearning models are developed for learning rich representations of complex data. There aretwo challenges to overcome before deep learning can be widely adopted in multimedia andother applications. One is usability; namely the implementation of different models andtraining algorithms must be done by nonexperts without much effort; especially when themodel is large and complex. The other is scalability; namely the deep learning system mustbe able to provision for a huge demand of computing resources for training large modelswith massive datasets. To address these two challenges; in this article we design adistributed deep learning platform called SINGA; which has an intuitive programming …,ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing; Communications; and Applications (TOMM),2016,8
Exploiting single-threaded model in multi-core in-memory systems,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Qian Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Weng-Fai Wong; Meihui Zhang,The widely adopted single-threaded OLTP model assigns a single thread to each staticpartition of the database for processing transactions in a partition.

The database community has worked on data-driven applications formany years; and therefore should be playing a lead role in supporting this new wave.However; databases and deep learning are different in terms of both techniques andapplications. In this paper; we discuss research problems at the intersection of the two fields.In particular; we discuss possible improvements for deep learning systems from a databaseperspective; and analyze database applications that may benefit from deep learningtechniques.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2016,8
Dgcc: A new dependency graph based concurrency control protocol for multicore database systems,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Pengfei Chang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Weng-Fai Wong; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: Multicore CPUs and large memories are increasingly becoming the norm inmodern computer systems. However; current database management systems (DBMSs) aregenerally ineffective in exploiting the parallelism of such systems. In particular; contentioncan lead to a dramatic fall in performance. In this paper; we propose a new concurrencycontrol protocol called DGCC (Dependency Graph based Concurrency Control) thatseparates concurrency control from execution. DGCC builds dependency graphs forbatched transactions before executing them. Using these graphs; contentions within thesame batch of transactions are resolved before execution. As a result; the execution of thetransactions does not need to deal with contention while maintaining full equivalence to thatof serialized execution. This better exploits multicore hardware and achieves higher level …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.03642,2015,6

To facilitate this process; we have designed a cross-service travelengine for trip planners. Our system seamlessly and semantically integrates various types oftravel services and resources based on a geographical ontology. We also built a user-friendly visualization tool for travellers to conveniently browse and design personalitineraries on Google Maps.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,5

UStore: a distributed storage with rich semantics,Anh Dinh; Ji Wang; Sheng Wang; Gang Chen; Wei-Ngan Chin; Qian Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Pingcheng Ruan; Kian-Lee Tan; Zhongle Xie; Hao Zhang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: Today's storage systems expose abstractions which are either too low-level (eg;key-value store; raw-block store) that they require developers to re-invent the wheels; or toohigh-level (eg; relational databases; Git) that they lack generality to support many classes ofapplications. In this work; we propose and implement a general distributed data storagesystem; called UStore; which has rich semantics. UStore delivers three key properties;namely immutability; sharing and security; which unify and add values to many classes oftoday's applications; and which also open the door for new applications. By keeping the coreproperties within the storage; UStore helps reduce application development efforts whileoffering high performance at hand.

Jointly modeling heterogeneous temporal properties in location recommendation,Saeid Hosseini; Hongzhi Yin; Meihui Zhang; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems suggest interesting locations tousers based on their previous check-ins via location-based social networks (LBSNs).Individuals visiting a location are partially affected by many factors including social links;travel distance and the time. A growing line of research has been devoted to takingadvantage of various effects to improve existing location recommendation methods.However; the temporal influence owns numerous dimensions which deserve to be exploredmore in depth. The subset property comprises a set of homogeneous slots such as an hourof the day; the day of the week; week of the month; month of the year; and so on. In addition;time has other attributes such as the recency which signifies the newly visited locationsversus others.

Onechallenge of this task is to locate the attention of both the query and database images. Inparticular; database images; eg of fashion products; on e-commerce websites are typicallydisplayed with other accessories; and the images taken by users contain noisy backgroundand large variations in orientation and lighting. Consequently; their attention is difficult tolocate. In this paper; we exploit the rich tag information available on the e-commercewebsites to locate the attention of database images.

Scaling Distributed Transaction Processing and Recovery based on Dependency Logging,Chang Yao; Meihui Zhang; Qian Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Jiatao Xu,Abstract: DGCC protocol has been shown to achieve good performance on multi-core in-memory system. However; distributed transactions complicate the dependency resolution;and therefore; an effective transaction partitioning strategy is essential to reduce expensivemulti-node distributed transactions. During failure recovery; log must be examined from thelast checkpoint onwards and the affected transactions are re-executed based on the waythey are partitioned and executed. Existing approaches treat both transaction managementand recovery as two separate problems; even though recovery is dependent on thesequence in which transactions are executed. In this paper; we propose to treat thetransaction management and recovery problems as one.

Towards A Unified Graph Model for Supporting Data Management and Usable Machine Learning,Guoliang Li; Meihui Zhang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Data management and machine learning are two important tasks in data science.However; they have been independently studied so far. We argue that they should becomplementary to each other. On the one hand; machine learning requires datamanagement techniques to extract; integrate; clean the data; to support scalable and usablemachine learning; making it user-friendly and easily deployable. On the other hand; datamanagement relies on machine learning techniques to curate data and improve its quality.This requires database systems to treat machine learning algorithms as their basicoperators; or at the very least; optimizable stored procedures. It poses new challenges asmachine learning tasks tend be iterative and recursive in nature; and some models have tobe tweaked and retrained.
