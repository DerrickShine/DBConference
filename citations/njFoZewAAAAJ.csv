MRI: Meaningful Interpretations of Collaborative Ratings,Mahashweta Das; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,ABSTRACT Collaborative rating sites have become essential resources that many usersconsult to make purchasing decisions on various items. Ideally; a user wants to quicklydecide whether an item is desirable; especially when many choices are available. Inpractice; however; a user either spends a lot of time examining reviews before making aninformed decision; or simply trusts overall rating aggregations associated with an item. Inthis paper; we argue that neither option is satisfactory and propose a novel and powerfulthird option; Meaningful Ratings Interpretation (MRI); that automatically provides ameaningful interpretation of ratings associated with the input items. As a simple example;given the movie “Usual Suspects;” instead of simply showing the average rating of 8.7 fromall reviewers; MRI produces a set of meaningful factoids such as “male reviewers under …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,35
Anomaly detection and spatio-temporal analysis of global climate system,Mahashweta Das; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Knowledge discovery from temporal; spatial and spatio-temporal data is pivotal forunderstanding and predicting the behavior of Earth's ecosystem model. An importantinfluence leaving its impact on the ecosystem is the global climate system. In this paper; theEarth Science data that we have analyzed consists of daily global air temperature andprecipitation measurements; aggregated from heterogeneous sensors for fifty years (1950--1999). The enormous amount of data that is available for analysis requires employment ofdata mining techniques for discovering interesting patterns; detecting significant changesand extracting meaningful insights from the data. Our work considers the problem ofdetecting anomalous (abnormal or unexpected) behavior in the global climate system;discovering teleconnection patterns and providing consequential insights to the analysts.,Proceedings of the third international workshop on knowledge discovery from sensor data,2009,33
Learning to question: leveraging user preferences for shopping advice,Mahashweta Das; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We present ShoppingAdvisor; a novel recommender system that helps users inshopping for technical products. ShoppingAdvisor leverages both user preferences andtechnical product attributes in order to generate its suggestions. The system elicits userpreferences via a tree-shaped flowchart; where each node is a question to the user. At eachnode; ShoppingAdvisor suggests a ranking of products matching the preferences of theuser; and that gets progressively refined along the path from the tree's root to one of its leafs.In this paper we show (i) how to learn the structure of the tree; ie; which questions to ask ateach node; and (ii) how to produce a suitable ranking at each node. First; we adapt theclassical top-down strategy for building decision trees in order to find the best user attributeto ask at each node. Differently from decision trees; ShoppingAdvisor partitions the user …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,19
Who Tags What? An Analysis Framework,Mahashweta Das; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr; del. icio. us; and YouTube;and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves threecomponents; user; item (eg; photos in Flickr); and tags (ie; words or phrases). Analyzing howtags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helpingusers search for desired information. In this paper; we explore common analysis tasks andpropose a dual mining framework for social tagging behavior mining. This framework iscentered around two opposing measures; similarity and diversity; being applied to one ormore tagging components; and therefore enables a wide range of analysis scenarios suchas characterizing similar users tagging diverse items with similar tags; or diverse userstagging similar items with diverse tags; etc. By adopting different concrete measures for …,Arxiv preprint arXiv:1208.0285,2012,18
Leveraging collaborative tagging for web item design,Mahashweta Das; Gautam Das; Vagelis Hristidis,Abstract The popularity of collaborative tagging sites has created new challenges andopportunities for designers of web items; such as electronics products; travel itineraries;popular blogs; etc. An increasing number of people are turning to online reviews and user-specified tags to choose from among competing items. This creates an opportunity fordesigners to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper;we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items withtheir user-submitted tags; and a query set of desirable tags; design the k best new itemsexpected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete; even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We presenttwo principled algorithms for solving this problem:(a) an exact" two-tier" algorithm (based …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,12
An expressive framework and efficient algorithms for the analysis of collaborative tagging,Mahashweta Das; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr; del. icio. us; and YouTube;and social tagging is essential to their success.

Maprat: Meaningful explanation; interactive exploration and geo-visualization of collaborative ratings,Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Mahashweta Das; Shrikant Desai; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract Collaborative rating sites such as IMDB and Yelp have become rich resources thatusers consult to form judgments about and choose from among competing items. Most ofthese sites either provide a plethora of information for users to interpret all by themselves ora simple overall aggregate information. Such aggregates (eg; average rating over all userswho have rated an item; aggregates along pre-defined dimensions; etc.) can not help a userquickly decide the desirability of an item. In this paper; we build a system MapRat that allowsa user to explore multiple carefully chosen aggregate analytic details over a set of userdemographics that meaningfully explain the ratings associated with item (s) of interest.MapRat allows a user to systematically explore; visualize and understand user ratingpatterns of input item (s) so as to make an informed decision quickly.

Fast Rule Mining Over Multi-Dimensional Windows,Mahashweta Das; P Deepak; Prasad M Deshpande; Ramakrishnan Kannan,Abstract Association rule mining is an indispensable tool for discovering insights from largedatabases and data warehouses. The data in a warehouse being multi-dimensional; it isoften useful to mine rules over subsets of data defined by selections over the dimensions.Such interactive rule mining over multi-dimensional query windows is difficult since rulemining is computationally expensive. Current methods using pre-computation of frequentitemsets require counting of some itemsets by revisiting the transaction database at querytime; which is very expensive. We develop a method (RMW) that identifies the minimal set ofitemsets to compute and store for each cell; so that rule mining over any query window maybe performed without going back to the transaction database. We give formal proofs that theset of itemsets chosen by RMW is sufficient to answer any query and also prove that it is …,*,2011,5
Generating informative snippet to maximize item visibility,Mahashweta Das; Habibur Rahman; Gautam Das; Vagelis Hristidis,Abstract The widespread use and growing popularity of online collaborative content siteshas created rich resources for users to consult in order to make purchasing decisions onvarious items such as e-commerce products; restaurants; etc. Ideally; a user wants to quicklydecide whether an item is desirable; from the list of items returned as a result of her searchquery. This has created new challenges for producers/manufacturers (eg; Dell) or retailers(eg; Amazon; eBay) of such items to compose succinct summarizations of web itemdescriptions; henceforth referred to as snippets; that are likely to maximize the items' visibilityamong users. We exploit the availability of user feedback in collaborative content sites in theform of tags to identify the most important item attributes that must be highlighted in an itemsnippet. We investigate the problem of finding the top-k best snippets for an item that are …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,3
Spatio-temporal anomaly detection,Mahashweta Das,Abstract Recent advances in computational sciences have led to the generation andutilization of enormous amounts of spatio-temporal data in numerous scientific disciplines;such as wireless sensor networks; bioinformatics; astrophysics and computational fluiddynamics. The need to efficiently handle and effectively analyze such humongous amount ofdata has led to the application of data mining techniques in this domain of research. Spatio-temporal data mining is the process of maneuvering such datasets to extract interestingknowledge and meaningful insights from the data. In this thesis; we propose a spatio-temporal and a temporal-spatial anomaly detection algorithm in the context of wirelesssensor network application. The latter can also be interpreted as a prediction model forspatio-temporal datasets. The anomaly detection algorithms identify local abnormalities in …,*,2009,3
Web item reviewing made easy by leveraging available user feedback,Azade Nazi; Mahashweta Das; Gautam Das,Abstract: The widespread use of online review sites over the past decade has motivatedbusinesses of all types to possess an expansive arsenal of user feedback to mark theirreputation. Though a significant proportion of purchasing decisions are driven by averagerating; detailed reviews are critical for activities like buying expensive digital SLR camera.Since writing a detailed review for an item is usually time-consuming; the number of reviewsavailable in the Web is far from many. Given a user and an item our goal is to identify the top-$ k $ meaningful phrases/tags to help her review the item easily.

Ad-wire: Add-on for web item reviewing system,Rajeshkumar Kannapalli; Azade Nazi; Mahashweta Das; Gautam Das,Abstract Over the past few decades as purchasing options moved online; the widespreaduse and popularity of online review sites has simultaneously increased. In spite of the factthat a huge extent of buying choices today are driven by numeric scores (eg; rating aproduct); detailed reviews play an important role for activities like purchasing an expensiveDSLR camera. Since writing a detailed review for an item is usually time-consuming; thenumber of reviews available in the Web is far from many. In this paper; we build a system AD-WIRE that given a user and an item; our system identifies the top-k meaningful tags to helpher review the item easily. AD-WIRE allows a user to compose her review by quicklyselecting from among the set of returned tags or writes her own review.

A hybrid solution for mixed workloads on dynamic graphs.,Mahashweta Das; Alkis Simitsis; Kevin Wilkinson,ABSTRACT The scale and significance of graph structured data today has led to thedevelopment of graph management systems that are optimized either for graph navigationrequests or graph analytic requests. We present a general purpose graph system thatprovides high performance concurrently for both navigation and analytic requests. Inaddition; it supports highly dynamic graphs wherein vertices and edges are added ordeleted and properties are modified. Our solution employs a hybrid architecture comprisingtwo graph engines; one for each workload; with a synchronization unit to manage updatesand a federation layer to present the hybrid system as a single API to graph applications. Wedevelop a proof-of-concept; describe its implementation in details; and present experimentalresults that demonstrate its potential.,GRADES,2016,1
METHOD AND APPARATUS TO BUILD FLOWCHARTS FOR E-SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS,*,An advisor flowchart is built; which flowchart comprises a set of nodes and each node isassociated with a user attribute selected from a set of user attributes in a user space; the setof attributes comprising information about users; eg; lifestyles; interests; demographics; etc.and each node is associated with a ranking of products from a product space. The advisorflowchart may be used to make a set of recommendations available to a user; where the setof recommendations comprise one or more top-ranked products associated with the node atwhich the user is currently positioned. At each node; the associated user attribute is used toformulate a question that may be posed to the user. The user's answer to the question maybe used to progress to another node of the advisor flowchart.,*,2014,1
Structured analytics in social media,Mahashweta Das; Gautam Das,Abstract The rise of social media has turned the Web into an online community wherepeople connect; communicate; and collaborate with each other. Structured analytics insocial media is the process of discovering the structure of the relationships emerging fromthis social media use. It focuses on identifying the users involved; the activities theyundertake; the actions they perform; and the items (eg; movies; restaurants; blogs; etc.) theycreate and interact with. There are two key challenges facing these tasks: how to organizeand model social media content; which is often unstructured in its raw form; in order toemploy structured analytics on it; and how to employ analytics algorithms to capture bothexplicit link-based relationships and implicit behavior-based relationships.

Scripts arerarely written or documented with discovery in mind; and the APIs on which they depend arefrequently inconsistent; further limiting reuse. For mobile devices the App Catalog serves asan essential intermediary; streamlining the process both for developers and end users.We've created an experimental platform called CLASP (Cloud Application Services Platform)applying that model by publishing services and datasets instead of apps. It includes supportfor existing APIs; and we've also created an SDK (software development kit); so our userscan write other operations themselves and easily publish in the catalog for later discoveryand reuse.,*,2015,*
CrowdMGR: Interactive Visual Analytics to Interpret Crowdsourced Data,Abon Chaudhuri; Mahashweta Das,ABSTRACT Crowdsourcing is popularly defined as a paradigm that utilizes humanprocessing power to solve problems that computers cannot yet solve. While recent researchhas been dedicated to improve the problem-solving potential of crowdsourcing activities; notmuch has been done to help a user quickly extract the valuable knowledge fromcrowdsourced solutions to a problem; without having to spend a lot of time examining allcontent in details. Online knowledge-sharing forums (Y! Answers; Quora; andStackOverflow); review aggregation platforms (Amazon; Yelp; and IMDB); etc. are allinstances of crowdsourcing sites which users visit to find out solutions to problems. In thispaper; we build a system CrowdMGR that performs visual analytics to help users manageand interpret crowdsourced data; and find relevant nuggets of information.

Exploratory mining of collaborative social content,Mahashweta Das,Abstract The widespread use and growing popularity of online collaborative content sites(eg; Yelp; Amazon; IMDB) has created rich resources for users to consult in order to makepurchasing decisions on various items such as restaurants; e-commerce products; movies;etc. It has also created new opportunities for producers of such items to improve business bydesigning better products; composing succinct advertisement snippets and building smartpersonalized recommendation systems. This motivates us to develop a framework forexploratory mining of user feedback on items in collaborative content sites. Typically; theamount of user feedback associated with item (s) can easily reach hundreds or thousands ofratings; tags or reviews; resulting in an overwhelming amount of information; which usersmay find difficult to cope with. For example; popular restaurants listed in the review site …,Proceedings of the 2013 SIGMOD/PODS Ph. D. symposium,2013,*
Top-K Product Design Based on Collaborative Tagging Data,Mahashweta Das; Gautam Das; Vagelis Hristidis,Abstract: The widespread use and popularity of collaborative content sites (eg; IMDB;Amazon; Yelp; etc.) has created rich resources for users to consult in order to makepurchasing decisions on various products such as movies; e-commerce products;restaurants; etc. Products with desirable tags (eg; modern; reliable; etc.) have higherchances of being selected by prospective customers. This creates an opportunity for productdesigners to design better products that are likely to attract desirable tags when published.In this paper; we investigate how to mine collaborative tagging data to decide the attributevalues of new products and to return the top-k products that are likely to attract the maximumnumber of desirable tags when published. Given a training set of existing products with theirfeatures and user-submitted tags; we first build a Naive Bayes Classifier for each tag. We …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1304.0419,2013,*
