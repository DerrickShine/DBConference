Hadoop++: making a yellow elephant run like a cheetah (without it even noticing),Jens Dittrich; Jorge-Arnulfo Quiané-Ruiz; Alekh Jindal; Yagiz Kargin; Vinay Setty; Jörg Schad,Abstract MapReduce is a computing paradigm that has gained a lot of attention in recentyears from industry and research. Unlike parallel DBMSs; MapReduce allows non-expertusers to run complex analytical tasks over very large data sets on very large clusters andclouds. However; this comes at a price: MapReduce processes tasks in a scan-orientedfashion. Hence; the performance of Hadoop---an open-source implementation ofMapReduce---often does not match the one of a well-configured parallel DBMS. In thispaper we propose a new type of system named Hadoop++: it boosts task performancewithout changing the Hadoop framework at all (Hadoop does not even'notice it'). To reachthis goal; rather than changing a working system (Hadoop); we inject our technology at theright places through UDFs only and affect Hadoop from inside. This has three important …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,464
Poldercast: Fast; robust; and scalable architecture for P2P topic-based pub/sub,Vinay Setty; Maarten Van Steen; Roman Vitenberg; Spyros Voulgaris,Abstract We propose PolderCast; a P2P topic-based Pub/Sub system that is (a) fault-tolerantand robust;(b) scalable wrt the number of nodes interested in a topic and number of topicsthat nodes are interested in; and (c) fast in terms of dissemination latency while (d) attaininga low communication overhead. This combination of properties is provided by animplementation that blends deterministic propagation over maintained rings withprobabilistic dissemination following a limited number of random shortcuts. The rings areconstructed and maintained using gossiping techniques. The random shortcuts are providedby two distinct peer-sampling services: Cyclon generates purely random links while Vicinityproduces interest-induced random links. We analyze PolderCast and survey it in the contextof existing approaches. We evaluate PolderCast experimentally using real-world …,Proceedings of the 13th International Middleware Conference,2012,56
The hidden pub/sub of spotify:(industry article),Vinay Setty; Gunnar Kreitz; Roman Vitenberg; Maarten Van Steen; Guido Urdaneta; Staffan Gimåker,Abstract Spotify is a peer-assisted music streaming service that has gained worldwidepopularity. Apart from providing instant access to over 20 million music tracks; Spotify alsoenhances its users' music experience by providing various features for social interaction.These are realized by a system using the widely-adopted pub/sub paradigm. In this paperwe provide an interesting case study of a hybrid pub/sub system designed for real-time aswell as offline notifications for Spotify users. We firstly describe a multitude of use caseswhere pub/sub is applied. Secondly; we study the design of its pub/sub system used formatching; disseminating and persisting billions of publications every day. Finally; we studypub/sub traffic collected from the production system; derive characterizations of the pub/subworkload; and show some interesting findings and trends.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Distributed event-based systems,2013,27
Cost-effective resource allocation for deploying pub/sub on cloud,Vinay Setty; Roman Vitenberg; Gunnar Kreitz; Guido Urdaneta; Maarten Van Steen,Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is a popular communication paradigm in the design of large-scale distributed systems. A fundamental challenge in deploying pub/sub systems on a datacenter or a cloud infrastructure is efficient and cost-effective resource allocation that wouldallow delivery of notifications to all subscribers. In this paper; we provide answers to thefollowing three fundamental questions: Given a pub/sub workload;(1) what is the minimumamount of resources needed to satisfy all the subscribers;(2) what is a cost-effective way toallocate resources for the given workload; and (3) what is the cost of hosting it on a publicInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider like Amazon EC2. To answer these questions; weformulate a problem coined Minimum Cost Subscriber Satisfaction (MCSS). We prove MCSSto be NP-hard and provide an efficient heuristic solution based on a combination of …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2014 IEEE 34th International Conference on,2014,17
As time goes by: comprehensive tagging of textual phrases with temporal scopes,Erdal Kuzey; Vinay Setty; Jannik Strötgen; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Temporal expressions (TempEx's for short) are increasingly important in search;question answering; information extraction; and more. Techniques for identifying andnormalizing explicit temporal expressions work well; but are not designed for and cannotcope with textual phrases that denote named events; such as" Clinton's term as secretary ofstate". This paper addresses the problem of detecting such temponyms; inferring theirtemporal scopes; and mapping them to events in a knowledge base if present there. Wepresent methods for this kind of temponym resolution; using an entity-and TempEx-orienteddocument model and the Yago knowledge base for distant supervision. We develop a familyof Integer Linear Programs for jointly inferring temponym mappings to the timeline andknowledge base. This enriches the document representation and also extends the …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web,2016,13
InZeit: efficiently identifying insightful time points,Vinay Setty; Srikanta Bedathur; Klaus Berberich; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Web archives are useful resources to find out about the temporal evolution ofpersons; organizations; products; or other topics. However; even when advanced text searchfunctionality is available; gaining insights into the temporal evolution of a topic can be atedious task and often requires sifting through many documents. The demonstrated systemnamed InZeit (pronounced" insight") assists users by determining insightful time points for agiven query. These are the time points at which the top-k time-travel query result changessubstantially and for which the user should therefore inspect query results. InZeit determinesthe m most insightful time points efficiently using an extended segment tree for in-memorybookkeeping.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,12
Maximizing the number of satisfied subscribers in pub/sub systems under capacity constraints,Vinay Setty; Gunnar Kreitz; Guido Urdaneta; Roman Vitenberg; Maarten van Steen,Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is a popular communication paradigm in the design of large-scale distributed systems. A provider of a pub/sub service (whether centralized; peer-assisted; or based on a federated organization of cooperatively managed servers)commonly faces a fundamental challenge: given limited resources; how to maximize thesatisfaction of subscribers? We provide; to the best of our knowledge; the first formaltreatment of this problem by introducing two metrics that capture subscriber satisfaction inthe presence of limited resources. This allows us to formulate matters as two new flavors ofmaximum coverage optimization problems. Unfortunately; both variants of the problem proveto be NP-hard. By subsequently providing formal approximation bounds and heuristics; weshow; however; that efficient approximations can be attained.

Temponym tagging: Temporal scopes for textual phrases,Erdal Kuzey; Jannik Strötgen; Vinay Setty; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract For many NLP and IR applications; anchored temporal information extracted fromtextual documents is of utmost importance. Thus; temporal tagging--the extraction andnormalization of temporal expressions--has gained a lot of attention in recent years andseveral tools such as HeidelTime and SUTime are proposed. However; such tools do notaddress textual phrases with temporal scopes like" Clinton's time as First Lady". While suchphrases (so-called temponyms) are not temporal expressions per se; information about theirtemporal scopes can be helpful in many scenarios; eg; in the context of temporal informationretrieval. In this paper; we describe the integration of a wide range of temponyms to thepublicly available temporal tagger HeidelTime to include temponym tagging.,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web,2016,6
Publish/Subscribe for Large-Scale Social Interaction: Design; Analysis and Resource Provisioning,Vinay Jayarama Setty,Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is a popular communication paradigm in the design of large-scale distributed systems. We are witnessing an increasingly widespread use of pub/sub fora wide array of applications both in industry and academia. For instance; the pub/subparadigm is used for RSS feed notifications; financial data dissemination and businessprocess management. Pub/sub has also been used in social interaction messagenotifications such as in Spotify. Social network interactions have grown exponentially inrecent years to the order of billions of notifications generated by millions of users every day.However; there are a number of critical challenges yet to be addressed to design a pub/subsystem that can scale massively. Pub/sub systems are generally deployed in centralizeddatacenters or using federated organizations of cooperatively managed servers. However …,*,2015,4
Modeling event importance for ranking daily news events,Vinay Setty; Abhijit Anand; Arunav Mishra; Avishek Anand,Abstract We deal with the problem of ranking news events on a daily basis for large newscorpora; an essential building block for news aggregation. News ranking has beenaddressed in the literature before but with individual news articles as the unit of ranking.However; estimating event importance accurately requires models to quantify current dayevent importance as well as its significance in the historical context. Consequently; in thispaper we show that a cluster of news articles representing an event is a better unit of rankingas it provides an improved estimation of popularity; source diversity and authority cues. Inaddition; events facilitate quantifying their historical significance by linking them with long-running topics and recent chain of events. Our main contribution in this paper is to provideeffective models for improved news event ranking. To this end; we propose novel event …,Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2017,3
Finding diverse needles in a haystack of comments: social media exploration for news,Hang Zhang; Vinay Setty,Abstract Use of social media platforms to express opinion and discuss various topics hasbeen increasingly popular. Consequently; huge volume of social media data is generated byusers across all these platforms; eg users comment on a variety of content items such asnews articles; videos; images on social media. These comments are often noisy and sparse;therefore; identifying sub-topics within them to explore social media is a challenge. In thispaper; we develop an effective way to distill sub-topics from all the comments related to atextual query and apply two different diversification techniques to select comments.

RichNote: Adaptive selection and delivery of rich media notifications to mobile users,Md Yusuf Sarwar Uddin; Vinay Setty; Ye Zhao; Roman Vitenberg; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In recent years; notification services for social networks; mobile apps; messaging systemsand other electronic services have become truly ubiquitous. When a new content becomesavailable; the service sends an instant notification to the user. When the content is producedin massive quantities; and it includes both large-size media and a lot of meta-information; itgives rise to a major challenge of selecting content to notify about and information to includein such notifications. We tackle three important challenges in realizing rich notificationdelivery:(1) content and presentation utility modeling;(2) notification selection and (3)scheduling of delivery. We consider a number of progressive presentation levels for thecontent. Since utility is subjective and hard to model; we rely on real data and user surveys.We model the content utility by learning from large-scale real world data collected from …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on,2016,2
Towards content-based publish/subscribe for distributed social networks,Christos Tryfonopoulos; Paraskevi Raftopoulou; Vinay Setty; Argiris Xiros,Abstract Over the last few years a number of distributed social networks with datamanagement capabilities have been introduced both by academia and industry. However;none of these efforts have so far focused on supporting content-based publish/subscribefunctionality in a distributed social networking environment. In this work we present a socialnetworking architecture that offers content-based pub/sub functionality-in addition to theusual social interaction and data management tasks-in distributed social networks; outlinethe associated distributed protocols; and hint on coping with diversification in pub/sub forsuch scenarios. To the best of our knowledge; our system is the first of its kind to offer suchan unique combination of features in a decentralised setting. Finally; we highlight thefeasibility of the proposal by means of experimentation with real social networking data …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2015,2

Estimating Event Focus Time Using Neural Word Embeddings,Supratim Das; Arunav Mishra; Klaus Berberich; Vinay Setty,Abstract Time associated with news events has been leveraged as a complementarydimension to text in several applications such as temporal information retrieval; news eventlinking; etc. Short textual event descriptions (eg; single sentences) are prevalent in webdocuments (also considered as inputs in the above applications) and often lack explicittemporal expressions for grounding them to a precise time period. For example; the eventdescription;" France swears in Emmanuel Macron as the 25th President"; lacks temporalcues to indicate that the event occurred in the year" 2017". Thus; we address the problem ofestimating event focus time defined as a time interval with maximum association therebyindicating its occurrence period.

BioNex: A System For Biomedical News Event Exploration,Patrick Ernst; Arunav Mishra; Avishek Anand; Vinay Setty,Abstract We demonstrate BioNex; a system to mine; rank and visualize biomedical newsevents. BioNex takes biomedical queries such as" Ebola virus disease" and retrieves the kmost relevant news events for them. To achieve this we first mine the generic news eventsby clustering them on a daily basis using general named entities and textual features. Theseclusters are also tagged with disambiguated biomedical entities which aid in biomedicalnews event exploration. The clusters are then used to compute the importance scores for theevent clusters based on a combination of textual; semantic; popularity and historicalimportance features. BioNex also visualizes the retrieved event clusters to highlight the topnews events and corresponding news articles for the given query.

Towards Publish/Subscribe Functionality on Graphs,Lefteris Zervakis; Christos Tryfonopoulos; Vinay Setty; Stephan Seufert; Spiros Skiadopoulos,ABSTRACT In this work; we introduce the publish/subscribe paradigm to support continuousquery processing over evolving graphs and motivate it for a number of applications and avariety of possible continuous queries. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work inthe literature that considers supporting publish/subscribe in graphs; we focus specifically onmassive and dynamically evolving graphs due to the nature of the problem and the type oftargeted applications. To this end; we design a proof-of-concept filtering algorithm forsupporting structural matching of continuous graph queries against updates in the evolvinggraph and demonstrate the need for efficient filtering by experimentally comparing ouralgorithm against a baseline approach.,2nd International Workshop on Preservation of Evolving Big Data,2016,*
Exploring Long Running News Stories using Wikipedia,Jaspreet Singh; Abhijit Anand; Vinay Setty; Avishek Anand,Abstract A significant portion of today's news articles are part of long running stories. Tobetter understand the context of these stories journalists; social scientists and other scholarsuse news collections to find temporal and topical insights. However these insights aredevoid of user impressions; derived from click-through data and query logs; and are onlyreliable if the collection is complete and consistent. In this work we introduce the notion ofcombining user impressions from Wikipedia with news collection based insights for longrunning news story exploration and outline promising new research directions. We alsodemonstrate our initial attempts with a prototype system called NewsEX.,Proceedings of the ACM Web Science Conference,2015,*

A Simple Approach to Synthetic Time Traces Generated from Basic Parameters,Hui Jin,High-fidelity multiphase flow models of the well hydraulics and flow lines in production anddrilling are used to simulate and test control systems. Examples of such application aremultiphase flow in oil production managed pressure drilling; under-balanced drilling andautomated well control in drilling; where automatic control systems are used to stabilizepressure or flow in various ways. A discrepancy of existing high-fidelity models; is that theydo not reproduce qualitatively realistic colored noise as that caused by various flowphenomena; such as waves; hydrodynamic slugging and other unmodelled stochastic flowdynamics. This means the control systems cannot be tested properly for robustness withrespect to realistic colored noise by simulations; which is a fundamental limitation in thedevelopment and testing of control systems for these applications.,*,2013,*
