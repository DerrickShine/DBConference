Introduction: The political economy of financialization,Jonathan P Goldstein,The literature on financialization is less than a decade old. 1 Epstein (2005) contains someof the earliest papers presented at a 2001 conference and updated for publication. While acommon definition of financialization has not emerged in the existing literature (Epstein2005: 3) nor in the papers in this issue; clear tendencies have emerged. The most dominanttrend has been to follow the lead of Hilferding (1981 [1910]) by contributing to what can beconsidered a sequel to Finance Capital. For the purposes of this introduction; I employ thisconcept of financialization as a process that alters the fundamental aspects of capitalistmicro and macro dynamics. Hilferding's class-based study of a new phase of capitalistaccumulation associated with the concentration and centralization of capital and the rise topower of a class of finance capitalists provides a general framework that has proven …,*,2009,35
The cyclical profit squeeze: a Marxian microfoundation,Jonathan P Goldstein,This paper develops a microfoundation for the cyclical profit squeeze theory of crisis. Anoptimal cyclical mark-up pricing policy is derived. The mark-up rises from initial trough untilmidexpansion and then declines until the terminal trough. The necessary and sufficientconditions for the resulting decline in the profit rate are the capital-labor struggle whichdetermines the behavior of costs and the competition among capitals which restricts risingcosts from being fully passed on. It is also shown that this optimal mark-up behavior servesas a microfoundation for a profit squeeze theory of the business cycle.,Review of Radical Political Economics,1985,35
Predator–prey model estimates of the cyclical profit squeeze,Jonathan P Goldstein,Abstract This paper extends the empirical literature on the cyclical profit squeeze (CPS)theory of crisis by developing a multivariate model with superior decomposition methods. Astructural time series (unobserved components) model with trend and structural VARcomponents is employed. The VAR captures the dynamic cyclical interaction betweenunemployment and profit's share of income and is interpreted as a linear version ofGoodwin's (1967) predator-prey model. Model extensions incorporate the accumulationprocess and structural shifts. Estimation results for the US economy are used to sort out thecontroversial relevance of the CPS in the post-1970 period. It is concluded that the CPS isrelevant during the period from 1949 to 1985; but is moderately weakened in the post-1970period. Inconclusive statistical support for the CPS is found for the post-1985 era.,Metroeconomica,1999,28
The empirical relevance of the cyclical profit squeeze: a reassertion,Jonathan P Goldstein,In recent years a number of studies (Epstein (1991); Michl (1988a; 1988b); Sherman (1990;1991); and Weisskopf (1988; 1992) have questioned the empirical relevance of the cyclicaland secular variants of the profit squeeze theory of crisis for the post-197O US economy.However; these studies contain a variety of methodological flaws which are sufficient basisto reopen the issue. In this light; the purpose of this paper is to provide alternative empiricalestimates of the relevance of the cyclical profit squeeze for the post-war US economy with aparticular focus on the post-1970 period. This literature has challenged the conditions ofexistence of the cyclical profit squeeze (CPS) and secular profit squeeze (SPS) in the post-1970 period. In particular; Epstein (1991) argues that a flexible exchange rate regime (1971-on) reduces the effective (international) competitive constraint on costinduced price …,Review of Radical Political Economics,1996,27
The simple analytics and empirics of the cyclical profit squeeze and cyclical underconsumption theories: clearing the air,Jonathan P Goldstein,This paper examines the controversies that exist between the cyclical profit squeeze (CPS)and nutcracker theories of cyclical crisis. The-simple analytics and empirics of both theoriesare examined. It is shown that the criticisms of the CPS advanced by Sherman (1997) areinvalid; and that the two components of the nutcracker theory—a cyclical underconsumptioncrisis plus a non-labor cost-induced decline in profits-have little relevance for explainingpostwar US business cycles.,Review of Radical Political Economics,1999,25
Markup variability and flexibility: Theory and empirical evidence,Jonathan Goldstein,This paper summarizes and empirically tests an alternative theory of markup pricing. It isconcluded that; over the typical business cycle;(1) the markup rises from initial trough untilthe midexpansion and then declines until the terminal trough and (2) markup flexibility ispositively related to the degree of (demand) competition. This cyclical pattern of markupvariability is shown to exist in major industry groups for all postwar cycles up to 1980.Regression analysis reveals that in highly concentrated industries a positive relation existsbetween markup flexibility and the level of import competition and a proxy for the elasticity ofdemand.,Journal of Business,1986,19
Marxian microfoundations: Contribution or detour?,Jonathan P Goldstein,This article celebrates and critically examines the twenty-five-year productive; yet highlycontroversial; Marxian microfoundations (MM) literature.

Havingestablished a methodological basis for MM; the micro contributions of the existing literatureare evaluated in the following subject areas: methodology; accumulation and crisis; laborprocess and labor market segmentation; technical change; and class and exploitation.

The existence; endogeneity; and synchronization of long waves: structural time series model estimates,Jonathan P Goldstein,In the spirit of David Gordon's application of advanced econometric techniques to problemsin political economy and his interest in long waves; this paper develops a structural timeseries model for testing the existence; endogeneity; and synchronization of long waves inthe output series for 11 countries. The results show a strong long wave pattern with a highdegree of endogenous behavior in 8 of 11 GDP series. Strong evidence for thesynchronization of long waves based on international transmission mechanisms is found;while weaker evidence exists for synchronization based on similar institutional structures.Other long wave hypotheses are also addressed.,Review of Radical Political Economics,1999,18

The Intergenerational Supply of Loggers Under Conditions of Declining Economic Well‐Being,Jonathan P Goldstein; Lloyd C Irland; Jennifer A Senick; Eric W Bassett,Abstract This paper addresses the supply-side explanations of a logger shortage byestimating an occupational choice model that considers the role of earnings; nonpecuniarydeterminants and intergenerational factors. Our results showed that:(1) relative earningshave no statistically significant effect on career choice;(2) improvement in the public imageof loggers substantially increases entry into logging; and (3) a strong intergenerationalsupply linkage exists but is currently being eroded.,Industrial Relations: a Journal of Economy and Society,2005,14
Mark-up pricing over the business cycle: the microfoundations of the variable mark-up,Jonathan P Goldstein,While considerable attention has been paid either to the fixity or variability of the mark-upand thus the profit rate; the existing literature has failed to develop a serious microeconomicunderpinning. The purpose of this paper is to construct a microeconomic model for theoptimal cyclical behavior of the mark-up and to analyze its implications for mark-upvariability. The debate over the variability of the mark-up has been primarily empirical innature. The major area of contention has centered around the demand sensitivity of the mark-up.'On one hand; proponents of a cyclically fluctuating mark-up consider both cost anddemand determinants of the mark-up and focus on the income elasticity of demand toexplain mark-ups that rise during the expansion phase of the business cycle and declineduring the contraction. On the other hand; there are the cost dominated theories of the …,Southern Economic Journal,1986,14
Pricing; Accumulation; and Crisis in Post Keyesian Theory,Jonathan P Goldstein,The construction of steady state growth models as the centerpiece of the Post Keynesianmethodology has contributed significantly to our understanding of the dynamics of advancedcapitalist economies. In the past decade an emphasis on the microeconomic conditionsconsistent with macro-steady state growth models has emerged. The major limitation of thisapproach is its failure to consistently go beyond the often simplifying assumptionsunderlying steady state economics in order to conduct an analysis which includes thepossibility of endogenous economic instability. 1 In particular; a Post Keynesian theory of theinteraction between pricing and accumulation decisions where economic crisis may emergeas a logical outcome has not been fully explored.,Journal of Post Keynesian Economics,1985,14
Is the endogenous business cycle dead?,Jonathan P Goldstein,A clearly defined dichotomy exists in the business cycle literature between endogenous andexoge-nous cycles. Exogenous cycles are either temporary; heavily damped randomdeviations from a stable long-run growth path or permanent stochastic fluctuations in thegrowth path which both require repeated stochastic impulses to generate typically observedrecurrent and irregular fluctuations. In contrast; endogenous cycles are systematic(deterministic); self-generating recurrent cycles that result from the inherent instability(structure) of the underlying economy. The most recent and most severe critiques ofendogenous theory are empirical in nature and stem from the unit root debates whichcontrast trend stationary (TS) and difference stationary (DS) models. Despite this critique; theevolution of this methodology has produced conflicting results with respect to the most …,Southern Economic Journal,1997,11
The global relevance of Marxian crisis theory,Jonathan P Goldstein,As we approach the dawn of the twenty-first century; 150 years after the development ofMarx's crisis theory; it seems appropriate to reassess the relevance of this approach forunderstanding the potential crisis tendencies of global capitalism. Here; I focus only on theimportant long-term tendency for capitalist economies to produce a continuing succession ofprofit squeeze (PS) and underconsumption (UC) crises and assess the likelihood that aglobal UC crisis will evolve out of the institutional and policy changes that emerged inresponse to the well-documented PS crisis of the postwar period.,Political economy and contemporary capitalism: Radical perspectives on economic theory and policy,2000,10
20 Heterodox macroeconomics and the current global financial crisis,Jonathan P Goldstein,This concluding chapter applies the integrated heterodox macrofoundations developed inthis volume to explain the current global financial crisis. I argue that to effectively understandthe current global crisis of capitalism requires the integration of various strands of heterodoxcrisis theory; particularly Keynesian; Marxian and Institutionalist approaches. 1 The chaptersin Parts I; II and III of this book; particularly those authored by Goldstein (Chapters 3 and 8);Dymski (Chapter 5); Orhanganzi (Chapter 9); Boddy (Chapter 12) and Kotz (Chapter 13)provide an essential foundation for achieving this goal.,Heterodox Macroeconomics,2009,8
An introduction to a unified heterodox macroeconomic theory,Jonathan P Goldstein,In the Neoliberal era; free market economics/ideology and the associated doctrines of freetrade and financial liberalization have guided the economic development of an integratedworld economy. The resulting development path has been marred by increasing incomeinequality; financial crises; slow aggregate demand growth; destructive competition and atendency to global excess capacity and unemployment. These outcomes arise from theanarchy and inherent contradictions of global free markets and the accompanyingcomplement of Neoliberal policies. The benefits of this Neoliberal regime have primarilyaccrued to financial capitalists and; to a lesser extent; to international industrial capitalists atthe expense of other social groups. Despite this poor track record; the economic foundationsthat underlie this development strategy–neoclassical microeconomics and new classical …,Heterodox Macroeconomics,2009,6
The profit squeeze is supported by the PW cycle indicator,JP Goldstein,Abstract This paper questions Van Lear's (1999) conclusion that the cyclical profit squeezemechanism is irrelevant for understanding post World War II business cycles. It is shown thathis conclusion erroneously emanates from either a misreading of the evidence or theapplication of an overly restrictive and irrelevant condition for the existence of a profitsqueeze. It is concluded that Van Lear's data and other data in the literature support thecyclical profit squeeze as a viable explanation of post war cycles.,Review of Radical Political Economics,2002,6

Heterodox Macroeconomics: Crotty's Integration of Keynes and Marx,Jonathan P Goldstein,While heterodox macroeconomic theories agree on a set of general principles; there is farless agreement on specific behavioral relations. With the goal of developing a more potentheterodox framework through the integration of Keynesian; Marxian; and institutionalistperspectives; I consider the seminal work of James Crotty. Crotty has developed the buildingblocks of an integrated heterodox macro theory that revolve around the nexus of theconcepts of fundamental uncertainty; financial fragility; impatient finance; irreversibleinvestment; adversarial class relations; the Marxian concept of competition; Marxian crisistheory; and effective demand. This integration considers numerous dichotomies/regimeshifts that are useful for understanding the path of capitalist development.,Review of Radical Political Economics,2008,5
Mark-up Pricing and the Business Cycle: The Microfoundation of the Variable Mark-up,Jonathan Paul Goldstein,Abstract The purpose of this dissertation is twofold. First; an alternative microfoundation formark-up pricing over the business cycle is developed. Second; the macroeconomicimplications of this microfoundation are examined and an alternative theory of therelationship between mark-up pricing and accumulation is advanced. Three majorhypotheses are considered. It is hypothesized that an optimal cyclical pricing policy for anoligopolistic price leader faced with dynamic cost and demand behavior and internationalcompetition is a variable mark-up. That is; the mark-up rises from initial trough until themidexpansion of the typical business cycle and then declines from that point until theterminal trough. Secondly; it is hypothesized that increases in the degree of competitionincrease the cyclical flexibility of the optimal mark-up policy. That is; the absolute value of …,*,1982,5
8 A Keynes–Marx theory of investment,Jonathan P Goldstein,The theory of investment lies at the center of an integrated heterodox macro model. 1 Yet;heterodox theories of investment have not advanced beyond simplistic expressions of theinvestment function. In particular; Keynesian investment functions have focused on capacityutilization as the primary determinant of investment; while Marxian approaches haveconcentrated on the profit rate. These simplistic theories are inadequate for understandingthe complex macroeconomic dynamics of the capitalist growth process in the era of theNeoliberal regime. Thus; the purpose of this chapter is to extend the basic theory ofinvestment in order to better explain the macro dynamics of the global economy. Based onthe work of Crotty (1993) and Crotty and Goldstein (1992a; 1992b; 1992c); I develop amicrofoundation for the firm's investment decision. This theory integrates both Keynesian …,Heterodox macroeconomics: Keynes; Marx and globalization,2009,4
Self-insurance: The case of motorcycle helmets,Jonathan P Goldstein,This article develops the economic implications of a head-neck injury tradeoff that underliesthe technological limitations of motorcycle helmets as a form of self-insurance. Conditionalon this tradeoff; an analysis of the optimal self-insurance decision establishes thatmandatory helmet use legislation results in expected welfare losses for a subset of themotorcycling population. These losses are not compensated by other forms of self-insuranceexpenditures because such expenditures are suboptimal. In the case of increased riskaversion; the model generates standard results for loss reduction activities with knownproductivities.,Journal of Risk and Insurance,1996,4
The Impact of Profitability; Financial Fragility and Competitive Regime Shifts on Investment Demand: Empirical Evidence,James Crotty; Jonathan Goldstein,Abstract Crotty and Goldstein have developed a hybrid post-Keynesian/neo-Schumpeteriantheory of investment demand. In this micro-founded theory of accumulation; the optimalinvestment decision depends on the level of expected profitability; the degree of competition;and the degree of financial fragility. Its core assumptions are: i) the future is unknowable inprinciple; ii) physical capital is illiquid and the accumulation process is substantiallyirreversible; iii) managers and owners are distinct economic agents with an unresolvedprincipal-agent conflict; and iv) management seeks the long-term growth and financialstability of the firm itself; and guards its decision-making authority against encroachment bystockholders and creditors. In this model; there is an unavoidable growth-safety tradeoff: thefirm's drive for growth and profits is constrained by management's desire for financial …,*,1992,4
The intersection of victims’ and offenders’ sex and race/ethnicity on prosecutorial decisions for violent crimes,Ira Sommers; Jonathan Goldstein; Deborah Baskin,The research considers the influence of extralegal factors; particularly interactions amongvictim/offender relationship; sex; and race/ethnicity; on prosecutors' decisions to dismisscriminal charges; plea; or proceed to trial for violent crimes. Minority males; particularly blackmales; were less likely to receive a plea (versus a trial) regardless of the victim's sex orrace/ethnicity. Minority males were also less likely to receive a plea if the victim was white.Alternatively; in prosecutorial dismissals; black and Hispanic males were treated no moreharshly than were any of the race/ethnicity–sex categories examined. The findings suggestthat failure to consider the sex and race/ethnicity of both defendants and victims may resultin inaccurate conclusions about how these variables affect prosecutorial decisions.,Justice System Journal,2014,3

Cutting off the Canadians: Nativism and the fate of the Maine Woodman's Association; 1970-1981,Michael Hillard; Jonathan P Goldstein,In October 1975; Maine's native woodcutters conducted an audacious; statewide strike thatled to an unprecedented two-week shutdown of the state's dominant paper industry. Thestrike surprised the industry; the state; and the strikers themselves. While the strike waslargely considered a failure by all sides; it was the beginning of a six-year movement thathad a significant impact on the industry and labor conditions. These impacts ultimatelyproved fleeting; and the movement itself was riven by a host of problems; including theseYankee loggers' nativist sentiments and their unfavorable legal status as contract workers.This essay tells their story.

Gender in American Tobacco Cards 1880–1920: The Role of Coercive Competition,Jonathan P Goldstein,This paper adds to the literature on Marxian coercive competition and its negative economicand social outcomes. An historical and econometric analysis of competitive intensity and theportrayal of women in one early form of tobacco advertising is conducted using an originaldata set. The historical analysis establishes the nature and intensity of competitive relations.Estimation results for a multinomial logit model for various portrayals of women show that a1% increase in the market share of independent producers caused a 0.35–0.7% and 2.5–4.5% increase in the likelihood that women were included and treated exploitatively in adsin early and late competitive periods; respectively.,Review of Political Economy,2012,2

More cost-effective surgical techniques and the centralization/regionalization ofservices are two solutions. The former requires an assessment of newer minimally invasiveand muscle-sparing surgical techniques. The latter necessitates an effective volume–outcome (VO) relationship. Prior studies have failed to evaluate and control for the VOrelation.

Taking the High Road Only to Arrive at the Low Road: The Creation of a Reserve Army of Petty Capitalists in the North Maine Woods,Jonathan P Goldstein; Michael G Hillard,Class relations in wood harvesting in Maine are analyzed. An unexpected high-roadstrategy emerges from the adoption of new technology for corporate crews (wage labor).This high-road policy is enhanced by the class struggle of independent logging contractors(petty capitalists). The ultimate diffusion of this technology to contractors reversed thisstrategy by allowing company crews to be disbanded. This created a reserve army of pettycapitalists and a resultant increase in the rate of exploitation.,Review of Radical Political Economics,2008,1

Race in Early Tobacco Advertising: The Case of American Tobacco Cards 1880-1911,Jonathan P Goldstein,This paper analyzes the inclusion/exclusion and portrayal of minorities (African and NativeAmerican) in one early form of tobacco advertising: American tobacco cards from 1880-1911. I test hypotheses related to: 1) attempts to hide the accomplishments/lifestyle ofminorities; 2) the inclusion of minorities for exploitative purposes; 3) the role of competitionon discrimination; and 4) the existence of progressive undercurrents in this form ofadvertising. My econometric analysis shows that American tobacco cards contributed viaexclusion to the hidden from view treatment of minority lifestyles. The majority of minorityinclusions was exploitative in nature promoting racial stereotyping and niche audiencemarketing; yet a limited progressive undercurrent of treatment; particularly for NativeAmericans; did emerge.

Recently; there has beena revival in business cycle pedagogy in the form of both texts and individual courseofferings. Contributing to this renaissance are: 1) the occurrence of more severe cyclicalcrises from 1973; 2) the internationalization of the business cycle; and 3) the occurrence ofcycles with profound financial influences.
