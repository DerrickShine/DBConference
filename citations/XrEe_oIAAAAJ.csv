Life-cycle of structural systems: recent achievements and future directions,Dan M Frangopol; Mohamed Soliman,Structural systems are under deterioration due to ageing; mechanical stressors; and harshenvironment; among other threats. Corrosion and fatigue can cause gradual structuraldeterioration. Moreover; natural and man-made hazards may lead to a sudden drop in thestructural performance. Inspection and maintenance actions are performed to monitor thestructural safety and maintain the performance over certain thresholds. However; theseactions must be effectively planned throughout the life-cycle of a system to ensure theoptimum budget allocation and maximum possible service life without adverse effects on thestructural system safety.

Probabilistic optimum inspection planning of steel bridges with multiple fatigue sensitive details,Mohamed Soliman; Dan M Frangopol; Sunyong Kim,Abstract Inspection planning of fatigue sensitive bridges is a complex process. This; in part;is due to various uncertainties associated with the damage propagation and the detectiontechnique used to perform inspections. The planning process starts with identifying the mostcritical locations of fatigue damage occurrence. In this context; non-destructive testing (NDT)techniques; applied at different times along the service life; can be used to monitor the crackgrowth and support the fatigue life estimation. The next step is to establish an inspectionplan which considers the available budget and the target performance level of theinvestigated bridge. This paper proposes a probabilistic approach for providing effectiveinspection plans for fatigue critical bridges. The proposed approach considers multiplefatigue critical locations in the bridge and chooses the best inspection option among a set …,Engineering Structures,2013,28

Probabilistic fatigue life estimation of steel bridges by using a bilinear S-N approach,Kihyon Kwon; Dan M Frangopol; Mohamed Soliman,This paper focuses on estimating the fatigue life below the constant amplitude fatiguethreshold (CAFT) of steel bridges by using a probabilistic approach on the basis of a bilinearstress life (ie; the SN approach). The current AASHTO SN approach uses a single SN line forpredicting the fatigue life. However; because of the variation of actual applied live-loadstress cycles; this approach very often results in a severe underestimation of the useful life ofstructures. It implies that fatigue damage in respective structural steel details may beoverestimated. To improve fatigue life estimation; a bilinear SN approach is integrated into aprobabilistic framework that can model the uncertainties associated with the fatiguedeterioration process. In this approach; the equivalent stress range is computed by usingtwo SN slopes and several probability density functions associated with stress ranges …,Journal of Bridge Engineering,2011,22

Fatigue assessment and service life prediction of existing steel bridges by integrating SHM into a probabilistic bilinear S-N approach,Mohamed Soliman; Dan M Frangopol; Kihyon Kown,Abstract Fatigue assessment of several steel bridge details; having equivalent stress rangebelow the constant amplitude fatigue threshold (CAFT); showed that many of these detailsare free of cracks; although the remaining life calculations predicted that they should havealready been suffering from cracks. This shows that the current methods for predicting thefatigue remaining life of steel bridges can be conservative and may lead to unnecessaryretrofit and rehabilitation actions. For a better fatigue life prediction; a bilinear SN approachhas been proposed. In this approach; the bilinear SN lines have different slopes above andbelow the CAFT.

A probabilistic approach for optimizing inspection; monitoring; and maintenance actions against fatigue of critical ship details,Mohamed Soliman; Dan M Frangopol; Alysson Mondoro,Abstract Fatigue is one of the main deteriorating mechanisms that affect the safety andreliability of ship structures. Fatigue cracks can appear at various locations along the shipstructure and may occur at early stages in the service life of a ship. Inspection; monitoringand/or repair actions are applied to prevent sudden failures of damaged structuralcomponents and their associated consequences. However; these actions increase theoperational cost of the ship and should be optimally planned during its service life. Due tothe presence of significant uncertainties associated with crack initiation and propagation; theplanning of such actions should be performed probabilistically.

Life-cycle cost evaluation of conventional and corrosion-resistant steel for bridges,Mohamed Soliman; Dan M Frangopol,Abstract Steel bridges that are under severe chloride exposure due to deicing salts ormarine environmental effects require frequent maintenance and repair activities to extendtheir service life and maintain an adequate performance level. In addition to the directmaintenance cost; these maintenance actions may lead to indirect costs associated withtraffic delays and environmental effects that can significantly increase the life-cycle cost ofthe bridge under consideration. The use of more sustainable materials; such asmaintenance-free steel; may increase the initial cost of the structure; however; the life-cyclecost; including the maintenance actions during the service life and their associated indirecteffects; can be significantly reduced.

Prediction of structural response of naval vessels based on available structural health monitoring data,Alysson Mondoro; Mohamed Soliman; Dan M Frangopol,Abstract Structural health monitoring (SHM) can be beneficial in reducing epistemicuncertainties associated with fatigue life prediction. For naval ships; available SHM data canbe discretized into operational cells; each referring to a certain navigation speed; headingangle; and sea condition. Cell-based approaches for predicting future fatigue life can beapplied if monitoring information is known for all cells. However; available SHM data maypopulate some; but not all; potential cells. Moreover; since SHM data is only available for agiven set of operating conditions; potential changes in climate or operational profiles cannotbe accounted for. Accordingly; there is a need for an approach to predict structuralresponses in unmonitored cells as a function of limited available monitoring data.

Nonlinear Prediction Surfaces for Estimating the Structural Response of Naval Vessels,Alysson Mondoro; Mohamed Soliman; Dan M Frangopol,Abstract Structural health monitoring (SHM) of naval vessels is essential for assessing theperformance of the structure and the fatigue damage accrued over the service life. The directintegration of available SHM data may be useful in reducing the epistemic uncertaintiesarising from inaccuracies in the modeling and the variations in the as-built structuralconfiguration from the initial design.

Life-cycle cost analysis of steel bridges under severe chloride exposure: A comparison between conventional and corrosion-resistant steel,M Soliman; DM Frangopol,ABSTRACT Steel bridges are under continuous deterioration due to various environmentaland mechanical stressors. This deterioration adversely affects the resistance and reliabilityof the structure resulting in a corresponding reduction in the safe service life. Among theeffects that impact the reliability of aging steel bridges and limit their service life is corrosion.Corrosion affects all steel bridge members and its effects are accelerated in the presence ofchloride deposits arising from marine environments or exposure to de-icing salts. Corrosioncan lead to a uniform loss in the thickness of affected elements; and in turn; reduce theirstructural capacity. This may eventually lead to failure in the corroded component when theload effects exceed the diminished capacity of the member.
