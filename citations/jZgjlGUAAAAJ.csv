K-automorphism: A general framework for privacy preserving network publication,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The growing popularity of social networks has generated interesting datamanagement and data mining problems. An important concern in the release of these datafor study is their privacy; since social networks usually contain personal information. Simplyremoving all identifiable personal information (such as names and social security number)before releasing the data is insufficient. It is easy for an attacker to identify the target byperforming different structural queries. In this paper we propose k-automorphism to protectagainst multiple structural attacks and develop an algorithm (called KM) that ensures k-automorphism. We also discuss an extension of KM to handle" dynamic" releases of thedata. Extensive experiments show that the algorithm performs well in terms of protection itprovides.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,334
gStore: answering SPARQL queries via subgraph matching,Lei Zou; Jinghui Mo; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Due to the increasing use of RDF data; efficient processing of SPARQL queriesover RDF datasets has become an important issue. However; existing solutions suffer fromtwo limitations: 1) they cannot answer SPARQL queries with wildcards in a scalable manner;and 2) they cannot handle frequent updates in RDF repositories efficiently. Thus; most ofthem have to reprocess the dataset from scratch. In this paper; we propose a graph-basedapproach to store and query RDF data. Rather than mapping RDF triples into a relationaldatabase as most existing methods do; we store RDF data as a large graph. A SPARQLquery is then converted into a corresponding subgraph matching query. In order to speed upquery processing; we develop a novel index; together with some effective pruning rules andefficient search algorithms. Our method can answer exact SPARQL queries and queries …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,167
Distance-join: Pattern match query in a large graph database,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The growing popularity of graph databases has generated interesting datamanagement problems; such as subgraph search; shortest-path query; reachabilityverification; and pattern match. Among these; a pattern match query is more flexiblecompared to a subgraph search and more informative compared to a shortest-path orreachability query. In this paper; we address pattern match problems over a large data graphG. Specifically; given a pattern graph (ie; query Q); we want to find all matches (in G) thathave the similar connections as those in Q. In order to reduce the search space significantly;we first transform the vertices into points in a vector space via graph embedding techniques;coverting a pattern match query into a distance-based multi-way join problem over theconverted vector space. We also propose several pruning strategies and a join order …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,162
A novel spectral coding in a large graph database,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yansheng Lu,Abstract Retrieving related graphs containing a query graph from a large graph database isa key issue in many graph-based applications; such as drug discovery and structural patternrecognition. Because sub-graph isomorphism is a NP-complete problem [4]; we have toemploy a filter-and-verification framework to speed up the search efficiency; that is; using aneffective and efficient pruning strategy to filter out the false positives (graphs that are notpossible in the results) as many as possible first; then validating the remaining candidatesby subgraph isomorphism checking. In this paper; we propose a novel filtering method; aspectral encoding method; ie GCoding. Specifically; we assign a signature to each vertexbased on its local structures. Then; we generate a spectral graph code by combining allvertex signatures in a graph. Based on spectral graph codes; we derive a necessary …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,127
Natural language question answering over RDF: a graph data driven approach,Lei Zou; Ruizhe Huang; Haixun Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wenqiang He; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract RDF question/answering (Q/A) allows users to ask questions in natural languagesover a knowledge base represented by RDF. To answer a national language question; theexisting work takes a two-stage approach: question understanding and query evaluation.Their focus is on question understanding to deal with the disambiguation of the naturallanguage phrases. The most common technique is the joint disambiguation; which has theexponential search space. In this paper; we propose a systematic framework to answernatural language questions over RDF repository (RDF Q/A) from a graph data-drivenperspective. We propose a semantic query graph to model the query intention in the naturallanguage question in a structural way; based on which; RDF Q/A is reduced to subgraphmatching problem. More importantly; we resolve the ambiguity of natural language …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,90
Dominant graph: An efficient indexing structure to answer top-k queries,Lei Zou; Lei Chen,Given a record set D and a query score function F; a top-k query returns k records from D;whose values of function F on their attributes are the highest. In this paper; we investigatethe intrinsic connection between top-k queries and dominant relationship between records;and based on which; we propose an efficient layer-based indexing structure; DominantGraph (DG); to improve the query efficiency. Specifically; DG is built offline to express thedominant relationship between records and top-k query is implemented as a graph traversalproblem; ie Traveler algorithm. We prove theoretically that the size of search space (that isthe number of retrieved records from the record set to answer top-k query) in our basicalgorithm is directly related to the cardinality of skyline points in the record set (see Theorem3.2). Based on the cost analysis; we propose the optimization technique; pseudo record …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,57
gStore: a graph-based SPARQL query engine,Lei Zou; M Tamer Özsu; Lei Chen; Xuchuan Shen; Ruizhe Huang; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract We address efficient processing of SPARQL queries over RDF datasets. Theproposed techniques; incorporated into the gStore system; handle; in a uniform and scalablemanner; SPARQL queries with wildcards and aggregate operators over dynamic RDFdatasets. Our approach is graph based. We store RDF data as a large graph and alsorepresent a SPARQL query as a query graph. Thus; the query answering problem isconverted into a subgraph matching problem. To achieve efficient and scalable queryprocessing; we develop an index; together with effective pruning rules and efficient searchalgorithms. We propose techniques that use this infrastructure to answer aggregationqueries. We also propose an effective maintenance algorithm to handle online updates overRDF repositories.

Top-k subgraph matching query in a large graph,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Yansheng Lu,Abstract Recently; due to its wide applications; subgraph search has attracted a lot ofattention from database and data mining community. Sub-graph search is defined asfollows: given a query graph Q; we report all data graphs containing Q in the database.However; there is little work about sub-graph search in a single large graph; which has beenused in many applications; such as biological network and social network. In this paper; weaddress top-k sub-graph matching query problem; which is defined as follows: given a querygraph Q; we locate top-k matchings of Q in a large data graph G according to a scorefunction. The score function is defined as the sum of the pairwise similarity between a vertexin Q and its matching vertex in G. Specifically; we first design a balanced tree (that is G-Tree)to index the large data graph. Then; based on G-Tree; we propose an efficient query …,Proceedings of the ACM first Ph.

Efficient simrank-based similarity join over large graphs,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Yansong Feng; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Graphs have been widely used to model complex data in many real-worldapplications. Answering vertex join queries over large graphs is meaningful and interesting;which can benefit friend recommendation in social networks and link prediction; etc. In thispaper; we adopt" SimRank" to evaluate the similarity of two vertices in a large graphbecause of its generality. Note that" SimRank" is purely structure dependent and it does notrely on the domain knowledge. Specifically; we define a SimRank-based join (SRJ) query tofind all the vertex pairs satisfying the threshold in a data graph G. In order to reduce thesearch space; we propose an estimated shortest-path distance based upper bound forSimRank scores to prune unpromising vertex pairs. In the verification; we propose a novelindex; called h-go cover; to efficiently compute the SimRank score of a single vertex pair …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,37
Dynamic skyline queries in large graphs,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Given a set of query points; a dynamic skyline query reports all data points that arenot dominated by other data points according to the distances between data points andquery points. In this paper; we study d ynamic s kyline queries in a large g raph (DSG-queryfor short). Although dynamic skylines have been studied in Euclidean space [14]; roadnetwork [5]; and metric space [3; 6]; there is no previous work on dynamic skylines over largegraphs. We employ a filter-and-refine framework to speed up the query processing that cananswer DSG-query efficiently. We propose a novel pruning rule based on graph propertiesto derive the candidates for DSG-query; that are guaranteed not to introduce false negatives.In the refinement step; with a carefully-designed index structure; we compute short pathdistances between vertices in O (H); where H is the number of maximal hops between …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,37
Pareto-based dominant graph: An efficient indexing structure to answer top-k queries,Lei Zou; Lei Chen,Given a record set D and a query score function F; a top-k query returns k records from D;whose values of function F on their attributes are the highest.

Graph similarity search with edit distance constraint in large graph databases,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Xiang Lian; Dong Wang; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Due to many real applications of graph databases; it has become increasinglyimportant to retrieve graphs g (in graph database D) that approximately match with querygraph q; rather than exact subgraph matches. In this paper; we study the problem of graphsimilarity search; which retrieves graphs that are similar to a given query graph under theconstraint of the minimum edit distance. Specifically; we derive a lower bound; branch-based bound; which can greatly reduce the search space of the graph similarity search. Wealso propose a tree index structure; namely b-tree; to facilitate effective pruning and efficientquery processing. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed approach outperformsthe existing approaches by orders of magnitude; in terms of both pruning power and queryresponse time.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,25
Detecting urban black holes based on human mobility data,Liang Hong; Yu Zheng; Duncan Yung; Jingbo Shang; Lei Zou,Abstract Many types of human mobility data; such as flows of taxicabs; card swiping data ofsubways; bike trip data and Call Details Records (CDR); can be modeled by a Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG). STG is a directed graph in which vertices and edges are associatedwith spatio-temporal properties (eg the traffic flow on a road and the geospatial location ofan intersection). In this paper; we instantly detect interesting phenomena; entitled blackholes and volcanos; from an STG. Specifically; a black hole is a subgraph (of an STG) thathas the overall inflow greater than the overall outflow by a threshold; while a volcano is asubgraph with the overall outflow greater than the overall inflow by a threshold (detectingvolcanos from an STG is proved to be equivalent to the detection of black holes).

Processing SPARQL queries over distributed RDF graphs,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; M Tamer Özsu; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract We propose techniques for processing SPARQL queries over a large RDF graph ina distributed environment. We adopt a “partial evaluation and assembly” framework.Answering a SPARQL query Q is equivalent to finding subgraph matches of the query graphQ over RDF graph G. Based on properties of subgraph matching over a distributed graph;we introduce local partial match as partial answers in each fragment of RDF graph G. Forassembly; we propose two methods: centralized and distributed assembly. We analyze ouralgorithms from both theoretically and experimentally. Extensive experiments over both realand benchmark RDF repositories of billions of triples confirm that our method is superior tothe state-of-the-art methods in both the system's performance and scalability.,The VLDB Journal,2016,23

Among these; a pattern match query is more flexiblecompared with a subgraph search and more informative compared with a shortest path or areachability query. In this paper; we address distance-based pattern match queries over alarge data graph G. Due to the huge search space; we adopt a filter-and-refine framework toanswer a pattern match query over a large graph. We first find a set of candidate matches bya graph embedding technique and then evaluate these to find the exact matches.

How to build templates for RDF question/answering: An uncertain graph similarity join approach,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Xiang Lian; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Shaoxu Song; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract A challenging task in the natural language question answering (Q/A for short) overRDF knowledge graph is how to bridge the gap between unstructured natural languagequestions (NLQ) and graph-structured RDF data (GOne of the effective tools is the"template"; which is often used in many existing RDF Q/A systems. However; few of themstudy how to generate templates automatically. To the best of our knowledge; we are the firstto propose a join approach for template generation. Given a workload D of SPARQL queriesand a set N of natural language questions; the goal is to find some pairs q; n; for q∈ D∧n∈; N; where SPARQL query q is the best match for natural language question n.

Efficient graph similarity search over large graph databases,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Xiang Lian; Dong Wang; Dongyan Zhao,Since many graph data are often noisy and incomplete in real applications; it has becomeincreasingly important to retrieve graphs g in the graph database D that approximatelymatch the query graph q; rather than exact graph matching. In this paper; we study theproblem of graph similarity search; which retrieves graphs that are similar to a given querygraph under the constraint of graph edit distance. We propose a systematic method for edit-distance based similarity search problem. Specifically; we derive two lower bounds; ie;partition-based and branch-based bounds; from different perspectives. More importantly; ahybrid lower bound incorporating both ideas of the two lower bounds is proposed; which istheoretically proved to have higher (at least not lower) pruning power than using the twolower bounds together.

PrefixTreeESpan: A pattern growth algorithm for mining embedded subtrees,Lei Zou; Yansheng Lu; Huaming Zhang; Rong Hu,Abstract Frequent embedded subtree pattern mining is an important data mining problemwith broad applications. In this paper; we propose a novel embedded subtree miningalgorithm; called PrefixTreeESpan (ie Prefix-Tree-projected E mbedded-S ubtree pa tter n);which finds a subtree pattern by growing a frequent prefix-tree. Thus; using divide andconquer; mining local length-1 frequent subtree patterns in Prefix-Tree-Projected databaserecursively will lead to the complete set of frequent patterns. Different from Chopper andXSpanner [4]; PrefixTreeESpan does not need a checking process. Our performance studyshows that PrefixTreeESpan outperforms Apriori-like algorithm: TreeMiner [6]; and pattern-growth algorithms: Chopper; XSpanner.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2006,20
Answering label-constraint reachability in large graphs,Kun Xu; Lei Zou; Jeffery Xu Yu; Lei Chen; Yanghua Xiao; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we study a variant of reachability queries; called label-constraintreachability (LCR) queries; specifically; given a label set S and two vertices u1 and u2 in alarge directed graph G; we verify whether there exists a path from u1 to u2 under labelconstraint S. Like traditional reachability queries; LCR queries are very useful; such aspathway finding in biological networks; inferring over RDF (resource description f ramework)graphs; relationship finding in social networks. However; LCR queries are much morecomplicated than their traditional counterpart. Several techniques are proposed in this paperto minimize the search space in computing path-label transitive closure. Furthermore; wedemonstrate the superiority of our method by extensive experiments.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,19
Mining frequent induced subtrees by prefix-tree-projected pattern growth,Lei Zou; Yansheng Lu; Huaming Zhang; Rong Hu; Chong Zhou,Frequent subtree pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broadapplications. Most existing algorithms; such as Apriori-like algorithms; are based oncandidate-generation-and-test framework; except for Chopper and XSpanner [8].Unfortunately; candidate pattern generation and test used in Apriori-like algorithms arealways time and space consuming; and this is especially true when candidate patterns arenumerous and large. To solve this problem; the technique of pattern growth was proposedby Han et al [6]. And the famous PrefixSpan algorithm was proposed for sequential patternmining by Pei et al. in [7]. Along this line; in this paper; we propose a novel induced subtreemining algorithm; called PrefixTreeISpan (ie Prefix-Tree-projected Induced-Subtree pattern);which finds induced subtree patterns by growing the frequent prefix-trees.

Extracting 5W1H event semantic elements from Chinese online news,Wei Wang; Dongyan Zhao; Lei Zou; Dong Wang; Weiguo Zheng,Abstract This paper proposes a verb-driven approach to extract 5W1H (W ho; W hat; W hom;W hen; W here and H ow) event semantic information from Chinese online news. The maincontributions of our work are two-fold: First; given the usual structure of a news story; wepropose a novel algorithm to extract topic sentences by stressing the importance of newsheadline; Second; we extract event facts (ie 5W1H) from these topic sentences by applying arule-based method (verb-driven) and a supervised machine-learning method (SVM). Thismethod significantly improves the predicate-argument structure used in Automatic ContentExtraction (ACE) Event Extraction (EE) task by considering valency (dominant capacity tonoun phrases) of a Chinese verb.

Summarization graph indexing: beyond frequent structure-based approach,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Huaming Zhang; Yansheng Lu; Qiang Lou,Abstract Graph is an important data structure to model complex structural data; such aschemical compounds; proteins; and XML documents. Among many graph data-basedapplications; sub-graph search is a key problem; which is defined as given a query Q;retrieving all graphs containing Q as a sub-graph in the graph database. Most existing sub-graph search methods try to filter out false positives (graphs that are not possible in theresults) as many as possible by indexing some frequent sub-structures in graph database;such as [20; 22; 4; 23]. However; due to ignoring the relationships between sub-structures;these methods still admit a high percentage of false positives. In this paper; we propose anovel concept; Summarization Graph; which is a complete graph and captures mosttopology information of the original graph; such as sub-structures and their relationships …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,15
Matching heterogeneous event data,Xiaochen Zhu; Shaoxu Song; Xiang Lian; Jianmin Wang; Lei Zou,Abstract Identifying duplicate events are essential to various business process applicationssuch as provenance querying or process mining. Distinct features of heterogeneous eventsincluding opaque names; dislocated traces and composite events; prevent existing dataintegration from techniques performing well. To address these issues; in this paper; wepropose an event similarity function by iteratively evaluating similar neighbors. We prove theconvergence of iterative similarity computation; and propose several pruning and estimationmethods. To efficiently support matching composite events; we devise upper bounds ofevent similarities. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposedevent matching approaches can achieve significantly higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art matching methods.,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,11
Semantic SPARQL similarity search over RDF knowledge graphs,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Wei Peng; Xifeng Yan; Shaoxu Song; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract RDF knowledge graphs have attracted increasing attentions these years. However;due to the schema-free nature of RDF data; it is very difficult for users to have full knowledgeof the underlying schema. Furthermore; the same kind of information can be represented indiverse graph fragments. Hence; it is a huge challenge to formulate complex SPARQLexpressions by taking the union of all possible structures. In this paper; we propose aneffective framework to access the RDF repository even if users have no full knowledge of theunderlying schema. Specifically; given a SPARQL query; the system could return as moreanswers that match the query based on the semantic similarity as possible. Interestingly; wepropose a systematic method to mine diverse semantically equivalent structure patterns.More importantly; incorporating both structural and semantic similarities we are the first to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,10
Subgraph matching with set similarity in a large graph database,Liang Hong; Lei Zou; Xiang Lian; S Yu Philip,In real-world graphs such as social networks; Semantic Web and biological networks; eachvertex usually contains rich information; which can be modeled by a set of tokens orelements. In this paper; we study a subgraph matching with set similarity (SMS 2) query overa large graph database; which retrieves subgraphs that are structurally isomorphic to thequery graph; and meanwhile satisfy the condition of vertex pair matching with the (dynamic)weighted set similarity. To efficiently process the SMS 2 query; this paper designs a novellattice-based index for data graph; and lightweight signatures for both query vertices anddata vertices. Based on the index and signatures; we propose an efficient two-phasepruning strategy including set similarity pruning and structure-based pruning; which exploitsthe unique features of both (dynamic) weighted set similarity and graph topology.

Efficient processing of label-constraint reachability queries in large graphs,Lei Zou; Kun Xu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lei Chen; Yanghua Xiao; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we study a variant of reachability queries; called label-constraintreachability (LCR) queries. Specifically; given a label set S and two vertices u 1 and u 2 in alarge directed graph G; we check the existence of a directed path from u 1 to u 2; whereedge labels along the path are a subset of S. We propose the path-label transitive closuremethod to answer LCR queries. Specifically; we t4ransform an edge-labeled directed graphinto an augmented DAG by replacing the maximal strongly connected components asbipartite graphs. We also propose a Dijkstra-like algorithm to compute path-label transitiveclosure by re-defining the “distance” of a path. Comparing with the existing solutions; weprove that our method is optimal in terms of the search space.

Context-aware recommendation using role-based trust network,Liang Hong; Lei Zou; Cheng Zeng; Luming Zhang; Jian Wang; Jilei Tian,Abstract Recommender systems have been studied comprehensively in both academic andindustrial fields over the past decade. As user interests can be affected by context at anytime and any place in mobile scenarios; rich context information becomes more and moreimportant for personalized context-aware recommendations. Although existing context-aware recommender systems can make context-aware recommendations to some extent;they suffer several inherent weaknesses:(1) Users' context-aware interests are not modeledrealistically; which reduces the recommendation quality;(2) Current context-awarerecommender systems ignore trust relations among users. Trust relations are actuallycontext-aware and associated with certain aspects (ie; categories of items) in mobilescenarios. In this article; we define a term role to model common context-aware interests …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2015,9

However; the lack of spatial information limits the use of the semantic webdata on position-oriented query. In this paper; we introduce spatial SPARQL; a variant ofSPARQL language; for querying spatial information integrated RDF data. Besides; wedesign a novel index SS-tree for evaluating the spatial queries. Based on the index; wepropose a search algorithm.

Mining frequent induced subtree patterns with subtree-constraint,Lei Zou; Yansheng Lu; Huaming Zhang; Rong Hu; Chong Zhou,Mining frequent induced subtree patterns is very useful in domains such as XML databases;Web log analyzing. However; because of the combinatorial explosion; mining all frequentsubtree patterns becomes infeasible for a large and dense tree database. And too manyfrequent subtree patterns also confuse users. Usually only a small set of the mining resultscan arouse users' interests. In this paper; we propose a problem to discover frequentinduced subtree patterns that are super trees of a given pattern tree specified by users; iefrequent induced subtree patterns with subtree-constraint. Most existing frequent subtreemining algorithms are based on right-most extension; which does not work well in the newproblem. So free extension is presented to replace right-most extension in this paper. Toavoid the duplicate pattern problem caused by free extension; we develop an efficient …,Data Mining Workshops; 2006.

However; usersmay be overwhelmed by the masses of matches. In this paper; we propose subgraph skylinesearch problem; denoted as S 3; to support more complicated analysis over graph data.Specifically; given a large graph G and a query graph q; we want to find all the subgraphs gin G; such that g is graph isomorphic to q and not dominated by any other subgraphs. Inorder to improve the efficiency; we devise a hybrid feature encoding incorporating bothstructural and numeric features. Moreover; we present some optimizations based onpartitioning strategy. We also propose a skylayer index to facilitate the dynamic subgraphskyline computation.

Top-k queries on RDF graphs,Dong Wang; Lei Zou; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Recent years have witnessed unprecedented volumes of structured data publishedin RDF format. Taking full advantage of such data has attracted a growing amount ofresearch interest from both academia and industry. However; efficient processing of top-kqueries in RDF data is still a new topic. Most existing approaches ignore top-k queries; oronly provide a limited number of ranking functions. In this paper; we provide an effective andefficient processing algorithm for top-k queries that consists of a novel tree-style index MS-tree and MS-tree-based filtering and pattern-matching functions. Firstly; candidate entities inRDF data were efficiently ranked and filtered through an MS-tree-based top-down method.Then; query structure patterns are matched in RDF data through graphic exploration.

Using conditional functional dependency to discover abnormal data in RDF graphs,Binbin He; Lei Zou; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Many issues about data quality have been studied in relational data; such as dataconsistency; data deduplication; data accuracy; data completeness and so on. In this paper;we focus on the discovery of abnormal data in RDF graphs. As the amount of RDF data isincreasing; data quality is becoming an important issue for usability of these RDFrepositories. Although association rules have been used to find abnormals in RDF graph;existing solutions ignore the latent semantics of connected structures in RDF graphs. Inorder to detect latent dependencies in RDF graph; firstly; we innovatively define Graph-based Conditional Functional Dependency (GCFD) that can represent the attribute valueand semantic structure dependencies of RDF data in a uniform manner. Then; we proposean efficient framework and some novel pruning rules to discover GCFD in large RDF …,Proceedings of Semantic Web Information Management on Semantic Web Information Management,2014,7

In this paper; we focus on subgraph query over a single large graph G;ie; finding all embeddings of query Q in G. Different from existing feature-based approaches;we map all edges into a two-dimensional space R 2 and propose a bitmap structure to indexR 2. At run time; we find a set of a djacent e dge p airs (AEP) or s tar-s tyle p atterns (SSP) tocover Q. We develop e dge j oin (EJ) algorithms to address both AEP and SSP subqueries.Based on the bitmap index; our method can optimize I/O and CPU cost. More importantly;our index has the linear space complexity instead of exponential complexity in feature-based approaches; which indicates that our index can scale well with respect to large datasize. Furthermore; our index has light maintenance overhead; which has not been …,World Wide Web,2016,6
Natural language question answering over RDF data,Ruizhe Huang; Lei Zou,Abstract As more and more RDF data becomes available; such as DBpedia; Yago andFreebase; it is desired to provide users with simple interfaces to access the datasets.Although the SPARQL query language is a standard way to query RDF data; it remainstedious and difficult even for expert users because of the formality of the language and thecomplexity of the underlying schema of RDF data. An ideal system should allow users toexpress queries in their own languages. In this work; we propose a methodology to translatenatural language questions into SPARQL queries; which can be answered by existing RDFengines and fulfill users? information need.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,6

Mapping entity-attribute web tables to web-scale knowledge bases,Xiaolu Zhang; Yueguo Chen; Jinchuan Chen; Xiaoyong Du; Lei Zou,Abstract There are many entity-attribute tables on the Web that can be utilized for enrichingthe entities of knowledge bases (KBs). This requires the schema mapping (matching)between the Web tables and the huge KBs. Existing solutions on schema mapping areinadequate for mapping a Web table and a KB; because of many reasons such as (1) thereare many duplicates of entities and their types in a KB;(2) the schema of KB is often implicit;informal; and evolving over time;(3) the KB is typically very large in volume. In this paper; wepropose a pure instance-based schema mapping solution to statistically find the effectivemapping between a Web table and a KB via the matched data examples. Besides; wepropose efficient solutions on finding the matched data examples as well as the overallmapping of a table and a KB.

Top-K possible shortest path query over a large uncertain graph,Lei Zou; Peng Peng; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract This paper studies the top-k possible shortest path (kSP) queries in a largeuncertain graph; specifically; given two vertices S and T; a kSP query reports the top-kpossible shortest paths from S to T. Different from existing solutions for uncertain graphproblems; we adopt the possible worlds semantics. Although possible worlds semanticshave been studied widely in relational databases; the graph structure leads to morecomplexity in computational model. The main contribution of this paper lies in developinglower and upper bounds for the probability that one path is the shortest path in an uncertaingraph; based on which; a filter-and-refine framework is proposed to answer kSP queries. Wedemonstrate the superiority of our method by extensive experiments.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2011,5
Subgraph search over massive disk resident graphs,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Xuemin Lin; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Due to the wide applications; subgraph queries have attracted lots of attentions indatabase community. In this paper; we focus on subgraph queries over a large graph G.Different from existing feature-based approaches; we propose a bitmap structure based onedges to index the graph. At run time; we decompose Q into a set of a djacent e dge p airs(AEP). We develop e dge j oin (EJ) algorithms to address AEP subqueries. The bitmap indexcan reduce both I/O and CPU cost. More importantly; the bitmap index has the linear spacecomplexity instead of the exponential complexity in feature-based approaches; whichconfirms its good scalability. Extensive experiments show that our method outperformsexisting ones in both online and offline performances significantly.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,5
Knowledge base completion using matrix factorization,Wenqiang He; Yansong Feng; Lei Zou; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract With the development of Semantic Web; the automatic construction of large scaleknowledge bases (KBs) has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. Althoughthese KBs are very large; they are still often incomplete. Many existing approaches to KBcompletion focus on performing inference over a single KB and suffer from the featuresparsity problem. Moreover; traditional KB completion methods ignore complementaritywhich exists in various KBs implicitly. In this paper; we treat KBs completion as a large matrixcompletion task and integrate different KBs to infer new facts simultaneously. We presenttwo improvements to the quality of inference over KBs. First; in order to reduce the datasparsity; we utilize the type consistency constraints between relations and entities toinitialize negative data in the matrix. Secondly; we incorporate the similarity of relations …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2015,4
Explore person specific evidence in web person name disambiguation,Liwei Chen; Yansong Feng; Lei Zou; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we investigate different usages of feature representations in the webperson name disambiguation task which has been suffering from the mismatch ofvocabulary and lack of clues in web environments. In literature; the latter receives lessattention and remains more challenging. We explore the feature space in this task and arguethat collecting person specific evidences from a corpus level can provide a more reasonableand robust estimation for evaluating a feature's importance in a given web page. This canalleviate the lack of clues where discriminative features can be reasonably weighted bytaking their corpus level importance into account; not just relying on the current local context.We therefore propose a topic-based model to exploit the person specific global importanceand embed it into the person name similarity. The experimental results show that the …,Proceedings of the 2012 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning,2012,4
Answering subgraph queries over large graphs,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Recently; subgraph queries over large graph-structured data have attracted lots ofattentions. Most of the recent algorithms proposed to solve this problem apply the structuralfeatures of graphs to construct the index; such as path; tree and subgraph. However; there isno a solid theory foundation of which structure is the best one to construct the index. What ismore; the cost of mining these structures is rather expensive. In this paper; we present a highperformance graph query algorithm; SMS; based on the simple yet effective neighborhoodstructure. To further improve the query performance; a graph partition solution is proposedand the efficient codes of vertices and blocks are carefully designed. Extensive experimentalstudies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm in the issue ofsubgraph queries on large graph-structured data.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2011,4
Online subgraph skyline analysis over knowledge graphs,Weiguo Zheng; Xiang Lian; Lei Zou; Liang Hong; Dongyan Zhao,Subgraph search is very useful in many real-world applications. However; users may beoverwhelmed by the masses of matches. In this paper; we propose a subgraph skylineanalysis problem; denoted as S 2 A; to support more complicated analysis over graph data.Specifically; given a large graph G and a query graph q; we want to find all the subgraphs gin G; such that g is graph isomorphic to q and not dominated by any other subgraphs. Inorder to improve the efficiency; we devise a hybrid feature encoding incorporating bothstructural and numeric features based on a partitioning strategy; and discuss how tooptimize the space partitioning. We also present a skylayer index to facilitate the dynamicsubgraph skyline computation. Moreover; an attribute cluster-based method is proposed todeal with the curse of dimensionality.

On the marriage of SPARQL and keywords,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract To maximize the advantages of both SPARQL and keyword search; we introduce anovel paradigm that combines both of them and propose a hybrid query (called an SKquery) that integrates SPARQL and keyword search in this paper. In order to answer SKqueries efficiently; a structural index is devised and a novel integrated query algorithm isproposed. We evaluate our method in large real RDF graphs and experiments demonstrateboth effectiveness and efficiency of our method.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2015,3
Graph-based RDF data management,Lei Zou; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The increasing size of RDF data requires efficient systems to store and query them.There have been efforts to map RDF data to a relational representation; and a number ofsystems exist that follow this approach. We have been investigating an alternative approachof maintaining the native graph model to represent RDF data; and utilizing graph databasetechniques (such as a structure-aware index and a graph matching algorithm) to addressRDF data management. Since 2009; we have been developing a set of graph-based RDFdata management systems that follow this approach: gStore; gStore-D and gAnswer. Thefirst two are designed to support efficient SPARQL query evaluation in a centralized anddistributed/parallel environments; respectively; while the last one aims to provide an easy-to-use interface (natural language question/answering) for users to access a RDF repository …,Data Science and Engineering,2017,2
Query Workload-based RDF Graph Fragmentation and Allocation,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract: As the volume of the RDF data becomes increasingly large; it is essential for us todesign a distributed database system to manage it. For distributed RDF data design; it isquite common to partition the RDF data into some parts; called fragments; which are thendistributed. Thus; the distribution design consists of two steps: fragmentation and allocation.In this paper; we propose a method to explore the intrinsic similarities among the structuresof queries in a workload for fragmentation and allocation; which aims to reduce the numberof crossing matches and the communication cost during SPARQL query processing.Specifically; we mine and select some frequent access patterns to reflect the characteristicsof the workload. Here; although we prove that selecting the optimal set of frequent accesspatterns is NP-hard; we propose a heuristic algorithm which guarantees both the data …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.07845,2015,2

More importantly; it canhandle; in a uniform manner; different data types (strings and numerical data) and SPARQLqueries with wildcards; aggregate; range and top-k operators over dynamic RDF datasets.We will demonstrate the main features of our system; show how to search Wikipediadocuments using gStore and how to build users' own application using gStore throughC++/Java API.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,2
Keyword graph: Answering keyword search over large graphs,Dong Wang; Lei Zou; Wanqiong Pan; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we focus on IR style queries; keyword search; over large disk-residentgraphs. Since most existing approaches cache the whole graph and indexing structure inmemory; these approaches cannot be applied into large graphs; such as RDF graphs andsocial networks. In this paper; we design a novel indexing structure;(kernel) keyword graphto summarize the structure of original graph. Based on (kernel) keyword graph; we proposean efficient keyword search algorithm. Extensive experiments confirm that our method canscale up to large graphs with millions of nodes and edges. The performance of our approachoutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by at least one order of magnitude.,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications,2012,2
Towards automatic construction of knowledge bases from Chinese online resources,Liwei Chen; Yansong Feng; Yidong Chen; Lei Zou; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Automatically constructing knowledge bases from online resources has become acrucial task in many research areas. Most existing knowledge bases are built from Englishresources; while few efforts have been made for other languages. Building knowledgebases for Chinese is of great importance on its own right. However; simply adapting existingtools from English to Chinese yields inferior results. In this paper; we propose to createChinese knowledge bases from online resources with less human involvement. This projectwill be formulated in a self-supervised framework which requires little manual work to extractknowledge facts from online encyclopedia resources in a probabilistic view. In addition; thisframework will be able to update the constructed knowledge base with knowledge factsextracted from up-to-date newswire. Currently; we have obtained encouraging results in …,Proceedings of ACL 2012 Student Research Workshop,2012,2
Top-K correlation sub-graph search in graph databases,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Yansheng Lu,Abstract Recently; due to its wide applications;(similar) subgraph search has attracted a lotof attentions from database and data mining community; such as [13; 18; 19; 5]. In [8]; Ke etal. first proposed correlation sub-graph search problem (CGSearch for short) to capture theunderlying dependency between sub-graphs in a graph database; that is CGS algorithm.However; CGS algorithm requires the specification of a minimum correlation threshold θ toperform computation. In practice; it may not be trivial for users to provide an appropriatethreshold θ; since different graph databases typically have different characteristics.Therefore; we propose an alternative mining task: top-K c orrelation sub-g raph search (TOP-CGSearh for short).

Keyphrase extraction using knowledge graphs,Wei Shi; Weiguo Zheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng; Lei Zou,Abstract Extracting keyphrases from documents automatically is an important and interestingtask since keyphrases provide a quick summarization for documents. Although lots of effortshave been made on keyphrase extraction; most of the existing methods (the co-occurrence-based methods and the statistic-based methods) do not take semantics into fullconsideration. The co-occurrence-based methods heavily depend on the co-occurrencerelations between two words in the input document; which may ignore many semanticrelations. The statistic-based methods exploit the external text corpus to enrich thedocument; which introduce more unrelated relations inevitably. In this paper; we propose anovel approach to extract keyphrases using knowledge graphs; based on which we coulddetect the latent relations of two keyterms (ie; noun words and named entities) without …,Data Science and Engineering,2017,1
Keyword Search on RDF Graphs-A Query Graph Assembly Approach,Shuo Han; Lei Zou; Jeffery Xu Yu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Keyword search provides ordinary users an easy-to-use interface for querying RDFdata. Given the input keywords; in this paper; we study how to assemble a query graph thatis to represent user's query intention accurately and efficiently. Based on the input keywords;we first obtain the elementary query graph building blocks; such as entity/class vertices andpredicate edges. Then; we formally define the query graph assembly (QGA) problem.Unfortunately; we prove theoretically that QGA is a NP-complete problem. In order to solvethat; we design some heuristic lower bounds and propose a bipartite graph matching-basedbest-first search algorithm. The algorithm's time complexity is O (k 2l... l 3l); where l is thenumber of the keywords and k is a tunable parameter; ie; the maximum number of candidateentity/class vertices and predicate edges allowed to match each keyword.

Answering top-K query combined keywords and structural queries on RDF graphs,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; Zheng Qin,Abstract Although SPARQL has been the predominant query language over RDF (ResourceDescription Framework) graphs; some query intentions cannot be captured well using onlySPARQL syntax. On the other hand; keyword search enjoys widespread usage because ofits intuitive way of specifying information needs; but suffers from the problem of lowprecision. To maximize the advantages of both SPARQL and keyword search; we introducea novel paradigm that combines them and propose a hybrid query (called a SPARQL-Keyword (SK) query) that integrates SPARQL and keyword search. To answer SK queriesefficiently; we propose a novel integrated query algorithm based on a structural index. Wealso present a distance-based optimization technique to further improve the efficiency of SKqueries evaluation.

For machines;understanding a question is nontrivial. Current approaches lack explicit backgroundknowledge. In this paper; we introduce a novel technical question understanding approachto recommending probable solutions to users. First; a knowledge graph is constructed whichcontains abundant technical information; and an augmented knowledge graph is built on thebasis of the knowledge graph; to link the knowledge graph and documents. Then wedevelop a light weight question driven mechanism to select candidate documents. Toimprove the online performance; we propose an index-based random walk to support theonline search.

Computing longest increasing subsequences over sequential data streams,Youhuan Li; Lei Zou; Huaming Zhang; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we propose a data structure; a quadruple neighbor list (QN-list; forshort); to support real time queries of all< u> l</u> ongest< u> i</u> ncreasing< u> s</u>ubsequence (LIS) and LIS with constraints over sequential data streams. The QN-List builtby our algorithm requires O (w) space; where w is the time window size. The running time forbuilding the initial QN-List takes O (w log w) time. Applying the QN-List; insertion of the newitem takes O (log w) time and deletion of the first item takes O (w) time. To the best of ourknowledge; this is the first work to support both LIS enumeration and LIS with constraintscomputation by using a single uniform data structure for real time sequential data streams.Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both time and space cost; not onlytheoretically; but also empirically.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,1
Privacy preserving subgraph matching on large graphs in cloud,Zhao Chang; Lei Zou; Feifei Li,Abstract The wide presence of large graph data and the increasing popularity of storing datain the cloud drive the needs for graph query processing on a remote cloud. But afundamental challenge is to process user queries without compromising sensitiveinformation. This work focuses on privacy preserving subgraph matching in a cloud server.The goal is to minimize the overhead on both cloud and client sides for subgraph matching;without compromising users' sensitive information. To that end; we transform an originalgraph $ G $ into a privacy preserving graph G k; which meets the requirement of an existingprivacy model known as k-automorphism. By making use of the symmetry in a k-automorphicgraph; a subgraph matching query can be efficiently answered using a graph G o; a smallsubset of G k. This approach saves both space and query cost in the cloud server. We …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,1

Natural Language Question/Answering: Let Users Talk With The Knowledge Graph,Weiguo Zheng; Hong Cheng; Lei Zou; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Kangfei Zhao,Abstract The ever-increasing knowledge graphs impose an urgent demand of providingeffective and easy-to-use query techniques for end users. Structured query languages; suchas SPARQL; offer a powerful expression ability to query RDF datasets. However; they aredifficult to use. Keywords are simple but have a very limited expression ability. Naturallanguage question (NLQ) is promising on querying knowledge graphs. A huge challenge ishow to understand the question clearly so as to translate the unstructured question into astructured query. In this paper; we present a data+ oracle approach to answer NLQs overknowledge graphs. We let users verify the ambiguities during the query understanding.

Answering Natural Language Questions by Subgraph Matching over Knowledge Graphs,Sen Hu; Lei Zou; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Haixun Wang; Dongyan Zhao,RDF question/answering (Q/A) allows users to ask questions in natural languages over aknowledge base represented by RDF. To answer a national language question; the existingwork takes a two-stage approach: question understanding and query evaluation. Their focusis on question understanding to deal with the disambiguation of the natural languagephrases. The most common technique is the joint disambiguation; which has the exponentialsearch space. In this paper; we propose a systematic framework to answer natural languagequestions over RDF repository (RDF Q/A) from a graph data-driven perspective. We proposea semantic query graph to model the query intention in the natural language question in astructural way; based on which; RDF Q/A is reduced to subgraph matching problem.

Efficient SimRank-Based Similarity Join,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Graphs have been widely used to model complex data in many real-worldapplications. Answering vertex join queries over large graphs is meaningful and interesting;which can benefit friend recommendation in social networks and link prediction; and so on.In this article; we adopt “SimRank”[13] to evaluate the similarity between two vertices in alarge graph because of its generality. Note that “Simank” is purely structure dependent; andit does not rely on the domain knowledge. Specifically; we define a SimRank-based join(SRJ) query to find all vertex pairs satisfying the threshold from two sets of vertices U and V.To reduce the search space; we propose a shortest-path-distance-based upper bound forSimRank scores to prune unpromising vertex pairs.

SPARQL Query Parallel Processing: A Survey,Jiaying Feng; Chenhong Meng; Jiaming Song; Xiaowang Zhang; Zhiyong Feng; Lei Zou,In this paper; we survey current parallel processing approaches for SPARQL queries in RDFdata. This survey focuses on three important aspects of current 15 SPARQL query enginesin performance; namely; system architectures; RDF data storage management; andSPARQL query executive strategies. We classify those 15 engines as three classes ofarchitectures (ie; cluster; partition; and federation); three kinds of storage (ie; partition; graph;and DBMS) and two query executive strategies (ie; partition and DBMS); respectively. Thisinvestigation shows that each aspect (architecture; storage; and query) is a key factor ofSPARQL query performance.

Mining Maximal pattern-based Subspace Clusters in High Dimensional Space,Yan-Sheng Lu; Rong Hu; Lei Zou; Chong Zhou,The problem of pattern-based subspace clustering; a special type of subspace clusteringthat uses pattern similarity as a measure of similarity; is studied. Unlike most traditionalclustering algorithms that group the close values of objects in all the dimensions or a set ofdimensions; clustering by pattern similarity shows an interesting pattern; where objectsexhibit a coherent pattern of rise and fall in subspaces. A novel approach; named EMaPle tomine the maximal pattern-based subspace clusters; is designed. The EMaPle searchesclusters only in the attribute enumeration spaces which are relatively few compared to thelarge number of row combinations in the typical datasets; and it exploits novel pruningtechniques. EMaPle can find the clusters satisfying coherent constraints; size constraintsand sign constraints neglected in MaPle. Both synthetic data sets and real data sets are …,Journal of Southeast University (English Edition),2006,*
gst-store: Querying Large Spatiotemporal RDF Graphs,Dong Wang; Lei Zou; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract The Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) query language allowsusers to issue a structural query over a resource description framework (RDF) graph.However; the lack of a spatiotemporal query language limits the usage of RDF data inspatiotemporal-oriented applications. As the spatiotemporal information continuouslyincreases in RDF data; it is necessary to design an effective and efficient spatiotemporalRDF data management system. In this paper; we formally define the spatiotemporalinformation-integrated RDF data; introduce a spatiotemporal query language that extendsthe SPARQL language with spatiotemporal assertions to query spatiotemporal information-integrated RDF data; and design a novel index and the corresponding query algorithm. Theexperimental results on a large; real RDF graph integrating spatial and temporal …,Data and Information Management,*,*
Redesign of the gStore system,Li Zeng; Lei Zou,Abstract gStore is an open-source native Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplestore that answers SPARQL queries by subgraph matching over RDF graphs. However;there are some deficiencies in the original system design; such as answering simple queries(including onetriple pattern queries). To improve the efficiency of the system; we reconsiderthe system design in this paper. Specifically; we propose a new query plan generationmodule that generates different query plans according to the structures of query graphs.Furthermore; we re-design our vertex encoding strategy to achieve more pruning power anda new multi-join algorithm to speed up the subgraph matching process. Extensiveexperiments on synthetic and real RDF datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms significantly.,*,*,*
Using partial evaluation in holistic subgraph search,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; Zhenqin Du; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Because of its wide application; the subgraph matching problem has been studiedextensively during the past decade. However; most existing solutions assume that a datagraph is a vertex/edge-labeled graph (ie; each vertex/edge has a simple label). Thesesolutions build structural indices by considering the vertex labels. However; some realgraphs contain rich-content vertices such as user profiles in social networks and HTMLpages on the World Wide Web. In this study; we consider the problem of subgraph matchingusing a more general scenario. We build a structural index that does not depend on anyvertex content. Based on the index; we design a holistic subgraph matching algorithm thatconsiders the query graph as a whole and finds one match at a time. In order to furtherimprove efficiency; we propose a “partial evaluation and assembly” framework to find …,Frontiers of Computer Science,*,*

Third International Workshop on Graph Data Management: Techniques and Applications (GDM 2012),Haixun Wang; Sameh Elnikety; Sherif Sakr; Lei Zou,It is our pleasure to present the proceedings of the third International Workshop on GraphData Management: Techniques and Applications (GDM); which took place on April 5; 2012in Washington DC; USA. The workshop was held in conjunction with the IEEE InternationalConference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2011). The call for papers solicited full and shortpapers that address practical and theoretical aspects of software applications that managegraph-structured data in different domains. Recently; graphs are widely used for datamodeling in different domains such as chemical compounds; multimedia databases; proteinnetworks; social networks and semantic web. With the continued emergence and increase ofmassive and complex structural graph data; graph database systems are emergingeffectively to manage; understand and utilize collections of graphs.
