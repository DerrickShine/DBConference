Query caching and optimization in distributed mediator systems,Sibel Adali; K Selçuk Candan; Yannis Papakonstantinou; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract Query processing and optimization in mediator systems that access distributed non-proprietary sources pose many novel problems. Cost-based query optimization is hardbecause the mediator does not have access to source statistics information and furthermoreit may not be easy to model the source's performance. At the same time; querying remotesources may be very expensive because of high connection overhead; long computationtime; financial charges; and temporary unavailability. We propose a cost-based optimizationtechnique that caches statistics of actual calls to the sources and consequently estimates thecost of the possible execution plans based on the statistics cache. We investigate issuespertaining to the design of the statistics cache and experimentally analyze various tradeoffs.We also present a query result caching mechanism that allows us to effectively use …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1996,507

Twig 2 Stack: bottom-up processing of generalized-tree-pattern queries over XML documents,Songting Chen; Hua-Gang Li; Junichi Tatemura; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Tree pattern matching is one of the most fundamental tasks for XML queryprocessing. Holistic twig query processing techniques [4; 16] have been developed tominimize the intermediate results; namely; those root-to-leaf path matches that are not in thefinal twig results. However; useless path matches cannot be completely avoided; especiallywhen there is a parent-child relationship in the twig query. Furthermore; existing approachesdo not consider the fact that in practice; in order to process XPath or XQuery statements; amore powerful form of twig queries; namely; Generalized-Tree-Pattern (GTP)[8] queries; isrequired. Most existing works on processing GTP queries generally calls for costly post-processing for eliminating redundant data and/or grouping of the matching results. In thispaper; we first propose a novel hierarchical stack encoding scheme to compactly …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,252
Method and apparatus for facilitating query reformulation,*,A method and apparatus for verifying a query to provide feedback to users for queryreformulation. By utilizing selectivity statistics for semantic and visual characteristics ofimage objects; query verification “examines” user queries and allows users to reformulatequeries through system feedback. Feedback information provided to the user includes (1)the maximum and minimum number of matches for the query;(2) alternatives for bothsemantic and visual-based query elements; and (3) estimated numbers of matching images.Additional types of feedback information may also be provided. With this feedback; the usersknow if the query criteria is too tight (ie too few matches will be retrieved) or too loose (ie toomany matches will be retrieved) so that they can relax; refine; or reformulate queries or leavequeries unchanged accordingly. Only after queries are verified to have a high possibility …,*,2001,243
The advanced video information system: data structures and query processing,Sibel Adalı; K Selçuk Candan; Su-Shing Chen; Kutluhan Erol; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract. We describe how video data can be organized and structured so as to facilitateefficient querying. We develop a formal model for video data and show how spatial datastructures; suitably modified; provide an elegant way of storing such data. We developalgorithms to process various kinds of video queries and show that; in most cases; thecomplexity of these algorithms is linear. A prototype system; called the Advanced VideoInformation System (AVIS); based on these concepts; has been designed at the University ofMaryland.,Multimedia systems,1996,233
Enabling dynamic content caching for database-driven web sites,K Selçuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li; Qiong Luo; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Web performance is a key differentiation among content providers. Snafus andslowdowns at major web sites demonstrate the difficulty that companies face trying to scaleto a large amount of web traffic. One solution to this problem is to store web content at server-side and edge-caches for fast delivery to the end users. However; for many e-commercesites; web pages are created dynamically based on the current state of business processes;represented in application servers and databases. Since application servers; databases;web servers; and caches are independent components; there is no efficient mechanism tomake changes in the database content reflected to the cached web pages. As a result; mostapplication servers have to mark dynamically generated web pages as non-cacheable. Inthis paper; we describe the architectural framework of the CachePortal system for …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,222
How does the data sampling strategy impact the discovery of information diffusion in social media?,Munmun De Choudhury; Yu-Ru Lin; Hari Sundaram; K Selcuk Candan; Lexing Xie; Aisling Kelliher,Abstract Platforms such as Twitter have provided researchers with ample opportunities toanalytically study social phenomena. There are however; significant computationalchallenges due to the enormous rate of production of new information: researchers aretherefore; often forced to analyze a judiciously selected “sample” of the data. Like othersocial media phenomena; information diffusion is a social process–it is affected by usercontext; and topic; in addition to the graph topology. This paper studies the impact ofdifferent attribute and topology based sampling strategies on the discovery of an importantsocial media phenomena–information diffusion.

Retrieving and organizing web pages by “information unit”,Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan; Quoc Vu; Divyakant Agrawal,ABSTRACT Since WWW encourages hypertext and hypermedia document authoring (eg;HTML or XML); Web authors tend to create documents that are composed of multiple pagesconnected with hyperlinks or frames. A Web document may be authored in multiple ways;such as (1) all information in one physical page; or (2) a main page and the relatedinformation in separate linked pages. Existing Web search engines; however; return onlyphysical pages. In this paper; we introduce and describe the use of the concept ofinformation unit; which can be viewed as a logical Web document consisting of multiplephysical pages as one atomic retrieval unit. We present an algorithm to efficiently retrieveinformation units. Our algorithm can perform progressive query processing over a Web indexby considering both document semantic similarity and link structures.

Resource description framework: metadata and its applications,K Selçuk Candan; Huan Liu; Reshma Suvarna,Abstract Universality; the property of the Web that makes it the largest data and informationsource in the world; is also the property behind the lack of a uniform organization schemethat would allow easy access to data and information. A semantic web; wherein differentapplications and Web sites can exchange information and hence exploit Web data andinformation to their full potential; requires the information about Web resources to berepresented in a detailed and structured manner. Resource Description Framework (RDF);an effort in this direction supported by the World Wide Web Consortium; provides a meansfor the description of metadata which is a necessity for the next generation of interoperableWeb applications.

AFilter: adaptable XML filtering with prefix-caching suffix-clustering,K Selçuk Candan; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Songting Chen; Junichi Tatemura; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract XML message filtering problem involves searching for instances of a given;potentially large; set of patterns in a continuous stream of XML messages. Since themessages arrive continuously; it is essential that the filtering rate matches the data arrivalrate. Therefore; the given set of filter patterns needs to be indexed appropriately to enablereal-time processing of the streaming XML data. In this paper; we propose AFilter; anadaptable; and thus scalable; path expression filtering approach. AFilter has a base memoryrequirement linear in filter expression and data size. Furthermore; when additional memoryis available; AFilter can exploit prefix commonalities in the set of filter expressions using aloosely-coupled prefix caching mechanism as opposed to tightly-coupled active staterepresentation of alternative approaches.

GMP: Distributed geographic multicast routing in wireless sensor networks,Shibo Wu; K Selcuk Candan,In this paper; we propose a novel Geographic Multicast routing Protocol (GMP) for wirelesssensor networks1. The proposed protocol is fully distributed and stateless. Given a set of thedestinations; the transmitting node first constructs a virtual Euclidean Steiner tree rooted atitself and including the destinations; using a novel and highly efficient reduction ratioheuristic (called rrSTR). Based on this locally computed tree and the information regardingthe locations of its immediate neighbors; the transmitting node then splits the destinationsinto a set of groups and calculates a next hop for each of these groups. A copy of the packetand the locations of the corresponding group of destination nodes are directed towards thecorresponding hop. The simulation results on NS2 show that the average per-destinationhop count obtained using GMP is comparable to the existing PBM [21] algorithm and …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2006.

System and method employing random walks for mining web page associations and usage to optimize user-oriented web page refresh and pre-fetch scheduling,*,A method for estimating an association between the media objects and the seed Web pageaccessed by a user. The method is employed in the context of a Web space on a networkhaving Web pages and links between those Web pages modeled as a directed graph. EachWeb page comprises a set of media objects and a page author. For each object a size; auser preference and a page author preference are determined. The network has anavailable pre-fetch bandwidth. The method calculates a weight for each Web object byapplying preference rules defined by and user preference and page author preference to thecontents of the set of media objects. Next; a random walk graph is generated; and objectgains are calculated by finding a steady state distribution of the random walk graph. Theobject gain represents an association between the object and the seed Web page.,*,2003,99
At the frontiers of information and software as services,K Selçuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li; Thomas Phan; Minqi Zhou,Abstract The high cost of creating and maintaining software and hardware infrastructures fordelivering services to businesses has led to a notable trend toward the use of third-partyservice providers; which rent out network presence; computation power; and data storagespace to clients with infrastructural needs. These third party service providers can act asdata stores as well as entire software suites for improved availability and system scalability;reducing small and medium businesses' burden of managing complex infrastructures. Thisis called information/application outsourcing or software as a service (SaaS). Emergence ofenabling technologies; such as service oriented architectures (SOA); virtual machines; andcloud computing; contribute to this trend.

Cp/cv: concept similarity mining without frequency information from domain describing taxonomies,Jong Wook Kim; K Candan,Abstract Domain specific ontologies are heavily used in many applications. For instance;these form the bases on which similarity/dissimilarity between keywords are extracted forvarious knowledge discovery and retrieval tasks. Existing similarity computation schemescan be categorized as (a) structure-or (b) information-based approaches. Structure basedapproaches compute dissimilarity between keywords using a (weighted) count of edgesbetween two keywords. Information-base approaches; on the other hand; leverage availablecorpora to extract additional information; such as keyword frequency; to achieve betterperformance in similarity computation than structure-based approaches. Unfortunately; inmany application domains (such as applications that rely on unique-keys in a relationaldatabase); frequency information required by information-based approaches does not …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,71
GPER: Geographic power efficient routing in sensor networks,Shibo Wu; K Selcuk Candan,This work presents a new geographical power efficient routing (GPER) protocol for sensornetworks. Each sensor node makes local decisions as to how far to transmit: therefore; theprotocol is power efficient; highly distributed and scalable. In GPER; given a finaldestination; each node first establishes a sub-destination within its maximum radio range.The node; however; may decide to relay the packet to this sub-destination through anintermediary node; if this preserves power. Furthermore; this intermediary node may actindependently and alter the subdestination based on its own power range andneighborhood status. Simulation results show that the routing power consumption usingGPER is close to optimal obtainable based on full knowledge of the network. GPER provides60%-90% savings over other power-sensitive routing solutions. For sensor networks with …,Network Protocols; 2004. ICNP 2004.

View invalidation for dynamic content caching in multitiered architectures,K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal; Wen-Syan Li; Oliver Po; Wang-Pin Hsiung,Abstract In today's multitiered application architectures; clients do not access data stored inthe databases directly. Instead; they use applications which in turn invoke the DBMS togenerate the relevant content. Since executing application programs may require significanttime and other resources; it is more advantageous to cache application results in a resultcache. Various view materialization and update management techniques have beenproposed to deal with updates to the underlying data. These techniques guarantee that thecached results are always consistent with the underlying data. Several applications;including e-commerce sites; on the other hand; do not require the caches be consistent allthe time. Instead; they require that all outdated pages in the caches are invalidated in atimely fashion. In this paper; we show that invalidation is inherently different from view …,Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Very Large Data Bases,2002,59
Retrieval schedules based on resource availability and flexible presentation specifications,K Selçuk Candan; B Prabhakaran; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract. A distributed multimedia document presentation involves retrieval of objects fromone or more document servers and their presentation at the client system. The presentationof the multimedia objects has to be carried out in accordance with the specification oftemporal relationships between the objects. The retrieval of multimedia objects from thedocument server (s) is influenced by factors such as temporal specification of objectspresentations; throughput offered by the network service provider; and the buffer resourceson the client system. Flexibility in the temporal specification of the multimedia document mayhelp in deriving an object retrieval schedule that can handle variations in networkthroughput and buffer resource availability.

Similarity-based ranking and query processing in multimedia databases,K Selçuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li; M Lakshmi Priya,Abstract Since media-based evaluation yields similarity values; results to a multimediadatabase query; Q (Y 1;…; Y n); is defined as an ordered list SQ of n-tuples of the form< X1;…; X n>. The query Q itself is composed of a set of fuzzy and crisp predicates; constants;variables; and conjunction; disjunction; and negation operators. Since many multimediaapplications require partial matches; SQ includes results which do not satisfy all predicates.Due to the ranking and partial match requirements; traditional query processing techniquesdo not apply to multimedia databases.

SBV-Cut: Vertex-cut based graph partitioning using structural balance vertices,Mijung Kim; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Graphs are used for modeling a large spectrum of data from the web; to socialconnections between individuals; to concept maps and ontologies. As the number andcomplexities of graph based applications increase; rendering these graphs more compact;easier to understand; and navigate through are becoming crucial tasks. One approach tograph simplification is to partition the graph into smaller parts; so that instead of the wholegraph; the partitions and their inter-connections need to be considered. Commonapproaches to graph partitioning involve identifying sets of edges (or edge-cuts) or vertices(or vertex-cuts) whose removal partitions the graph into the target number of disconnectedcomponents. While edge-cuts result in partitions that are vertex disjoint; in vertex-cuts thedata vertices can serve as bridges between the resulting data partitions; consequently …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2012,44

Hiding Traversal of Tree Structured Data from Untrusted Data Stores.,Ping Lin; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract. With the increasing use of web services; many new challenges concerning datasecurity are becoming critical. Especially in mobile services; where clients are generally thinin terms of computation power and storage space; a remote server can be outsourced for thecomputation or can act as a data store. Unfortunately; such a data store may not always betrustworthy and clients with sensitive data and queries may want to be protected frommalicious attacks. In this paper; we present a technique to hide tree structured data frompotentially malicious data stores; while allowing clients to traverse the data to locate anobject of interest without leaking information to the data store. The two motivatingapplications for this approach are hiding (1) tree-like XML data as well as XML queries thatare in the form of tree-paths; and (2) tree-structured indexes and queries executed on …,WOSIS,2004,41
Collaborative multimedia systems: Synthesis of media objects,K. Selcuk  Candan; P Venkat Rangan; VS Subrahmanian,When a group {/1;...; l/sub n/} of individuals wishes to collaboratively construct a complexmultimedia document; the first requirement is that they be able to manipulate media-objectscreated by one another.

Since media-based evaluation yields similarity values; results to such aquery is defined as an ordered set. Since many multimedia applications require partialmatches; query results also include tuples which do not satisfy all predicates. Hence; anyfuzzy semantics which extends the boolean semantics of conjunction in a straight forwardmanner may not be desirable for multimedia databases. In this paper; we focus on theproblem of 'given a multimedia query which consists of multiple fuzzy and crisp predicates;how to provide the user with a meaningful overall ranking.'More specifically; we study the …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2001,37
Topic segmentation of message hierarchies for indexing and navigation support,Jong Wook Kim; K Selçuk Candan; Mehmet E Dönderler,Abstract Message hierarchies in web discussion boards grow with new postings. Threads ofmessages evolve as new postings focus within or diverge from the original themes of thethreads. Thus; just by investigating the subject headings or contents of earlier postings in amessage thread; one may not be able to guess the contents of the later postings. Theresulting navigation problem is further compounded for blind users who need the help of ascreen reader program that can provide only a linear representation of the content. We seethat; in order to overcome the navigation obstacle for blind as well as sighted users; it isessential to develop techniques that help identify how the content of a discussion boardgrows through generalizations and specializations of topics. This knowledge can be used insegmenting the content in coherent units and guiding the users through segments …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,36
FICSR: f eedback-based inc on s istency r esolution and query processing on misaligned data sources,Yan Qi; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract A critical reality in data integration is that knowledge from different sources mayoften be conflicting with each other. Conflict resolutioncan be costly and; if done withoutproper context; can be ineffective. In this paper; we propose a novel query-driven andfeedback-based approach (FICSR 1) to conflict resolution when integrating data sources. Inparticular; instead of relying on traditional model based definition of consistency; weintroduce a ranked interpretation. This not only enables FICSR to deal with the complexity ofthe conflict resolution process; but also helps achieve a more direct match between theusers'(subjective) interpretation of the data and the system's (objective) treatment of theavailable alternatives. Consequently; the ranked interpretation leads to new opportunities forbi-directional (data informs over↔ user) feedback cycle for conflict resolution: given a …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,35
Cosena: a context-based search and navigation system,Mario Cataldi; Claudio Schifanella; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino; Luigi Di Caro,Abstract Most of the existing document and web search engines rely on keyword-basedqueries. To find matches; these queries are processed using retrieval algorithms that rely onword frequencies; topic recentness; document authority; and (in some cases) availableontologies. In this paper; we propose an innovative approach to exploring text collectionsusing a novel keywords-by-concepts (KbC) graph; which supports navigation using domain-specific concepts as well as keywords that are characterizing the text corpus. The KbC graphis a weighted graph; created by tightly integrating keywords extracted from documents andconcepts obtained from domain taxonomies. Documents in the corpus are associated to thenodes of the graph based on evidence supporting contextual relevance; thus; the KbC graphsupports contextually informed access to these documents. In this paper; we also present …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems,2009,34
Collaborative multimedia documents: Authoring and presentation,K Selçuk Candan; B Prabhakaran; VS Subrahmanian,Multimedia documents are composed of different data types such as video; audio; text andimages. Authoring a multimedia document is a creative exercise. Unlike traditional computersupported collaborative work where documents are composed of static objects; multimediadocuments have temporal; spatial and quality of service (QoS) requirements that must besupported by any collaborative multimedia platform. In this paper; we show that mostrequirements (including temporal; spatial; and QoS requirements) for collaborativemultimedia systems can be expressed in terms of a highly-structured class of linearconstraints called difference constraints that have been well-studied in the operationsresearch literature. As a consequence; well known algorithms for solving differenceconstraints may be used as a starting point for creating multimedia documents. Based on …,*,1998,33
WebDB: A web query system and its modeling; language; and implementation,Wen-Syan Li; Junho Shim; K Selcuk Candan; Yoshinori Hara,The World-Wide Web can be viewed as a collection of multimedia documents in the form ofWeb pages connected through hyperlinks.

RanKloud: scalable multimedia data processing in server clusters,K Selcuk Candan; Jong Kim; Parth Nagarkar; Mithila Nagendra; Renwei Yu,Multimedia data is produced in massive quantities. The applications that drive this massivedata influx today span a large spectrum; from entertainment; surveillance; and e-commerceto Web content and social media. This data flood brings forth a need for highly parallelizableframeworks for scalable processing and efficient analysis of large media collections. In thisarticle; we have observed that a major obstacle in executing large media-analysisoperations in a scalable manner is that; when implemented naively; a significant portion ofthe work might be wasted. RanKloud is a system we are developing for share-nothing;batched parallelization of large media-analysis operations in a waste-avoiding manner.RanKloud achieves this by treating the utility of the data and features to the given analysisas an integral part of the process and by developing data partitioning and resource …,IEEE MultiMedia,2011,32
Feedback-driven result ranking and query refinement for exploring semi-structured data collections,Huiping Cao; Yan Qi; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Feedback process has been used extensively in document-centric applications;such as text retrieval and multimedia retrieval. Recently; there have been efforts to applyfeedback to semi-structured XML document collections as well. In this paper; we note thatfeedback can also be an effective tool for exploring (through result ranking and queryrefinement) large semi-structured data collections. In particular; in large scale data sharingand curation environments; where the user may not know the structure of the data; queriesmay initially be overly vague. Given a path query and a set of results identified by the systemto this query over the data; we consider two types of feedback: Soft feedback captures theuser's preference for some features over the others. Hard feedback; on the other hand;expresses users' assertions regarding whether certain features should be further …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,32

Separate virtual active networks sharing proxy servers in differenthierarchical structures are formed for different streams of media data; and the differenthierarchical structures are dynamically reconfigured independently of one another.Redistribution and consolidation of data paths through the hierarchical structures isperformed by the proxy network coordinator in response to messages from the proxy serversof a hierarchical structure.,*,2004,31
Scalable filtering of multiple generalized-tree-pattern queries over XML streams,Songting Chen; Hua-Gang Li; Jun'ichi Tatemura; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan,An XML publish/subscribe system needs to filter a large number of queries over XMLstreams. Most existing systems only consider filtering the simple XPath statements. In thispaper; we focus on filtering of the more complex generalized-tree-pattern (GTP) queries. Ourfiltering mechanism is based on a novel Tree-of-Path (TOP) encoding scheme; whichcompactly represents the path matches for the entire document. First; we show that the TOPencodings can be efficiently produced via a shared bottom-up path matching. Second; withthe aid of this TOP encoding; we can (1) achieve polynomial time and space complexity forpost processing;(2) avoid redundant predicate evaluations;(3) allow an efficient duplicate-free and merge join-based algorithm for merging multiple encoded path matches and (4)simplify the processing of GTP queries. Overall our approach maximizes the sharing …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2008,30
Sum-max monotonic ranked joins for evaluating top-k twig queries on weighted data graphs,Yan Qi; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract In many applications; the underlying data (the web; an XML document; or arelational database) can be seen as a graph. These graphs may be enriched with weights;associated with the nodes and edges of the graph; denoting application specificdesirability/penalty assessments; such as popularity; trust; or cost. A particular challengewhen considering such weights in query processing is that results need to be rankedaccordingly. Answering keyword-based queries on weighted graphs is shown to becomputationally expensive. In this paper; we first show that answering queries with furtherstructure imposed on them remains NP-hard. We next show that; while the query evaluationtask can be viewed in terms of ranked structural-joins along query axes; the monotonicityproperty; necessary for ranked join algorithms; is violated. Consequently; traditional …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,30
Engineering and hosting adaptive freshness-sensitive web applications on data centers,Wen-Syan Li; Oliver Po; Wang-Pin Hsiung; K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Wide-area database replication technologies and the availability of content deliverynetworks allow Web applications to be hosted and served from powerful data centers. Thisform of application support requires a complete Web application suite to be distributed alongwith the database replicas. A major advantage of this approach is that dynamic content isserved from locations closer to users; leading into reduced network latency and fastresponse times. However; this is achieved at the expense of overheads due to (a)invalidation of cached dynamic content in the edge caches and (b) synchronization ofdatabase replicas in the data center. These have adverse effects on the freshness ofdelivered content. In this paper; we propose a freshness-driven adaptive dynamic contentcaching; which monitors the system status and adjusts caching policies to provide content …,Proceedings of the 12th international conference on World Wide Web,2003,30
Using tagflake for condensing navigable tag hierarchies from tag clouds,Luigi Di Caro; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract We present the tagFlake system; which supports semantically informed navigationwithin a tag cloud. tagFlake relies on TMine for organizing tags extracted from textualcontent in hierarchical organizations; suitable for navigation; visualization; classification; andtracking. TMine extracts the most significant tag/terms from text documents and maps themonto a hierarchy in such a way that descendant terms are contextually dependent on theirancestors within the given corpus of documents. This provides tagFlake with a mechanismfor enabling navigation within the tag space and for classification of the text documentsbased on the contextual structure captured by the created hierarchy. tagFlake is languageneutral; since it does not rely on any natural language processing technique and isunsupervised.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,29
Reasoning for web document associations and its applications in site map construction,K Selçuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li,Abstract Recently; there is an interest in using associations between Web pages in providingusers with pages relevant to what they are currently viewing. We believe that; to enableintelligent decisions; we need to answer the question “for a given set of pages; find out whythey are associated”. We present a framework for reasoning about Web documentassociations. We start from the observation that the reasons of the Web page associationsare implicitly embedded in the content of the pages as well as the links connecting them.The association reasoning scheme we propose is based on a random walk algorithm. Thisalgorithm can take both link structure and contents into consideration and allows users tospecify a focus. We then show how the proposed algorithm; combined with a logical domainidentification technique; can be used for Web site summarization and Web site map …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2002,29
Scalable xml filtering with bottom up path matching and encoded path joins,*,Systems and methods to provide two bottom up path matching solutions and one postprocessing solution for evaluating value predicates and tree pattern queries. The first pathmatching method triggers the matching whenever a leaf query step is seen and stores theprefix sub-matches in a cache for reuse. The second path matching method is an NFA (non-deterministic finite state automata) based solution through a post-order traversal of the XMLdocument tree. The post processing method relies on a compact encoding the path results;which avoids redundant value predicate; join evaluations and any duplicate elimination; sortand grouping operations.,*,2008,28
Towards a theory of collaborative multimedia,K Selcuk Candan; VS Subrahmanian; P Venkat Rangan,We develop a theory of media objects; and present optimal algorithms for collaborativesynthesis of media objects.

Method and apparatus for distributed indexing,*,Disclosed is a method and apparatus for providing range based queries over distributednetwork nodes. Each of a plurality of distributed network nodes stores at least a portion of alogical index tree. The nodes of the logical index tree are mapped to the network nodesbased on a hash function. Load balancing is addressed by replicating the logical index treenodes in the distributed physical nodes in the network. In one embodiment the logical indextree comprises a plurality of logical nodes for indexing available resources in a gridcomputing system. The distributed network nodes are broker nodes for assigning gridcomputing resources to requesting users. Each of the distributed broker nodes stores atleast a portion of the logical index tree.,*,2007,27
Safety guarantee of continuous join queries over punctuated data streams,Hua-Gang Li; Songting Chen; Junichi Tatemura; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan; Wang-Pin Hsiung,Abstract Continuous join queries (CJQ) are needed for correlating data from multiplestreams. One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the datastreams are infinite; this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventuallyrun out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address thisproblem. In particular; punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and; hence;enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given aset of available punctuation schemes; if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unboundedstorage; then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running.Unfortunately; while punctuation semantics is clearly useful; the mechanisms to identify ifand how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,27
A unified treatment of null values using constraints,K Selçuk Candan; John Grant; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract An important reality when studying relational databases is the fact that entries inrelational tables may often be “missing” or only partially specified. The study of such missinginformation has led to a rich body of work on “null values.” It was recognized early on thatthere are many different types of null values; each of which reflects different intuitions aboutwhy a particular piece of information is missing. Different relations (or even the samerelation) could contain different types of null values; yet; very little work has been done onproviding a unifying model that reasons with different types of nulls. In this paper; we useconstraints to provide a unifying framework for the most common types of nulls. We showhow viewing tuples containing null values of these types can be viewed as constraints andhow this leads to an algebra for null values. In particular; this algebra contains a unique …,Information Sciences,1997,27
Creating tag hierarchies for effective navigation in social media,K Selçuk Candan; Luigi Di Caro; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract In social media; such as blogs; since the content naturally evolves over time; it ishard or in many cases impossible to organize the content for effective navigation. Thus; onecommonly has to resort to simple tools; such as tags and tag clouds; for presentingfrequently used keywords to users to provide them at least some high level idea about thecontent of a given set of social media entries. Most visualizations of tag clouds vary the sizesof the fonts to differentiate important tags from those that are less important. We propose analternative" contextual-layout" method; TMine; for analyzing and presenting tags that areextracted from textual content. In TMine tags are first mapped onto a latent semantic space.Then; TMine analyzes the relationships between tags relying on an extended booleaninterpretation of the semantic space.

Continuous planning for solving business process adaptivity,Andrea Marrella; Massimo Mecella,Abstract Process Management Systems (PMSs; aka Workflow Management Systems–WfMSs) are currently more and more used as a supporting tool to coordinate the enactmentof processes. In real world scenarios; the environment may change in unexpected ways soas to prevent a process from being successfully carried out. In order to cope with theseanomalous situations; a PMS should automatically adapt the process without completelyreplacing it. In this paper; we propose a technique; based on continuous planning; toautomatically cope with unexpected changes; in order to modify only those parts of theprocess that need to be changed/adapted and keeping other parts stable. We also provide arunning example that shows the practical applicability of the approach.,*,2011,25
Using random walks for mining web document associations,K Selçuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li,Abstract World Wide Web has emerged as a primary means for storing and structuringinformation. In this paper; we present a framework for mining implicit associations amongWeb documents. We focus on the following problem:“For a given set of seed URLs; find a listof Web pages which reflect the association among these seeds.” In the proposed framework;associations of two documents are induced by the connectivity and linking path length.Based on this framework; we have developed a random walk-based Web mining techniqueand validated it by experiments on real Web data. In this paper; we also discuss theextension of the algorithm for considering document contents.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2000,25
sDTW: computing DTW distances using locally relevant constraints based on salient feature alignments,K Selçuk Candan; Rosaria Rossini; Xiaolan Wang; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Many applications generate and consume temporal data and retrieval of time seriesis a key processing step in many application domains. Dynamic time warping (DTW)distance between time series of size N and M is computed relying on a dynamicprogramming approach which creates and fills an N x M grid to search for an optimal warppath. Since this can be costly; various heuristics have been proposed to cut away thepotentially unproductive portions of the DTW grid. In this paper; we argue that time seriesoften carry structural features that can be used for identifying locally relevant constraints toeliminate redundant work. Relying on this observation; we propose salient feature basedsDTW algorithms which first identify robust salient features in the given time series and thenfind a consistent alignment of these to establish the boundaries for the warp path search …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,24

This requires a complete ecommerceweb site suite (ie edge caches; Web servers; application servers; and DBMS) to bedistributed along with the database replicas. A major advantage of this approach is; like thecaches; the possibility of serving dynamic content from a location close to the users;reducing network latency. However; this is achieved at the expense of additional overhead;caused by the need of invalidating dynamic content cached in the edge caches andsynchronization of the database replicas in the data center.

Maintaining XPath views in loosely coupled systems,Arsany Sawires; Junichi Tatemura; Oliver Po; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract We address the problem of maintaining materialized XPath views in environmentswhere the view maintenance system and the base data system are loosely-coupled. Weshow that the recently proposed XPath view maintenance techniques require tight coupling;and thus are not practical for loosely-coupled systems. Our solution adapts to loose-couplingby using information that is fully available through standard XPath interfaces. Thisinformation consists of the view definition; the update statement; and the current materializedview result. Under this model; incremental maintenance is not always possible; thus;maintaining the consistency of the views requires frequent view recomputations. Our goal isto reduce the frequency of view recomputation by detecting cases where a base update isirrelevant to a view; and cases where a view is self maintainable given a base update.

IFQ: a visual query interface and query generator for object-based media retrieval,Wen-Syan Li; K Selcuk Candan; Kyoji Hirata; Yoshinori Hara,There are two major directions for image retrieval system development. The first direction isthe direct manipulation of information using query languages; which are precise tocomputers but not user friendly. The second direction is the development of naturalinterfaces; such as query by image example. The latter approach has the advantage ofbetter query visualization; but it usually yields a low precision because users' drawings maynot be precise. IFQ (In Frame Query) is a visual user query interface for object-based mediaretrieval systems. It aims at not only providing a natural visual query interface but alsosupporting precise direct manipulation through automated query generation. Furthermore;IFQ gives users the flexibility of using combinations of semantic expressions; conceptualdefinitions; sketch; and image examples to pose queries.,Multimedia Computing and Systems' 97.

Demand-scalable geographic multicasting in wireless sensor networks,Shibo Wu; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract In this paper; we focus on the challenge of demand-scalable multicast routing inwireless sensor networks. Due to the ad-hoc nature of the placement of the sensor nodes aswell as the variations in the available power of the nodes; centralized or stateful routingschemes are not applicable. Thus; in this paper; we first introduce a Geographic Multicastrouting Protocol (GMP) for wireless sensor networks. 1 The protocol is fully distributed andstateless. Given a set of the destinations; the transmitting node first constructs a virtualEuclidean Steiner tree rooted at itself and including the destinations; using a novel andhighly efficient reduction ratio heuristic (called rrSTR). The simulation results on NS2 showthat GMP requires 25% less hops and energy than the existing Position Based Multicasting;PBM; Location-Guided Steiner trees; LGS; approaches.

On overlay schemes to support point-in-range queries for scalable grid resource discovery,Liping Chen; K Selçuk Candan; Junichi Tatemura; Divyakant Agrawal; Dirceu Cavendish,A resource directory is a critical component of a grid architecture. P2P computing paradigmcould address some of the scalability issues that make distributed resource discoveryservices challenging. Unfortunately; most existing distributed hash table (DHT) based P2Poverlays have difficulty in treating attribute range queries that are common in resourcediscovery lookups. This paper proposes a general framework for range-based resourcediscovery. In particular; the proposed framework maps tree-structured logical data (ie; rangeindexing) onto a DHT-based physical node space (ie; resource brokers). In this paper; weconsider three mapping schemes from the logical space onto the physical space.

Secure and privacy preserving outsourcing of tree structured data,Ping Lin; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract With the increasing use of web services; many new challenges concerning datasecurity are becoming critical. Data or applications can now be outsourced to powerfulremote servers; which are able to provide services on behalf of the owners. Unfortunately;such hosts may not always be trustworthy. In [1; 2]; we presented a one-servercomputationally private tree traversal technique; which allows clients to outsource tree-structured data. In this paper; we extend this protocol to prevent a polynomial time serverwith large memory to use correlations in client queries and in data structures to learn privateinformation about queries and data. We show that; when the proposed techniques are used;computational privacy is achieved even for non-uniformly distributed node accesses that arecommon in real databases.,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2004,22
Hierarchical image modeling for object-based media retrieval,Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan; Kyoji Hirata; Yoshinori Hara,Abstract Images are more structurally complex than the data stored in the traditional DBMSs.Many systems perform media retrieval based on image feature matching; the fact thatimages have structures is ignored. On the other hand; we view images as compound objectscontaining many component objects. Each component object corresponds to a region (s)that is a visually and semantically meaningful entity (eg car; man; etc.). As images/objectstruly have hierarchical structures and have both visual and semantics properties; we arguethat image retrieval using either semantics and image matching alone is insufficient. In thispaper; we introduce a hierarchical structure for image modeling to support image retrievalusing combinations of semantic expressions and visual examples at both the whole imageand object levels.

Based on automated schema matching with uncertainty; the UQBE system returnsthe best confident results. The system lets the user refine them interactively. A tuple in thequery result is associated with lineage that is a boolean formula over schema matchingdecisions representing underlying conditions on which the corresponding tuple is includedin the result. Given binary feedbacks on tuples by the user; which are possibly imprecise; thesystem solves it as an optimization problem to refine confidence values of matchingdecisions.

Freshness-driven adaptive caching for dynamic content Web sites,Wen-Syan Li; Oliver Po; Wang-Pin Hsiung; K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Both response time and content freshness are essential to e-commerceapplications on the Web. One option to achieve good response time is to build a highperformance Web site by deploying the state of art IT infrastructures with large network andserver capacities. With such a system architecture; freshness of the content delivered islimited by the network latency since when users receive the contents; the contents may havechanged at the server. With the wide availability of content delivery networks; many e-commerce Web applications utilize edge cache servers to cache and deliver dynamiccontents at locations much closer to users; avoiding network latency. By caching a largenumber of dynamic content pages in the edge cache servers; response time can bereduced; benefiting from higher cache hit rates.

We view querying multimediadatabase as a combination of IR; image matching; and traditional database queryprocessing and it should be conducted in a way of perpetual query reformulation for honingtarget results. In this paper we present a hybrid multimedia database system; which employsa hierarchical database statistics structure for both query optimization and reformulationanalysis without adding additional query processing cost.,VLDB,1997,19
Skip-and-prune: cosine-based top-k query processing for efficient context-sensitive document retrieval,Jong Wook Kim; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Keyword search and ranked retrieval together emerged as popular data accessparadigms for various kinds of data; from web pages to XML and relational databases. Auser can submit keywords without knowing much (sometimes nothing) about the complexstructure underlying a data collection; yet the system can identify; rank; and return a set ofrelevant matches by exploiting statistics about the distribution and structure of the data.Keyword-based data models are also suitable for capturing user's search context in terms ofweights associated to the keywords in the query. Given a search context; the data in thedatabase can also be re-interpreted for semantically correct retrieval. This option; however;is often ignored as the cost of re-assessing the content in the database naively tends to beprohibitive. In this paper; we first argue that top-k query processing can help tackle this …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,18

Such slow response times anddown times can be devastating for e-commerce sites as indicated in a recent study by ZonaResearch [1] on the relationship between Web page download time and user abandonmentrate. The study shows that only 2% of users will leave a Web site (ie abandonment rate) ifthe download time is less than 7 seconds. However; The abandonment rate goes up to 70%when the download time is around 12 seconds. This study clearly establishes theimportance of fast response times to an e-commerce Web site to retain its customers. Onepossible solution to this problem is to deploy network-wide caches so that a large fraction …,VLDB,2001,18

Optimization of media processing workflows with adaptive operator behaviors,Lina Peng; K Selçuk Candan; Christopher Mayer; Karamvir S Chatha; Kyung Dong Ryu,Abstract In this paper; we present the ARIA media processing workflow architecture thatprocesses; filters; and fuses sensory inputs and actuates responses in real-time. Thecomponents of the architecture are programmable and adaptable; ie the delay; size; andquality/precision characteristics of the individual operators can be controlled via a number ofparameters. Each data object processed by qStream components is subject totransformations based on the parameter values. For instance; the quality of an output dataobject and the corresponding processing delay and resource usage depend on the valuesassigned to parameters of the operators in the object flow path. In Candan; Peng; Ryu;Chatha; Mayer (Efficient stream routing in quality-and resource-adaptive flow architectures.In: Workshop on multimedia information systems; 2004); we introduced a class of flow …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2007,17
Approximate tensor decomposition within a tensor-relational algebraic framework,Mijung Kim; Kasim Selçuk Candan,Abstract In this paper; we first introduce a tensor-based relational data model and definealgebraic operations on this model. We note that; while in traditional relational algebraicsystems the join operation tends to be the costliest operation of all; in the tensor-relationalframework presented here; tensor decomposition becomes the computationally costliestoperation. Therefore; we consider optimization of tensor decomposition operations within arelational algebraic framework. This leads to a highly efficient; effective; and easy-to-parallelize join-by-decomposition approach and a corresponding KL-divergence basedoptimization strategy. Experimental results provide evidence that minimizing KL-divergencewithin the proposed join-by-decomposition helps approximate the conventional join-then-decompose scheme well; without the associated time and space costs.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,16
Supporting OLAP operations over imperfectly integrated taxonomies,Yan Qi; K Selçuk Candan; Junichi Tatemura; Songting Chen; Fenglin Liao,Abstract OLAP is an important tool in decision support. With the help of domain knowledge;such as hierarchies of attribute values; OLAP helps the user observe the effects of variousdecisions. One assumption of most OLAP operations is that the available domain knowledgeis precise. In particular; they assume that the hierarchy of values over which the user cannavigate forms a taxonomy. In this paper; we first note that when multiple heterogeneousdata sources are involved in the gathering of the data and the associated domainknowledge; the integrated knowledge-base; constructed by combining locally availabletaxonomies based on the concept matchings; may not be a taxonomy itself. Specifically;existence of intersections among concepts from different sources compromises the tree-structure of the integrated taxonomy and prevents effective use of hierarchical navigation …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,16
Discovering web document associations for web site summarization,K Selςuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li,Abstract Complex web information structures prevent search engines from providingsatisfactory context-sensitive retrieval. We see that in order to overcome this obstacle; it isessential to use techniques that recover the web authors' intentions and superimpose themwith the users' retrieval contexts in summarizing web sites. Therefore; in this paper; wepresent a framework for discovering implicit associations among web documents foreffective web site summarization. In the proposed framework; associations of webdocuments are induced by the web structure embedding them; as well as the contents of thedocuments and users' interests. We analyze the semantics of document associations anddescribe an algorithm which capture these semantics for enumerating and ranking possibledocument associations. We then use these asociations in creating context-sensitive …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2001,16
Skyline-sensitive joins with LR-pruning,Mithila Nagendra; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Efficient processing of skyline queries has been an area of growing interest. Mostexisting techniques assume that the skyline query is applied to a single data table.Unfortunately; this is not true in many applications where; due to the complexity of theschema; the skyline query may involve attributes belonging to multiple tables. Recently;various hybrid skyline-join algorithms have been proposed. However; the current proposalssuffer from several drawbacks: they often need to scan the input tables exhaustively in orderto obtain the set of skyline-join results; moreover; the pruning techniques employed toeliminate the tuples are largely based on expensive pairwise tuple-to-tuple comparisons. Inthis paper; we aim to address these shortcomings by proposing two novel skyline-joinalgorithms; namely skyline-sensitive join (S 2 J) and symmetric skyline-sensitive join (S 3 …,Proceedings of the 15th international conference on extending database technology,2012,15
System support for exploration and expert feedback in resolving conflicts during integration of metadata,K Selçuk Candan; Huiping Cao; Yan Qi; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract A critical reality in integration is that knowledge obtained from different sources mayoften be conflicting. Conflict-resolution; whether performed during the design phase orduring run-time; can be costly and; if done without a proper understanding of the usagecontext; can be ineffective. In this paper; we propose a novel exploration and feedback-based approach [FICSR (Pronounced as" fixer")] to conflict-resolution when integratingmetadata from different sources. Rather than relying on purely automated conflict-resolutionmechanisms; FICSR brings the domain expert in the conflict-resolution process and informsthe integration based on the expert's feedback. In particular; instead of relying on traditionalmodel based definition of consistency (which; whenever there are conflicts; picks a possibleworld among many); we introduce a ranked interpretation of the metadata and statements …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,15
Load and network aware query routing for information integration,W-S Li; Vishal S Batra; Vijayshankar Raman; Wei Han; K Selcuk Candan; Inderpal Narang,Current federated systems deploy cost-based query optimization mechanisms; ie; theoptimizer selects a global query plan with the lowest cost to execute. Thus; cost functionsinfluence what remote sources (ie equivalent data sources) to access and how federatedqueries are processed. In most federated systems; the underlying cost model is based ondatabase statistics and query statements; however; the system load of remote sources andthe dynamic nature of the network latency in wide area networks are not considered. As aresult; federated query processing solutions can not adapt to runtime environment changes;such as network congestion or heavy workloads at remote sources. We present a novelsystem architecture that deploys a query cost calibrator to calibrate the cost function basedon system load and network latency at the remote sources and consequently indirectly" …,Data Engineering; 2005.

Evaluations of architectural designs and implementation for database-driven web sites,Wen-Syan Li; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Oliver Po; K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Response time is a key differentiation point among electronic commerce (e-commerce) applications. For many e-commerce applications; Web pages are createddynamically based on the current business state; stored in database systems. Thearchitecture of database-driven e-commerce Web sites are more complex than that of typicalWeb sites. It requires integration of Web servers; application servers; and back-enddatabase systems as well as synchronization of multiple databases if caches are used foracceleration of content delivery. In this paper; we analyze the factors that impact theperformance and scalability of a database-driven Web site. We experimentally test (1) theperformance metrics of database update; query; and synchronization;(2) trigger overhead;and (3) application server (AS) and database connection overhead and constraints.

Supporting efficient multimedia database exploration,Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan; Kyoji Hirata; Yoshinori Hara,Abstract. Due to the fuzziness of query specification and media matching; multimediaretrieval is conducted by way of exploration. It is essential to provide feedback so that userscan visualize query reformulation alternatives and database content distribution. Sincemedia matching is an expensive task; another issue is how to efficiently support explorationso that the system is not overloaded by perpetual query reformulation. In this paper; wepresent a uniform framework to represent statistical information of both semantics and visualmetadata for images in the databases. We propose the concept of query verification; whichevaluates queries using statistics; and provides users with feedback; including the strictnessand reformulation alternatives of each query condition as well as estimated numbers ofmatches. With query verification; the system increases the efficiency of the multimedia …,The VLDB journal,2001,15
R 2 DF framework for ranked path queries over weighted RDF graphs,Juan P Cedeño; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a semantic web specification that aimsto support conceptual modeling of information about resources in the form of a triples offacts. In this paper; we note that; although RDF provides mechanisms to encode meta-information (such as source; trust; or certainty) about facts recorded in the knowledge base;existing RDF query languages and RDF stores fail to support key primitives needed in alarge class of knowledge applications which associate utilities or costs on the availableknowledge statements. To address this shortcoming; we propose a novel R 2 DF frameworkfor utility ranked resource descriptions. We first propose a simple ranked RDF (R2DF)specification to enhance RDF triples with an application specific weight (eg cost).

Navigating within news collections using tag-flakes,Luigi Di Caro; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract The use of tag clouds is common for presenting frequently occurring tags orkeywords in a collection to the users. Most visualizations of tag clouds vary the sizes of thefonts to differentiate important tags from others. This; however; is sufficient neither to help theuser explore and discover relationships between tags in a collection; nor to help track thechanges in these relationships across time frames in dynamic collections. In this paper; wepropose an alternative “contextual-layout” method; tag-flakes; for presenting tags orkeywords that are associated with dynamically evolving textual content; like news streams. ATMine algorithm first maps tags onto a latent semantic space. However; instead of using thislatent semantic space to simply cluster and index the documents (as commonly done inmany existing schemes); TMine analyzes the relationships between tags in this semantic …,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,2011,14

View management in multimedia databases,K Selçuk Candan; Eric Lemar; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract Though there has been extensive work on multimedia databases in the last fewyears; there is no prevailing notion of a multimedia view; nor there are techniques to create;manage; and maintain such views. Visualizing the results of a dynamic multimedia query ormaterializing a dynamic multimedia view corresponds to assembling and delivering aninteractive multimedia presentation in accordance with the visualization specifications. Inthis paper; we suggest that a non-interactive multimedia presentation is a set of virtualobjects with associated spatial and temporal presentation constraints. A virtual object iseither an object; or the result of a query. As queries may have different answers at differentpoints in time; scheduling the presentation of such objects is nontrivial.

Decomposition-by-normalization (DBN): leveraging approximate functional dependencies for efficient tensor decomposition,Mijung Kim; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract For many multi-dimensional data applications; tensor operations as well asrelational operations need to be supported throughout the data lifecycle. Although tensordecomposition is shown to be effective for multi-dimensional data analysis; the cost of tensordecomposition is often very high. We propose a novel decomposition-by-normalizationscheme that first normalizes the given relation into smaller tensors based on the functionaldependencies of the relation and then performs the decomposition using these smallertensors. The decomposition and recombination steps of the decomposition-by-normalizationscheme fit naturally in settings with multiple cores. This leads to a highly efficient; effective;and parallelized decomposition-by-normalization algorithm for both dense and sparsetensors.

Propagation-vectors for trees (PVT): concise yet effective summaries for hierarchical data and trees,Venkata Snehith Cherukuri; Kasim Selçuk Candan,Abstract Summarization of hierarchical data and metadata is a fundamental operation inapplications in many domains. In particular; similarity search of hierarchical data; such asXML; would benefit greatly from concise and indexable summaries. This is especially true inP2P scenarios; where the search needs to be done in a distributed fashion on multiplepeers. This situation requires summaries which are small; yet effective in identifying potentialpeers that need to be further explored. In this paper; we propose a method; calledpropagation-vectors for trees (PVT) which constructs very concise and accurate summariesof hierarchical data; such as XML trees. We then show how to use this summary to performsimilarity search on summarized data. The proposed summarization scheme relies on alabel-propagation mechanism; which constructs an n-dimensional vector from a given …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM workshop on Large-Scale distributed systems for information retrieval,2008,13

In another method;invalidation processing is performed by locking a database which is locked duringprocessing so as to reflect the state of the database at the beginning of processing; and anupdate log that reflects all updates to the database since the beginning of the precedingprocessing cycle.

Challenges and practices in deploying web acceleration solutions for distributed enterprise systems,Wen-Syan Li; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Oliver Po; Koji Hino; Kasim Selcuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract For most Web-based applications; contents are created dynamically based on thecurrent state of a business; such as product prices and inventory; stored in databasesystems. These applications demand personalized content and track user behavior whilemaintaining application integrity. Many of such practices are not compatible with Webacceleration solutions. Consequently; although many web acceleration solutions haveshown promising performance improvement and scalability; architecting and engineeringdistributed enterprise Web applications to utilize available content delivery networksremains a challenge.

LWI-SVD: low-rank; windowed; incremental singular value decompositions on time-evolving data sets,Xilun Chen; K Selcuk Candan,Abstract Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is computationally costly and therefore anaive implementation does not scale to the needs of scenarios where data evolvescontinuously. While there are various on-line analysis and incremental decompositiontechniques; these may not accurately represent the data or may be slow for the needs ofmany applications. To address these challenges; in this paper; we propose a Low-rank;Windowed; Incremental SVD (LWI-SVD) algorithm; which (a) leverages efficient andaccurate low-rank approximations to speed up incremental SVD updates and (b) uses awindow-based approach to aggregate multiple incoming updates (insertions or deletions ofrows and columns) and; thus; reduces on-line processing costs.

Discovering mappings in hierarchical data from multiple sources using the inherent structure,K Selçuk Candan; Jong Wook Kim; Huan Liu; Reshma Suvarna,Abstract Unprecedented amounts of media data are publicly accessible. However; it isincreasingly difficult to integrate relevant media from multiple and diverse sources foreffective applications. The functioning of a multimodal integration system requires metadata;such as ontologies; that describe media resources and media components. Such metadataare generally application-dependent and this can cause difficulties when media needs to beshared across application domains. There is a need for a mechanism that can relate thecommon and uncommon terms and media components. In this paper; we develop analgorithm to mine and automatically discover mappings in hierarchical media data;metadata; and ontologies; using the structural information inherent in these types of data.We evaluate the performance of this algorithm for various parameters using both synthetic …,Knowledge and information systems,2006,12

The media capture andprocessing components; such as media filters and fusion operators; are programmable andadaptable; ie; the delay; size; frequency; and quality/precision characteristics of individualoperators can be controlled via a number of parameters.

Wrex: A scalable middleware architecture to enable xml caching for web-services,Junichi Tatemura; Oliver Po; Arsany Sawires; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Web service caching; ie; caching the responses of XML web service requests; isneeded for designing scalable web service architectures. Such caching of dynamic contentrequires maintaining the caches appropriately to reflect dynamic updates to the back-enddata source. In the database; especially relational; context; extensive research hasaddressed the problem of incremental view maintenance. However; only a few attemptshave been made to address the cache maintenance problem for XML web servicemessages. We propose a middleware solution that bridges the gap between the cachedweb service responses and the backend dynamic data source. We assume; for generality;that the back-end source has a general XML logical data model.

An event-based model for continuous media data on heterogeneous disk servers,K Selçuk Candan; Eenjun Hwang; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract. Over the last few years; there has been intense work on the problem of retrieval ofcontinuous media (CM) data from disk. However; no single unified framework exists withinwhich such retrieval problems can be studied. In this paper; we first propose a formal modelfor CM data retrieval from heterogeneous disk servers. This model can be used tocharacterize CM data retrieval problems independently of how data is laid out on disk; andwhat objectives (eg; minimize client delay; maximize buffer utilization; etc.) the systemmanager is interested in. We then show how using this formal model; we can neatly definewhat it means to optimally handle events that occur in movie-on-demand (MOD) systems.Examples of such events include new clients entering the system; old clients leaving thesystem; continuing clients doing pause; rewind and fast-forward operations.

MUVIR: Multi-View Rare Category Detection.,Dawei Zhou; Jingrui He; K Seluk Candan; Hasan Davulcu,Abstract Rare category detection refers to the problem of identifying the initial examples fromunderrepresented minority classes in an imbalanced data set. This problem becomes morechallenging in many real applications where the data comes from multiple views; and someviews may be irrelevant for distinguishing between majority and minority classes; such assynthetic ID detection and insider threat detection. Existing techniques for rare categorydetection are not best suited for such applications; as they mainly focus on data with a singleview. To address the problem of multi-view rare category detection; in this paper; wepropose a novel framework named MUVIR.

We view an image as a compound object containing many sub-objects. Each sub-object corresponds to image regions that are visually and semanticallymeaningful (eg; car; man; etc.). In this paper; we first present a framework for modelingimages and videos using object-based hierarchical structures. The proposed structuresupports image retrieval at both whole-image and object levels. We show how to extend theobject-based image modeling framework to video retrieval at object; frame; action; andcomposite action levels. The advantages of our approach are as follows:(1) hierarchicalmodel allows translation of video retrieval queries to image retrieval queries with additionaltemporal relationships;(2) concept definitions release users from learning the system and …,Theory and Practice of Object Systems,1999,10
Layered processing of skyline-window-join (SWJ) queries using iteration-fabric,Mithila Nagendra; K Selcuk Candan,The problem of finding interesting tuples in a data set; more commonly known as the skylineproblem; has been extensively studied in scenarios where the data is static. More recently;skyline research has moved towards data streaming environments; where tuplesarrive/expire in a continuous manner. Several algorithms have been developed to trackskyline changes over sliding windows; however; existing methods focus on skyline analysisin which all required skyline attributes belong to a single incoming data stream. Thisconstraint renders current algorithms unsuitable for applications that require a real-time“join” operation to be carried out between multiple incoming data streams; arriving fromdifferent sources; before the skyline query can be answered. Based on this motivation; in thispaper; we address the problem of computing skyline-window-join (SWJ) queries over …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,9
PhC: Multiresolution visualization and exploration of text corpora with parallel hierarchical coordinates,K Selçuk Candan; Luigi Di Caro; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract The high-dimensional nature of the textual data complicates the design ofvisualization tools to support exploration of large document corpora.

The inherent reduction in dimensionality during themapping from multidimensional points to 2D lines; however; may result in visualcomplications. For instance; the lines that correspond to clusters of objects that are separatein the multidimensional space may overlap each other in the 2D space; the resultingincrease in the number of crossings would make it hard to distinguish the individual …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2012,9
On context-aware co-clustering with metadata support,Claudio Schifanella; Maria Luisa Sapino; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract In traditional co-clustering; the only basis for the clustering task is a givenrelationship matrix; describing the strengths of the relationships between pairs of elementsin the different domains. Relying on this single input matrix; co-clustering discoversrelationships holding among groups of elements from the two input domains. In many reallife applications; on the other hand; other background knowledge or metadata about one ormore of the two input domain dimensions may be available and; if leveraged properly; suchmetadata might play a significant role in the effectiveness of the co-clustering process. Howadditional metadata affects co-clustering; however; depends on how the process is modifiedto be context-aware. In this paper; we propose; compare; and evaluate three alternativestrategies (metadata-driven; metadata-constrained; and metadata-injected co-clustering) …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2012,9
RanKloud: a scalable ranked query processing framework on hadoop,K Selçuk Candan; Parth Nagarkar; Mithila Nagendra; Renwei Yu,Abstract The popularity of batch-oriented cluster architectures like Hadoop is on the rise.These batch-based systems successfully achieve high degrees of scalability by carefullyallocating resources and leveraging opportunities to parallelize basic processing tasks.However; they are known to fall short in certain application domains such as large scalemedia analysis. In these applications; the utility of a given data element plays a vital role in aparticular analysis task; and this utility most often depends on the way the data is collectedor interpreted. However; existing batch data processing frameworks do not consider datautility in allocating resources; and hence fail to optimize for ranked/top-k query processing inwhich the user is interested in obtaining a relatively small subset of the best result instances.A naïve implementation of these operations on an existing system would need to …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,9
Organization and tagging of blog and news entries based on content reuse,Jong Wook Kim; K Selçuk Candan; Junichi Tatemura,Abstract As their popularity as dynamic platforms for information dissemination and sharingincreases; the use of Weblogs (blogs) which track and comment on real world (political;news; entertainment) events is also growing. The success of the blog as a popular mediumfor information sharing; on the other hand; is also its weakest spot in that there is littlesupport beyond keyword based searches for blog entries. Consequently; there is impendingneed for navigational support; which can help users relate a large; diverse; and inherentlydistributed collection of blogosphere. In this paper; we first note that the existence of largedegrees of content overlaps in the form of quotation/commentary pairs (as well as contentborrowings across media outlets) can be leveraged for tracking the topic developmentpatterns within the blogosphere. Relying on this observation; we first propose focus and …,Journal of Signal Processing Systems,2010,9
Alphasum: size-constrained table summarization using value lattices,K Selçuk Candan; Huiping Cao; Yan Qi; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Consider a scientist who wants to explore multiple data sets to select the relevantones for further analysis. Since the visualization real estate may put a stringent constraint onhow much detail can be presented to this user in a single page; effective tablesummarization techniques are needed to create summaries that are both sufficiently smalland effective in communicating the available content. In this paper; we first argue that tablesummarization can benefit from knowledge about acceptable value clustering alternativesfor clustering the values in the database. We formulate the problem of table summarizationwith the help of value lattices. We then provide a framework to express alternative clusteringstrategies and to account for various utility measures (such as information loss) in assessingdifferent summarization alternatives. Based on this interpretation; we introduce three …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,9
Data-quality guided load shedding for expensive in-network data processing,Lina Peng; K Selçuk Candan,In situ wireless sensor networks; not only have to route sensed data from sources todestinations; but also have to filter and fuse observations to eliminate potentially irrelevantdata. If data arrive faster to such fusion nodes than the speed with which they can consumethe inputs; this will result in an overflow of input buffers. In this paper; we develop loadshedding mechanisms which take into consideration both data quality and expensive natureof fusion operators. In particular; we present quality assessment models for objects andfusion operators and we highlight that such quality assessments may impose partial orderson objects.,Data Engineering; 2007.

Focusing decomposition accuracy by personalizing tensor decomposition (PTD),Xinsheng Li; Shengyu Huang; Kasim Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Tensor decomposition operation is the basis for many data analysis tasks fromclustering; trend detection; anomaly detection; to correlation analysis. One key problem withtensor decomposition; however; is its computational complexity--especially for dense datasets; the decomposition process takes exponential time in the number of tensor modes; theprocess is relatively faster for sparse tensors; but decomposition is still a major bottleneck inmany applications. While it is possible to reduce the decomposition time by tradingperformance with decomposition accuracy; a drop in accuracy may not always beacceptable. In this paper; we first recognize that in many applications; the user may have afocus of interest--ie; part of the data for which the user needs high accuracy--and beyond thisarea focus; accuracy may not be as critical. Relying on this observation; we propose a …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,8
High-performance composite event monitoring system supporting large numbers of queries and sources,SangJeong Lee; Youngki Lee; Byoungjip Kim; Kasim Selçuk Candan; Yunseok Rhee; Junehwa Song,Abstract This paper presents a novel data structure; called Event-centric ComposableQueue (ECQ); a basic building block of a new scalable composite event monitoring (CEM)framework; SCEMon. In particular; we focus on the scalability issues when large numbers ofCEM queries and event sources exist in upcoming CEM environments. To address thesechallenges effectively; we take an event-centric sharing approach rather than dealing withqueries and sources separately. ECQ is a shared queue; which stores incoming eventinstances of a primitive event class. ECQs are designed to facilitate efficient sharedevaluations of multiple queries over very large volumes of event streams from numerousevent sources. ECQs are composable and form a single shared network within whichmultiple queries are simultaneously evaluated. In this paper; we present efficient shared …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM international conference on Distributed event-based system,2011,8
Reducing metadata complexity for faster table summarization,K Selçuk Candan; Mario Cataldi; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Since the visualization real estate puts stringent constraints on how much data canbe presented to the users at once; table summarization is an essential tool in helping usersquickly explore large data sets. An effective summary needs to minimize the information lossdue to the reduction in details. Summarization algorithms leverage the redundancy in thedata to identify value and tuple clustering strategies that represent the (almost) same amountof information with a smaller number of data representatives. It has been shown that; whenavailable; metadata; such as value hierarchies associated to the attributes of the tables; canhelp greatly reduce the resulting information loss. However; table summarization; whethercarried out through data analysis performed on the table from scratch or supported throughalready available metadata; is an expensive operation.

Extracting Relevant Snippets for Web Navigation.,Qing Li; K Selçuk Candan; Qi Yan,Abstract Search engines present fix-length passages from documents ranked by relevanceagainst the query. In this paper; we present and compare novel; language-model basedmethods for extracting variable length document snippets by real-time processing ofdocuments using the query issued by the user. With this extra level of information; thereturned snippets are considerably more informative. Unlike previous work on passageretrieval which relies on searching relevant segments for filtering of preoccupied passages;we focus on query-informed segmentation to extract context-aware relevant snippets withvariable length. In particular; we show that; when informed through an appropriate relevancelanguage model; curvature analysis and Hidden Markov model (HMM) based contentsegmentation techniques can facilitate to extract relevant document snippets.,AAAI,2008,8

On shortest path problems with “non-Markovian” link contribution to path lengths,Arunabha Sen; K Selçuk Candan; Afonso Ferreira; Bruno Beauquier; Stephane Perennes,Abstract In this paper we introduce a new class of shortest path problems; where thecontribution of a link to the path length computation depends not only on the weight of thatlink but also on the weights of the links already traversed. This class of problems may beviewed as “non-Markovian”. We consider a specific problem that belong to this class; whichis encountered in the multimedia data transmission domain. We consider this problem underdifferent conditions and develop algorithms. The shortest path problem in multimedia datatransmission environment can be solved in O (n 2) or O (n 3) computational time.,International Conference on Research in Networking,2000,8
Integrating content search with structure analysis for hypermedia retrieval and management,Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract: Hypertext and hypermedia have emerged as primary means for structuringdocuments and for accessing the Web. It has two aspects: content and structural information.It is believed that integration of content search with structure analysis can improvehypermedia document retrieval and management; consequently increasing informationutilization. This research topic has emerged as a main focus of many recent conferencesand research communities; including computer-human interface; information retrieval;hypertext; databases; and Web. In this paper; we summarize the state-of-the-art techniquesand functionalities of integrating content search with structure analysis for Web documentsretrieval and management.,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1999,8
Leveraging metadata for identifying local; robust multi-variate temporal (RMT) features,Xiaolan Wang; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Many applications generate and/or consume multi-variate temporal data; yet experts oftenlack the means to adequately and systematically search for and interpret multi-variateobservations. In this paper; we first observe that multi-variate time series often carrylocalized multi-variate temporal features that are robust against noise. We then argue thatthese multi-variate temporal features can be extracted by simultaneously considering; atmultiple scales; temporal characteristics of the time-series along with external knowledge;including variate relationships; known a priori. Relying on these observations; we developalgorithms to detect robust multi-variate temporal (RMT) features which can be indexed forefficient and accurate retrieval and can be used for supporting analysis tasks; such asclassification. Experiments confirm that the proposed RMT algorithm is highly effective …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,7

Freshness-driven adaptive caching for dynamic content,Wen-Syan Li; Oliver Po; Wang-Pin Hsiung; K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,With the wide availability of content delivery networks; many e-commerce Web applicationsutilize edge cache servers to cache and deliver dynamic contents at locations much closer tousers; avoiding network latency. By caching a large number of dynamic content pages in theedge cache servers; response time can be reduced; benefiting from higher cache hit rates.However this is achieved at the expense of higher invalidation cost. On the other hand; ahigher invalidation cost leads to a longer invalidation cycle (time to perform the invalidationcheck on the pages in caches) at the expense of freshness of cached dynamic content. Inthis paper we propose a freshness-driven adaptive dynamic content caching technique;which monitors response time and invalidation cycle length and dynamically adjusts cachingpolicies. We have implemented the proposed technique within NECs CachePortal Web …,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2003.(DASFAA 2003). Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on,2003,7
SEMCOG: an object-based image retrieval system and its visual query interface,Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan; Kyoji Hirata; Yoshinori Hara,Image retrieval is a key issue in many image database applications. Major approachesinclude queries by image examples (cognition-based approach) and query by semantics(semantics-based approach). The semantics-based approach is good at image retrievalbased on image semantics. However; this approach has low visual expressive capability.Since images are visual; it is hard to describe in detail using text alone. The cognition-basedapproach haa an advantage of using visual examples. However; one disadvantage of usingthe cognition-based approach alone is its low precision. This is because users' drawings areusually not precise enough and current image recognition technique still has its limits. Forexample; if a user wants to retrieve images containing a dog and provides a drawing of adog; currently systems of cognition-based approach can only return many images with …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1997,7
Compressed spatial hierarchical bitmap (cSHB) indexes for efficiently processing spatial range query workloads,Parth Nagarkar; K Selçuk Candan; Aneesha Bhat,Abstract In most spatial data management applications; objects are represented in terms oftheir coordinates in a 2-dimensional space and search queries in this space are processedusing spatial index structures. On the other hand; bitmap-based indexing; especially thanksto the compression opportunities bitmaps provide; has been shown to be highly effective forquery processing workloads including selection and aggregation operations. In this paper;we show that bitmap-based indexing can also be highly effective for managing spatial datasets. More specifically; we propose a novel compressed spatial hierarchical bitmap (cSHB)index structure to support spatial range queries. We consider query workloads involvingmultiple range queries over spatial data and introduce and consider the problem of bitmapselection for identifying the appropriate subset of the bitmap files for processing the given …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,6
TensorDB: in-database tensor manipulation with tensor-relational query plans,Mijung Kim; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Today's data management systems increasingly need to support both tensor-algebraic operations (for analysis) as well as relational-algebraic operations (for datamanipulation and integration). Tensor decomposition techniques are commonly used fordiscovering underlying structures of multi-dimensional data sets. However; as the relevantdata sets get large; existing in-memory schemes for tensor decomposition becomeincreasingly ineffective and; instead; memory-independent solutions; such as in-databaseanalytics; are necessitated. We introduce an in-database analytic system for efficientimplementations of in-database tensor decompositions on chunk-based array data stores;so called; TensorDB.

Multiresolution tensor decompositions with mode hierarchies,Claudio Schifanella; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Tensors (multidimensional arrays) are widely used for representing high-orderdimensional data; in applications ranging from social networks; sensor data; and Internettraffic. Multiway data analysis techniques; in particular tensor decompositions; allowextraction of hidden correlations among multiway data and thus are key components ofmany data analysis frameworks. Intuitively; these algorithms can be thought of as multiwayclustering schemes; which consider multiple facets of the data in identifying clusters; theirweights; and contributions of each data element. Unfortunately; algorithms for fittingmultiway models are; in general; iterative and very time consuming. In this article; weobserve that; in many applications; there is a priori background knowledge (or metadata)about one or more domain dimensions. This metadata is often in the form of a hierarchy …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2014,6
Skynets: searching for minimum trees in graphs with incomparable edge weights,Huiping Cao; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Query processing over weighted data graphs often involves searching for aminimum weighted subgraph--a tree--which covers the nodes satisfying the given querycriteria (such as a given set of keywords). Existing works often focus on graphs where theedges have scalar valued weights. In many applications; however; edge weights need to berepresented as ranges (or intervals) of possible values. In this paper; we introduce theproblem of skynets; for searching minimum weighted subgraphs; covering the nodessatisfying given query criteria; over interval-weighted graphs. The key challenge is that;unlike scalars which are often totally ordered; depending on the application specificsemantics of the≤ operator; intervals may be partially ordered. Naturally; the need tomaintain alternative; incomparable solutions can push the computational complexity of …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,6
Object and combination shedding schemes for adaptive media workflow execution,Lina Peng; Renwei Yu; K Selcuk Candan; Xinxin Wang,Complex media fusion operations can be costly in terms of the time they need to processinput objects. If data arrive faster to fusion nodes than the speed with which they canconsume the inputs; this will result in some input objects not being processed. In this paper;we develop load shedding mechanisms which take into consideration both data quality andexpensive nature of media fusion operators. In particular; we present quality assessmentmodels for objects and multistream fusion operators and highlight that such qualityassessments may impose partial orders on objects. We highlight that the most effective loadcontrol approach for fusion operators involves shedding of (not the individual input objectsbut) combinations of objects. Yet; identifying suitable combinations of objects in real time willnot be possible if efficient combination selection algorithms do not exist.

SEA: Segment-enrich-annotate paradigm for adapting dialog-based content for improved accessibility,K Selçuk Candan; Mehmet E Dönderler; Terri Hedgpeth; Jong Wook Kim; Qing Li; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract While navigation within complex information spaces is a problem for all users; theproblem is most evident with individuals who are blind who cannot simply locate; point; andclick on a link in hypertext documents with a mouse. Users who are blind have to listensearching for the link in the document using only the keyboard and a screen readerprogram; which may be particularly inefficient in large documents with many links or deephierarchies that are hard to navigate. Consequently; they are especially penalized when theinformation being searched is hidden under multiple layers of indirections.

Access-Private Outsourcing of Markov Chain and RandomWalk based Data Analysis Applications,Ping Lin; K Selçuk Candan,Random walk graph and Markov chain based models are used heavily in many data andsystem analysis domains; including web; bioinformatics; and queueing. These modelsenable the description and analysis of various behaviors of stochastic systems. If the systembeing modelled has certain properties; such as if it is irreducible and aperiodic; close formformulations corresponding to its stationary behavior can be used to analyze its behavior.However; if the system does not have these properties or if the user is not interested in thestationary behavior; then an iterative approach needs to be used to determine potentialoutcomes based on the initial probability distribution inputs to the model.

Similarity-based retrieval of temporal documents,Prakash Yamuna; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract In this paper; we describe a similarity-based retrieval framework that addresses thechallenges associated with the temporal nature of multimedia documents. Multimediadocuments consist of multiple media objects and a set of specifications (eg. temporal) that tiethese objects together. Therefore; we describe similarity/dissimilarity measures that aim tocapture document authors' intensions. We use a prioritized constraint-based framework toevaluate these measures. We also develop algorithms that efficiently compute thesemeasures for special cases.,Proceedings of the 2000 ACM workshops on Multimedia,2000,6

Efficient processing of skyline-join queries over multiple data sources,Mithila Nagendra; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Efficient processing of skyline queries has been an area of growing interest. Manyof the earlier skyline techniques assumed that the skyline query is applied to a single datatable. Naturally; these algorithms were not suitable for many applications in which theskyline query may involve attributes belonging to multiple data sources. In other words; if thedata used in the skyline query are stored in multiple tables; then join operations would berequired before the skyline can be searched. The task of computing skylines on multipledata sources has been coined as the skyline-join problem and various skyline-joinalgorithms have been proposed. However; the current proposals suffer several drawbacks:they often need to scan the input tables exhaustively in order to obtain the set of skyline-joinresults; moreover; the pruning techniques employed to eliminate the tuples are largely …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,5

HCS: Hierarchical Cut Selection for Efficiently Processing Queries on Data Columns using Hierarchical Bitmap Indices.,Parth Nagarkar; K Selçuk Candan,ABSTRACT When data are large and query processing workloads consist of data selectionand aggregation operations (as in online analytical processing); column-oriented datastores are generally the preferred choice of data organization; because they enable effectivedata compression; leading to significantly reduced IO. Most columnstore architecturesleverage bitmap indices; which themselves can be compressed; for answering queries overdata columns. Columndomains (eg; geographical data; categorical data; biologicaltaxonomies; organizational data) are hierarchical in nature; and it may be moreadvantageous to create hierarchical bitmap indices; that can help answer queries overdifferent sub-ranges of the domain. However; given a query workload; it is critical to choosethe appropriate subset of bitmap indices from the given hierarchy. Thus; in this paper; we …,EDBT,2014,5

Structure-and extension-informed taxonomy alignment,K Selçuk Candan; Mario Cataldi; Maria Luisa Sapino; Claudio Schifanella,Abstract Ontologies and concept taxonomies help software systems organize data moreeffectively for particular application domains. Ontologies also enable sharing and integrationof data from different domains and data sources. However; ontologies from different domainsare rarely identical; thus; there is need for techniques to find alignments between conceptsin different ontologies and taxonomies. In this paper; we first note that alignment algorithmscan be classified into two; structurally-informed and extensionally-informed. We then presenta concept vector based scheme that captures structural information inherent in taxonomiesto facilitate structure-based matching of concepts across taxonomies.

Leveraging structural knowledge for hierarchically-informed keyword weight propagation in the web,Jong Wook Kim; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Although web navigation hierarchies; such as Yahoo. com and Open DirectoryProject; enable effective browsing; their individual nodes cannot be indexed for searchindependently. This is because contents of the individual nodes in a hierarchy are related tothe contents of their neighbors; ancestors; and descendants in the structure. In this paper;we show that significant improvements in precision can be obtained by leveragingknowledge about the structure of hierarchical web content. In particular; we propose a novelkeyword weight propagation technique to properly enrich the data nodes in web hierarchies.Our approach relies on leveraging the context provided by neighbor entries in a givenstructure. We leverage this information for developing relative-content preserving keywordpropagation schemes.

ARIA is a middleware for describing and executingmedia processing workflows to process; filter; and fuse sensory inputs and actuateresponses in real-time. ARIA is designed with the goal of maximum modularity and ease ofintegration of a diverse collection of media processing components and data sources.Moreover; ARIA is cognizant of the fact that various media operators and data structures areadaptable in nature; ie; the delay; size; and quality/precision characteristics of theseoperators can be controlled via various parameters.

Similarity-based retrieval of temporal specifications and its application to the retrieval of multimedia documents,K Selçuk Candan; Prakash Yamuna,Abstract In this paper; we describe a similarity-based retrieval framework for temporalinformation; such as multimedia presentations. We develop techniques that allow users toquery and retrieve multimedia documents; based on their temporal content. For this purpose;we describe different temporal data models and a set of similarity metrics applicable fordifferent retrieval tasks. We develop algorithms that efficiently compute these metrics andreport on experiment results. We also develop algorithms that efficiently index temporalstructures based on these measures and show that the proposed variant of multidimensional scaling is efficient and provides high quality retrieval of temporal specifications.,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2005,5
Adaptive multi-sensor; multi-actuator media workflow system for interactive arts,Lina Peng; K Selçuk Candan,We are presenting the Architecture for Interactive Arts (ARIA) middleware architecture forsensory/reactive environments; such as interactive performances. ARIA processes; filters;and fuses sensory inputs and actuates responses in real-time while providing variousservice guarantees. ARIA is deployed on a centralized stream processor that monitors andqueries over distributed media sensors and outputs of the media workflows are sent toactuators with video and audio presentation capabilities. Due to rapid updates and thecontinuous nature of sensory data streams; approximation and adaptation techniques arenecessary to optimize resource usage. We propose a mechanism that adapts mediaworkflows by adjusting parameters of filters and fusion operators that dynamically control thespeed of data streams and the sampling rate.

Effects of user request patterns on a multimedia delivery system,Christopher B Mayer; K Selçuk Candan; Venkatesh Sangam,Abstract Because of their size; service times; and drain on server resources; multimediaobjects require specialized replication systems in order to meet demand and ensure contentavailability. We present a novel method for creating replication systems where the replicatedobjects' sizes and/or per-object service times are large. Such replication systems are well-suited to delivering multimedia objects on the Internet. Assuming that user request patternsto the system are known; we show how to create replication systems that distribute read loadto servers in proportion to their contribution to system capacity and experimentally show thepositive load distribution properties of such systems. However; when user request patternsdiffer from what the system was designed for; system performance will be affected.Therefore; we also report on results that reveal (i) how server loads are affected and (ii) …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2004,5
Efficient Stream Routing in Quality-and Resource-Adaptive Flow Architectures.,K Selçuk Candan; Lina Peng; Kyung Dong Ryu; Karam S Chatha; Christopher B Mayer,Abstract In this paper; we address challenges faced when optimizing data and objectstreams in the presence of quality and resource adaptable operators on the flow network.We present the qStream 1 flow architecture that processes; filters; and fuses sensory inputsand actuates responses in real-time while providing various Quality of Service (QoS)guarantees. The components of the architecture are programmable and adaptable; ie; thedelay; size; frequency; and quality/precision characteristics of individual operators can becontrolled via a number of parameter values. Therefore; each data object streamed betweencomponents is subject to transformations and quality changes based on these parameters.The quality of an output data object and the corresponding delay and resource usagedepend on the values assigned to parameters of the operators in the object flow path.

Integration of Database and Internet Technologies for Scalable End-to-end E-commerce Systems,K Se1çuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li,ABSTRACT The content of many Web sites changes frequently. Especially in most e-commerce sites; Web content is created on request; based on the current state of businessprocesses represented in application servers and databases. In fact; currently 25% of allWeb content consists of such dynamically generated pages; and this ratio is likely to behigher in ecommerce sites. Web site performance; including system up-time and userresponse time; is a key differentiation point among companies that are eager to reach;attract; and keep customers. Slowdowns can be devastating for these sites; as shown byrecent studies. Therefore; most commercial content-providers pay premium prices forservices; such as content delivery networks (CDNs); that promise high scalability; reducednetwork delays; and lowerrisk of failure. Unfortunately; fore-commerce sites; whose main …,Chapter 6 in Architectural Issues in Web-enabled e-Business; Idea Group Publishing,2002,5
Query Optimization in the Presence of Top-k Predicates.,Lakshmi Priya Mahalingam; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract In this paper; we present novel techniques for performing query optimization indatabases; such as multimedia and web databases; which rely on top-A; predicates. Wepropose an optimization model that (1) takes into account different binding patternsassociated with query predicates and (2) considers the variations in the query result size (orcoverage); depending on the execution order. We address the additional complexity and thewell-known NP-complete nature of the query optimization problem by adoptively reducingthe granularity of the search space. For this purpose; unlike the data histograms whichcapture the data distribution; we propose opt-histograms that capture the distribution of sub-query-plan values over many query optimization tasks.,Multimedia Information Systems,2001,5
Least-cost high-quality object retrieval for distributed multimedia collaborations,K Selcuk Candan; Yifeng Yang,In a collaborative network; retrieval of media objects from corresponding servers introducesmany challenges. A major challenge is the multi-objective route establishment requirement;where various QoS and object quality parameters should be simultaneously optimized. Thistask requires new quality-based routing algorithms. We present optimistic; pessimistic andhybrid algorithms that optimize the media delivery costs while maximizing the quality of thetransmitted objects. We also report on simulation results to show the applicability of thesealgorithms for varying sizes of collaborative networks. These algorithms can be implementedeither as sub-application-layer solutions in an information-centric network or as application-layer information sharing/communication protocols between collaborators.,Multimedia Computing and Systems; 1999.

IFQ: a visual query interface for object-based image retrieval,Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan; Kyoji Hirata; Yoshi Hara,Abstract There are two major directions for image retrieval interface development. Onedirection is manipulation through query languages; which is more precise to computers butnot user friendly since users need to know database schema and query languages. Anotherdisadvantage is that query languages do not visualize queries so that users can match thequery representation with their mental models. Approaches include keyword-basedinterfaces and SQL-like query languages.,CHI'97 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,1997,5
Multimedia authoring systems,Ross Cutler; Kasim Selçuk Candan,Summary In this paper we survey three multimedia authoring systems (Multimedia Toolbook3.0; Director 4.0; and Authorware 3.0). Each system uses a different metaphor (book; movie;and icon-based flowchart) for creating multimedia applications. A sample application isdeveloped in each MAS and the effects of the corresponding metaphors are compared. Wealso discuss current technologies like ODBC; OLE; DDE; DLL; and MCI; and describe howMAS's are benefiting from them. In the last section of the paper; we look at the limitations ofcurrent systems; and discuss the future of the research in this area.,*,1996,5

2PCP: Two-phase CP decomposition for billion-scale dense tensors,Xinsheng Li; Shengyu Huang; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays-consequently; tensor decomposition operations (CPand Tucker) are the bases for many high-dimensional data analysis tasks; from clustering;trend detection; anomaly detection; to correlation analysis in various application domains;including science and engineering1. One key problem with tensor decomposition is itscomputational complexity and space requirements. Especially; as the relevant data sets getdenser; in-memory schemes for tensor decomposition become increasingly ineffective;therefore out-of-core (secondary-memory supported; potentially parallel) computing isnecessitated. However; existing techniques do not consider the I/O and network dataexchange costs that out-of-core execution of the tensor decomposition operation will incur.In this paper; we note that when this operation is implemented with the help of secondary …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,4

Using a smartphone device; we propose a methodbased on the joint usage of GPS and acoustic fingerprints; allowing to greatly improve theprecision of GPS only group detection. To reach the objective; we use a novel variation of anexisting audio fingerprinting algorithm with good noise tolerance; assessing it under severalconditions. The method is shown to be especially effective for groups of listeners of audioand audio visual content.

Gi-nmf: Group incremental non-negative matrix factorization on data streams,Xilun Chen; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a well known method for obtaining lowrank approximations of data sets; which can then be used for efficient indexing;classification; and retrieval. The non-negativity constraints enable probabilistic interpretationof the results and discovery of generative models. One key disadvantage of the NMF;however; is that it is costly to obtain and this makes it difficult to apply NMF in applicationswhere data is dynamic. In this paper; we recognize that many applications involveredundancies and we argue that these redundancies can and should be leveraged forreducing the computational cost of the NMF process: Firstly; online applications involvingdata streams often include temporal redundancies. Secondly; and perhaps less obviously;many applications include integration of multiple data streams (with potential overlaps) …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,4
Pushing-down tensor decompositions over unions to promote reuse of materialized decompositions,Mijung Kim; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract From data collection to decision making; the life cycle of data often involves manysteps of integration; manipulation; and analysis. To be able to provide end-to-end support forthe full data life cycle; today's data management and decision making systems increasinglycombine operations for data manipulation; integration as well as data analysis. Tensor-relational model (TRM) is a framework proposed to support both relational algebraicoperations (for data manipulation and integration) and tensor algebraic operations (for dataanalysis). In this paper; we consider joint processing of relational algebraic and tensoranalysis operations. In particular; we focus on data processing workflows that involve dataintegration from multiple sources (through unions) and tensor decomposition tasks. While; intraditional relational algebra; the costliest operation is known to be the join; in a …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2014,4

The useof personalized PageRank for large graphs; however; is difficult due to its high computationcost. In this paper; we propose a Locality-sensitive; Re-use promoting; approximatepersonalized PageRank (LR-PPR) algorithm for efficiently computing the PPR values relyingon the localities of the given seed nodes on the graph:(a) The LR-PPR algorithm is localitysensitive in the sense that it reduces the computational cost of the PPR computation processby focusing on the local neighborhoods of the seed nodes.(b) LR-PPR is re-use promotingin that instead of performing a monolithic computation for the given seed node set using theentire graph; LR-PPR divides the work into localities of the seeds and caches the …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on information & knowledge management,2013,4
SkySuite: a framework of skyline-join operators for static and stream environments,Mithila Nagendra; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Efficient processing of skyline queries has been an area of growing interest overboth static and stream environments. Most existing static and streaming techniques assumethat the skyline query is applied to a single data source. Unfortunately; this is not true inmany applications in which; due to the complexity of the schema; the skyline query mayinvolve attributes belonging to multiple data sources. Recently; in the context of staticenvironments; various hybrid skyline-join algorithms have been proposed. However; thesealgorithms suffer from several drawbacks: they often need to scan the data sourcesexhaustively in order to obtain the set of skyline-join results; moreover; the pruningtechniques employed to eliminate the tuples are largely based on expensive pairwise tuple-to-tuple comparisons. On the other hand; most existing streaming methods focus on …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,4
Impact neighborhood indexing (INI) in diffusion graphs,Jung Hyun Kim; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract A graph neighborhood consists of a set of nodes that are nearby or otherwiserelated to each other. While existing definitions consider the structure (or topology) of thegraph; we note that they fail to take into account the information propagation and diffusioncharacteristics; such as decay and reinforcement; common in many networks. In this paper;we first define the propagation efficiency of nodes and edges. We use this to introduce thenovel concept of zero-erasure (or impact) neighborhood (ZEN) of a given node; n; consistingof the set of nodes that receive information from (or are impacted by) n without any decay.Based on this; we present an impact neighborhood indexing (INI) algorithm that creates datastructures to help quickly identify impact neighborhood of any given node. Experimentresults confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed INI algorithms.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,4
Narrative-based taxonomy distillation for effective indexing of text collections,Mario Cataldi; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Taxonomies embody formalized knowledge and define aggregations betweenconcepts/categories in a given domain; facilitating the organization of the data and makingthe contents easily accessible to the users. Since taxonomies have significant roles in dataannotation; search and navigation; they are often carefully engineered. However; especiallyin domains; such as news; where content dynamically evolves; they do not necessarilyreflect the content knowledge. Thus; in this paper; we ask and answer; in the positive; thefollowing question:“is it possible to efficiently and effectively adapt a given taxonomy to ausage context defined by a corpus of documents?” In particular; we recognize that theprimary role of a taxonomy is to describe or narrate the natural relationships betweenconcepts in a given document corpus. Therefore; a corpus-aware adaptation of a …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2012,4
Complex pattern ranking (cpr): Evaluating top-k pattern queries over event streams,Xinxin Wang; K Selçuk Candan; Junehwa Song,Abstract Most existing approaches to complex event processing over streaming data rely onthe assumption that the matches to the queries are rare and that the goal of the system is toidentify these few matches within the incoming deluge of data. In many applications; such asuser credit card purchase pattern monitoring; however the matches to the user queries are infact plentiful and the system has to efficiently sift through these many matches to locate onlythe few most preferable matches. In this paper; we propose a complex pattern ranking (CPR)framework for specifying top-k pattern queries over streaming data; present new algorithmsto support top-k pattern queries in data streaming environments; and verify the effectivenessand efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

Relevant shape contour snippet extraction with metadata supported hidden Markov models,Xinxin Wang; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract In most existing works on shape contour matching; the shape contours areconsidered and matched in whole. When searching for contour snippets; however;techniques that match whole contours are not directly applicable. In particular; a relevantsnippet can be anywhere on a shape contour; moreover; the relevance of shape snippet is afunction of not only the shape of the snippet itself; but also of its neighborhood on thecontour. In this paper; we propose an HMM based solution to shape snippet extraction.Relying on a general-purpose symbolic representation (such as SAX); we first convert theshape contour onto a representation suitable for snippet marking and extraction processes.We then show that; given a set of samples; we can train an HMM capable of detectingrelevant snippets in new shape images. Next; we show that the HMM performance can be …,Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval,2010,4

An XML message filtering system needs to (a)process registered filter predicates on multiple distributed real-time streams and (b) matchand validate the filter results with local data to identify the relevant data that can be used forhigher-level processing. Although efficient real-time filtering schemes exists; the matchingphase of the operation where filter results have to be matched against local data to selectthose matches that are relevant to the particular task remains to be expensive as it requiresexpensive join operations. In this paper; we present an efficient middleware (FMware) forfiltering and matching XML messages against locally available data.

Adaptive content delivery to assist blind students in accessing course materials,Mehmet E Donderler; Lina Peng; K Selcuk Candan,Abstract Currently; blind users can access information on the web only with the help of ascreen reader program (such as Window Eyes and JAWS for Windows); which providesoutput in either audio or Braille format. Even though screen reader software is helpful; it isgenerally very difficult; as well as time consuming; to find a link of interest; or a piece ofinformation on a Web page using a screen reader; since the user has to listen to the audiooutput from the screen reader for every link and textual content. Moreover; blind userscannot get an overview of the structure of the information presented in a Web page or a Website at a glance on the screen as sighted people do. Therefore; it is much easier for blindusers to get disoriented in a hypertext environment.

Resource lock commit protocol (RLCP) for multimedia object retrieval,K Selçuk Candan; Eenjun Hwang; B Prabhakaran; VS Subrahmanian,Many multimedia presentation applications involve retrieval of objects from more than onecollaborating server. Presentations of objects from different collaborating servers might beinter-dependent. For instance; we can consider distributed video servers where blocks ofmovies are distributed over a set of servers. Here; blocks of a movie from different videoservers have to be retrieved and presented continuously without any gaps in thepresentation. Such applications first need an estimate of the available network resources toeach of the collaborating server in order to identify a schedule for retrieving the objectscomposing the presentation. A collaborating server can suggest modifications of the retrievalschedule depending on its load. These modifications can potentially affect the retrievalschedule for other collaborating applications.

Decomposition-by-normalization (DBN): leveraging approximate functional dependencies for efficient CP and tucker decompositions,Mijung Kim; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract For many multi-dimensional data applications; tensor operations as well asrelational operations both need to be supported throughout the data lifecycle. Tensor basedrepresentations (including two widely used tensor decompositions; CP and Tuckerdecompositions) are proven to be effective in multi-aspect data analysis and tensordecomposition is an important tool for capturing high-order structures in multi-dimensionaldata. Although tensor decomposition is shown to be effective for multi-dimensional dataanalysis; the cost of tensor decomposition is often very high. Since the number of modes ofthe tensor data is one of the main factors contributing to the costs of the tensor operations; inthis paper; we focus on reducing the modality of the input tensors to tackle the computationalcost of the tensor decomposition process. We propose a novel decomposition-by …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2016,3

Data-Utility Sensitive Query Processing on Server Clusters to Support Scalable Data Analysis Services,Renwei Yu; Mithila Nagendra; Parth Nagarkar; K Selçuk Candan; Jong Wook Kim,Abstract The observation that a significant class of data processing and analysisapplications can be expressed in terms of a small set of primitives that are easy to parallelizehas resulted in increasing popularity of batch-oriented; highly-parallelizable clusterframeworks to support data analysis services. These frameworks; however; are known tohave shortcomings for certain application domains. For example; in many data analysisapplications; the utility of a given data element to the particular analysis task depends on theway the data is collected (eg its precision) or interpreted. However; since existing batchoriented data processing frameworks do not consider variations in data utility; they are notable to focus on the best results. Even if the user is interested in obtaining a relatively smallsubset of the best result instances; these systems often need to enumerate entire result …,*,2011,3

Even though these screen reader software render a given digital textaccessible through audio or Braille; it is generally very difficult and time consuming for auser who is blind to search and effectively use relevant content in a digital collection. Theproblem is compounded when a user needs to drive from multiple books; for example whena student is studying on a particular topic using a digital library environment.

Predictive early object shedding in media processing workflows,Lina Peng; K Selçuk Candan,Media-rich ubiquitous distributed media processing workflow systems continuously senseusers' needs; status; and the context; filter and fuse a multitude of real-time media data; andreact by adapting the environment to the user. One challenge facing these systems is thatthey need to process real-time data arriving continuously from the sensors and data ratesand qualities may vary dramatically. Thus; reducing the amount of unqualified data objectsthat need to be processed within the underlying media processing workflows can enhancethe performance significantly. In this paper; we first focus on the prediction of the outputqualities at the actuator; especially in the presence of fusion operators in the workflow. Wethen present quality-aware early object elimination schemes to enable informed resourcesavings in continuous real-time media processing workflow middleware.,Multimedia and Expo; 2007 IEEE International Conference on,2007,3

Annotating educational discussion boards to help students who are blind,Maria Luisa Sapino; K Selçuk Candan; Jong Wook Kim; Fabrizio Antonelli,Educational discussion boards are growing in use as they help students share knowledgeand doubts in a working/studying environment. Although these interactive tools are highlyeffective in learning environments; their usability by blind students is very poor. In this paperwe develop techniques to improve accessibility of educational content for students who areblind. Threads of messages in discussion boards evolve with new postings; thus just byinvestigating the subject headings or contents of earlier postings in a message thread;students may not be able to guess the contents of the postings deeper in the hierarchy. Inorder to overcome the navigation obstacle for users; it is essential to develop techniques thathelp identify how the content of a discussion board grows. We develop a technique toorganise messages in a message board; by automatically classifying and annotating …,International Journal of Continuing Engineering Education and Life Long Learning,2007,3
Keyword Weight Propagation for Indexing Structured Web Content,Jong Wook Kim; K Selcuk Candan,ABSTRACT When documents are atomically structured; it is possible to assign themkeyword vectors to support indexing. Most web content; however; have non-atomicstructures. These include navigational/semantic hierarchies on the web. Although they areespecially effective for browsing; such structures make it hard for individual nodes to beproperly indexed. This is because; in many cases; their contents have to be inferred from thecontents of their neighbors; ancestors; and descendants in the structure. In this paper; wepropose a novel keyword and keyword weight propagation technique to properly enrich thedata nodes in structured content. In particular; our approach first relies on understanding thecontext provided by the relative content relationships between entries in the structure. Wethen leverage this information for relative-content preserving keyword propagation …,Proc. of WebKDD,2006,3

Multi-criteria query optimization in the presence of result size and quality tradeoffs,Lakshmi Priya Mahalingam; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract In this paper; we present novel multi-criteria query optimization techniques forperforming query optimization in databases; such as multimedia and web databases; whichrely on imperfect access mechanisms and top-k predicates. We present an optimizationmodel that (1) takes into account different binding patterns associated with querypredicates;(2) considers the variations in the expected query result sizes as a function ofquery execution plans; and (3) considers the expected result qualities of the executionorders. We address the complexity and the well-known NP-complete nature of the queryoptimization problem by adaptively reducing the granularity of the search space. For thispurpose; unlike the data histograms which capture the data distribution; we propose opt-histograms that capture the distribution of sub-query-plan values over many optimization …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2004,3
Server replication in interactive; push-based data delivery networks,Nikhil Iyer; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract—In a push-based system; updates that are made to objects are sent to clients;without them explicitly requesting these updates. The focus of this research is to develop aserver replication protocol for such interactive; push-based networks. When a server getsoverwhelmed and is serving more clients than it can handle; a replica is created. After thereplication; a portion of the clients connected to the overwhelmed server are redirected tothe new replica. The decisions (a)“at which particular server the replica is created” and(b)“which clients are redirected” can greatly influence the performance observed by theclients; the level of the service provided by the server; and the overall level of satisfactionwith the functioning of the servers. In this paper; we identify a number of parameters thatinfluence the selection of a new server and we develop an efficient and effective protocol …,Multimedia Information Systems,2004,3
Data and application security for distributed application hosting services,Ping Lin; K Selçuk Candan,ABSTRACT The cost of creating and maintaining software and hard-ware infrastructures fordelivering web services led to a notable trend toward the use of application serviceproviders (ASPs) and; more generally; distributed application hosting services (DAHSs). Theemergence of enabling technologies; such as J2EE and .NET; has contributed to theacceleration of this trend. DAHSs rent out Internet presence; computation power; and datastorage space to clients with infrastructural needs. Consequently; they are cheap andeffective outsourcing solutions for achieving increased service availability and scalability inthe face of surges in demand. However; ASPs and DAHSs operate within the complex; multi-tiered; and open Internet environment and; hence; they introduce many security challengesthat have to be addressed effectively to convince customers that outsourcing their IT …,Information Security Policies and Actions in Modern Integrated Systems,2004,3
Multi-tiered cache management for e-commerce Web sites,Wang-Pin Hsiung; Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Response time is a key differentiation point among electronic commerce (e-commerce) applications. For many e-commerce applications; Web pages are createddynamically based on the current state of a business stored in database systems. Toimprove the response time; many e-commerce Web sites deploy caching solutions foracceleration of content delivery. There are multiple tiers in the content delivery infrastructurewhere cache servers can be deployed; including (1) data caching (in data centers);(2)content page caching (in edge or frontend caches);(3) database query result set caching(between application servers and DBMS). The architecture of database-driven e-commerceWeb sites is more complex than that of typical Web sites. It requires the integration of Webservers; application servers; and back-end database systems as well as dynamic content …,*,2003,3
“Can you really trust that seed?”: Reducing the impact of seed noise in personalized PageRank,Shengyu Huang; Xinsheng Li; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Network based recommendation systems leverage the topology of the underlying graph andthe current user context to rank objects in the database. Random-walk based techniques;such as PageRank; encode the structure of the graph in the form of a transition matrix of astochastic process from which the significances of the nodes in the graph are inferred.Personalized PageRank (PPR) techniques complement this with a seed node set whichserves as the personalization context. In this paper; we note (and experimentally show) thatPPR algorithms that do not differentiate among the seed nodes may not properly rank nodesin situations where the seed set is incomplete and/or noisy. To tackle this problem; wepropose alternative robust personalized PageRank (RPR) strategies; which are insensitiveto noise in the set of seed nodes and in which the rankings are not overly biased towards …,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on,2014,2
RanKloud: Scalable multimedia and social media retrieval and analysis in the cloud,K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Today; multimedia data are produced in massive quantities; thanks to a diversespectrum of applications including entertainment; surveillance; e-commerce; web; and socialmedia. In particular; social media data have three challenging characteristics: data sizes areenormous; data are often multi-faceted; and data are dynamic. Tensors (multi-dimensionalarrays) are widely used for representing such high-order dimensional data. Consequently; asystem dealing with social media data needs to scale with the tensor volume and thenumber and diversity of the data facets. This necessitates highly parallelizable; and in manycases cloud-based; frameworks for scalable processing and efficient analysis of large mediaand social media collections.

Workload-balanced processing of top-K join queries on cluster architectures,Renwei Yu; Mithila Nagendra; Parth Nagarkar; K Selçuk Candan; Jong Wook Kim,Abstract—The observation that a significant class of data processing and analysisapplications can be expressed in terms of a small set of primitives that are easy to parallelizehas resulted in increasing popularity of batch-oriented; highly-parallelizable clusterframeworks. These frameworks; however; are known to have shortcomings for certainapplication domains. For example; in many data analysis applications; the utility of a givendata element to the particular analysis task depends on the way the data is collected (eg itsprecision) or interpreted. However; since existing batch data processing frameworks do notconsider variations in data utility; they are not able to focus on the best results. Even if theuser is interested in obtaining a relatively small subset of the best result instances; thesesystems often need to enumerate entire result sets; even if these sets contain lowutility …,tech. report ASUCIDSE-CSE-2010–001,2010,2
Exploring path query results through relevance feedback,Huiping Cao; Yan Qi; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Feedback driven data exploration schemes have been implemented for non-structured data (such as text) and document-centric XML collections where formulatingprecise queries is often impossible. In this paper; we study the problem of enablingexploratory access; through ranking; to data-centric XML. Given a path query and a set ofresults identified by the system to this query over the data; we consider feedback whichcaptures the user's preference for some features over the others. The feedback can be"positive" or" negative". To deal with feedback; we develop a probabilistic feature significancemeasure and describe how to use this for ranking results in the presence of dependenciesbetween the path features. We bring together these techniques in AXP; a system foradaptive and exploratory path retrieval.

Topic development pattern analysis-based adaptation of information spaces,Syed Toufeeq Ahmed; K Selçuk Candan; Sangwoo Han; Yan Qi,While navigation within complex information spaces is a challenge for all users; the problemis most evident with individuals who are blind or visually impaired. A particular challengefaced by students who are blind when accessing documents in digital libraries is that longdocuments are almost impenetrable for these users who cannot skim through largedocuments effectively and who cannot visually organize and re-organize documents for lateruse in new contexts. We highlight that adaptation and personalization of textual media canbe possible only through novel algorithms that can segment media content to its basicinformation units and enable users to pick; recombine; and re-organize these units into newpersonalized documents. This is a multi-faceted problem that requires research intotechnical challenges from user modeling to context analysis. In this paper; we focus on …,New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia,2009,2
AURA: Enabling attribute-based spatial search in RFID rich environments,Tejas A Bapat; K Selçuk Candan; V Snehith Cherukuri; Hari Sundaram,In this paper; we introduce AURA; a novel framework for enriching the physical environmentwith information about objects and activities in order to support searches in the physicalworld. The goal is to enable individuals to use the environment in which they function as aliving (short-term) memory of their activities and of the objects with which they interact in thisenvironment. In order to act as a memory; the physical environment must be transparentlyembedded with relevant information and made accessible by in-situ search mechanisms.We achieve this embedding through innovative algorithms that leverage a collection ofparasitic RFID tags distributed in the environment to act as a distributed storage cloud.Information about the activities of the users and objects with which they interact are encodedand stored; in a decentralized way; on these RFID tags to support attribute-based search …,Data Engineering; 2009.

Enabling access-privacy for random walk based data analysis applications,Ping Lin; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Random walk graph and Markov chain based models are used heavily in manydata and system analysis domains; including web; bioinformatics; and queuing. Thesemodels enable the description and analysis of various behaviors of stochastic systems. If thesystem being modeled has certain properties; such as if it is irreducible and aperiodic; closeform formulations corresponding to its stationary behavior can be used to analyze itsbehavior. However; if the system does not have these properties or if the user is notinterested in the stationary behavior; then an iterative approach needs to be used todetermine potential outcomes based on the initial probability distribution inputs to the model.In this paper; we focus on access-privacy enabled outsourced Markov chain based dataanalysis applications; where a non-trusted service provider takes (hidden) user queries …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,2
Improving user response times in application delivery networks through reduction of network and server latencies,K SELÇUK CANDAN; Wen-Syan Li; Divyakant Agrawal,An application delivery network (ADN) consists of a set of servers distributed over a largewide area network. In general; ADNs employ two approaches to improve performance interms of response time:(1) use topological proximity on the network to redirect clients to aclosest server; and (2) balance the load of the servers in the original source or the contentdelivery network using a load balancing algorithm. These two approaches aim to minimizethe two major parameters; network latency and server latency; respectively. To acceleratedelivery of static content; network latency is the major parameter to minimize. However; toaccelerate delivery of dynamically generated content; both parameters are important and asolution requires to achieve a balance between these two approaches.

Clustering and indexing of experience sequences for popularity-driven recommendations,K Selçuk Candan; Mehmet E Dönderler; J Ramamoorthy; Jong W Kim,Abstract As part of our iCare efforts; we are developing mechanisms that provide guidanceto individuals who are blind in diverse contexts. A fundamental challenge in this context is torepresent and index experiences that can be used to provide recommendations. In thispaper; we address the challenge of indexing experiences in order to retrieve them based ontheir popularities. In particular; we model experiences as sequences of propositionalstatements from a particular domain (daily life; web browsing; etc.). We then show thatknowledge about domain constraints (such as commutativity between possible statements)need to be used for clustering and indexing experiences for popularity-search. We alsohighlight that don't cares (propositional statements not relevant to the user's query) make thetask of popularity indexing challenging. Thus; we develop a canonical-sequence based …,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM workshop on Continuous archival and retrival of personal experences,2006,2
Fairly redistributing failed server load in a distributed system,Venkatesh Sangam; Christopher B Mayer; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract We recently proposed a novel method for large-object replication and loadbalancing. Our method is particularly well-suited to data grids; data warehousing providers;and hosting of dynamic web sites. The method attempts to distribute object request loadfairly to servers according to server capacity so that the likelihood of them overloading; andhence failing; is reduced. Unfortunately; server failures cannot be eliminated entirely. Whena server fails; the load carried by that server must be absorbed by the rest of the system.Unless this load is distributed fairly across the remaining servers; they may also overload;creating a cascade of failures and reduced quality of service. In this paper; we propose anefficient method for fairly redistributing the load of a failed server or set of failed serverswithin our replication system.

We introduce the notion of similarity and the need for the same as wellas discuss the properties of the similarity measure we propose. We discuss the developmentof similarity metrics to compare the temporal structures of multimedia documents. We alsodevelop algorithms that efficiently index temporal structures based on these measures.

Robust Multi-Variate Temporal Features of Multi-Variate Time Series,Sicong Liu; Silvestro Roberto Poccia; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino; Xiaolan Wang,6 7 8 9 10 11 Many applications generate and/or consume multi-variate temporal data andexperts often lack the means to adequately and systematically search for and interpret multi-variate observations. In this paper; we first observe that multi-variate time series often carrylocalized multi-variate temporal features that are robust against noise. We then argue thatthese multi-variate temporal features can be extracted by simultaneously considering; atmultiple scales; temporal characteristics of the time-series along with external knowledge;including variate relationships that are known a priori. Relying on these observations; wedevelop data models and algorithms to detect robust multi-variate temporal (RMT) featuresthat can be indexed for effcient and accurate retrieval and can be used for supporting dataexploration and analysis tasks.

Personalized pagerank in uncertain graphs with mutually exclusive edges,Jung Hyun Kim; Mao-Lin Li; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Measures of node ranking; such as personalized PageRank; are utilized in manyweb and social-network based prediction and recommendation applications. Despite theireffectiveness when the underlying graph is certain; however; these measures becomedifficult to apply in the presence of uncertainties; as they are not designed for graphs thatinclude uncertain information; such as edges that mutually exclude each other. While thereare several ways to naively extend existing techniques (such as trying to encodeuncertainties as edge weights or computing all possible scenarios); as we discuss in thispaper; these either lead to large degrees of errors or are very expensive to compute; as thenumber of possible worlds can grow exponentially with the amount of uncertainty.

Recommendation systems leverage such node significancemeasures to rank the objects in the database. Context-aware recommendation techniquescomplement the data graph with additional data that provide the recommendation context.However; despite their wide-spread use in many graph-based knowledge discovery andrecommendation applications; conventional PageRank-based measures have variousshortcomings.

Unfortunately; the problem of maximum common subgraph isomorphismbetween two graphs is a well known NP-hard problem; rendering it impractical to search forexact graph alignments. While there are several heuristics; most of these analyze andencode global and local structural information for every node of the graph and then rankpairs of nodes across the two graphs based on their structural similarities. Moreover; manyalgorithms involve a post-processing (or refinement) step which aims to improve the initialmatching accuracy.

STFMap: query-and feature-driven visualization of large time series data sets,K Selçuk Candan; Rosaria Rossini; Maria Luisa Sapino; Xiaolan Wang,Abstract Since many applications rely on time-based data; visualizing temporal data andhelping experts explore large time series data sets are critical in many application domains.In this interactive system preview; we argue that time series often carry structural featuresthat can; if efficiently identified and effectively visualized; help reduce visual overload andhelp the user quickly focus on the relevant portions of the data sets. Relying on thisobservation; we introduce a novel STFMap system; which includes four innovative query-and feature-driven time series data set visualization techniques:(a) segment-maps;(b) warp-maps;(c) stretch-maps; and (d) feature-maps. These rely on the salient temporal features ofthe time series and their alignments with respect to the given user query to help usersexplore the data set in a query-driven fashion.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,1

Instead; pDView maps data along all itsrelevant dimensions onto a pDTree structure; capturing and visualizing the underlyingfundamental relationships.

Context-informed Knowledge Extraction from Document Collections to Support User Navigation.,Mario Cataldi; Claudio Schifanella; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino; Luigi Di Caro,ABSTRACT: Most of the existing document and web search engines rely on keyword-basedqueries. To find matches; these queries are processed using retrieval algorithms that rely onword frequencies; topic recentness; document authority; and (in some cases) availableontologies. In this paper; we propose an innovative approach to exploring text collectionsusing a novel keywords-by-concepts (KbC) graph; which supports navigation using domain-specific concepts as well as keywords that are characterizing the text corpus.

GPEB: Power-Efficient geographic broadcasting in sensor networks,Shibo Wu; K Selcuk Candan,Nodes in a sensor network; operating on power limited batteries; must save power tominimize the need for battery replacement. In this paper; we study the power efficiencyissues related to geographic broadcast protocols in wireless sensor networks. Specifically;we study the problems in existing flooding based and pruning based broadcast algorithmand propose a new Geographic Power Efficient Broadcast algorithm to reduce the overlapsof broadcast coverage area and thus the total power consumption. The proposed algorithmis a hybrid protocol that combines broadcasts of maximum transmission radio range andforwards of much smaller transmission radio range. Through simulation; we show that theGPEB protocol proposed in this paper can save total power consumption up to 23%compared to existing geographic broadcast protocols.,Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems; 2008.

Multimedia information systems,Maria Luisa Sapino; K Selcuk Candan,3D meshes have been widely used in multimedia applications such as 3D video gaming;virtual reality and animation databases. Due to the large data size of 3D meshes; the enduser typically experiences long delay waiting for a 3D model to download from networks. Forexample; it requires 168 s to download 42 MB ''Happy Buddha''model (Large geometricmodels archive at Georgia Institute of Technology) over a channel offering an averagebandwidth of 2 Mbps. To alleviate this limitation; it is desirable to compress 3D meshes first;and then transmit the compressed data over networks. Single-resolution techniques [1–4]are not suitable for the network transmission since the global view of the model cannot berendered until the entire model is downloaded. Progressive compression techniques [5–10]address this issue by sending a base mesh first; and following it with a sequence of …,*,2008,1
Virtual active network for live streaming media delivery,Wen-Syan Li; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan; Yusuf Akca; Murat Kantarcioglu,The large amount of bandwidth and other resources required to deliver streaming medialimits the number of concurrent users. We propose a virtual active network (VAN)architecture for streaming media data delivery over wide area networks.

Policy-Based Resource Sharing in Streaming Overlay Networks,K Selçuk Candan; Yusuf Akca; Wen-Syan Lit,Abstract In this chapter; we discuss peer-to-peer media streaming overlay networkarchitectures and introduce a policy-based architecture for streaming live media from mediasources to end-users over independently owned and operated networks. This architecture(mSON) efficiently supports multiple simultaneous media streams; with different sources anduser populations; through shared overlay resources. The overlay network infrastructuretakes into account the existence of multiple content providers (media sources) andminimizes its footprint to use available resources most effectively. In the meanwhile; itprevents resources from being overutilized to prevent congestions; service rejections; andjitters in the streams users receive. We report experimental results that show that the policy-based mSON achieves these tasks efficiently and effectively.,*,2005,1
Multitiered cache management and acceleration for database-driven websites,Wen-Syan Li; Wang-Pin Hsiung; K Selcuk Candan,Response time is a key differentiation point among electronic commerce (e-commerce)applications. For many e-commerce applications; web pages are created dynamically basedon the current state of a business stored in database systems. To improve the response time;many e-commerce websites deploy caching solutions for acceleration of content delivery.There are multiple tiers in the content delivery infrastructure where cache servers can bedeployed; including (1) data caching (in data centers);(2) content page caching (in edge orfront end caches); and (3) database query result set caching (between application serversand DBMS). The architecture of database-driven e-commerce websites is more complexthan that of typical websites. It requires the integration of web servers; application servers;and back end database systems as well as dynamic content caching solutions. In this …,Concurrent Engineering,2004,1
Hiding data and code security for application hosting infrastructure,Ping Lin; K Selçuk Candan; Rida Bazzi; Zhichao Liu,Abstract In mobile computing environments; where clients have limited computing powerand memory; it is common for mobile clients to use a fixed host server to execute theirapplications. Application hosting services; which rent out storage;(Internet) presence; andcomputation power to clients with IT needs (but without appropriate infrastructures) havebeen widely adopted. A common way these hosting services are used is as follows:(1) Thecustomer (or application owner) A with an application P publishes this application along withthe relevant data onto the servers of the host; H.(2) Whenever they need; the customer (orapplication owner) A or its clients access the application remotely by passing appropriateparameter variables v to the host.(3) The host; then; runs P (v) with the local data; and sendsthe result back to the requesting party.(4) The host charges the customer (or application …,International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics,2003,1
Acceleration of data center-hosted distributed database-driven Web applications,Wen-Syan Li; Oliver Po; Wang-Pin Hsiung; K Selcuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Response time is essential to many Web applications. Consequently; manydatabase-driven Web applications rely on data centers that host applications and databasecontents. Such IT infrastructure enables generation of requested pages at locations muchcloser to the end-users; thus reducing network latency. However; it incurs additionalcomplexity associated with database/data center synchronization and data freshness. In thispaper; we describe the deployment of NEC's CachePortal dynamic content cachingtechnology on a database-driven Web site in a data center-based distribution infrastructure.The new system architecture has been experimentally evaluated and the results show thatthe deployment of NEC's CachePortal accelerates the dynamic content delivery up to 7times while attaining a high level of content freshness.,*,2003,1

That; in turn; requires a means of combining datasets thatemploy different systematics in their recording while at the same time preserving thesemantics of the data. To that end; we have developed a general procedure that we callquery-driven; on-the-fly data integration that is deployed within the Digital ArchaeologicalRecord digital repository. The integration procedure employs ontologies that are mapped tothe original datasets. Integration of the ontology-based dataset representations is done atthe time the query is executed; based on the specific content of the query. In this way; theoriginal data are preserved; and data are aggregated only to the extent necessary to …,Advances in Archaeological Practice,2018,*

nTD: Noise-Profile Adaptive Tensor Decomposition,Xinsheng Li; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Tensor decomposition is used for many web and user data analysis operations fromclustering; trend detection; anomaly detection; to correlation analysis. However; many of thetensor decomposition schemes are sensitive to noisy data; an inevitable problem in the realworld that can lead to false conclusions. The problem is compounded by over-fitting whenthe user data is sparse. Recent research has shown that it is possible to avoid over-fitting byrelying on probabilistic techniques. However; these have two major deficiencies:(a) firstly;they assume that all the data and intermediary results can fit in the main memory; and (b)they treat the entire tensor uniformly; ignoring potential non-uniformities in the noisedistribution. In this paper; we propose a Noise-Profile Adaptive Tensor Decomposition (nTD)method; which aims to tackle both of these challenges. In particular; nTD leverages a grid …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,*
Context-Aware Proactive Personalization of Linear Audio Content,Casagranda Paolo; Maria Luisa Sapino; Selcuk K Candan,How many times did you wish the radio programming was more aligned with your interestsor current situation? How many times did you feel the need to change the channel becauseof a non-interesting content on your favorite station? Did you ever feel distracted by theaudio programming in your car at a busy intersection? We present a platform for proactivepersonalization of linear audio content within a hybrid content radio framework. Hybridcontent radio programming aims at enhancing the traditional broadcast radio experienceand augmenting it with audio content related to the listener's context. It allows enrichment ofthe broadcaster's program schedule with context-aware; personalized audio content; withthe goal of improving the users' listening experience; decreasing their propensity to channel-surf; and giving them more targeted content; such as local news; entertainment; music …,EDBT: 20th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2017,*
Reducing seed noise in personalized PageRank,Shengyu Huang; Xinsheng Li; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract Network-based recommendation systems leverage the topology of the underlyinggraph and the current user context to rank objects in the database. Random walk-basedtechniques; such as PageRank; encode the structure of the graph in the form of a transitionmatrix of a stochastic process from which the significances of the nodes in the graph areinferred. Personalized PageRank (PPR) techniques complement this with a seed node setwhich serves as the personalization context. In this paper; we note (and experimentallyshow) that PPR algorithms that do not differentiate among the seed nodes may not properlyrank nodes in situations where the seed set is incomplete and/or noisy. To tackle thisproblem; we propose alternative robust personalized PageRank (RPR) strategies; which areinsensitive to noise in the set of seed nodes and in which the rankings are not overly …,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2016,*

Focusing Decomposition Accuracy by Personalizing Tensor Decomposition (PTD),Li Xinsheng; Huang Shengyu; Kasim Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Tensor decomposition operation is the basis for many data analysis tasks from clustering;trend detection; anomaly detection; to correlation analysis. One key problem with tensordecomposition; however; is its computational complexity--especially for dense data sets; thedecomposition process takes exponential time in the number of tensor modes; the process isrelatively faster for sparse tensors; but decomposition is still a major bottleneck in manyapplications. While it is possible to reduce the decomposition time by trading performancewith decomposition accuracy; a drop in accuracy may not always be acceptable. In thispaper; we first recognize that in many applications; the user may have a focus of interest--ie;part of the data for which the user needs high accuracy--and beyond this area focus;accuracy may not be as critical.

XML Data Integration: Merging; Query Processing and Conflict Resolution,Yan Qi; Huiping Cao; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract In XML Data Integration; data/metadata merging and query processing areindispensable. Specifically; merging integrates multiple disparate (heterogeneous andautonomous) input data sources together for further usage; while query processing is onemain reason why the data need to be integrated in the first place. Besides; when supportedwith appropriate user feedback techniques; queries can also provide contexts in whichconflicts among the input sources can be interpreted and resolved. The flexibility of XMLstructure provides opportunities for alleviating some of the difficulties that other less flexibledata types face in the presence of uncertainty; yet; this flexibility also introduces newchallenges in merging multiple sources and query processing over integrated data. In thischapter; the authors discuss two alternative ways XML data/schema can be integrated …,*,2010,*

PICC Counting: Who Needs Joins when you Can Propagate Efficiently?,Jong Wook Kim; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Counting is a common task in many data mining applications; including marketbasket data analysis; scientific inquiry; and other high dimensional data managementapplications. Given a single table; obtaining the instance counts of the entries in the table isrelatively cheap. In situations where the attributes of interest are distributed across differenttables; however; the problem of computing instance counts can be very expensive. Thenaive solution; joining all the relevant relations to obtain a single table suitable for counting;is rarely practical. In this paper; we propose PICC (P ropagation-based I nstance C ounts onC oncise Graphs); a novel counting technique for discovering instance counts in databases.We first propose a propagation-based instance counting scheme which avoids joins toobtain a single table.

Large-Scale ASP Replication of Database-Driven Portals,Christopher B Mayer; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Web portal applications that dynamically generate results in response to userrequests are more popular than ever. Such portal applications usually consist of a businesslogic component and a very large database; or databases that hold the portal's content.Despite efforts to speed up response generation; ever-rising user demand means thatreplication of a portal's logic and database will be needed at some point as other methods tokeep up with demand (faster databases and content caching for example) have limits.,*,2007,*
Replicating multi-quality web applications using ACO and bipartite graphs,Christopher B Mayer; Judson Dressler; Felicia Harlow; Gregory Brault; K Selcuk Candan,Abstract This paper presents the application of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) meta-heuristic to a new NP-hard problem involving the replication of multi-quality database-drivenweb applications (DA s) by a large application service provider (ASP). The ASP must assignDA replicas to its network of heterogeneous servers so that user demand is satisfied at thedesired quality level and replica update loads are minimized. Our ACO algorithm; AntDA; forsolving the ASP's replication problem has several novel or infrequently seen features: antstraverse a bipartite graph in both directions as they construct solutions; pheromone is usedfor traversing from one side of the bipartite graph to the other and back again; heuristic edgevalues change as ants construct solutions; and ants may sometimes produce infeasiblesolutions.

DHT overlay schemes for scalable p-range resource discovery,Liping Chen; K Selçuk Candan; Junichi Tatemura; Divyakant Agrawal; Dirceu Cavendish,The information service is a critical component of a grid infrastructure for resource discovery.Although P2P computing paradigm could address some of the scalability issues thatplagued grid resource discovery; most existing distributed hash table (DHT) based P2Poverlays have difficulty in treating attribute range queries that are common in resourcediscovery lookups due to the inherent randomness of hash functions. Recently; there havebeen various attempts to solve the range search problem over DHT networks [Aberer; etal.(2003); Gao and Steenkiste (2004); Ratnasamy; et al.(2003); and Tanin; et al.(2005)].Central to all of these is a mapping scheme which maps the tree-structured logical indexspace to some DHT-based physical node space.

Acceleration and Monitoring of Data Center-hosted Distributed Database-driven Web Applications,Wen-Syan Li; K Selcuk Candan; Wei-Kuang Huang,For many e-commerce applications; web pages are created dynamically based on thecurrent state of a business; such as product prices and inventory; stored in databasesystems. This characteristic requires e-commerce websites to deploy and integrate webservers; application servers; and database systems at the backend. Response time isessential to many e-commerce applications. With increasing availability and advancement ofcontent delivery networks (CDN); many database-driven web applications rely on datacenters that host applications and database contents. Such IT infrastructure enables thegeneration of requested pages at locations much closer to the end-users; thus reducingnetwork latency. However; it incurs additional complexity associated with database-datacenter synchronization and data freshness. In this paper; the deployment of NEC's …,Concurrent Engineering,2004,*

An algebra and calculus for multidatabases with integrity constraints,Kasim S Candan; VS Subrahmanian,Litwin et. al. have developed a language called MSQL for query multidatabases.Subsequently; Grant; Litwin; Roussopolous and Sellis have developed a calculus andalgebra associated with MSQL that facilitates querying and interoperation in a multidatabaseenvironment. In this paper; we build upon their framework by assuming that a set of integrityconstraints must be satisfied. Even though each individual database in a multidatabase maysatisfy the integrity constraints; the entire multidatabase itself may not satisfy the constraints.We propose three new data retrieval notions based on whether the constraint semanticsis``naive'';``skeptical''or makes``choices.''We propose a semantics for these operations; anddevelop an algebra and calculus based on these operators. We prove that the algebra canbe embedded within the calculus--however; the calculus is strictly more powerful than the …,*,1998,*
Multilayered storage and transmission for animated 3D polygonal meshes,K Selcuk Candan; Michael G Wagner,Highly detailed geometric models are rapidly becoming common-place in computergraphics and multimedia. MPEG4 is introducing standards for 3D polygon meshes.Analogously to video; highly complex polygon meshes challenge not only renderingperformance but also transmission bandwidth and storage capacities. Current work focusesonly on the compression; and progressive refinement and transmission of static polygonmeshes. On the other hand; geometric content is no longer static; it allows user interactionand complex changes within the geometry. Since this emerging problem has to beaddressed in any future multimedia standard this paper aims to open the research byexploring similarities and differences in transmission and storage of dynamically changingpolygon meshes and geometry compared to other stream data; such as video.

CHIMP: A Framework for Multimedia Documents,K Selcuk Candan; B Prabhakaran; VS Subrahmanian,A multimedia document consists of different types of media objects that are to be presentedat different instants of time and for different durations. The media objects may be stored incomputer systems connected by a network; thereby rendering the document distributed. Theauthors may wish to collaborate in a distributed manner to edit a multimedia document.Hence; an authoring system needs to identify a retrieval schedule that describes the timeinstants at which the objects have to be retrieved as well as the logical paths to be followedby the objects. In this paper; we consider a collaborative multimetia document authoringsystem with the above mentioned features. We propose a difference constraints basedtemporal specification for the multimedia document. This approach allows us to generateflexible schedules for retrieving objects over the computer network.

Secure Mediated Databases,Candan Sushil Jajodia; KS Candan; Sushil Jajodia; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract With the evolution of the information superhighway; there is now an immenseamount of information available in a wide variety of databases. Furthermore; users oftenhave the ability to access legacy software packages developed by external sources.However; sometimes both the information provided by a data source; as well as one or moreof the functions available through a software package may be sensitive--in such cases;organizations require that access by users be controlled. HERMES (" HEterogeneousReasoning and MEdiator System") is a platform that has been developed at the University ofMaryland within which mediators may be designed and implemented. HERMES has alreadybeen used for a number of applications [7; 3]. In this paper; we will provide a formal model ofsecurity in mediated systems.

Seed Noise in Personalized PageRank,Shengyu Huang; Xinsheng Li; K Selçuk Candan; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract—Random-walk based techniques; such as PageRank; encode the structure of thegraph in the form of a transition matrix of a stochastic process from which the significances ofthe nodes in the graph can be inferred. Personalized PageRank (PPR) techniquescomplement this with a seed node set which serves as the personalization context. In thispaper; we note (and experimentally show) that PPR algorithms that do not differentiateamong the seed nodes may not properly rank nodes in situations where the seed set isincomplete and/or noisy. Unfortunately; this situation is very common in many realworldapplications of PPR; where users often have incomplete views of the overall data. To tacklethis problem; we propose alternative robust personalized PageRank (RPR) strategies; whichare insensitive to noise in the set of seed nodes and in which the rankings are not overly …,*,*,*

Web Site Summarization using Document Associations,K Selçuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li,ABSTRACT Hypermedia has emerged as a primary means for storing and structuringinformation. Yet; due to the continuously increasing size of these infrastructures; it is gettingever difficult for users to understand and navigate through such sites. We see that in order toovercome this obstacle; it is essential to use techniques that recover the Web authors'intentions and superimpose it with the users' retrieval contexts in summarizing Web sites.Therefore; in this paper; we present a framework which uses implicit associations amongWeb documents which considers three factors:(1) document separation (by the number;type; and content of the likes);(2) connectivity; and (3) document content.,*,*,*
RCdex: An Index Structure for Tree Matching in the Presence of Commutations,K Selçuk Candan; Jaikannan Ramamoorthy; Mehmet E Dönderler,ABSTRACT Tree-structured data models and formats are increasingly being used in manyapplications to represent and store data objects. Since the structural information inherent insuch data cannot be captured in conventional index structures; quick retrieval of tree-structured data necessitates special indexing techniques. A variety of algorithms; such asViST and Data Guides; have been proposed to answer tree queries efficiently. Nonetheless;a class of tree-structured data; which are insensitive to certain commutations between theelements; cannot be indexed using the existing techniques. In this paper; we propose anindex structure (RCdex) to efficiently answer wildcard (“⋆”) queries in the presence ofcommutations. We experimentally show that this approach provides large savings in queryexecution time when commutations between the nodes of the tree are allowed.,*,*,*

Constraints; Parameters; and Replication Strategies for Supporting Web Content Delivery,Chris Mayer; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract A new class of network related services has become widely used in improvingperformance; response-time; and scalability of Web-based applications. The basic premiseof these services is that by replicating the content; user requests may be served from aserver that is in the network proximity of the user instead of routing it all the way to the originserver. Replication; however; comes with update overhead. Although this overhead may beacceptable if the replicated objects are small; when they are large; as in multimedia objects;the cost of the network resources required for reflecting the update onto all replica serversmay be prohibitively large. Secondly; in such systems server failure is a function of the readload and the traditional assumption of failure independence does not hold. Furthermore;there usually is a difference between read and write failures. In this paper; we propose a …,*,*,*

FICSR: Feedback-based InConSistency Resolution and,Yan Qi; K Selcuk Candan; M Luisa Sapino,ABSTRACT A critical reality in data integration is that knowledge from different sources mayoften be conflicting with each other. Conflictresolution can be costly and; if done withoutproper context; can be ineffective. In this paper; we propose a novel query-driven andfeedback-based approach (FICSR1) to conflict resolution when integrating data sources. Inparticular; instead of relying on traditional model based definition of consistency; weintroduce a ranked interpretation. This not only enables FICSR to deal with the complexity ofthe conflict-resolution process; but also helps achieve a more direct match between theusers'(subjective) interpretation of the data and the system's (objective) treatment of theavailable alternatives. Consequently; the ranked interpretation leads to new opportunities forbi-directional (datainf orms←→ user) feedback cycle for conflict resolution: given a query …,*,*,*
PREDICTIVE EARLY OBJECT SHEDDING IN MEDIA PROCESSING WORKFLOWS (EXTENDED VERSION),Lina Peng; K Selçuk Candan,ABSTRACT Media-rich ubiquitous distributed media processing workflow systemscontinuously sense users' needs; status; and the context; filter and fuse a multitude of real-time media data; and react by adapting the environment to the user. One challenge facingthese systems is that they need to process real-time data arriving continuously from thesensors and data rates and qualities may vary dramatically. Thus; reducing the amount ofunqualified data objects that need to be processed within the underlying media processingworkflows can enhance the performance significantly. In this paper; we first focus on theprediction of the output qualities at the actuator; especially in the presence of fusionoperators in the workflow. We then present quality-aware early object elimination schemesto enable informed resource savings in continuous real-time media processing workflow …,*,*,*
