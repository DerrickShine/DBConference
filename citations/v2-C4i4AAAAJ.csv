Slim-trees: High performance metric trees minimizing overlap between nodes,Caetano Traina; Agma Traina; Bernhard Seeger; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract In this paper we present the Slim-tree; a dynamic tree for organizing metric datasetsin pages of fixed size. The Slim-tree uses the “fat-factor” which provides a simple way toquantify the degree of overlap between the nodes in a metric tree. It is well-known that thedegree of overlap directly affects the query performance of index structures. There are manysuggestions to reduce overlap in multidimensional index structures; but the Slim-tree is thefirst metric structure explicitly designed to reduce the degree of overlap. Moreover; wepresent new algorithms for inserting objects and splitting nodes. The new insertion algorithmleads to a tree with high storage utilization and improved query performance; whereas thenew split algorithm runs considerably faster than previous ones; generally without sacrificingsearch performance.

Fast indexing and visualization of metric data sets using slim-trees,Caetano Traina; Agma Traina; Christos Faloutsos; Bernhard Seeger,Many recent database applications need to deal with similarity queries. For suchapplications; it is important to measure the similarity between two objects using the distancebetween them. Focusing on this problem; this paper proposes the slim-tree; a new dynamictree for organizing metric data sets in pages of fixed size. The slim-tree uses the triangleinequality to prune the distance calculations that are needed to answer similarity queriesover objects in metric spaces. The proposed insertion algorithm uses new policies to selectthe nodes where incoming objects are stored. When a node overflows; the slim-tree uses aminimal spanning tree to help with the splitting. The new insertion algorithm leads to a treewith high storage utilization and improved query performance. The slim-tree is a metricaccess method that tackles the problem of overlaps between nodes in metric spaces and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2002,230
Fast feature selection using fractal dimension,Caetano Traina; Agma Traina; Leejay Wu; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Dimensionality curse and dimensionality reduction are two issues that haveretained high interest for data mining; machine learning; multimedia indexing; andclustering. We present a fast; scalable algorithm to quickly select the most importantattributes (dimensions) for a given set of n-dimensional vectors. In contrast to older methods;our method has the following desirable properties:(a) it does not do rotation of attributes;thus leading to easy interpretation of the resulting attributes;(b) it can spot attributes thathave nonlinear correlations;(c) it requires a constant number of passes over the dataset;(d) itgives a good estimate on how many attributes we should keep. The idea is to use the'fractal'dimension of a dataset as a good approximation of its intrinsic dimension; and to dropattributes that do not affect it. We applied our method on real and synthetic datasets …,*,2000,203
An efficient algorithm for fractal analysis of textures,Alceu Ferraz Costa; Gabriel Humpire-Mamani; Agma Juci Machado Traina,In this paper we propose a new and efficient texture feature extraction method: theSegmentation-based Fractal Texture Analysis; or SFTA. The extraction algorithm consists indecomposing the input image into a set of binary images from which the fractal dimensionsof the resulting regions are computed in order to describe segmented texture patterns. Thedecomposition of the input image is achieved by the Two-Threshold Binary Decomposition(TTBD) algorithm; which we also propose in this work. We evaluated SFTA for the tasks ofcontent-based image retrieval (CBIR) and image classification; comparing its performance tothat of other widely employed feature extraction methods such as Haralick and Gabor filterbanks. SFTA achieved higher precision and accuracy for CBIR and image classification.Additionally; SFTA was at least 3.7 times faster than Gabor and 1.6 times faster than …,Graphics; Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI); 2012 25th SIBGRAPI Conference on,2012,166
Clustering very large multi-dimensional datasets with mapreduce,Robson Leonardo Ferreira Cordeiro; Caetano Traina Junior; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Julio López; U Kang; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Given a very large moderate-to-high dimensionality dataset; how could one clusterits points? For datasets that don't fit even on a single disk; parallelism is a first class option.In this paper we explore MapReduce for clustering this kind of data. The main questions are(a) how to minimize the I/O cost; taking into account the already existing data partition (eg;on disks); and (b) how to minimize the network cost among processing nodes. Either of themmay be a bottleneck. Thus; we propose the Best of both Worlds--BoW method; thatautomatically spots the bottleneck and chooses a good strategy. Our main contributionsare:(1) We propose BoW and carefully derive its cost functions; which dynamically choosethe best strategy;(2) We show that BoW has numerous desirable features: it can work withmost serial clustering methods as a plugged-in clustering subroutine; it balances the cost …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,164
Similarity search without tears: the OMNI-family of all-purpose access methods,Agma Traina; Caetano Traina; Christos Faloutsos,Designing a new access method inside a commercial DBMS is cumbersome and expensive.We propose a family of metric access methods that are fast and easy to implement on top ofexisting access methods; such as sequential scan; R-trees and Slim-trees. The idea is toelect a set of objects as foci; and gauge all other objects with their distances from this set.We show how to define the foci set cardinality; how to choose appropriate foci; and how toperform range and nearest-neighbor queries using them; without false dismissals. The fociincrease the pruning of distance calculations during the query processing. Furthermore weindex the distances from each object to the foci to reduce even triangular inequalitycomparisons.

On query result diversification,Marcos R Vieira; Humberto L Razente; Maria CN Barioni; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Divesh Srivastava; Caetano Traina; Vassilis J Tsotras,In this paper we describe a general framework for evaluation and optimization of methodsfor diversifying query results. In these methods; an initial ranking candidate set produced bya query is used to construct a result set; where elements are ranked with respect torelevance and diversity features; ie; the retrieved elements should be as relevant aspossible to the query; and; at the same time; the result set should be as diverse as possible.While addressing relevance is relatively simple and has been heavily studied; diversity is aharder problem to solve. One major contribution of this paper is that; using the aboveframework; we adapt; implement and evaluate several existing methods for diversifyingquery results. We also propose two new approaches; namely the Greedy with MarginalContribution (GMC) and the Greedy Randomized with Neighborhood Expansion (GNE) …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,113

Spatial join selectivity using power laws,Christos Faloutsos; Bernhard Seeger; Agma Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract We discovered a surprising law governing the spatial join selectivity across two setsof points. An example of such a spatial join is “find the libraries that are within 10 miles ofschools”. Our law dictates that the number of such qualifying pairs follows a power law;whose exponent we call “pair-count exponent”(PC). We show that this law also holds for self-spatial-joins (“find schools within 5 miles of other schools”) in addition to the general casethat the two point-sets are distinct. Our law holds for many real datasets; including diverseenvironments (geographic datasets; feature vectors from biology data; galaxy data fromastronomy). In addition; we introduce the concept of the Box-Occupancy-Product-Sum(BOPS) plot; and we show that it can compute the pair-count exponent in a timely manner;reducing the run time by orders of magnitude; from quadratic to linear.

The maincontribution of this paper is that; surprisingly; many diverse datasets follow a" power law".This is the first analysis of distance distributions for metric datasets. We named the exponentof our power law as the" Distance Exponent". We show that it plays an important role for theanalysis of real; metric datasets. Specifically; we show:(a) how to use it to derive formulas forselectivity estimation of range queries; and (b) how to measure it quickly from a metric indextree (like an M-tree). We do experiments on many real datasets (road intersections of UScounties; vectors characteristics extracted from face matching systems; distance matrixes)and synthetic datasets (Sierpinsky triangle and 2-dimensional line).

An association rule-based method to support medical image diagnosis with efficiency,Marcela X Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques,In this paper; we propose a method based on association rule-mining to enhance thediagnosis of medical images (mammograms). It combines low-level features automaticallyextracted from images and high-level knowledge from specialists to search for patterns. Ourmethod analyzes medical images and automatically generates suggestions of diagnosesemploying mining of association rules. The suggestions of diagnosis are used to acceleratethe image analysis performed by specialists as well as to provide them an alternative to workon. The proposed method uses two new algorithms; PreSAGe and HiCARe. The PreSAGealgorithm combines; in a single step; feature selection and discretization; and reduces themining complexity. Experiments performed on PreSAGe show that this algorithm is highlysuitable to perform feature selection and discretization in medical images. HiCARe is a …,IEEE transactions on multimedia,2008,56

A fast and effective method to find correlations among attributes in databases,Elaine PM de Sousa; Caetano Traina; Agma JM Traina; Leejay Wu; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract The problem of identifying meaningful patterns in a database lies at the very heartof data mining. A core objective of data mining processes is the recognition of inter-attributecorrelations. Not only are correlations necessary for predictions and classifications–sincerules would fail in the absence of pattern–but also the identification of groups of mutuallycorrelated attributes expedites the selection of a representative subset of attributes; fromwhich existing mappings allow others to be derived. In this paper; we describe a scalable;effective algorithm to identify groups of correlated attributes. This algorithm can handle non-linear correlations between attributes; and is not restricted to a specific family of mappingfunctions; such as the set of polynomials. We show the results of our evaluation of thealgorithm applied to synthetic and real world datasets; and demonstrate that it is able to …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2007,52

This new method; called metric histogram; takesadvantage of the correlation among adjacent bins of histograms; reducing thedimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from images; leading to faster and moreflexible indexing and retrieval processes. The proposed technique works on each imageindependently from the others in the dataset; therefore there is no pre-defined number ofcolor regions in the resulting histogram. Thus; it is not possible to use traditional comparisonalgorithms such as Euclidean or Manhattan distances. To allow the comparison of imagesthrough the new feature vectors given by metric histograms; a new metric distance functionMHD () is also proposed.

In metric spaces;comparison operations can be specially expensive; so the pruning ability of indexingmethods turns out to be specially meaningful. This paper shows how to measure the pruningpower of metric access methods; and defines a new measurement; called" prunability;"which indicates how well a pruning technique carries out the task of cutting down distancecalculations at each tree level. It also presents a new dynamic access method; aiming tominimize the number of distance calculations required to answer similarity queries. We showthat this novel structure is up to 3 times faster and requires less than 25% distancecalculations to answer similarity queries; as compared to existing methods.

Assessing the best integration between distance-function and image-feature to answer similarity queries,Pedro H Bugatti; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract The retrieval of multimedia data relies on a feature extractor to provide the intrinsiccharacteristics (features) from the data; and a measure to quantify the similarity betweenthem. A challenge in multimedia database systems is how to best integrate these two keyaspects in order to improve the quality of the retrieved selection when answering similarityqueries. In this paper; we analyze and compare a set of distance functions and featureextractors with regard to the association and dependencies among them. The results showthat the most widely used and well-known distance functions; such as the Euclideandistance; do not reach a desirable similarity assessment; and reveal that a careful choice ofa distance function considerably improves the retrieval of multimedia data; which in ourexperiments reached up to 92%.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2008,40

In this paperwe present a fast; scalable algorithm to quickly select the most important attributes(dimensions) for a given set of n-dimensional vectors; determining what attributes arecorrelated to the others and how to group them. The algorithm takes advantage of the'fractal'dimension of a data set as a good approximation of its intrinsic dimension and; basedon it; indicates what attributes are the most important to keep the meaning of the data.

However; they are not able to handle largegraphs; and/or they do not allow interaction. We are interested on large graphs; withhundreds of thousands of nodes. Such graphs bring two challenges: the first one is that anystraightforward interactive manipulation will be prohibitively slow. The second one issensory overload: even if we could plot and replot the graph quickly; the user would beoverwhelmed with the vast volume of information because the screen would be too clutteredas nodes and edges overlap each other.

MrCC employs a novel data structure based on multi-resolutionand gains over previous approaches in:(a) it finds clusters that stand out in the data in astatistical sense;(b) it is linear on running time and memory usage regarding number of datapoints and dimensionality of subspaces where clusters exist;(c) it is linear in memory usageand quasi-linear in running time regarding space dimensionality; and (d) it is accurate;deterministic; robust to noise; does not require stating the number of clusters as inputparameter; does not perform distance calculation and is able to detect clusters in …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,28
Content-based image retrieval using approximate shape of objects,Agma JM Traina; André GR Balan; Luis M Bortolotti; C Traina,This paper presents a new approach to retrieve images by content using a composition ofrelevant features regarding texture; shape and brightness distribution. The first step of themethod is a segmentation process based on Markov random fields; which can be doneautomatically; having as parameter the number of desired classes. The regions obtained inthe segmentation guide the extraction of measures from the original image producing a 30-dimensional feature vector used in the image retrieval. The experiments showed that thefeature vector has high discrimination power and the time for retrieval operations are onlyfractions of seconds.,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2004. CBMS 2004.

Frequency plot and relevance plot to enhance visual data exploration,JF Rodrigues; Agma JM Traina; C Traina,We present two techniques aiming at exploring databases through multivariatevisualizations. Both techniques intend to deal with the problem caused by the limited amountof elements that can be presented simultaneously in traditional visual explorationprocedures. The first technique; the Frequency Plot; combines data frequency withinteractive filtering to identify clusters and trends in subsets of the database. Thus; graphicalelements (lines; pixels; icons; or graphical marks) are color differentiated proportionally tohow frequent the value being represented is; while interactive filtering allows the selection ofinteresting partitions of the database. The second technique; the Relevance Plot;corresponds to assigning different levels of color distinguishably to visual elementsaccording to their relevance to a user's specified data properties set; which can be …,Computer Graphics and Image Processing; 2003.

A holistic approach for resource-aware adaptive data stream mining,Mohamed Medhat Gaber; S Yu Philip,Abstract Mining data streams is a field of increasing interest due to the importance of itsapplications and dissemination of data stream sources. Most of the streaming techniquesdeveloped so far have not addressed the need for resource-aware computing in data streamanalysis. The fact that streaming information is often generated or received onboardresource-constrained computational devices such as sensor nodes and mobile devicesmotivates the need for resource-awareness in data stream processing systems. In thispaper; we propose a generic framework that enables resource-awareness in streamingcomputation using algorithm granularity settings in order to change the resourceconsumption patterns periodically. This generic framework is applied to a novel threshold-based micro-clustering algorithm to test its validity and feasibility. We have termed this …,New Generation Computing,2006,25
From bag-of-visual-words to bag-of-visual-phrases using n-grams,Glauco V Pedrosa; Agma JM Traina,The Bag-of-Visual-Words has emerged as an effective modeling approach to represent localimage features. It describes local image features by assigning them a visual word accordingto a visual dictionary. The image representation is given by the frequency of each visualword in the image; as a similar representation used in textual documents. In this paper; wepresent a novel approach building a high-level description using a group of words (phrases)for representing an image. We introduce the use of n-grams for image representation; basedon the idea of" Bag-of-Visual-Phrases". In the field of computational linguistics; an n-gram isa phrase formed by a sequence of n-consecutive words. As analogy; we represent an imageby a combination of n-consecutive visual words. We made representative experiments usingthree public benchmark databases of textures and nature scenes and two medical …,Graphics; Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI); 2013 26th SIBGRAPI-Conference on,2013,24
Efficient processing of complex similarity queries in RDBMS through query rewriting,Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina; Marcos R Vieira; Adriano S Arantes; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Multimedia and complex data are usually queried by similarity predicates. Whereasthere are many works dealing with algorithms to answer basic similarity predicates; there arenot generic algorithms able to efficiently handle similarity complex queries combiningseveral basic similarity predicates. In this work we propose a simple and effective set ofalgorithms that can be combined to answer complex similarity queries; and a set of algebraicrules useful to rewrite similarity query expressions into an adequate format for thosealgorithms. Those rules and algorithms allow relational database management systems toturn complex queries into efficient query execution plans. We present experiments thathighlight interesting scenarios. They show that the proposed algorithms are orders ofmagnitude faster than the traditional similarity algorithms. Moreover; they are linearly …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,23
Measuring evolving data streams’ behavior through their intrinsic dimension,Elaine PM de Sousa; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract The dimension of a dataset has major impact on database management; such asindexing and querying processing. The embedding dimension (ie; the number of attributesof the dataset) usually overestimates the actual contribution of the attributes to the maincharacteristics of the data; as the typical assumption of uniform distribution andindependence between attributes usually does not hold. In fact; due to dependencies andattribute correlations; real data are typically skewed and exhibit intrinsic dimensionalitymuch lower than the embedding dimension. Similarly; the intrinsic dimension can also beapplied to improve data stream processing and analysis. Data streams are generated assequences of events represented by a predetermined number of numerical attributes. Thus;without loss of generality; we can consider events as elements from a dimensional …,New Generation Computing,2006,23
Slicing the metric space to provide quick indexing of complex data in the main memory,Caio César Mori Carélo; Ives Renê Venturini Pola; Ricardo Rodrigues Ciferri; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Cristina Dutra de Aguiar Ciferri,Abstract Searching in a dataset for elements that are similar to a given query element is acore problem in applications that manage complex data; and has been aided by metricaccess methods (MAMs). A growing number of applications require indices that must be builtfaster and repeatedly; also providing faster response for similarity queries. The increase inthe main memory capacity and its lowering costs also motivate using memory-based MAMs.In this paper; we propose the Onion-tree; a new and robust dynamic memory-based MAMthat slices the metric space into disjoint subspaces to provide quick indexing of complexdata. It introduces three major characteristics:(i) a partitioning method that controls thenumber of disjoint subspaces generated at each node;(ii) a replacement technique that canchange the leaf node pivots in insertion operations; and (iii) range and k-NN extended …,Information Systems,2011,22
Effective shape-based retrieval and classification of mammograms,Joaquim C Felipe; Marcela X Ribeiro; Elaine PM Sousa; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract This paper presents a new approach to support Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD)aiming at assisting the task of classification and similarity retrieval of mammographic masslesions; based on shape content. We have tested classical algorithms for automaticsegmentation of this kind of image; but usually they are not precise enough to generateaccurate contours to allow lesion classification based on shape analyses. Thus; in this work;we have used Zernike moments for invariant pattern recognition within regions of interest(ROIs); without previous segmentation of images. A new data mining algorithm thatgenerates statistical-based association rules is used to identify representative features thatdiscriminate the disease classes of images. In order to minimize the computational effort; analgorithm based on fractal theory is applied to reduce the dimension of feature vectors.

In this paper; we address the task of scaling up k-medoid-based algorithms through the utilization of metric access methods; allowing clusteringalgorithms to be executed by database management systems in a fraction of the time usuallyrequired by the traditional approaches. We also present an optimization strategy that can beapplied as an additional step of the proposed algorithm in order to achieve better clusteringsolutions.

Mamcost: Global and local estimates leading to robust cost estimation of similarity queries,Gisele Busichia Baioco; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,This paper presents an effective cost model to estimate the number of disk accesses (I/Ocost) and the number of distance calculations (CPU cost) to process similarity queries overdata indexed by metric access methods. Two types of similarity queries were taken intoconsideration: range and k-nearest neighbor queries. The main point of the cost model isconsidering not only global parameters of the data set but also the local data distribution.The model takes advantage of the intrinsic dimension of the data set; estimated by itscorrelation fractal dimension. Experiments were performed on real and synthetic data sets;with different sizes and dimensions; in order to validate the proposed model. They confirmedthat the estimations are accurate; within the range achieved by real queries.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007. SSBDM'07. 19th International Conference on,2007,21
SuperGraph visualization,Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina; Christos Faloutsos; Caetano Traina Jr,Given a large social or computer network; how can we visualize it; find patterns; outliers;communities? Although several graph visualization tools exist; they cannot handle largegraphs with hundred thousand nodes and possibly million edges. Such graphs bring twochallenges: interactive visualization demands prohibitive processing power and; even if wecould interactively update the visualization; the user would be overwhelmed by theexcessive number of graphical items. To cope with this problem; we propose a formalinnovation on the use of graph hierarchies that leads to GMine system. GMine promotesscalability using a hierarchy of graph partitions; promotes concomitant presentation for thegraph hierarchy and for the original graph; and extends analytical possibilities with theintegration of the graph partitions in an interactive environment,Multimedia; 2006.

Large graph analysis in the gmine system,Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Hanghang Tong; Jia-Yu Pan; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Christos Faloutsos,Current applications have produced graphs on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodesand millions of edges. To take advantage of such graphs; one must be able to find patterns;outliers; and communities. These tasks are better performed in an interactive environment;where human expertise can guide the process. For large graphs; though; there are somechallenges: the excessive processing requirements are prohibitive; and drawing hundred-thousand nodes results in cluttered images hard to comprehend. To cope with theseproblems; we propose an innovative framework suited for any kind of tree-like graph visualdesign. GMine integrates 1) a representation for graphs organized as hierarchies ofpartitions-the concepts of SuperGraph and Graph-Tree; and 2) a graph summarizationmethodology-CEPS.

How to improve medical image diagnosis through association rules: The IDEA method,Marcela Xavier Ribeiro; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Natalia Abdala Rosa; Paulo Mazzoncini de Azevedo Marques,In this paper we present a new method; called IDEA; which employs association rules toassist in medical image diagnosis. IDEA mines association rules; relating visual featureswith the knowledge gotten from specialists; and employs the associations to suggestpossible diagnoses for a given medical image. IDEA incorporates two new algorithms calledOmega and ACE. Omega performs simultaneously feature selection and data discretizationvery efficiently with linear cost on the number of feature values. ACE is a new associativeclassifier; which has the particular ability of suggesting multiple keywords to compose thediagnosis for a given medical image. The IDEA method has an important characteristic thatmakes it different from other CAD methods: it suggests multiple diagnosis hypotheses for animage and ranks them based on a measure of quality.

Genetic algorithms for approximate similarity queries,Renato Bueno; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Algorithms to query large sets of simple data (composed of numbers and smallcharacter strings) are constructed to retrieve the exact answer; retrieving every relevantelement; so the answer said to be exact. Similarity searching over complex data is muchmore expensive than searching over simple data. Moreover; comparison operations overcomplex data usually consider features extracted from each element; instead of theelements themselves. Thus; even if an algorithm retrieves an exact answer; it is'exact'regarding the extracted features; not regarding the original elements themselves.Therefore; trading exact answering with query time response can be worthwhile. In this workwe developed two search strategies based on genetic algorithms to allow retrievingapproximate data indexed by Metric Access Methods (MAM) within a limited; user-defined …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,20

Querying complex objects by similarity in SQL.,Maria Camila Nardini Barioni; Humberto Luiz Razente; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract. Similarity search has received large attention on modern database applicationsinvolving complex objects; since the queries executed in such databases are seldom basedon exact matches but rather on some specific notion of similarity. However; the SQL querylanguage does not provide effective support for similarity queries. This paper proposes theaddition of similarity queries to SQL; including a new set of similarity operators in order tosearch complex objects stored as sets of attributes in a relation. It also describes a prototypedeveloped to validate and illustrate the concepts and syntax presented.,SBBD,2005,20

Bowfire: detection of fire in still images by integrating pixel color and texture analysis,Daniel YT Chino; Letricia PS Avalhais; Jose F Rodrigues; Agma JM Traina,Emergency events involving fire are potentially harmful; demanding a fast and precisedecision making. The use of crowd sourcing image and videos on crisis managementsystems can aid in these situations by providing more information than verbal/textualdescriptions. Due to the usual high volume of data; automatic solutions need to discard non-relevant content without losing relevant information. There are several methods for firedetection on video using color-based models. However; they are not adequate for still imageprocessing; because they can suffer on high false-positive results. These methods alsosuffer from parameters with little physical meaning; which makes fine tuning a difficult task. Inthis context; we propose a novel fire detection method for still images that uses classificationbased on color features combined with texture classification on super pixel regions.

MedFMI-SiR: A powerful DBMS solution for large-scale medical image retrieval,Daniel S Kaster; Pedro H Bugatti; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Paulo MA Marques; Antonio C Santos; Caetano Traina,Abstract Medical systems increasingly demand methods to deal with the large amount ofimages that are daily generated. Therefore; the development of fast and scalableapplications to store and retrieve images in large repositories becomes an importantconcern. Moreover; it is necessary to handle textual and content-based queries over suchdata coupled with DICOM image metadata and their visual patterns. While DBMSs havebeen extensively used to manage applications' textual information; content-basedprocessing tasks usually rely on specific solutions. Most of these solutions are targeted torelatively small and controlled datasets; being unfeasible to be employed in real medicalenvironments that deal with voluminous databases.

Low level features of shape and texture areextracted from images. Statistical association rules are used to select the most relevantfeatures to discriminate the images; reducing the size of the feature vectors and eliminatingnoisy features that influence negatively the query results; making the whole process moreefficient.

Using relevance feedback to reduce the semantic gap in content-based image retrieval of mammographic masses,Natalia A Rosa; Joaquim C Felipe; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Rangaraj M Rangayyan; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques,This paper presents the use of relevance feedback (RFb) to reduce the semantic gap incontent-based image retrieval (CBIR) of mammographic masses. Tests were conductedwhere the radiologists' classification of the lesions based on the BI-RADS categories wereused with techniques of query-point movement to incorporate RFb. The measures ofsimilarity of images used for CBIR were based upon Zernike moments. The performance ofCBIR was measured in terms of precision and recall of retrieval. The results indicateimprovement due to RFb of up to 41.6% in precision. In our experiments; the gain in theperformance of CBIR with RFb was associated with the BI-RADS category of the querymammographic image; with large improvement in cases of lesions belonging to categories 4and 5.

The mm-tree: A memory-based metric tree without overlap between nodes,Ives Rene Venturini Pola; Caetano Traina; Agma Juci Machado Traina,Abstract Advanced database systems offer similarity queries on complex data. Searching bysimilarity on complex data is accelerated through the use of metric access methods (MAM).These access methods organize data in order to reduce the number of comparison betweenelements when answering queries. MAM can be categorized in two types: disk-based andmemory-based. The disk-based structures limit the partitioning of space forcing nodes tohave multiple elements according to disk page sizes. However; memory-based trees allowsmore flexibility; producing trees faster to build and to perform queries. Although recentdevelopments target disk-based methods on tree structures; several applications benefitsfrom a faster way to build indexes on main memory.

DBM-tree: Trading height-balancing for performance in metric access methods,Marcos R Vieira; Caetano Traina Jr; Fabio JT Chino; Agma JM Traina,Metric Access Methods (MAM) are employed to accelerate the processing of similarityqueries; such as the range and the k-nearest neighbor queries. Current methods; such asthe Slim-tree and the M-tree; improve the query performance minimizing the number of diskaccesses; keeping a constant height of the structures stored on disks (height-balancedtrees). However; the overlapping between their nodes has a very high influence on theirperformance. This paper presents a new dynamic MAM called the DBM-tree (Density-BasedMetric tree); which can minimize the overlap between high-density nodes by relaxing theheight-balancing of the structure. Thus; the height of the tree is larger in denser regions; inorder to keep a tradeoff between breadth-searching and depth-searching. An underpinningfor cost estimation on tree structures is their height; so we show a non-height dependable …,Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society,2006,18

A novel optimization approach to efficiently process aggregate similarity queries in metric access methods,Humberto L Razente; Maria Camila N Barioni; Agma Juci M Traina; Christos Faloutsos; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract A similarity query considers an element as the query center and searches a datasetto find either the elements far up to a bounding radius or the k nearest ones from the querycenter. Several algorithms have been developed to efficiently execute similarity queries.However; there are queries that require more than one center; which we call AggregateSimilarity Queries. Such queries appear when the user gives multiple desirable examples;and requests data elements that are similar to all of the examples; as in the case of applyingrelevance feedback. Here we give the first algorithms that can handle aggregate similarityqueries on Metric Access Methods (MAM) such as the M-tree and Slim-tree. Our method;which we call Metric Aggregate Similarity Search (MASS) has the following properties:(a) itrequires only the triangle inequality property;(b) it guarantees no false-dismissals; as we …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,17

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems areinherently interactive. However; little attention has been paid to their interfaces. A majordifficulty for designing the interface of these systems is to ally high quality means to integratethe querying on the images and the presentation and handling of the results. The goal of thispaper was to analyze the user interaction in CBIR systems regarding their functionality andusability. This was achieved by following the actual interaction of users while working with aCBIR system. This task allowed us to suggest a questionnaire that can properly reflect theevaluated aspects of the users interaction regarding their satisfaction degree.

In this paper we present a fast; scalable algorithm to quickly select the mostimportant attributes (dimensions) for a given set of n-dimensional vectors. In contrast to oldermethods; our method has the following desirable properties:(a) it does not do rotation ofattributes; thus leading to easy interpretation of the resulting attributes;(b) it can spotattributes that have either linear or nonlinear correlations;(c) it requires a constant number ofpasses over the dataset;(d) it gives a good estimate on how many attributes should be kept.,Journal of Information and data Management,2010,16

In this sense; we establish a model to examine the process through whichvisualizations become expressive for users. This model has lead us to a taxonomy orientedto the human visual perception. The essence of this taxonomy provides natural criteria inorder to delineate a novel understanding for the design space of visualizations. From suchunderstanding; we elaborate a model for generalized design. The model poses an intuitivecomprehension for the visualization design space departing from fundamental pre-attentivestimuli and from perceptual phenomena.

Identifying Algebraic Properties to Support Optimization of Unary Similarity Queries.,Mônica Ribeiro Porto Ferreira; Agma JM Traina; Ires Dias; Richard Chbeir; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. Conventional operators for data retrieval are either based on exact matching or ontotal order relationship among elements. Neither of them is appropriate to manage complexdata; such as multimedia data; time series and genetic sequences. In fact; the mostmeaningful way to compare complex data is by similarity. However; the Relational Algebra;employed in the Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS); cannot expresssimilarity criteria. In order to address this issue; we provide here an extension of theRelational Algebra; aimed at representing similarity queries in algebraic expressions. Thispaper identifies fundamental properties to allow the integration of the unary similarityoperators into the Relational Algebra to handle similarity-based operators; either alone orcombined with the existing (exact matching and/or relational) operators.

A support system for content-based medical image retrieval in object oriented databases,Caetano Traina; Agma JM Traina; Rildo R Dos Santos; Edna Y Senzako,Abstract This work describes both the concepts used in an Object Manager for storage ofmedical images as one more data type associated to objects; and a support systemdeveloped to offer this kind of tool to medical application developers. The purpose of thiswork is to support the retrieval of images through queries based on the graphical contents ofthe stored images. The usual approach uses icons and textual attributes stored with theimages to specify the queries. This work uses a novel modeling technique to define the“image data type;” by means of which it is possible to decide; before the query itself; the keydata of each image that must be extracted from the image when it is stored in the database;so the search can be accelerated when queries are issued. This approach enables buildingof expansible systems; where new image processing algorithms can be added easily …,Journal of medical systems,1997,15

Nonetheless; the process ofcomparing XML documents with XML grammars; ie; XML document and grammar similarityevaluation; has not yet received the attention it deserves. In this paper; we provide anoverview on existing research related to XML document/grammar comparison; presentingthe background and discussing the various techniques related to the problem. We alsodiscuss some prominent application domains; ranging over document classification andclustering; document transformation; grammar evolution; selective dissemination of XML …,*,2011,14
Querying multimedia data by similarity in relational DBMS,Maria Camila Nardini Barioni; Daniel dos Santos Kaster; Humberto Luiz Razente; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Júnior,Abstract Multimedia objects–such as images; audio; and video–do not present the totalordering relationship; so the relational operators ('<';'=';'=';'>') are not suitable to comparethem. Therefore; similarity queries are the most useful; and often the only types of queriesadequate to search multimedia objects stored in a database. Unfortunately; the ubiquitousquery language SQL–the most widely employed language in Database ManagementSystems (DBMS)–does not provide effective support for similarity queries. This chapterpresents an already validated strategy that adds similarity queries to SQL; supporting apowerful set of similarity operators. The chapter also describes techniques to store andretrieve multimedia objects in an efficient way and shows existing DBMS alternatives toexecute similarity queries over multimedia data.,*,2011,14
A new family of distance functions for perceptual similarity retrieval of medical images,Joaquim Cezar Felipe; Caetano Traina; Agma Juci Machado Traina,Abstract A long-standing challenge of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems is thedefinition of a suitable distance function to measure the similarity between images in anapplication context which complies with the human perception of similarity. In this paper; wepresent a new family of distance functions; called attribute concurrence influence distances(AID); which serve to retrieve images by similarity. These distances address an importantaspect of the psychophysical notion of similarity in comparisons of images: the effect ofconcurrent variations in the values of different image attributes. The AID functions allow forcomparisons of feature vectors by choosing one of two parameterized expressions: onetargeting weak attribute concurrence influence and the other for strong concurrenceinfluence. This paper presents the mathematical definition and implementation of the AID …,Journal of digital imaging,2009,14
SuGAR: a framework to support mammogram diagnosis,Marcela X Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; Andre GR Balan; Caetano Traina Jr; Paulo MA Marques,In this paper we present a framework based on association-rules to help diagnosis ofmammogram abnormalities. Our framework-SuGAR-combines low-level featuresautomatically extracted from images with high-level knowledge gotten from specialists tomine association rules; suggesting possible diagnoses. Our framework is optimized; in thesense that it combines; in a single step; feature selection and discretization; reducing themining complexity. The framework was applied to real datasets and the results show highsensitivity (up to 95%) and accuracy (up to 92%); allowing us to claim that association rulescan effectively aid in the diagnosing task.,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2007.

Global warp metric distance: Boosting content-based image retrieval through histograms,Joaquim Cezar Felipe; Agma JM Traina; C Traina,This work presents a new distance function-the global warp metric distance-to comparehistograms used as a feature to index image databases in content based image retrievalenvironments. The metric histogram represents a compact; but efficient alternative to the useof traditional gray level histograms to represent images. The global warp metric distance(GWMD) enhances the comparison between histograms; replacing the rigid bin to binevaluation by the warp method; which allows a local" adjustment" of one histogram to theother during the distance calculation; introducing a global matching of the curves. Besidesthis; GWMD applies a set of geometric global features of histograms to determine the finaldistance. Results on similarity retrieval in medical images demonstrate the superiority of theproposed approach in analyzing image sets that present brightness and contrast …,Multimedia; Seventh IEEE International Symposium on,2005,14

Extending relational databases to support content-based retrieval of medical images,Myrian RB Araujo; C Traina; Agma Traina; Josiane M Bueno; Humberto Luiz Razente,This paper shows how to support images in a relational database; so it can fulfill therequirements to be used as the storage mechanism of a PACS. This support includes theability to answer similarity queries based on the image content; providing fast image retrievalbased on indexing structures. The main concept allowing this support is the definition ofdistance functions based on features; which are extracted from the images as they arestored in the database. An extension to SQL enables the construction of an interpreter thatintercepts the extended commands and translates them into standard SQL; allowing one totake advantage of any relational database server. We describe experiments made with aprototype implemented using these concepts; which allowed answering queries up to 20times faster than using existing relational servers alone.,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2002.(CBMS 2002).

Open issues for partitioning clustering methods: an overview,Maria Camila N Barioni; Humberto Razente; Alessandra MR Marcelino; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Over the last decades; a great variety of data mining techniques have beendeveloped to reach goals concerning Knowledge Discovery in Databases. Among them;cluster detection techniques are of major importance. Although these techniques havealready been largely explored in the scientific literature; there are at least two importantopen issues: the existent algorithms are not scalable for large high-dimensional datasets;and the unsupervised nature of traditional data clustering makes it very difficult to generatemeaningful clusters. This article presents an overview of the strategies being explored inorder to deal more deeply with these issues. Moreover; it describes a new semi-supervisedclustering strategy that exemplifies the integration of several approaches and that can beemployed with partitioning algorithms; such as PAM and Clarans.

Aggregate similarity queries in relevance feedback methods for content-based image retrieval,Humberto L Razente; Maria Camila N Barioni; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Content-based image retrieval techniques rely on automatic features extracted fromimages to process similarity queries. Usually low-level features are extracted; and when theyare used to compare images stored in a database to a reference image (through singlecenter selection queries); they often lack the ability to convey to the users what theyunderstand as similarity. To deal with the gap between what the user expects and what thesystem can automatically provide; relevance feedback techniques have been employed. Inthis paper we present a generalization of the single center similarity queries over data inmetric spaces; taking into account both range and k-nearest neighbors. Allowing a query toinclude multiple query centers; it straightforwardly attends the relevance feedbackrequirements. Thus; we analyze how well our new approach contribute to relevance …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2008,12

Evaluating the intrinsic dimension of evolving data streams,Elaine PM de Sousa; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Data streams are fundamental in several data processing applications involvinglarge amount of data generated continuously as a sequence of events. Frequently; suchevents are not stored; so the data is analyzed and queried as they arrive and discarded rightaway. In many applications these events are represented by a predetermined number ofnumerical attributes. Thus; without loss of generality; we can consider events as elementsfrom a dimensional domain. A sequence of events in a data stream can be characterized byits intrinsic dimension; which in dimensional datasets is usually lower than the embeddingdimensionality. As the intrinsic dimension can be used to improve the performance ofalgorithms handling dimensional data (specially query optimization) measuring it is relevantto improve data streams processing and analysis as well. Moreover; it can also be useful …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2006,12

Content-based image retrieval systems relying on relevance feedback techniques usually requestthe users to label relevant/irrelevant images. Thus; we present a highly effective strategy tosurvey user profiles; taking advantage of such labeling to implicitly gather the userperceptual similarity. The profiles maintain the settings desired for each user; allowingtuning of the similarity assessment; which encompasses the dynamic change of the distancefunction employed through an interactive process. Experiments on medical images showthat the method is effective and can improve the decision making process during analysis.,Computers in biology and medicine,2014,11

The proposedalgorithms are sample-based; and they always build a valid and height-balanced tree. Wecompare the proposed algorithm with existing ones; showing the behavior to bulk-load datainto the Slim-tree metric access method. After having identified the worst case of our firstalgorithm; we describe adequate counteractions in an elegant way creating the secondalgorithm. Experiments performed to evaluate their performance show that our bulk-loadingmethods build trees faster than the sequential insertion method regarding construction time;and that it also significantly improves search performance.,Information Systems,2010,11

The onion-tree: quick indexing of complex data in the main memory,Caio César Mori Carélo; Ives Renê Venturini Pola; Ricardo Rodrigues Ciferri; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina-Jr; Cristina Dutra de Aguiar Ciferri,Abstract Searching for elements in a dataset that are similar to a given query element is acore problem in applications that use complex data; and has been carried out aided by ametric access method (MAM). A growing number of these applications require indices thatcan be built faster and for several times; in addition to providing smaller response times forsimilarity queries. Besides; the increase in the main memory capacity and its lowering costsalso motivate using memory-based MAMs. In this paper; we propose the Onion-tree; a newand robust dynamic memory-based MAM that performs a hierarchical division of the metricspace into disjoint subspaces. The Onion-tree is very compact; requiring a small fraction ofthe main memory (eg; at most 4.8%). Comparisons of the Onion-tree; a memory-basedversion of the Slim-tree; and the memory-based MM-tree showed that the Onion-tree …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2009,11
Including the perceptual parameter to tune the retrieval ability of pulmonary CBIR systems,Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques; Joaquim C Felipe; Caetano Traina,The research on Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is growing in relevance at a fastpace. Algorithms and tools for CBIR can help decision-making processes; for exampleallowing the specialist to retrieve cases similar to the one under evaluation. However; themain reservation about using CBIR is the semantic gap; which is the divergence amongautomatic results and what the user is expecting. We propose the ldquoperceptualparameterrdquo; which allows changing the relationship between the feature extractionalgorithms and the distance functions; aimed at finding the best integration of both from thespecialist's point of view.

Some experiments were performed to validate theeffects of the preprocessing performed by the Omega algorithm in the results of the C4. 5algorithm (a well-known decision tree-based classifier). The results indicates that theproposed algorithm Omega is well-suited to both; data discretization and feature selection;being appropriate for data pre-processing.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2008,11

The k-nearest neighborpredicate is surely the most interesting for several applications; including Content-BasedImage Retrieval (CBIR) and Data Mining (DM) tasks; yet it is also the most expensive to beevaluated. A strong motivation to include operators to execute the k-nearest neighborpredicate inside a DBMS is to employ the powerful resource of query rewriting following …,Journal of Information and Data Management,2011,9
Combining visual analytics and content based data retrieval technology for efficient data analysis,Jose Fernando Rodrigues Jr; Luciana AS Romani; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,One of the most useful techniques to help visual data analysis systems is interactive filtering(brushing). However; visualization techniques often suffer from overlap of graphical itemsand multiple attributes complexity; making visual selection inefficient. In these situations; thebenefits of data visualization are not fully observable because the graphical items do notpop up as comprehensive patterns. In this work we propose the use of content-based dataretrieval technology combined with visual analytics. The idea is to use the similarity queryfunctionalities provided by metric space systems in order to select regions of the datadomain according to user-guidance and interests. After that; the data found in such regionsfeed multiple visualization workspaces so that the user can inspect the correspondentdatasets. Our experiments showed that the methodology can break the visual analysis …,Information Visualisation (IV); 2010 14th International Conference,2010,9
Unsupervised scaling of multi-descriptor similarity functions for medical image datasets,Renato Bueno; Daniel S Kaster; Adriano A Paterlini; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Content-based search has proven to be a proper complement to textual queries overmedical image databases. In many applications; employing multiple image descriptors andcombining the respective distance functions using adequate scale factors improves theretrieval accuracy. However; the existing weighting methods are either exhaustive orsupervised. In this paper; we present the Fractal-scaled Product Metric; an unsupervisedmethod to determine a scale factor among features in multi-descriptor image similarityassessment based on the fractal theory. The composite distance function obtained is notlimited to dimensional image descriptors and enables using scalable indexing structures.Experiments have shown that the proposed method determines near-optimal scale factorsfor the descriptors involved; and always improves the precision of the results …,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2009.

Data pre-processing: a new algorithm for feature selection and data discretization,Marcela X Ribeiro; Mônica RP Ferreira; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract Data pre-processing is a key element to improve the accuracy of data miningalgorithms. In the pre-processing step; the data are treated in order to make the miningprocess achievable and effective. Data discretization and feature selection are two importanttasks that can be performed prior to the learning phase and can significantly reduce theprocessing effort of the data mining algorithm. In this paper; we present Omega; a newalgorithm for data discretization and feature selection. Omega performs simultaneously datadiscretization and feature selection. We validated Omega by comparing it with other well-known algorithms for data discretization (1R; ChiMerge and Chi2) and feature selection(DTM; Relief and Chi2).

Thisnew approach takes advantage of an interactive 3-dimensional visualization fed by theimage features obtained through a given extraction technique under analysis. Usingcontrolled test image datasets; the researcher can literally" see" the discrimination power ofthe image features. This new approach gives a very good insight of the behavior of a givenimage feature extractor algorithm; which are confirmed by the well-known precision andrecall measurements.

The fractal dimension making similarity queries more efficient,Adriano S Arantes; Marcos R Vieira; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,ABSTRACT This paper presents a new algorithm to answer k-nearest neighbor queriescalled the Fractal k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NNF ()). This algorithm takes advantage of thefractal dimension of the dataset under scan to estimate a suitable radius to shrinks a querythat retrieves the k-nearest neighbors of a query object. k-NN () algorithms starts searchingfor elements at any distance from the query center; progressively reducing the alloweddistance used to consider elements as worth to analyze. If a proper radius can be set to startthe process; a significant reduction in the number of distance calculations can be achieved.The experiments performed with real and synthetic datasets over the access method Slim-tree; have shown that the efficiency of our approach makes the total processing time to dropup to 50%; while requires 25% less distance calculations.,Proceedings of the II ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Fractals; Power Laws and Other Next Generation Data Mining Tools,2003,9

Parameter-free and domain-independent similarity search with diversity,Lucio FD Santos; Willian D Oliveira; Monica RP Ferreira; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract New operators to execute similarity-based queries over multimedia data stored inDatabase Management Systems are increasingly demanded. However; searching in verylarge datasets; the basic operators often return elements too much similar both to the querycenter and to themselves; reducing the answer's utility. In this paper; we tackle the problemof providing diversity to similarity query results; and define techniques to assure that eachelement in the result set is different enough from the others. Existing techniques compel theuser to define either a parameter to trade among similarity and diversity or a minimumsimilarity between result elements. Distinctly; our approach provides similarity queries withdiversification using the influence concept; which automatically estimates the inherentdiversity between the result set elements requiring no user-defined parameters …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,8
New DTW-based method to similarity search in sugar cane regions represented by climate and remote sensing time series,Luciana AS Romani; RRV Goncalves; J Zullo; C Traina; Agma JM Traina,Brazil is an important sugar cane producer; which is the main resource for ethanolproduction; a renewable source of energy. This agricultural commodity is important to thecountry economy; becoming fundamental to improve models that assist the crops monitoringprocess. Vegetation indexes originated from remote sensing images andagrometeorological indexes can be combined to represent sugar cane fields in a regionalscale. However; finding different regions with similar patterns to classify or analyze theircharacteristics is a non-trivial task. Accordingly; this paper presents a method to find similarsugar cane fields represented by series of vegetation and agrometeorological indexes. Theproposed method combines a weighted distance function with an algorithm to find similarobjects.

SACMiner: a new classification method based on statistical association rules to mine medical images,Carolina YV Watanabe; Marcela X Ribeiro; Caetano Traina; Agma JM Traina,Abstract The analysis of images to decision making has become more accurate thanks to thetechnological progress on acquiring medical images. In this scenario; new approaches havebeen developed and employed in the computer-aided diagnosis in order to be a secondopinion to the physician. In this work; we present SACMiner; which is a new method ofclassification that takes advantage of statistical association rules. It works with continuousattributes and avoids introducing the bottleneck and inconsistencies in the learning modeldue to a discretization step; which is required in the most of the associative classificationmethods. Two new algorithms are employed in this method: the StARMiner* and the V-classifier.

Content-based retrieval of medical images by continuous feature selection,Pedro Henrique Bugatti; Marcela Xavier Ribeiro; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Junior,Feature selection can significantly improve the precision of content-based queries in imagedatabases by removing noisy features or by bursting the most relevant ones. Continuousfeature selection techniques assign continuous weights to each feature according to theirrelevance. In this paper; we propose a supervised method for continuous feature selection.The proposed method applies statistical association rules to find patterns relating low-levelimage features to high-level knowledge about the images; and it uses the patterns mined todetermine the weight of the features. The feature weighting through the statisticalassociation rules reduces the semantic gap that exists between low-level features and thehigh-level user interpretation of images; improving the precision of the content-basedqueries. Moreover; the proposed method performs dimensionality reduction of image …,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2008. CBMS'08. 21st IEEE International Symposium on,2008,8
An efficient framework for similarity query optimization,Mônica RP Ferreira; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract The increasing volume of multimedia data stored in relational databasemanagement systems (RDBMS) demands efficient ways to process similarity queries.Therefore; the query processor should provide mechanisms to express similarity queries; tointerpret and translate them into equivalent expression in relational algebra; to evaluatealternative query plans and finally to execute the queries using the best plan found. In thispaper; we present an effective framework to interpret; translate; select the best plan andefficiently execute similarity queries over data indexed by metric access methods.Experimental evaluation of the framework shows a reduction of up to 20% in the total timerequired to answer similarity queries.,Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2007,8

Classification abstraction: An intrinsic element in database systems,Elaine P Machado; Caetano Traina; Myrian RB Araujo,Abstract The Classification Abstraction is a fundamental concept supporting the existence ofdatabase systems. However; it has been seldom supported as a database modelingelement. This paper presents a technic to support classification as a semantic constructor;enabling its representation in target modeling. It is also shown that this concept can unify thecommands for data definition and data manipulation in query languages; thus generatingtight environments including the data model; the database management system and thesoftware design techniques. Through classification; object types and object instances can betreated in a uniform manner; allowing the unification of concepts and commands.

Endowing a content-based medical image retrieval system with perceptual similarity using ensemble strategy,Marcos Vinicius Naves Bedo; Davi Pereira dos Santos; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Paulo Mazzoncini de Azevedo-Marques; Caetano Traina,Abstract Content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) is a powerful resource to improvedifferential computer-aided diagnosis. The major problem with CBMIR applications is thesemantic gap; a situation in which the system does not follow the users' sense of similarity.This gap can be bridged by the adequate modeling of similarity queries; which ultimatelydepends on the combination of feature extractor methods and distance functions. In thisstudy; such combinations are referred to as perceptual parameters; as they impact on howimages are compared. In a CBMIR; the perceptual parameters must be manually set by theusers; which imposes a heavy burden on the specialists; otherwise; the system will follow apredefined sense of similarity.

In this scenario; we introduce a twofoldmethodology; we use a hierarchical graph representation to efficiently model the databaserelationships and; on top of it; we designed a visualization technique for rapidly relationalexploration. Our results demonstrate that the exploration of databases is deeply simplified asthe user is able to visually browse the data with little or no knowledge about its structure;dismissing the need for complex SQL queries.

Easing the dimensionality curse by stretching metric spaces,Ives RV Pola; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Queries over sets of complex elements are performed extracting features from eachelement; which are used in place of the real ones during the processing. Extracting a largenumber of significant features increases the representative power of the feature vector andimproves the query precision. However; each feature is a dimension in the representationspace; consequently handling more features worsen the dimensionality curse. The problemderives from the fact that the elements tends to distribute all over the space and a largedimensionality allows them to spread over much broader spaces. Therefore; in high-dimensional spaces; elements are frequently farther from each other; so the distancedifferences among pairs of elements tends to homogenize.

The volume of multimedia and complex data (images; videos; audio; time series;DNA sequences; and others) has been growing at a very fast pace. Thus; it is necessary tostore in databases many types of data which are not naturally handled by DatabaseManagement Systems (DBMSs). Complex data are well-suited to be queried by similarity.Many works addressed techniques for similarity searching; but the majority of them are notconceived to be integrated into a database engine.

Ourmain contribution is the proposal of the MHF-DHA algorithm; which is aimed at improving theperformance of drill-down and roll-up queries by horizontally fragmenting data warehousesorganized in different levels of aggregation. Besides allowing that multiple dimensions beused as a basis for the fragmentation; the algorithm also explores the hierarchical structureof these dimensions.

Distance functions usuallyrely on a set of features extracted from each image through a set of image processingalgorithms called feature extractors. Before extracting features; other image processingalgorithms are usually employed to pre-process each image; preparing it for the extractors.Usually there are several criteria that can be considered when measuring how much twoimages are similar. Therefore; to compare images in current CBIR environments one mustdefine (1) the criteria;(2) the image pre-processing needed before the extractors can be …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on applied computing,2005,7

We have used Principal ComponentAnalysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis to correlate sugarcane cultivated land withmultitemporal NDVI images also verifying the influence of climate conditions to them.According to both techniques (PCA and clustering); clusters for different set of variables aredistinct only when cultivated land was included in the dataset.

Improving content-based retrieval of medical images through dynamic distance on relevance feedback,Pedro H Bugatti; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Content-based image retrieval approaches rely on automatic features extracted from imagesto perform similarity queries. The major drawback is that such features often do notsatisfactorily represent what the users understand and expect from them; eg when searchingfor similar images. In order to deal with the gap between the user semantic interpretation ofthe images and what the system can automatically provide; relevance feedback techniqueshave been employed. However; it has been used without prior analysis about the distancefunction that best suits the user intention in each relevance feedback cycle and leading tothe increase of such gap. Hence; in the present paper we employ user profiling inconjunction to content-based image retrieval and relevance feedback techniques to exploitthe user intentions and to reach the best configuration according to the user intention in …,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2011 24th International Symposium on,2011,6

Including conditional operators in content-based image retrieval in large sets of medical exams,C Traina; AJM Trains; JM de Figuciredo,Content-based image retrieval systems (CBIR) aim at helping in searching large imagecollections to find those more likely to answer query conditions based on the informationrepresented in the images. To speed up the search process; selected features are extractedfrom each image when they are stored in the database; so each one is represented by afeature vector. Subsequent image searching operations are performed using the featurevectors in place of the images. The feature extraction algorithms have important issues inCBIR due to the large semantic gap between the low-level features extracted as comparedto the high-level; semantic; results expected by the users. A way to approach a semanticanalysis of an image; as performed by humans; is to employ a large number of analyzerswhose results are processed by a set of rules based on if-then clauses.

Use of a semantically grained database system for distribution and control within design environments,Caetano Traina; João Eduardo Ferreira; Mauro Biajiz,Abstract This paper presents a technique to share the data stored in an object-orienteddatabase aimed at designing environments. This technique shares data between tworelated databases; called the Original and Product databases; and is composed of threeprocesses: data separation; evolution and integration. Whenever a block of data needs to beshared; it is spread into both databases; resulting in a block on the original database; andanother into the Product database; with special links between them controlled by the ObjectManager. These blocks do not need to be maintained identical during the evolution phase ofthe sharing process. Six types of links were defined. and by choosing one; the designercontrol the evolution and reintegration of the block in both databases. This process uses thecomposite object concept as the unit of control. The presented concepts can be applied to …,European Conference on Parallel Processing,1997,6
Improving the pruning ability of dynamic metric access methods with local additional pivots and anticipation of information,Paulo H Oliveira; Caetano Traina; Daniel S Kaster,Abstract Metric Access Methods (MAMs) have been proved to allow performing similarityqueries over complex data more efficiently than other access methods. They can beconsidered dynamic or static depending on the pivot type used in their construction. Globalpivots tend to compromise the dynamicity of MAMs; as eventual pivot-related updates mustbe propagated through the entire structure; while local pivots allow this maintenance tooccur locally. Several applications handle online complex data and; consequently; demandefficient dynamic indexes to be successful. In this context; this work presents two techniquesfor improving the pruning ability of dynamic MAMs:(i) using cutting local additional pivots toreduce distance calculations and (ii) anticipating information from child nodes to reduceunnecessary disk accesses. The experiments reveal significant improvements in a …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2015,5
Vertebral body segmentation of spine MR images using superpixels,Paulo Duarte Barbieri; Glauco Vitor Pedrosa; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Marcello Henrique Nogueira-Barbosa,This paper presents a segmentation approach guided by the user for extracting the vertebralbodies of spine from MRI. The proposed approach; called VBSeg; takes advantage of superpixels to reduce the image complexity and then making easy the detection of each vertebralbody contour. Super pixels adapt themselves to the image structures; once their formationlaw follows the homogeneity of the image regions. However; for some diseases orabnormalities; the boundary of each super pixel does not fit well in the vertebra contour. Toavoid this drawback; we propose to use the Otsu's method as a possegmentation step todivide the super pixels into smaller ones. The final segmentation is obtained through aregion growing approach using points manually selected by the specialist. It can producemasks of the five lumbar vertebrae with an average precision of 80% and recall of 87 …,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2015 IEEE 28th International Symposium on,2015,5

A statistical associative classifier with automatic estimation of parameters on computer aided diagnosis,Carolina YV Watanabe; Marcela Xavier Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; C Traina,In this paper; we proposed a classifier based on statistical association rules that avoids thediscretization step and automatically estimates the input thresholds. The algorithmautomatically selects the most significant features to produce rules. These rules are simple;including the selected features; a single interval in the antecedent of the rule and a labelclass in the consequent; and getting at most twice the number of rules features. To evaluateour method; we compare it with traditional classifiers as C4. 5 and Adaboost; in the task ofclassifying benign or malign masses of mammograms; usingtwo different real datasets. Theproposed method achieve the best results regarding accuracy; sensitivity and sensibility.,Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA); 2012 11th International Conference on,2012,5
A new feature descriptor derived from Hilbert space-filling curve to assist breast cancer classification,Denise Guliato; Walter Alexandre A de Oliveira; Caetano Traina,Malignant breast tumors and benign masses appear in mammograms with different shapecharacteristics: the former usually have rough; spiculated; or microlobulated contours;whereas the latter commonly have smooth; round; oval; or macrolobulated contours. Visualfeatures that characterize shape roughness can assist in distinguishing between malignanttumors and benign masses in mammo-grams. Here we propose a new approach based onHilbert curves to classify breast masses as benign or malignant. The feature extraction isperformed in linear time; and is amenable to parallel processing; whereas the classificationphase can be performed by a classical neural networks structure. We evaluated our methodusing a set of 111 contours from 65 benign masses and 46 malignant tumors. As theexperimental evaluations show; we achieved an accuracy of 0.99 in terms of the area …,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2010 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on,2010,5
Time-aware similarity search: a metric-temporal representation for complex data,Renato Bueno; Daniel S Kaster; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Recent advances in information technology demand handling complex data types;such as images; video; audio; time series and genetic sequences. Distinctly from traditionaldata (such as numbers; short strings and dates); complex data do not possess the totalordering property; yielding relational comparison operators useless. Even equalitycomparisons are of little help; as it is very unlikely to have two complex elements exactlyequal. Therefore; the similarity among elements has emerged as the most important propertyfor comparisons in such domains; leading to the growing relevance of metric spaces to datasearch. Regardless of the data domain properties; the systems need to track evolution ofdata over time. When handling multidimensional data; temporal information is commonlytreated as just one or more dimensions. However; metric data do not have the concept of …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,5
A new approach for optimization of dynamic metric access methods using an algorithm of effective deletion,Renato Bueno; Daniel dos Santos Kaster; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract The existing Metric Access Methods (MAM) assume the data elements representimmutable objects. However; many applications must handle complex data evolving overtime. Health care; weather monitoring; and other applications require removing or updatingelements. Most of the MAM presented in the literature either do not have the deletionoperation described; or it is performed just marking the element as deleted withouteffectively removing it from the structure. In this paper we describe an algorithm thateffectively removes any element from a metric tree. While maintaining the height-balancingof the structure; the proposed deletion algorithm uses mechanisms to enforce a reducednumber of pages in the tree; improving the query performance. Based on the deletionalgorithm; we propose a new way to optimize a MAM; which we call the Push-pull …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,5

Sampling is an useful technique to support manager a more sensible volume in thedata reduction process. Uniform sampling has been widely used but; in datasets exhibitingskewed cluster distribution; biased sampling shows better results.

Bulk-loading Dynamic Metric Access Methods.,Thiago Galbiatti Vespa; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract. The main contribution of this paper is a bulk-loading algorithm for multi-waydynamic metric access methods based on the covering radius of a representative; like theSlim-tree. The proposed algorithm is sample-based; and it builds a height-balanced tree in atop-down fashion; using the metric domain's distance function and a bound limit to groupand determine the number of elements in each partition of the dataset at each step of thealgorithm. Experiments performed to drill its performance shows that our bulk-loadingmethod is up to 6 times faster to build a tree than the sequential insertion method regardingconstruction time; and that it improves the search performance too.,SBBD,2007,5

Vote-and-comment: modeling the coevolution of user interactions in social voting web sites,Alceu Ferraz Costa; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina; Christos Faloutsos,In social voting Web sites; how do the user actions-up-votes; down-votes and comments-evolve over time? Are there relationships between votes and comments? What is normaland what is suspicious? These are the questions we focus on. We analyzed over 20;000submissions corresponding to more than 100 million user interactions from three socialvoting Web sites: Reddit; Imgur and Digg. Our first contribution is two discoveries:(i) thenumber of comments grows as a power-law on the number of votes and (ii) the time betweena submission creation and a user's reaction obeys a log-logistic distribution.

Nearest neighbor queries with counting aggregate-based conditions,Daniel S Kaster; Willian D Oliveira; Renato Bueno; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract The amount of complex data; such as images; videos and time series; has beenincreasing in the past few years in a very fast pace. The main property employed to querysuch kind of data based on its content is the similarity between elements. One of the mostcommon similarity queries is the k-Nearest Neighbor query (k-NNq); which returns the kelements most similar to a given reference element. Although this kind of query is useful formany applications; it does not consider additional conditions that may modify the basicnearest neighbor search; which would allow retrieving more relevant information to the user.Complex data are usually associated with other information and usually have metadatadescribing the data content and/or context. Such external (non-content-based) informationcan be employed to define the conditions modifying the k-NN search to answer advanced …,Journal of Information and Data Management,2011,4

Based on the knowledge mined; eachquery posed is rewritten in order to better meet the user expectations. We propose anextension of SQL aimed at exploring mining processes over complex data; generatingassociation rules that extract semantic information from the textual description superimposedto the extracted features; thereafter using them to rewrite the queries. As a result; the systemobtains results closer to the user expectation than it could using only the traditional; plainsimilarity query execution.,Journal of Information and Data Management,2010,4

SID: Calculating the intrinsic dimension of data streams,Elaine PM de Sousa; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,ABSTRACT Data streams are fundamental in several data processing applications involvinglarge amount of data generated continuously as a sequence of events. Usually; such eventsare transient and do not need to be stored on disk; so the data are analyzed as they areobtained and discarded right away. In the majority of applications; all the events of a datastream have a fixed number of attributes; so events are elements from a dimensionaldomain. As in any dimensional dataset; the data stream can be characterized by an intrinsicdimensionality; which is usually lower than its embedded dimensionality and that affects theperformance of algorithms used to handle the data. Therefore; it is relevant to measure theintrinsic dimensionality of this type of data. In this paper we present the first ever publishedalgorithm able to measure the intrinsic dimension of datasets on the fly; following the …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2006,4

Our approach proposes an innovative and interactive systematization thatcan augment the potential for data presentation by utilizing multiple views. These multiplepresentation views are kept linked according to the analytical decisions took by the user andare tracked in a tree-like structure. Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerfulsystem that helps the user to browse the information and to make decisions based both onoverview and on detailed perspectives of the data under analysis.

Therefore; when comparingmultimedia data; the comparison computations usually consider some properties extractedfrom the data elements. In this way; exact queries involving this kind of data return data thatis exact regarding the properties compared; but not necessarily exact regarding themultimedia data itself.

Visually Mining on Multiple Relational Tables at Once.,Maria Camila Nardini Barioni; Humberto Luiz Razente; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract. Data mining (DM) processes require data to be supplied in only one table or datafile. Therefore; data stored in multiple relations of relational databases must be joined beforesubmission to DM analysis. A problem faced during this preparation step is that; most of thetimes; the analyst does not have a clear idea of what portions of data should be mined. Thispaper reckons the strong human ability to interpret data in graphical format to develop aprocess called “wagging”; to visualize data from multiple relations; helping the analyst whenpreparing data to DM. The data obtained from the wagging process allow to execute furtherprocesses as if they were operating over multiple relations; bringing the join operations tobecome part of the data mining process.

Efficient execution of conjunctive complex queries on big multimedia databases,Karina Fasolin; Renato Fileto; Marcelo Krugery; Daniel S Kaster; Monica RP Ferreira; Robson LF Cordeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,This paper proposes an approach to efficiently execute conjunctive queries on big complexdata together with their related conventional data. The basic idea is to horizontally fragmentthe database according to criteria frequently used in query predicates. The collection offragments is indexed to efficiently find the fragment (s) whose contents satisfy some querypredicate (s). The contents of each fragment are then indexed as well; to support efficientfiltering of the fragment data according to other query predicate (s) conjunctively connectedto the former. This strategy has been applied to a collection of more than 106 million imagestogether with their related conventional data. Experimental results show considerableperformance gain of the proposed approach for queries with conventional and similarity-based predicates; compared to the use of a unique metric index for the entire database …,Multimedia (ISM); 2013 IEEE International Symposium on,2013,3
A new concept of sets to handle similarity in databases: the simsets,Ives RV Pola; Robson LF Cordeiro; Caetano Traina; Agma JM Traina,Abstract Traditional DBMS are heavily dependent on the concept that a set never includesthe same element twice. On the other hand; modern applications require dealing withcomplex data; such as images; videos and genetic sequences; in which exact match of twoelements seldom occurs and; generally; is meaningless. Thus; it makes sense that sets ofcomplex data should not include two elements that are “too similar”. How to create a conceptequivalent to “sets” for complex data? And how to design novel algorithms that allow it to benaturally embedded in existing DBMS? These are the issues that we tackle in this paper;through the concept of “similarity sets”; or SimSets for short. Several scenarios may benefitfrom our SimSets. A typical example appears in sensor networks; in which SimSets canidentify sensors recurrently reporting similar measurements; aimed at turning some of …,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2013,3

It employs Gabor filters; thus; the k-Gabor method canquantify texture information from specific regions; tissues and internal structures of theimages providing a succint representation for a richer image analysis. The feature vectorsgenerated describe the images more precisely than other methods from the literature; asshown in the experiments.

Using visual analysis to weight multiple signatures to discriminate complex data,Renato Bueno; Daniel S Kaster; Humberto L Razente; Maria Camila N Barioni; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Complex data is usually represented through signatures; which are sets of featuresdescribing the data content. Several kinds of complex data allow extracting differentsignatures from an object; representing complementary data characteristics. However; thereis no ground truth of how balancing these signatures to reach an ideal similarity distribution.It depends on the analyst intent; that is; according to the job he/she is performing; a fewsignatures should have more impact in the data distribution than others. This work presentsa new technique; called Visual Signature Weighting (ViSW); which allows interactivelyanalyzing the impact of each signature in the similarity of complex data represented throughmultiple signatures. Our method provides means to explore the tradeoff of prioritizingsignatures over the others; by dynamically changing their weight relation.

Integrating user preference to similarity queries over medical images datasets,Mônica RP Ferreira; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Sandra De Amo; Fabíola SF Pereira; Richard Chbeir,Large amounts of images from medical exams are being stored in databases; so developingretrieval techniques is an important research problem. Retrieval based on the image visualcontent is usually better than using textual descriptions; as they seldom gives every nuancesthat the user may be interested in. Content-based image retrieval employs the similarityamong images for retrieval. However; similarity is evaluated using numeric methods; andthey often orders the images by similarity in a way rather distinct from the user's intention. Inthis paper; we propose a technique to allow expressing the user's preference over attributesassociated to the images; so similarity queries can be refined by preference rules.Experiments performed over a dataset with computed tomography lung images shows thatcorrectly expressing the user's preferences; the similarity query precision can increase …,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2010 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on,2010,3

Improving cbir using feature extraction based on wavelet transform,Carolina W Silva; Pedro H Bugatti; Marcela X Ribeiro; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract The" gap semantic" and the" curse of dimensionality" are two shortcomings ofcontent-based image retrieval techniques that rely on automatic feature extracted fromimages to process similarity queries. The first one represents the semantic gap that existsbetween low-level features automatically extracted by a computational system; and the high-level user interpretation of images. The second one involves problems occurring whensimilarity is defined over high-dimensional feature spaces. This paper shows a method thatdeals with these both shortcomings. We use discrete wavelet transforms to obtain the imagerepresentation from a multiresolution point of view. The feature vectors were composed ofthe features from the approximation subspace; which succinctly represent the images in theprocessing of similarity queries.

Boosting k-nearest neighbor queries estimating suitable query radii,Marcos R Vieira; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina; Adriano Arantes; Christos Faloutsos,This paper proposes novel and effective techniques to estimate a radius to answer k-nearestneighbor queries. The first technique targets datasets where it is possible to learn thedistribution about the pairwise distances between the elements; generating a globalestimation that applies to the whole dataset. The second technique targets datasets wherethe first technique cannot be employed; generating estimations that depend on where thequery center is located. The proposed k-NNF () algorithm combines both techniques;achieving remarkable speedups. Experiments performed on both real and synthetic datasetshave shown that the proposed algorithm can accelerate k-NN queries more than 26 timescompared with the incremental algorithm and spends half of the total time compared with thetraditional k-NN () algorithms.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007.

Constrained Aggregate Similarity Queries in Metric Spaces.,Humberto Luiz Razente; Maria Camila Nardini Barioni; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. The optimization of similarity queries using metric access methods has been widelydiscussed in the last decades. Similarity queries consider one object as the query center;and retrieve objects that are either far up to a radius or the nearest ones. Another importantretrieval operation; less studied so far; is the Aggregate Similarity Query; which retrievesobjects with the smallest aggregate distances to a set of query centers. This paper presentsthe definition of Circumscription-Constrained Aggregate Similarity Queries; discussesperformance issues involved; and proposes an optimization based on the triangle inequalityto reduce the number of distance calculations and disk accesses needed to answer thequeries.,SBBD,2007,3
Perceptual distance functions for similarity retrieval of medical images,Joaquim Cezar Felipe; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract A challenge already opened for a long time concerning Content-based ImageRetrieval (CBIR) systems is how to define a suitable distance function to measure thesimilarity between images regarding an application context; which complies with the humanspecialist perception of similarity. In this paper; we present a new family of distancefunctions; namely; Attribute Interaction Influence Distances (AID); aiming at retrieving imagesby similarity. Such measures address an important aspect of psychophysical comparisonbetween images: the effect in the interaction on the variations of the image features. The AIDfunctions allow comparing feature vectors using two parameterized expressions: onetargeting weak feature interaction; and another for strong interaction.

Tracking the intrinsic dimension of evolving data streams to update association rules,Elaine PM De Sousa; Marcela X Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. Data streams can change their behavior over time and; when a significant changeoccurs; the rules governing the attributes reported by each event can also change.Moreover; data streams can be composed of events from several classes; and the rulesgoverning the events of each class can also change depending on actual properties of thedata. In this paper we propose a new technique to continuously identify which are the mostrelevant attributes to characterize each class; based on the general properties exhibited bythe data stream as it evolves over time.,*,2006,3

Efficient algorithms to execute complex similarity queries in RDBMS,Adriano S Arantes; Marcos R Vieira; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,ABSTRACT Search operations in large sets of complex objects usually rely on similarity-based criteria; due to the lack of other general properties that could be used to compare theobjects; such as the total order relationship; or even the equality relationship between pairsof objects; commonly used with data in numeric or short texts domains. Therefore; similaritybetween objects is the core criterion to compare complex objects. There are two basicoperators for similarity queries: Range Query and k-Nearest Neighbors Query. Muchresearch has been done to develop effective algorithms to implement them as standaloneoperations. However; algorithms to support these operators as parts of more complexexpressions involving their composition were not developed yet.

Aumento da Eficiência das Estruturas de Indexação Métricas com Uso de Conceitos da Lógica Nebulosa.,Claudio Haruo Yamamoto; Mauro Biajiz; Caetano Traina Jr; Av do Trabalhador Sãocarlense; Centro–São Carlos–SP–Brasil,Abstract The retrieval of complex data eg image; audio; video; genomic sequences etc. inDatabase Management Systems (DBMSs) has been in the focus of the academic communityand of DBMSs developers. The most promising technique is the content-based search; inwhich a set of descriptors with high discrimination power is extracted from each dataelement; and a feature vector is obtained and used to index the data to fasten the searchoperations. The feature vectors are data in high dimensional spatial domains or metricdomains; and its indexing requires the use of appropriate indexing structures. The mostpromising structures are the ones for metric domains; eg the M-tree; the Slim-tree; the OMNI-Family and the DF-tree.

Efficiently Indexing Multiple Repositories of Medical Image Databases,Paulo H Oliveira; Lucas C Scabora; Mirela T Cazzolato; Willian D Oliveira; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract—Performing content-based image retrieval over large repositories of medicalimages demands efficient computational techniques. The use of such techniques is intendedto speed up the work of physicians; who often have to deal with information from multipledata repositories. When dealing with multiple data repositories; the common computationalapproach is to search each repository separately and merge the multiple results into onefinal response; which slows down the whole process. This can be improved if we build amechanism able to search several repositories as if they were a single one; ie a mechanismto search the whole domain of medical images. Aiming at this goal; we propose the DomainIndex; a new category of index structures aimed at efficiently searching domains of data;regardless of the repository to which they belong.

A label-scaled similarity measure for content-based image retrieval,Gustavo Blanco; Marcos VN Bedo; Mirela T Cazzolato; Lucio FD Santos; Ana Elisa Serafim Jorge; Caetano Traina; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques; Agma JM Traina,Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) has proven to be a suitable complement totraditional text-based searching. CBIR applications rely on two main steps; namely therepresentation of the images; and the similarity measuring between two representedimages.

Fire detection on unconstrained videos using color-aware spatial modeling and motion flow,Letricia PS Avalhais; Jose Rodrigues; Agma JM Traina,The semantic segmentation of events on emergency contexts involves the identification ofpreviously defined events of interest. In this work; the focused semantic event is thepresence of fire in videos. The literature presents several methods for automatic video firedetection; but these methods were built under assumptions; such as stationary cameras andcontrolled lightening conditions that are often in contrast to the videos acquired by hand-held devices. To fulfill this gap; we propose a fire detection method; called SPATFIRE. Ourmethod innovates on three aspects:(1) it relies on a specifically tailored color model namedFire-like Pixel Detector able to improve the accuracy of fire detection;(2) it employs a newtechnique for motion compensation; diminishing the problems observed in videos capturedwith non-stationary cameras; and;(3) it defines a segmentation method able to identify …,Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI); 2016 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2016,2

However; the gathered records quickly become too similaramong themselves and handling several similar reports does not add valuable knowledgeto assist the helping personnel at the control center in their decision making tasks.

Similarity joins and beyond: an extended set of binary operators with order,Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Lucio FD Santos; Willian D Oliveira; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Similarity joins are troublesome database operators that often produce results muchlarger than the user really needs or expects. In order to return the similar elements; similarityjoins also require sorting during the retrieval process; although order is a concept notsupported in the relational model. This paper proposes a solution to solve those two issuesextending the similarity join concept to a broader set of binary operators; which aims atretrieving the most similar pairs and embedding the sorting operation only as an internalprocessing step; so as to comply with the relational theory. Additionally; our extension allowsto explore another useful condition not previously considered in the similarity retrieval: thenegation of predicates.

Compact and discriminative approach for encoding spatial-relationship of visual words,Glauco V Pedrosa; Agma JM Traina,Abstract The Bag-of-Visual-Words approach has been successfully used for video andimage analysis by encoding local features as visual words; and the final representation is ahistogram of the visual words detected in the image. One limitation of this approach relies onits inability of encoding spatial distribution of the visual words within an image; which isimportant for similarity measurement between images. In this paper; we present a noveltechnique to incorporate spatial information; called Global Spatial Arrangement (GSA). Theidea is to split the image space into quadrants using each detected point as origin. Toensure rotation invariance; we use the information of the gradient of each detected point todefine each quarter of the quadrant.

As thecomplexity of the data types handled by modern applications keeps growing; searching bysimilarity becomes increasingly interesting; that makes the Metric Space Theory as thetheoretical base to build the structures employed to index complex data. Also; as the mainmemory capacity grows and the price decreases; increasingly larger databases can becompletely indexed in the main-memory. Thus; more and more applications require the database management systems to quickly build indexes that can take advantage of memory-based indexes.

Using sub-dictionaries for image representation based on the bag-of-visual-words approach,Glauco Vitor Pedrosa; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) is a well known approach to represent images for visualrecognition and retrieval tasks. This approach represents an image as a histogram of visualwords and the dissimilarity between two images is measured by comparing thosehistograms. When performing comparisons involving a specific type of images; some visualwords can be more informative and discriminative than others. To take advantage of this fact;assigning appropriate weights can improve the performance of image retrieval. In this paper;we developed a novel modeling approach based on sub dictionaries. We extracted a sub-dictionary as a subset of visual words that best represents a specific image class.

However; this modeling approach does not take into consideration the spatialrelationships of these words; which is important for similarity measurement between images.We have developed a novel technique to incorporate spatial information of visual wordsbased on the n-grams representation. The method encodes regional layout with a 2-gramrepresentation in the local keypoint neighborhood. The region is divided in two zones tocapture the relative orientations of pair-wise visual words. In turn; each image is describedby an accumulated vector of 2-grams. Then; we compute the Shannon entropy over arandom “bunch” of 2-grams to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector.

Similarity queries have beenacknowledged as one of the most useful resources to retrieve complex data; but the basicsimilarity operators are not enough to meet the requirements of the applications; largelybecause their result sets tend to include many elements too similar to the query center andamong themselves. To tackle this problem; variations and extensions of basic operatorshave been studied pursuing result diversification; ie; to search for elements sufficientlysimilar to the query center; but also diverse from each other. Result diversification has beenstudied considering either extra information related to the data or the distance among resultset elements.

Many works have been proposed to perform economic series forecasting; however; itstill is a hard endeavor to develop a general model that is able to handle the chaotic natureof the markets. Artificial intelligence methods such as artificial neural networks and supportvector machines arose as promising alternatives; but they hide the processing semantics;limiting the result interpretation. In addition; one of the main drawbacks of the existingsolutions is that they usually cannot be easily employed as building blocks of new analysistools.

Feature space optimization for content-based image retrieval,Letricia PS Avalhais; Sergio F Da Silva; Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Substantial benefits can be gained from effective Relevance Feedback techniquesin content-based image retrieval. However; existing techniques are limited due tocomputational cost and/or by being restricted to linear transformations on the data. In thisstudy we analyze the role of nonlinear transformations in relevance feedback. We presenttwo promising Relevance Feedback methods based on Genetic Algorithms used to enhancethe performance on the task of image retrieval according to the user's interests. The firstmethod adjusts the dissimilarity function by using weighting functions while the secondmethod redefines the features space by means of linear and nonlinear transformationfunctions.

The Similarity Cloud Model: A novel and efficient hippocampus segmentation technique,Fredy EC Athó; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Paula RB Diniz,This work presents a new segmentation model called Similarity Cloud Model (SCM) basedon hippocampus feature extraction. The segmentation process is divided in two mainoperations: localization by similarity and cloud adjustment. The first process uses the cloudto localize the most probable position of the hippocampus in a target volume. Segmentationis completed by a reformulation of the cloud to correct the final labeling; based on a newcomputation of arc-weights. This method has been tested in an entire dataset of 235 MRIcombining healthy and epileptic patients. Results indicate superior quality segmentation incomparison with similar graph and bayesian-based models.,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2011 24th International Symposium on,2011,2
Integrating user profile in medical CBIR systems to answer perceptual similarity queries,Pedro H Bugatti; Daniel S Kaster; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Techniques for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) have been intensively explored dueto the increase in the amount of captured images and the need of fast retrieval of them. Themedical field is a specific example that generates a large flow of information; especiallydigital images employed for diagnosing. One issue that still remains unsolved deals withhow to reach the perceptual similarity. That is; to achieve an effective retrieval; one mustcharacterize and quantify the perceptual similarity regarding the specialist in the field.Therefore; the present paper was conceived to fill in this gap creating a consistent support toperform similarity queries over medical images; maintaining the semantics of a given querydesired by the user. CBIR systems relying in relevance feedback techniques usually requestthe users to label relevant images.

Issues and techniques to mitigate the performance gap in content-based image retrieval systems,Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Robson Cordeiro; Marcela Ribeiro; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques,Abstract This chapter discusses key aspects concerning the performance of Content-basedImage Retrieval (CBIR) systems. The so-called performance gap plays an important roleregarding the acceptability of CBIR systems by the users. It provides a timely answer to theactual demand for computational support from CBIR systems that provide similarity queriesprocessing. Focusing on the performance gap; this chapter explains and discusses the mainproblems currently under investigation: the use of many features to represent images; thelack of appropriate indexing structures to retrieve images and features; deficient query plansemployed to execute similarity queries; and the poor quality of results obtained by the CBIRsystem. We discuss how to overcome these problems; introducing techniques such as howto employ feature selection techniques to beat the “dimensionality curse” and how to use …,*,2011,2

Sugar cane is one of the most important crops for the Brazilian economy; especiallybecause it is the main source for ethanol production; replacing fossil fuels. The recentdevelopment of bi-fuel engines has further increased demand for ethanol; which is one ofthe most important derivatives of sugar cane. Recently; remote sensing imagery has beenwidely used to monitor sugar cane harvests and to support scientific research. However; withthe advancement of remote sensing technology; large amounts of data have beengenerated and therefore the analysis and discovery of useful knowledge from these datahave became essential tasks to assist research works. In this context; this paper proposes amethodology based on data clustering to analyze NDVI time series in order to monitor thegrowing cycles of sugar cane crops throughout the year.

Improving medical image retrieval through multi-descriptor similarity functions and association rules,Renato Bueno; Marcela X Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems still face the problem of low precision ofsystem results. To improve the precision of such systems; many image visual extractors havebeen developed and employed to represent the images. However; the usage of a largenumber of extractors and consequently; a large number of features; leads to the“dimensionality curse”; where the retrieval performance and the query accuracy diminish. Inthis paper; we propose a new method; called Statistical Fractal-scaled Product Metric(SFPM); to maximize the accuracy of CBIR systems and speedup similarity queries. TheSFPM method combines association rule mining and the Fractal-scaled Product Metric(FPM)[4]; to determine a reduced set of features and appropriate scale factors in multi-descriptor image similarity assessment.

Silhouette-based feature selection for classification of medical images,Sergio F da Silva; Bruno Brandoli; Danilo Medeiros Eler; João Batista Neto; Agma JM Traina,Classification is an important task for computer-aided diagnosis systems (CADs). However;many classifiers may not perform well; presenting poor generalization and highcomputational cost; especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. Thus; featureselection can greatly mitigate these problems. In this paper; we propose two filter-basedfeature selection algorithms that calculate the simplified silhouette statistic as evaluationfunction: the silhouette-based greedy search (SiGS) and the silhouette-based geneticalgorithm search (SiGAS). Silhouette statistic is used to guide the search for features thatprovide better class separability. Experiments performed on three datasets have shown thatthe SiGAS algorithm overcomes traditional filter algorithms; such as CFS; FCBF and reliefF.It also outperforms a similar algorithm; kNNGAS; based on genetic algorithm that …,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2010 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on,2010,2
Metric data analysis enhanced through temporal visualization,Renato Bueno; Humberto L Razente; Daniel S Kaster; Maria Camila N Barioni; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,The human vision can naturally interpret data in spaces of 2 or 3 dimensions. When data isin higher dimensional spaces; in most cases the visualization is not intuitive. Regardingmetric spaces; the interpretation is even harder; since they often do not have a direct spatialrepresentation. However; the need to analyze how metric-represented data evolve over timeis pretty common when one needs to understand several phenomena and in decisionmaking processes; as it occurs in medical and agrometeorological applications. This paperpresents three interactive techniques to visualize metric data that vary over time. Each onefocus on a different way to interpret the temporal information. The first technique shows dataevolving in a timeline axis. The second overlaps evolving snapshots of the space showinghow the space varies regarding time.

Although there exist different image processing techniques that can be used todiscover knowledge from satellite images of coffee crops; there are still many issues to beaddressed. One of them is that automatic image classification techniques usually haveproblems to recognize patterns from images of coffee crops; due to their spatial variabilityand planting characteristics. In this context; we present a comparison of two differentmethods for the task of classifying a Geoye-1 image of coffee fields from the South of thestate of Minas Gerais; in Brazil. The compared methods are: QMAS; a new algorithm forimage classification; and MAXVER; a traditional method commonly used by agronomists toclassify satellite images.

A new method to efficiently reduce histogram dimensionality,Pedro H Bugatti; Agma JM Traina; Joaquim C Felipe; Caetano Traina,A challenge in Computer-Aided Diagnosis based on image exams is to provide a timelyanswer that complies to the specialist's expectation. In many situations; when a specialistgets a new image to analyze; having information and knowledge from similar cases can bevery helpful. For example; when a radiologist evaluates a new image; it is common to recallsimilar cases from the past. However; when performing similarity queries to retrieve similarcases; the approach frequently adopted is to extract meaningful features from the imagesand searching the database based on such features. One of the most popular image featureis the gray-level histogram; because it is simple and fast to obtain; providing the global gray-level distribution of the image. Moreover; normalized histograms are also invariant to affinetransformations on the image.

Although database management systems supply basic tools to data recovery andanalysis through standard transactions in large amounts of data; the analysis of these datain high dimensional spaces is an overwhelming job. On the other hand; human beings havea great capacity to quickly absorb and understand information presented in graphical form.As data clustering is one of the key techniques in the KDD process; this work aims to use thehuman visual perception to help in the iterative clustering analysis done by the k-medoid-based algorithms. Our technique takes advantages of the interpretation obtained from theuser; through his interaction with the presented visualizations; and allows subsequent dataanalysis tasks to use these results automatically.,3rd ADBIS Workshop on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery—ADMKD,2007,2

Seleção de atributos relevantes para busca por similaridade e classificação de imagens médicas,Marcela X Ribeiro; Joaquim C Felipe; Agma JM Traina,Abstract This paper presents a new method to identify relevant features to discriminateimages into categories. Shape features of a set of medical images are represented byZernike moments. MinERA (Minerador Estátistico de Regras de Associação) is a newalgorithm that identifies the most relevant features to discriminate images into categories(benign and malignant tumours; for instance); through mining association rules. Thealgorithm uses statistical measures that describe the behaviour of the attributes; consideringthe image categories; in order to find rules of interest. An experiment with images of tumoralmasses of mammograms compares the accuracy of MinERA and C4. 5 algorithms todetermine a set of relevant Zernike moments; capable to classify the images into benign andmalignant. The results show that MinERA reaches a higher precision to perform this task.,I Workshop de Visão Computacional,2005,2

The architecture is exercised by means of a simulation model and real webserver traces are used as workload. Two classes of users are considered with differentpriorities. An algorithm for service differentiation has been implemented in the model and thesimulation results show the architecture can actually provide a differentiated QoS to itsclients even at high loads. The proposed model may be used as a starting point for theconstruction of either a web server software module or a prototype implemented inhardware. This latter case will enable the provision of QoS closer to the communicationinfrastructure with a lower consumption of system resources.

A Tool for Content-Based Image Retrieval in Object-Oriented Databases.,Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina; Rildo R dos Santos; Edna Y Senzako,Abstract Conventional image processing algorithms used to compare images are verytimeconsuming; making them inappropriate for use in searching for an image in a hugecollection of images stored in a database. The usual approach uses icons and textualattributes stored with the images to specify the queries. However; this approach depends onhuman analysis of each image; which reduces the precision to a great extent. This workstates that it is possible to quickly retrieve a set of characteristics from each image as it isbeing stored in the database; building an index structure based on each characteristic; soimages can be retrieved through queries based on the graphic contents of the storedimages. When a search for a specific image becomes necessary; these same characteristicscan be extracted from that image; and the set of indexes can be used to narrow the …,IADT,1998,2

Retrieving 2D shapes by similarity based on bag of salience points,Glauco V Pedrosa; Agma JM Traina; Celia AZ Barcelos,Abstract This paper proposes a novel shape feature description based on salient points;called Bag-of-Salience-Points (BoSP). The proposed descriptor is compact and provides afast solution for finding the correspondences of two set of salient points; contributing tospeed-up the task of shape matching. The novelty of the proposed descriptor lies incombining local sparse features (salient points) encoded in global and spatial-basedhistograms with a few other shape factors like eccentricity. The proposed shape descriptorretrieves the best matching; even in occlusions situations; where points in the two shapescannot be properly matched. The BoSP is validated on several benchmark datasets for 2Dshape matching algorithms; and it is observed that the BoSP maintains superiordiscriminative; while being invariant to geometric transformations as well as demanding a …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2017,1

One index to dominate them all: Domain Indexes for improving queries across multiple tables,Paulo H Oliveira; Lucas C Scabora; Caetano Traina; Daniel S Kaster,Abstract Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) organize data into relations;representing them as tables. Most of queries executed over them are optimized by indexstructures. However; considering queries that require scanning indexes across multipletables; the common approach involves scanning multiple indexes and combining theirresults; which is potentially costly; especially regarding similarity queries over complex data.This paper proposes a new type of index for modern RDBMS called domain index. Suchproposal consists of indexes that allow searching columns of the same type; across multipletables; with a single index scan; hence with superior performance. To evaluate our proposal;we carried out experiments (i) over a medical image dataset; to evaluate the performance incontent-based similarity queries; and (ii) over a flow-based intrusion detection dataset; to …,Proceedings of the Symposium on Applied Computing,2017,1
FOMP: a novel preprocessing technique to speed-up the outlier removal from matched points,Jonathan S Ramos; Carolina YV Watanabey; Agma JM Traina,Image matching plays a major role in many applications; including pattern recognition andbiomedical imaging. It encompasses three steps: 1) interest point selection; 2) featureextraction from each interest point; 3) features point matching. For steps 1 and 2; traditionalinterest point detectors/extractors have worked well. However; for step 3 even a few pointsincorrectly matched (outliers); might lead to an undesirable result. State-of-the-art consensusalgorithms present a high time cost as the number of outlier increases. Aimed at overcomingthis problem; we present FOMP; a novel preprocessing approach; that reduces the amountof outliers in the initial set of matched points by filtering out the vertices that present a higherdifference among their edges in a complete graph representation of the points.

Diversity in similarity joins,Lucio FD Santos; Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Willian D Oliveira; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract With the increasing ability of current applications to produce and consume morecomplex data; such as images and geographic information; the similarity join has attractedconsiderable attention. However; this operator does not consider the relationship among theelements in the answer; generating results with many pairs similar among themselves;which does not add value to the final answer. Result diversification methods are intended toretrieve elements similar enough to satisfy the similarity conditions; but also considering thediversity among the elements in the answer; producing a more heterogeneous result withsmaller cardinality; which improves the meaning of the answer. Still; diversity have beenstudied only when applied to unary operations.

Similarity sets: A new concept of sets to seamlessly handle similarity in database management systems,Ives Rene Venturini Pola; Robson LF Cordeiro; C Traina; Agma JM Traina,Abstract Besides integers and short character strings; current applications require storingphotos; videos; genetic sequences; multidimensional time series; large texts and severalother types of “complex” data elements. Comparing them by equality is a fundamentalconcept for the Relational Model; the data model currently employed in most DatabaseManagement Systems. However; evaluating the equality of complex elements is usuallysenseless; since exact match almost never happens. Instead; it is much more significant toevaluate their similarity. Consequently; the set theoretical concept that a set cannot includethe same element twice also becomes senseless for data “sets” that must be handled bysimilarity; suggesting that a new; equivalent definition must take place for them.

Compact distance histogram: a novel structure to boost k-nearest neighbor queries,Marcos VN Bedo; Daniel S Kaster; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract The k-Nearest Neighbor query (k-NNq) is one of the most useful similarity queries.Elaborated k-NNq algorithms depend on an initial radius to prune regions of the searchspace that cannot contribute to the answer. Therefore; estimating a suitable starting radius isof major importance to accelerate k-NNq execution. This paper presents a new technique toestimate a tight initial radius. Our approach; named CDH-kNN; relies on Compact DistanceHistograms (CDHs); which are pivot-based histograms defined as piecewise linearfunctions. Such structures approximate the distance distribution and are compressedaccording to a given constraint; which can be a desired number of buckets and/or amaximum allowed error. The covering radius of a k-NNq is estimated based on therelationship between the query element and the CDHs' joint frequencies.

Combine-and-conquer: improving the diversity in similarity search through influence sampling,Lucio FD Santos; Willian D Oliveira; Luiz O Carvalho; Monica RP Ferreira; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Result diversification methods are intended to retrieve elements similar to a givenobject whereas also enforcing a certain degree of diversity among them; aimed at improvingthe answer relevance. Most of the methods are based on optimization; but bearing NP-hardsolutions. Diversity is injected into an otherwise all-too-similar result set in two phases: in thefirst; the search space is reduced to speed up finding the optimal solution; whereas in thesecond a trade-off between diversity and similarity over the reduced space is obtained. It isassumed that the first phase is achieved by applying a traditional nearest neighboralgorithm; but no previous investigation evaluated the impact of the first over the secondphase. In this paper; we devised alternative techniques to execute the first phase andevaluated how obtaining a better quality set of elements in the first phase can improve the …,Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2015,1

Being similar is not enough: how to bridge usability gap through diversity in medical images,Lucio FD Santos; Marcos VN Bedo; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,In this paper we present a technique developed to bridge the usability gap in Content-BasedMedical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) systems exploring both similarity and diversity. Usabilitygaps are related to how easy to use a software tool from the radiologist's perspective is.Although much have been done to better express similarity queries; the use of CBMIR overmassive databases may have drawbacks that impact its usability. We claim that much of theproblems derives from the fact that many images returned are closer to each other than tothe query element (near-duplicates). To target this nuisance; we propose to boost similarityqueries with diversity; using a technique to hierarchically cluster near-duplicates. Wetailored a domain-independent and parameter-free method by controlling the maximum areareached in the search space. This novel approach to improve CBMIR systems take …,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2014 IEEE 27th International Symposium on,2014,1
QuMinS: Fast and scalable querying; mining and summarizing multi-modal databases,Robson LF Cordeiro; Fan Guo; Donna S Haverkamp; James H Horne; Ellen K Hughes; Gunhee Kim; Luciana AS Romani; Priscila P Coltri; Tamires T Souza; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Given a large image set; in which very few images have labels; how to guess labelsfor the remaining majority? How to spot images that need brand new labels different from thepredefined ones? How to summarize these data to route the user's attention to what reallymatters? Here we answer all these questions. Specifically; we propose QuMinS; a fast;scalable solution to two problems:(i) Low-labor labeling (LLL)–given an image set; very fewimages have labels; find the most appropriate labels for the rest; and (ii) Mining andattention routing–in the same setting; find clusters; the top-N O outlier images; and the NRimages that best represent the data.

The SITSMining framework: a data mining approach for satellite image time series,Bruno Ferraz do Amaral; Daniel Yoshinobu Takada Chino; Luciana AS Romani; Renata RV Gonçalves; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Elaine Parros Machado de Sousa,The amount of data generated and stored in many domains has increased in the last years.In remote sensing; this scenario of bursting data is not different. As the volume of satelliteimages stored in databases grows; the demand for computational algorithms that canhandle and analyze this volume of data and extract useful patterns has increased. In thiscontext; the computational support for satellite images data analysis becomes essential. Inthis work; we present the SITSMining framework; which applies a methodology based ondata mining techniques to extract patterns and information from time series obtained fromsatellite images. In Brazil; as the agricultural production provides great part of the nationalresources; the analysis of satellite images is a valuable way to help crops monitoring overseasons; which is an important task to the economy of the country.

Using boundary conditions for combining multiple descriptors in similarity based queries,Rodrigo F Barroso; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Renato Bueno,Abstract Queries dealing with complex data; such as images; face semantic problems thatmight compromise results quality. Such problems have their source on the differences foundbetween the semantic interpretation of the data and their low level machine coderepresentation. The descriptors utilized in such representation translate intrinsiccharacteristics of the data (usually color; shape and texture) into qualifying attributes.Different descriptors represent different intrinsic characteristics that can get different aspectsof the data while processing a similarity comparison among them. Therefore; the use ofmultiple descriptors tends to improve data separation and categorization; if compared to theuse of a single descriptor. Another relevant fact is that some specific intrinsic characteristicsare essential for identifying a subset of the data. Based on such premises; this work …,Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition,2013,1

Reducing the dimensionality of the sift descriptor and increasing its effectiveness and efficiency in image retrieval via bag-of-features,Glauco Vitor Pedrosa; Solange Oliveira Rezende; Agma Juci Machado Traina,Abstract The Bag-of-Features is a popular approach to describe multimedia information byusing visual words. The SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) is one of the most utilizeddescriptor to model multimedia information in Bag of-Features. The data is described as aset of keypoints and a feature vector is assigned for each of the keypoints. This featurevector is composed of 128 values; which represent the region around each keypoint. Ingeneral; some of the detected keypoints are not relevant and can be discarded withoutlosing the local discriminative power. In this paper; we propose a technique to reduce thedetected keypoints by SIFT; as well as a technique to reduce the feature vectordimensionality. Experiments were made in order to analyze the performance of theproposed reduction techniques using two different image databases.

Thisfeature selection algorithm consists in a compactness analysis of scatterplots to find the mostrelevant features providing high separability abilities. A high relevance value of a scatterplotmeans better predictability among of classes based on two features. We take advantage ofthis information to generate a ranking for features usefulness. We compared our method totwo well-known feature selection methods using three real medical datasets. All of themwere compared regarding the dimensionality of the final feature vector and the retrievaleffectiveness measured by the precision and recall graphs.

Our approach combines fractal dataanalysis and the monitoring of the real and the model-generated data streams to detectdeviations considering the intrinsic correlation among climate time series. Experimentalstudies showed that our approach can discriminate the data either as real or as generatedby a model. Those results suggest that there are yet space to improve the climate changemodels; and that the fractal-based concepts may contribute in this improvement.,Proceedings of the 27th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2012,1

A CAD system based on complex networks theory to characterize mass in mammograms,Carolina YV Watanabe; Jonathan S Ramos; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,This paper presents a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for mammograms; which isbased on complex networks to shape boundary characterization of mass in mammograms;suggesting a" second opinion" to the health specialist. A region of interest (the mass) isautomatically segmented using an improved algorithm based on EM/MPM and the shape ismodeled into a scale-free complex network. Topological measurements of the resultingnetwork are used to compose the shape descriptors. The experiments comparing thecomplex network approach with other traditional descriptors; in detecting breast cancer inmammograms; show that the proposed approach accomplish the best values of accuracy.Hence; the results indicate that complex networks are wellsuited to characterizemammograms.,Medical Imaging 2012: Computer-Aided Diagnosis,2012,1
Paged similarity queries,Enzo Seraphim; Thatyana F Piola Seraphim; Edmilson M Moreira; Fábio CM Ricotta; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract An important feature of a database management systems (DBMS) is its client/serverarchitecture; where managing shared memory among the clients and the server is always antough issue. However; similarity queries are specially sensitive to this kind of architecture;since the answer sizes vary widely. Usually; the answers of similarity query are fullyprocessed to be sent in full to the user; who often is interested in just parts of the answer; egjust few elements closer or farther to the query reference. Compelling the DBMS to retrievethe full answer; further ignoring its majority is at least a waste of server processing power.Paging the answer is a technique that splits the answer onto several pages; following clientrequests. Despite the success of paging on traditional queries; little work has been done tosupport it in similarity queries.

Distance functions association for content-based image retrieval using multiple comparison criteria,Ives Rene Venturini Pola; Agma JM Traina; C Traina,The comparison operators available in traditional database management systems (DBMS)are not adequate to handle complex data such as images; rather comparing them usingsimilarity operators is the option of choice. Similarity operators need a way to measure thesimilarity between pairs of objects. Although there are many interesting works dealing withsimilarity queries and functions to measure similarity; they all rely on a single similarityfunction that must be applicable over the whole dataset. However; images from medicalexams often require several ways to measure similarity; depending on many factors; such asthe particular pathological condition being searched; or the existence of specific clinicalcondition revealed in the images compared. Therefore; the ability to handle several ways tocompare images by similarity is important in medical software handling images. This work …,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2006.

Class-Constraint Similarity Queries,Jessica A de Souza; Agma JM Traina; Sebastian Michel,ABSTRACT Similarity searching is a widely applied concept on multimedia or complex data;such as images; videos; time-series; among others. Therefore; it is important to look at theexecution of specific query types; eg; constrained k-nearest neighbor that is directly basedon bounded regions. In this paper; we present the Class-Constraint k-Nearest Neighbor(CCkNN) query; which goes beyond the traditional constrained k-nearest neighbor; becauseour CCkNN works for any specific categories of data points. The proposed CCkNN aims ataccelerating the process of class-constraint similarity query execution by taking advantageof performing queries on multiple metric access methods regarding the class dimensions ofthe objects of each index. Additionally; this strategy identifies which index is moreappropriate to run class-constraint on the k-nearest neighbor queries. Experimental …,*,2018,*

CLAP; ACIR and SCOOP: Novel techniques for improving the performance of dynamic Metric Access Methods,Paulo H Oliveira; Caetano Traina Jr; Daniel S Kaster,Abstract Constant technological advances in electronic devices have led to the growth ofelaborated data such as large texts; time series; georeferenced imagery; genetic sequences;photos; videos and several other types of complex data. Differently from scalar; traditionaldata types such as numbers and strings; complex data do not present the order relationproperty; which allows identifying whether an element precedes another according to somecriterion. Therefore; these data are usually compared by the similarity degree among them.The Metric Access Methods (MAMs) are recognized as well-suited to perform similarityqueries over such kind of data more efficiently than other access methods. MAMs can beconsidered dynamic or static depending on the pivot type used to construct them. Pivots areoften employed to narrow the search for data.

Semantic Similarity Group By Operators for Metric Data,Natan A Laverde; Mirela T Cazzolato; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Grouping operators summarize data in DBMS arranging elements in groups usingidentity comparisons. However; for metric data; grouping by identity is seldom useful; sinceadopting the concept of similarity is often a better fit. There are operators that can group dataelements using similarity. However; the existing operators do not achieve good results forcertain data domains or distributions. The major contributions of this work are a noveloperator called the SGB-Vote that assign groups using an election involving alreadyassigned groups and an extension for current operators bounds each group to a maximumamount of the nearest neighbors. The operators were implemented in a framework andevaluated using real and synthetic datasets from diverse domains considering both qualityof and execution time.

The Merkurion approach for similarity searching optimization in Database Management Systems,Marcos VN Bedo; Daniel S Kaster; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Modern Database Management Systems (DBMSs) retrieve songs that resemblethose in a music dataset; identify plagiarism in a set of documents; or provide past cases tophysicians by taking into account the characteristics of a query exam. All such tasks requirethe comparison of data by similarity; which can be expressed in terms of distance-basedqueries in metric spaces. Traditional query processing relies mostly on histograms fordescribing the data distribution space and choosing a data retrieval path that quickly leadsto the answer; discarding comparisons of most unwanted data.

How to speed up outliers removal in image matching,Jonathan S Ramos; Carolina YV Watanabe; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract Outliers removal from matched points is a crucial step in imagematching/mosaicing. A single outlier might lead to incorrect adjustments. In order to dealwith this issue; graph-based approaches were proposed in the literature; but usually theyare very time consuming. Aimed at minimizing the processing time and keeping thematching accuracy; we developed a preprocessing technique called FOMP; which reducesthe number of outliers in the initial set of matched points. FOMP filters out vertices based onthe difference of the edge weights. In this paper; we detail and present an improved version(FOMP*) by enhancing the stop criteria; taking into account the average weights of thevertices. We have conducted exhaustive experiments and summarized the results obtainedover 5 different image datasets; where four of them present several conditions (camera …,Pattern Recognition Letters,2017,*
VolTime: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on Users' Online Activity Volume,Daniel YT Chino; Alceu F Costa; Agma JM Traina; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Is it possible to spot review frauds and spamming on social media and onlinestores? In this paper we analyze the joint distribution of the inter-arrival times and volume ofevents such as comments and online reviews and show that it is possible to accurately rankand detect suspicious users such as spammers; bots and fraudsters. We propose VolTime; agenerative model that fits well the inter-arrival time distribution (IAT) of real users. Thus;VOLTIME automatically spots and ranks suspicious users. Experiments on several realdatasets; ranging from Reddit comments and phone calls to Flipkart product reviews; showthat VolTime is able to accurately fit the activity volume and IAT of real data. Additionally; weshow that VolTime ranks suspicious users with a precision higher than 90% for a sensitivityof 70%.,*,2017,*
BREATH: Heat Maps Assisting the Detection of Abnormal Lung Regions in CT Scans,Mirela Teixeira Cazzolato; Lucas de Carvalho Scabora; Alceu Ferraz Costa; Marcos Roberto Nesso Junior; Luis Fernando Milano Oliveira; Daniel dos Santos Kaster; Caetano Traina Junior; Agma Juci Machado Traina,Abstract—Computed Tomography (CT) scans are often employed to diagnose lungdiseases; as abnormal tissue regions may indicate whether proper treatment is required.However; detecting specific regions containing abnormalities in a CT scan demands timeand effort of specialists. Moreover; different parts of a single lung image may present bothnormal and abnormal characteristics; what makes inaccurate the classification of a singlelung as healthy (normal) or not. In this paper we propose the BREATH method; capable ofdetecting abnormalities in lung tissue regions; highlighting them by means of a heat mapvisualization. The method starts by segmenting lung tissues using a superpixel-basedapproach; followed by the training of a statistical model to represent normal tissues and;finally; the generation of a heat map showing abnormal regions that require attention from …,2017 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS),2017,*
When Similarity is Not Enough; Ask for Diversity: Grouping Elements Based on Influence,Lucio FD Santos; Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Marcos VN Bedo; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Crowdsourcing images have been increasingly employed for mapping emergencyscenarios; which helps rescue forces in choosing contingency plans. In this scenario;similarity searching can be used to retrieve related images from past situations. However;the retrieved images often are similar among themselves and; therefore; add little to nonenew information to the rescue decision-making process. In this paper; we take advantage ofdiversity queries to increase the variety of the representative elements about an incident;whereas the remaining and related data are grouped according to the set of representatives.Thus; our approach enables content retrieval; grouping and an easier exploration of theresult set.

Encoding Visual Attention Features for Effective Biomedical Images Retrieval,Glauco Vitor Pedrosa; Agma JM Traina,This paper proposes a novel model; called Similarity Based on Visual Attention Features(SimVisual); to enhance the similarity analysis between images by considering featuresextracted from salient regions mapped by visual attention models. Visual attention modelshave demonstrated to be very useful for encoding perceptual semantic information of theimage content. Thus; aggregating saliency features into the final image representation is apowerful asset to enhance the similarity analysis between images; while increasing theaccuracy in retrieval tasks. The goal of SimVisual is to combine different saliency modelswith traditional image descriptors; aimed at increasing the descriptive power of thesedescriptors without modifying the original algorithms.

Pivot-Based Similarity Wide-Joins Fostering Near-Duplicate Detection,Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Lucio Fernandes Dutra Santos; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Monitoring systems targeting to improve decision making in emergency scenariosare currently benefiting from crowdsourcing information. The main issue with such kind ofdata is that the gathered reports quickly become too similar among themselves. Hence; toomuch similar reports; namely near-duplicates; do not add valuable knowledge to assist crisiscontrol committees in their decision making tasks. The current approaches to detect near-duplicates are usually based on a twofold processing; where the first phase relies onsimilarity queries or clustering techniques; whereas the second and most computationallycostly phase refines the result from the first one. Aimed at reducing that cost and alsoimproving the ability of near-duplication detection; we developed a framework model basedon the similarity wide-join database operator.

Fire Detection from Social Media Images by Means of Instance-Based Learning,Mirela Teixeira Cazzolato; Alceu Ferraz Costa; Gustavo Blanco; Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. Social media can provide valuable information to support decision making in crisismanagement; such as in accidents; explosions; and fires. However; much of the data fromsocial media are images; which are uploaded at a rate that makes it impossible for humanbeings to analyze them. To cope with that problem; we design and implement a database-driven architecture for fast and accurate fire detection named FFireDt. The design of FFireDtuses the instance-based learning through indexed similarity queries expressed as anextension of the relational Structured Query Language. Our contributions are:(i) the designof the Fast-Fire Detection (FFireDt); which achieves efficiency and efficacy rates that rival tothe state-of-the-art techniques;(ii) the sound evaluation of 36 image descriptors; for the taskof image classification in social media;(iii) the evaluation of content-based indexing with …,Enterprise Information Systems: 17th International Conference; ICEIS 2015; Barcelona; Spain; April 27-30; 2015; Revised Selected Papers,2016,*

However; the integration of both query operator classes is still in its early stages; asmost works on similarity queries focus on the data structures and operations required toexecute just the similarity retrieval operation; but few of them target problems on theintegration itself. Among them; the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) comparison operator givesground to conflicting interpretations when composed with others.

MFS-Map: efficient context and content combination to annotate images,Alceu Ferraz Costa; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Automatic image annotation provides textual description to images based oncontent and context information. Since images may present large variability; imageannotation methods often employ multiple extractors to represent visual content consideringlocal and global features under different visual aspects. As result; an important aspect ofimage annotation is the combination of context and content representations. This paperproposes MFS-Map (Multi-Feature Space Map); a novel image annotation method thatmanages the problem of combining multiple content and context representations whenannotating images. The advantage of MFS-Map is that it does not represent visual andtextual features by a single large feature vector. Rather; MFS-Map divides the problem intofeature subspaces. This approach allows MFS-Map to improve its accuracy by identifying …,Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2014,*

This has leadto the emergence of a new generation of ambient and context-aware applications. Miningand querying the resulting large datasets is possibly the only way to discover informationand extract new knowledge in them. One of the challenges is bridging several disciplines;such as database systems; XML and information retrieval; artificial intelligence; andmultimedia processing. Thus; it has become important to understand multimedia and XMLstreams mining and querying techniques; how such techniques can contribute to newknowledge discovery; and how to organize and manage the discovered knowledge.

Properties of the Unary Similarity Operator Integrated to the Relational Algebra,Mônica Ribeiro Porto Ferreira; Caetano Traina Junior; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Ires Dias,Abstract. Conventional operators for data comparison are either based on exact matching oron total order relationship among elements. Neither of them are appropriate to managecomplex data; such as multimedia data (eg; images; audio and large texts); time series andgenetic sequences. In fact; the most meaningful way to compare complex data is bysimilarity. However; the Relational Algebra; employed in the relational DatabaseManagement Systems (RDBMS); cannot express similarity criteria. In order to address thissupport; an extension to the Relational Algebra is under development at GBdI-ICMCUSP(Databases and Images Group); aiming to represent similarity queries in algebraicexpressions. This technical report defines a formal framework which embodies the unarysimilarity operators into Relational Algebra; and precisely define their algebraic …,*,2008,*

INTEGRATING DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND VISUAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT HIGHLIGHT DETECTION IN SPORTS VIDEOS,J Assfalg; M Bertini; C Colombo; A Del Bimbo,The dramatic quantity of videos generated by digital technologies has originated the needfor automatic annotation of these videos; and the consequent need for techniquessupporting their retrieval. Content-based video annotation and retrieval is therefore an activeresearch topic. While many of the results in content-based image retrieval can besuccessfully applied to videos; additional techniques have to be developed to address theirpeculiarity. In fact; videos add the temporal dimension; thus requiring to represent objectdynamics. Furthermore; while we often think of a video just as of a sequence of images; it isactually a compound medium; integrating such elementary media as realistic images;graphics; text and audio; each showing characteristic presentation affordances [8].

A Spline-based Cost Model for Metric Trees,Marcos VN Bedo; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Pádua–RJ St A; Sao Carlos–SP–Brazil,Abstract. Whenever two (or more) access methods are alternatives for the execution of aquery; how to choose which one is the best for the task? Such a decision is made by theDBMS optimizer module; which models the query costs according to the distribution of thedata space. Cost modeling of similarity searches; however; requires the representation ofdistances' rather than data distribution. In this paper; we propose the Stockpile model forcost estimation of similarity queries on metric trees by using pivot-based distance histogramsthat represent the local densities around the query elements. By combining the localdensities to the probability of traversing the tree nodes; Stockpile provides a fair estimationof both disk accesses (I/O costs) and distance calculations (CPU costs). We comparedStockpile and two literature models regarding similarity queries in real-world data sources …,*,*,*

Relational graph data management on the edge: Grouping vertices’ neighborhood with Edge-k,Lucas C Scabora; Paulo H Oliveira; Daniel S Kaster; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina-Jr; Sao Carlos–SP–Brazil,Abstract. As the amount of data represented as graph grows; several frameworks areemploying relational databases to manage them. However; the existing solutions storegraphs creating a row for each edge in an edge table. In this paper; we propose Edge-k; anovel storage approach that combines additional columns in the edges table; allowing totune the number of edges stored in a single row by taking into account the overallneighborhood of the vertices; thus providing a better table organization. Compared to theexisting approaches in the literature; experiments reveal that our proposal was able to reacha speedup of 66% over a representative real dataset and up to 57% in synthetic datasetswhen processing Single Source Shortest Path queries. Hence; our solution advances thestate of the art in the context of graph data management within relational databases …,*,*,*

This paper propose a group of someworkflow instructions called H2B-MPS; an extension of the process presented by Horita etal.(H2B)(2012); and developed to be aligned to the process of Human ResourceManagement (GRH) present in the MR-MPS-SW. For this reason; in each of H2B activities;we defined a workflow instruction that seeks not only to meet expected results; butincorporate the best practices of GRH and the MR-MPS-SW. Through the mapping betweentheir work instructions and expected outcomes of the GRH is possible to verify that the modelis in accordance with the MR-MPS-SW.,*,*,*

Algorithm for three dimension reconstruction of magnetic resonance tomographs and X-ray images based on Fast Fourier Transform,Josiane M Bueno; Agma Juci M Traina; Paulo E Cruvinel,This work presents an algorithm for three-dimensional digital image reconstruction. Suchalgorithms based on the combination of both a Fast Fourier Transform method withHamming Window and the use of a tri-linear interpolation function. The algorithm allows notonly the generation of three-dimensional spatial spin distribution maps for MagneticResonance Tomography data but also X and Y-rays linear attenuation coefficient maps forCT scanners. Results demonstrates the usefulness of the algorithm in three-dimensionalimage reconstruction by doing first two-dimensional reconstruction and rather afterinterpolation. The algorithm was developed in C++ language; and there are two availableversions: one under the DOS environment; and the other under the UNIX/Sunenvironment.(author),*,*,*

Neste contexto; as pesquisas mais promissoras focam principalmente na inferênciade pesos de características contínuos e na seleção de características. Entretanto; osprocessos tradicionais de inferência de pesos contínuos são computacionalmente caros e aseleção de características equivale a uma ponderação binária.

A Percepção Humana na Recuperação de Imagens por Conteúdo,Joselene Marques; Agma Juci Machado Traina,The Relevance Feedback (RR) approach is a powerful mechanism to refine and improve thetechniques for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) considering the subjectivity introducedby the human analysis. Traditionally; in this process the human analyst weighs the imagesretrieved; considering their degree of relevance to the query posed. By doing so; thesubjectivity of human perception is introduced in the CBIR; and the semantic gap inherent tothis process is diminished. This work discusses the use of Relevance Feedback in a realCBIR system under development at the ICMC-USP; which aims at minimizing the negativeeffect on the user acceptance of a CBIR system when false negative images are retrieved. Anew approach on RR is proposed; which aims at taking advantage of the computation of thesimilarity function between the images to improve the set of relevant images retrieved.,*,*,*

Benefiting from such graphs can be better performed by means of visualinteraction. However; in the domain of large graphs; excessive processing and limiteddisplay space bound the possibilities for visual presentation and processing. In this line; weintroduce GMine; a prototype system that uses an innovative data structure; the Graph-Tree.The engineering of GMine allows for scalability over huge graphs stored on disk; anextended graph representation embracing both hierarchical and plain organization; and theinteractive browsing of graph hierarchies.

Consequently; institutions have stored hugeamounts of data such as climate time series and remote sensing images. Computationalmodels to filter; transform; merge and analyze data from many different areas are complexand challenging. The complexity increases even more when combining several knowledgedomains. Examples are research in climatic changes; biofuel production and environmentalproblems. A possible solution to the problem is the association of several computationaltechniques. Accordingly; this paper presents a framework to analyze; monitor and visualizeclimate and remote sensing data by employing methods based on fractal theory; data miningand visualization techniques.

On the Effects of Distance Functions to Improve Content-based Image Retrieval,Pedro H Bugatti; Agma JM Traina,Abstract. The retrieval of images by visual content relies on a feature extractor to provide themost meaningful intrinsic characteristics (features) from the data; and a distance function toquantify the similarity between them. A challenge in this field supporting content-basedimage retrieval (CBIR) to answer similarity queries is how to best integrate these two keyaspects. There are plenty of researching on algorithms for feature extraction of images.However; little attention have been paid to the importance of the use of a well-suiteddistance function associated to a feature extractor. This Master Dissertation was conceivedto fill in this gap. It was also proposed a new technique to perform feature selection over thefeature vectors; in order to improve the precision when answering similarity queries. Thiswork also showed that the proper use of a distance function effectively improves the …,*,*,*

Análise temporal de municípios produtores de cana-de-açúcar no estado de São Paulo por meio de agrupamento do NDVI (AVHRR/NOAA) e dados de produtivida...,RR do V GONÇALVES; Luciana Alvim Santos Romani; J ZULLO JUNIOR; Ana Maria Heuminski de Ávila; Agma Juci Machado Traina,Abstract. Sugar cane has become strategic to the Brazilian economy; especially due to itsimportance in the replacement of fossil fuels. In recent years; the development of bi-fuel carengines leaded to a fast increase in the demand for ethanol; one of the most importantderivatives of sugar cane. Therefore; it is very important to monitor the crop seasons in orderto estimate the yield of sugar cane as well as to evaluate the expansion of this crop in thecountry. There are several models to estimate the sugar cane production involvingphysiological; meteorological and pedological variables. However; the use of satelliteimages to aid in the monitoring of sugar cane production has increased greatly in recentyears. In this context; this paper presents an assessment of the distribution of sugar caneregions in the last eight crop seasons; according to three different clusters.
