Peer-to-peer computing,Dejan S Milojicic; Vana Kalogeraki; Rajan Lukose; Kiran Nagaraja; Jim Pruyne; Bruno Richard; Sami Rollins; Zhichen Xu,Abstract The term “peer-to-peer”(P2P) refers to a class of systems and applications thatemploy distributed resources to perform a function in a decentralized manner. With thepervasive deployment of computers; P2P is increasingly receiving attention in research;product development; and investment circles. Some of the benefits of a P2P approachinclude: improving scalability by avoiding dependency on centralized points; eliminating theneed for costly infrastructure by enabling direct communication among clients; and enablingresource aggregation. This survey reviews the field of P2P systems and applications bysummarizing the key concepts and giving an overview of the most important systems.Design and implementation issues of P2P systems are analyzed in general; and thenrevisited for eight case studies.

A local search mechanism for peer-to-peer networks,Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti,Abstract One important problem in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is searching and retrievingthe correct information. However; existing searching mechanisms in pure peer-to-peernetworks are inefficient due to the decentralized nature of such networks. We propose twomechanisms for information retrieval in pure peer-to-peer networks. The first; the modifiedBreadth-First Search (BFS) mechanism; is an extension of the current Gnuttela protocol;allows searching with keywords; and is designed to minimize the number of messages thatare needed to search the network. The second; the Intelligent Search mechanism; uses thepast behavior of the P2P network to further improve the scalability of the search procedure.In this algorithm; each peer autonomously decides which of its peers are most likely toanswer a given query. The algorithm is entirely distributed; and therefore scales well with …,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,559
Online outlier detection in sensor data using non-parametric models,Sharmila Subramaniam; Themis Palpanas; Dimitris Papadopoulos; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Sensor networks have recently found many popular applications in a number ofdifferent settings. Sensors at different locations can generate streaming data; which can beanalyzed in real-time to identify events of interest. In this paper; we propose a framework thatcomputes in a distributed fashion an approximation of multi-dimensional data distributions inorder to enable complex applications in resource-constrained sensor networks. We motivateour technique in the context of the problem of outlier detection. We demonstrate how ourframework can be extended in order to identify either distance-or density-based outliers in asingle pass over the data; and with limited memory requirements.

Interest-based connections in peer-to-peer networks,*,Peers (p) monitor responses received from other peers (s; q) to requests for information andrate the responding peers on their ability to provide information of interest. When aresponding peer (s) is discovered to frequently provide good results; the requesting peer (p)attempts to move closer to the responding peer (s) by creating a direct connection (ps) withthat peer and thereby promote the “good” peer to an “immediate” peer. If such a promotionwould result in too many direct connections; the least important immediate peer is demotedto an “indirect” peer. The criteria (Imp) used for evaluating the relative importance of at leastthe immediate peers is preferably a time weighted average (Imp*(t)= α· Imp (t)+ β· Imp*(t− 1))that also measures consistency and reliability and preferably includes factors not onlyrepresentative of the peer's ability to provide requested information (Hits); but also of its …,*,2007,224
Distributed deviation detection in sensor networks,Themistoklis Palpanas; Dimitris Papadopoulos; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Sensor networks have recently attracted much attention; because of their potentialapplications in a number of different settings. The sensors can be deployed in largenumbers in wide geographical areas; and can be used to monitor physical phenomena; or todetect certain events. An interesting problem which has not been adequately addressed sofar is that of distributed online deviation detection in streaming data. The identification ofdeviating values provides an efficient way to focus on the interesting events in the sensornetwork. In this work; we propose a technique for online deviation detection in streamingdata. We discuss how these techniques can operate efficiently in the distributed environmentof a sensor network; and discuss the tradeoffs that arise in this setting.

MicroHash: An Efficient Index Structure for Flash-Based Sensor Devices.,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Song Lin; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Walid A Najjar,Abstract In this paper we propose the MicroHash index; which is an efficient externalmemory structure for Wireless Sensor Devices (WSDs). The most prevalent storage mediumfor WSDs is flash memory. Our index structure exploits the asymmetric read/write and wearcharacteristics of flash memory in order to offer high performance indexing and searchingcapabilities in the presence of a low energy budget which is typical for the devices underdiscussion. A key idea behind MicroHash is to eliminate expensive random accessdeletions. We have implemented MicroHash in nesC; the programming language of theTinyOS [7] operating system. Our trace-driven experimentation with several real datasetsreveals that our index structure offers excellent search performance at a small cost ofconstructing and maintaining the index.,FAST,2005,184

Finding good peers in peer-to-peer networks,M Krishna Ramanathan; Vana Kalogeraki; Jim Pruyne,As computing and communication capabilities have continued to increase; more and moreactivity is taking place at the edges of the network; typically in homes or on workersdesktops. This trend has been demonstrated by the increasing popularity and usability of"peer-to-peer" systems; such as Napster and Gnutella. Unfortunately; this popularity hasquickly shown the limitations of these systems; particularly in terms of scale. Because thenetworks form in an ad-hoc manner; they typically make inefficient use of resources. Wepropose a mechanism; using only local knowledge; to improve the overall performance ofpeer-to-peer networks based on interests.

Data dissemination in mobile peer-to-peer networks,Thomas Repantis; Vana Kalogeraki,Abstract In this paper we propose adaptive content-driven routing and data disseminationalgorithms for intelligently routing search queries in a peer-to-peer network that supportsmobile users. In our mechanism nodes build content synopses of their data and adaptivelydisseminate them to the most appropriate nodes. Based on the content synopses; a routingmechanism is being built to forward the queries to those nodes that have a high probabilityof providing the desired results. Our simulation results show that our approach is highlyscalable and significantly improves resources usage by saving both bandwidth andprocessing power.,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mobile data management,2005,88
The threshold join algorithm for top-k queries in distributed sensor networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Zografoula Vagena; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki; V Tsotras; Michail Vlachos; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In this paper we present the Threshold Join Algorithm (TJA); which is an efficientTOP-k query processing algorithm for distributed sensor networks. The objective of a top-kquery is to find the k highest ranked answers to a user defined similarity function. Theevaluation of such a query in a sensor network environment is associated with the transfer ofdata over an extremely expensive communication medium. TJA uses a non-uniformthreshold on the queried attribute in order to minimize the number of tuples that have to betransferred towards the querying node. Additionally; TJA resolves queries in the networkrather than in a centralized fashion; which minimizes even more the consumption ofbandwidth and delay. Our preliminary experimental results; using our trace driven simulator;show that TJA is both practical and efficient.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Data management for sensor networks,2005,87

We present a system for heterogeneous stream processing and crowdsourcingsupporting intelligent urban traffic management. Complex events related to traffic congestion(trends) are detected from heterogeneous sources involving fixed sensors mounted onintersections and mobile sensors mounted on public transport vehicles.

Spatial queries in sensor networks,Amir Soheili; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Recent advances in low-power sensing devices coupled with the widespreadavailability of wireless ad-hoc networks have fueled the development of sensor networks.These are typically deployed over wide areas to gather data in the environment and monitorevents of interest. The ability to run spatial queries is extremely useful for sensor networks.Spatial query execution has been extensively studied in the context of centralized spatialdatabases; however because of the energy and bandwidth limitation of sensor nodes thesesolutions are not directly applicable to the sensor network. In this paper we propose ascalable and distributed way of spatial query execution in sensor networks.

Exploiting locality for scalable information retrieval in peer-to-peer networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract An important problem in unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is the efficientcontent-based retrieval of documents shared by other peers. However; existing searchingmechanisms are not scaling well because they are either based on the idea of flooding thenetwork with queries or because they require some form of global knowledge. We proposethe Intelligent Search Mechanism (ISM) which is an efficient; scalable yet simple mechanismfor improving the information retrieval problem in P2P systems. Our mechanism is efficientsince it is bounded by the number of neighbors and scalable because no global knowledgeis required to be maintained.

Decentralized trust management for ad-hoc peer-to-peer networks,Thomas Repantis; Vana Kalogeraki,Abstract Modern mobile devices can form ad-hoc networks to autonomously share data andservices. While such self-organizing; peer-to-peer communities offer exciting collaborationopportunities; deciding whether to trust another peer can be challenging. In this work wepropose a decentralized trust management middleware for ad-hoc; peer-to-peer networks;based on reputation. Our middleware's protocols take advantage of the unstructured natureof the network to render malicious behavior; such as lying and colluding; risky. Thereputation information of each peer is stored in its neighbors and piggy-backed on itsreplies. By simulating the behavior of networks both with and without a rating scheme wewere able to show that just a few dishonest peers can flood the network with false results;whereas this phenomenon is virtually eliminated when using our middleware.,Proceedings of the 4th international workshop on Middleware for Pervasive and Ad-Hoc Computing (MPAC 2006),2006,63

In one arrangement; respective Bloom-Filters may be formedat the nodes as a function of data available via the nodes. The Bloom-filters may becommunicated between peer-to-peer coupled nodes of the peer-to-peer network that haveformed connections using incentive-based criteria to control whether one node connects toanother node. A search expression may be formed for locating a data object; and nodesselected as a function of the Bloom-filters and the incentive-based criteria.

Cluster-based congestion control for supporting multiple classes of traffic in sensor networks,Kyriakos Karenos; Vana Kalogeraki; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy,In wireless sensor networks; multiple flows from data collecting sensors to an aggregatingsink could traverse paths that are largely interference coupled. These interference effectsmanifest themselves as congestion; and cause high packet loss and arbitrary packet delays.This is particularly problematic in event-based sensor networks where some flows are ofgreater importance than others and require fidelity in terms of higher packet delivery andtimeliness.

Real-time traffic management in sensor networks,Kyriakos Karenos; Vana Kalogeraki,In this work we propose a traffic management mechanism to support real-time flows in highlyunpredictable sensor network environments. The mechanism is based on a joint trafficregulation and end-to-end scheduling approach; a traffic regulation component adjusts theincoming packet rate to implicitly control the channel load and intelligently rejects packetsthat are more likely to miss their deadline while a laxity-based scheduling componentprojects the packets' per-hop delay and compensates for network end-to-end delays. Thus;high success ratios without severely degrading the fidelity are achieved.

In this paper we present a newscheduling algorithm that exploits the task laxities and the object importance to makeeffective scheduling decisions. The algorithm uses current timing and resourcemeasurements to determine the feasibility of the tasks and to distribute the objects to theprocessors. A task's timing parameter (laxity value) is carried; from one processor to another;with the object invocations; yielding a system-wide scheduling strategy that requires onlylocal computations.

Data center service providers are interestedin compressing the workload onto as few computing units as possible so as to utilize itsresources most efficiently and conserve power. However; because memory hierarchyinterference between threads is not managed by commercial operating systems; the datacenter operators still prefer running threads on different chips so as to avoid possibleperformance degradation due to interference.

The analysis of the data collected by suchsensor network can help us to understand the field dynamics; and optimize the deploymentof other solutions. We define a group of sensors having similar underlying distribution over aperiod of time as a homogeneous region.

A fair resource allocation algorithm for peer-to-peer overlays,Yannis Drougas; Vana Kalogeraki,Over the past few years; peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have become very popular forconstructing overlay networks of many nodes (peers) that allow users geographicallydistributed to share data and resources. One non-trivial question is how to distribute the datain a fair and fully decentralized manner among the peers. This is important because it canimprove resource usage; minimize network latencies and reduce the volume of unnecessarytraffic incurred in large-scale P2P systems. In this paper we present a technique for fairresource allocation in unstructured peer-to-peer systems. Our technique uses the fairnessindex of a distribution as a measure of fairness and shows how to optimize the fairness ofthe distribution using only local decisions. Load balancing is achieved by replicatingdocuments across multiple nodes in the system.

Virtual channel management for densely deployed IEEE 802.15. 4 LR-WPANs,Tae Hyun Kim; Jae Yeol Ha; Sunghyun Choi; Wook Hyun Kwon,The number of channels specified for IEEE 802.15. 4 low-rate wireless personal areanetworks (LR-WPANs) is too few to operate many applications of WPANs in the same area.To overcome this limit; we introduce virtual channel; a novel concept to increase the numberof available channels when various WPAN applications coexist. A virtual channel isbasically created via superframe scheduling within the inactive periods in a logical channelpreoccupied by other WPANs. To maximize the coexistence capability of WPANs usingvirtual channels; we propose (1) least collision superframe scheduler (LC-scheduler);(2)less complex heuristics; and (3) virtual channel selector (VCS) to efficiently manage multipleavailable logical channels.

Dynamic scheduling of distributed method invocations,Vana Kalogeraki; PM Melliar-Smith; Louise E Moser,Distributed method invocations require dynamic scheduling algorithms and efficientresource projections to provide timeliness guarantees to application objects. In this paper;we present a dynamic scheduling algorithm that examines the computation times; real timesand resource requirements of the application tasks to determine a feasible schedule for themethod invocations. The schedule is driven by the laxities of the tasks and the importancethat the tasks have to the system. Tasks span processor boundaries; and request messagescarry scheduling parameters (laxity values) from one processor to another; yielding a system-wide scheduling algorithm that requires only local computations. Experimental resultsvalidate our scheduling algorithm; and show that it has minimal overhead.,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 2000. Proceedings. The 21st IEEE,2000,26
Realize: Resource management for soft real-time distributed systems,PM Melliar-Smith; LE Moser; V Kalogeraki; P Narasimhan,The Realize system simplifies the development of complex applications by separating theapplication programming from the management of resources for soft real-time CORBAapplications; and from the replication of CORBA objects to provide high availability and faulttolerance.

Sensor network coverage restoration,Nitin Kumar; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki,Abstract Wireless sensor networks are emerging as a new computational platform consistingof small; low-power and inexpensive nodes used in a broad set of application areasincluding environmental monitoring; habitat monitoring and disaster recovery. Typicallysensor nodes are deployed over a geographical area for the purpose of detecting; trackingand monitoring events of interest. Since sensor nodes are deployed in a large land region;the objective is to achieve complete coverage of the region; that is; every location in theregion lies in the observation field of at least one sensor node. However the initial placementof sensors may not achieve this goal for various reasons: the number of original sensorsmay have been too low; the original placement may have been random (for example;sensors deployed from the air) leaving parts of the region uncovered; or; some of the …,networks,2005,12

Structuring topologically aware overlay networks using domain names,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Vana Kalogeraki,Abstract Overlay networks are application layer systems which facilitate users in performingdistributed functions such as searches over the contents of other users. An importantproblem in such networks is that the connections among peers are arbitrary; leading in thatway to a topology structure; which does not match the underlying physical topology. Thistopology mismatch leads to large user experienced delays; degraded performance andexcessive resource consumption in Wide Area Networks. In this work we propose andevaluate the Distributed Domain Name Order (DDNO) technique; which makes unstructuredoverlay networks topologically aware. In DDNO; a node devotes half of its connections tonodes that share the same domain-name and the remaining half connections to randomnodes. The former connections achieve good performance; because the bulk of the …,Computer Networks,2006,11

The inherent ad-hoc nature ofthese systems makes it difficult to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of thedistributed applications; thus having a direct impact on their scalability; efficiency andperformance. In this paper we propose adaptive algorithms to meet applications QoSdemands and balance the load across multiple peers. These comprise (a) resourcemanagement mechanisms to monitor resource loads and application latencies and (b) self-organization algorithms to dynamically select peers that maximize the probability of meetingthe applications' soft real-time and QoS requirements.

Budget-based self-optimized incentive search in unstructured P2P networks,Yi Hu; Min Feng; Laxmi N Bhuyan; Vana Kalogeraki,Distributed object search is the primary function of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system tolocate and transfer the file. The predominant search schemes in unstructured P2P systemshave their problems: flooding creates excessive traffic overhead and random walk prolongssearch delay. Moreover; both use uniform time-to-live (TTL) control for all users; whichmakes them vulnerable to selfish user attacks; and results in the" free-riding" and" tragedy ofthe commons" problems.

Dynamic relay node placement in wireless sensor networks,Jorge Mena; Vana Kalogeraki,In this paper we present an online algorithm that attacks the problem of placing relay nodesin regions where high localized congestion is detected. Congestion refers to the networkoverload caused by excess concurrent attempts of wireless devices to access the commonshared channel. Our algorithm uses the Expected Transmission Delay (ETD) metric basedon both current measurements and history observations over a window of time and is usedby the nodes to identify the level of congestion in the local environment of the node. Ourscheme uses a dissemination probing mechanism to exchange statistical local informationperiodically which are used to detect the congested area.

Handling multimedia objects in peer-to-peer networks,Vana Kalogeraki; Alex Delis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Video-on-demand systems and services [4; 2] are predominantly offered over dedicatedprivate networks with the help of large servers [3; 13].

The widespread usage of broadbandnetworks in connection with the low-cost commodity hardware may offer alternative avenuesfor the delivery of video streams and other multimedia objects. This goal can be achievedwith the help of multiple; independent; and inexpensive computing nodes that function usinga peer-to-peer P2P protocol [9; 8; 7].

Many emerging distributed applications require the processing of massive amountsof data in real-time. As a result; distributed stream processing systems have beenintroduced; offering a scalable and efficient means of in-network processing.

A model for identifying misinformation in online social networks,Sotirios Antoniadis; Iouliana Litou; Vana Kalogeraki,Abstract Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become increasingly popular means ofinformation sharing among users. The spread of news regarding emergency events iscommon in OSNs and so is the spread of misinformation related to the event.

Consequently; it becomes a necessity to develop a platform that will aggregateall the necessary information and will orchestrate it in the best way possible; towardsmeeting these goals. A main problem that arises in such a setting is the high diversity of theincoming data; obtained from very different sources such as sensors; smart phones; GPSsignals and social networks.

Effective privacy-preserving online route planning,Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Ira Assent; Christian S Jensen,An online Route Planning Service (RPS) computes a route from one location to another.Current RPSs such as Google Maps require the use of precise locations. However; someusers may not want to disclose their source and destination locations due to privacyconcerns. An approach that supplies fake locations to an existing service incurs asubstantial loss of quality of service; and the service may well return a result that may be nothelpful to the user. We propose a solution that is able to return accurate route planningresults when source and destination regions are used in order to achieve privacy. Thesolution re-uses a standard online RPS rather than replicate this functionality; and it needsno trusted third party. The solution is able to compute the exact results without leaking of theexact locations to the RPS or un-trusted parties.

A case for dynamic page migration in multiple-writer software DSM systems,Thomas Repantis; Christos D Antonopoulos; Vana Kalogeraki; Theodore S Papatheodorou,Software DSMs (SDSMs) are an appealing alternative to message passing; since theyfacilitate the programmability of clusters. However the ease of programming comes at theexpense of performance. Although accesses of data that reside to the memory of remotenodes are transparent to the programmer; they suffer from significantly higher latenciescompared to local accesses. As a consequence; it is desirable to move data as close aspossible to the nodes that need them most. In this paper we introduce a protocol fordynamically migrating memory pages in home-based SDSM systems. In these systems eachpage has a designated home node; yet our protocol allows a node that heavily modifies apage to become its new home. The new protocol targets multiple-writer DSMs; ie DSMs thatallow multiple nodes to concurrently modify the same page. The process is dynamic and …,Cluster Computing; 2005. IEEE International,2005,5

In order todeterministically process the streaming data; they need mechanisms that synchronize theorder in which tuples are processed by the operators. On the other hand; achieving real-timeresponse in such a system requires careful tradeoff between determinism and low latencyperformance.

Real-time and cost-effective limitation of misinformation propagation,Iouliana Litou; Vana Kalogeraki; Ioannis Katakis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Online Social Networks (OSNs) constitute one of the most important communicationchannels and are widely utilized as news sources. Information spreads widely and rapidly inOSNs through the word-of-mouth effect. However; it is not uncommon for misinformation topropagate in the network. Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects;especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events.Therefore; it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation. Towards this goal;we suggest a novel propagation model; namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model;that effectively captures the way contradictory information; ie; misinformation and credibleinformation; propagates in the network.

Using human social sensors for robust event location detection,Ioannis Boutsis; Vana Kalogeraki,Recently; the massive prevalence of mobile devices has led to the development of mobilesocial sensing systems where humans are enlisted to act as social sensors to perform geo-located tasks that require human intelligence or intervention. Social sensing from ubiquitoususers can provide significant benefits particularly during crisis management and emergencyscenarios. However; an important problem during such emergencies is how to exploit socialsensors to accurately determine the location; extent and severity of the event. In this paperwe develop a social sensing system that uses humans as social sensors where we applyparticle filtering to iteratively determine the spatial areas to be investigated to accuratelydetect the location and state of the target event.

The geographical area we aim tocover is represented as a grid of cells with no holes and the center of every cell in this gridrepresents a node. Thus; the problem we solve is: Given a geographical area to be exploredby a set of UAVs; how to plan a path that ensures that all nodes in the given area arecovered while minimizing the distance traveled by the UAVs. We propose an algorithm thatdetermines the complete coverage path; this creates a path for exploration that every nodein the path will be visited exactly once while minimizing the total distance traveled by theUAV. We illustrate that our approach can also be applied in the case of multiple UAVs thatcan fly simultaneously over that area thus minimizing the exploration time.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments,2016,1

Travel time estimation in real-time using buses as speed probes,Dimitrios Tomaras; Ioannis Boutsis; Vana Kalogeraki,Travel time estimation is a strategically important service in urban environments forpersonalized and eco-friendly route planning optimization; congestion avoidance;ridesharing and taxi dispatching. However; storing and retrieving traffic data in specificspatiotemporal regions is not an easy task as the data generated by these systems aretypically very large and dynamic. In this paper we propose an efficient and scalable solutionfor real-time travel time estimation of trajectories. In our system buses are used as speedprobes to obtain real-time traffic data information and spatio-temporal trajectories are storedin a dynamic indexing system optimized for efficiently retrieving spatiotemporal data in real-time.

Finding representative objects using link analysis ranking,Panagiotis Papapetrou; Tatiana Chistiakova; Jaakko Hollmén; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Link analysis ranking methods are widely used for summarizing the connectivitystructure of large networks. We explore a weighted version of two common link analysisranking algorithms; PageRank and HITS; and study their applicability to assistiveenvironment data. Based on these methods; we propose a novel approach for identifyingrepresentative objects in large datasets; given their similarity matrix. The novelty of ourapproach is that it takes into account both the pair-wise similarities between the objects; aswell as the origin and" evolution path" of these similarities within the dataset. The key step ofour method is to define a complete graph; where each object is represented by a node andeach edge in the graph is given a weight equal to the pairwise similarity value of the twoadjacent nodes. Nodes with high ranking scores correspond to representative objects …,Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments,2012,1
Consistent replication in distributed multi-tier architectures,Thomas Repantis; Arun Iyengar; Vana Kalogeraki; Isabelle Rouvellou,Replication is commonly used to address the scalability and availability requirements ofcollaborative web applications in domains such as computer supported cooperative work;social networking; e-commerce and e-banking. While providing substantial benefits;replication also introduces the overhead of maintaining data consistent among thereplicated servers. In this work we study the performance of common replication approacheswith various consistency guarantees and argue for the feasibility of strong consistency. Wepropose an efficient; distributed; strong consistency protocol and reveal experimentally thatits overhead is not prohibitive. We have implemented a replication middleware that offersdifferent consistency protocols; including our strong consistency protocol.

Efficient stream processing in the cloud,Dung Vu; Vana Kalogeraki; Yannis Drougas,Abstract In the recent years; many emerging on-line data analysis applications require real-time delivery of the streaming data while dealing with unpredictable increase in the volumeof data. In this paper we propose a novel approach for efficient stream processing of burstsin the Cloud. Our approach uses two queues to schedule requests pending execution. Whenbursts occur; incoming requests that exceed maximum processing capacity of the node;instead of being dropped; are diverted to a secondary queue. Requests in the secondaryqueue are concurrently scheduled with the primary queue; so that they can be immediatelyexecuted whenever the node has any processing power unused as the results of burstfluctuations. With this mechanism; processing power of nodes is fully utilized and the burstsare efficiently accommodated.

On constructing overlay networks to support distributed real-time virtual environment applications,Vana Kalogeraki; Fang Chen,Overlay networks provide an attractive solution to distributed real-time virtual applicationsbecause of their unique features of scalability; decentralization and cost effectiveness.However; overlay support for distributed real-time virtual applications remains a challengebecause of two reasons: 1) Frequent update messages traveling through multiple hops canincrease the network traffic and cause long communication and processing delays; and 2)Variable latencies experienced by different participants can violate their consistencyrequirements and affect the performance of the application. In this paper; we proposetechniques that work at two levels to address this problem. First the participants are groupedaccording to their virtual distance to satisfy their consistency requirements.

Workflow process models; which form thebackbone of process automation; are manually designed. This process entails assumptionsand errors. This leads to inaccurate models and inefficient process executions along withcomplexity in understanding of the process itself. In this work we present a novel techniquefor improving the accuracy and thereby the efficiency of Workflow models.

Low-Rank Methods in Event Detection,Jakub Marecek; Stathis Maroulis; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract: We present low-rank methods for event detection. We assume that normalobservation come from a low-rank subspace; prior to being corrupted by a uniformlydistributed noise. Correspondingly; we aim at recovering a representation of the subspace;and perform event detection by running point-to-subspace distance query in $\ell^\infty $; foreach incoming observation. In particular; we use a variant of matrix completion underinterval uncertainty on a suitable flattening $ M\in R^{m\times n} $ of the input data to obtaina low-rank model $ M\approx L\times R $; $ L\in R^{m\times r} $; $ R\in R^{r\times n} $; $ r\llm $. On-line; we compute the distance of each incoming $ x\in R^ n $ to the space spannedby $ R $. For the distance computation; we present a constant-time algorithm with a one-sided error bounded by a function of the number of coordinates employed.

Social Event Scheduling,Nikos Bikakis; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract: A major challenge for social event organizers (eg; event planning companies;venues) is attracting the maximum number of participants; since it has great impact on thesuccess of the event; and; consequently; the expected gains (eg; revenue; artist/brandpublicity). In this paper; we introduce the Social Event Scheduling (SES) problem; whichschedules a set of social events considering user preferences and behavior; events'spatiotemporal conflicts; and competing events; in order to maximize the overall number ofparticipants. We show that SES is strongly NP-hard; even in highly restricted instances. Tocope with the hardness of the SES problem we design a greedy approximation algorithm.Finally; we evaluate our method experimentally using a real dataset.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.09973,2018,*

An efficient technique for event location identification using multiple sources of urban data,Dimitrios Tomaras; Vana Kalogeraki; Nikolas Zygouras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract The proliferation of smart technologies has produced significant changes in the waypeople interact in a city. Smart traffic monitoring systems allow citizens and city operators toacquire a real-time view of the city traffic state. Furthermore; alternative means of transport;such as bike sharing systems; have enjoyed tremendous success in many major citiesaround the world today and provide real-time information regarding the mobility of the users.Such sources of urban data may act as human mobility sensors. Detecting the location andextent of large events in urban environments is a challenging problem. Previous workfocuses mainly on identifying traffic flows and extract possible event sources.

Efficient and timely misinformation blocking under varying cost constraints,Iouliana Litou; Vana Kalogeraki; Ioannis Katakis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Online Social Networks (OSNs) constitute one of the most important communicationchannels and are widely utilized as news sources. Information spreads widely and rapidly inOSNs through the word-of-mouth effect. However; it is not uncommon for misinformation topropagate in the network. Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects;especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events.Therefore; it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation. Towards this goal;we suggest a novel propagation model; namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model;that effectively captures the way contradictory information; ie; misinformation and credibleinformation; propagates in the network.

Lessons Learnt from the analysis of a bike sharing system,Dimitrios Tomaras; Ioannis Boutsis; Vana Kalogeraki,Abstract Bike-sharing systems have been deployed in many major cities around the worldtoday. Bike sharing systems provide great advantages as a mean of urban publictransportation facilitating a green solution for daily commuters and tourists. Users tend to usemore often this type of transportation for their daily needs. The key to success for suchsystems is the efficient distribution of bikes among the bike stations in order to satisfy highuser demands.

Efficient Data Dissemination in Overlays,Dung Vu; Thomas Repantis; Vana Kalogeraki,In this paper we propose adaptive data dissemination algorithms for intelligently routingsearch queries in a peer-to-peer network. In our mechanism nodes build content synopsesof their data and adaptively disseminate them to the most appropriate nodes. Based on thecontent synopses; a routing mechanism is being built to forward the queries to those nodesthat have a high probability of providing the desired results. Our simulation results show thatour approach is highly scalable and significantly improves resources usage by saving bothbandwidth and processing power.,Future Dependable Distributed Systems; 2009 Software Technologies for,2009,*
RG-EDF: An I/O Scheduling Policy for Flash Equipped Sensor Devices,Adam Ji Dou; Vana Kalogeraki,Abstract Flash equipped sensor devices are becoming increasingly complex and are nowcapable of supporting real-time multiple applications on a single sensor; rich sensing ofvisual and audio data; and storage of large amounts of data. With this increase incomplexity; it is no longer sufficient to provide first in first out (FIFO) type capture of data intomore persistent memories. In this paper we propose RG-EDF; a new scheduling policy forflash equipped sensor devices. RG-EDF aims at providing QoS support to multimedia tasksby considering the unique characteristics of flash-based devices. We have implemented ourscheme on a CC1010 sensor node with a SD flash card attached and compared ourtechnique to other popular scheduling policies. Our experimental results show the workingand benefit of our system.,IFIP International Workshop on Software Technolgies for Embedded and Ubiquitous Systems,2008,*
Data collection; reliable real-time,Vana Kalogeraki; Amir Soheili,Automatic data acquisition is the extraction of information from images; relevant for a givenapplication; by means of a computer. Photogrammetric image processing is divided into twoaspects; ie; the geometric/radiometric image evaluation and image analysis.Geometric/radiometric image evaluation comprises image orientation; the derivation ofgeometric surface descriptions and orthoprojection. Image analysis contains the extractionand description of three-dimensional (3D) objects. A strict separation of both areas ispossible neither for manual nor for automatic photogrammetric image processing.,Encyclopedia of GIS,2008,*

A Soft Real-Time Agent-based Peer-to-Peer Architecture,Fang Chen; Vana Kalogeraki,Summary As computers become more pervasive and communication technologies advance;a new generation of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are increasingly becoming popular for real-time communication; ad-hoc collaboration and resource sharing in large-scale distributedsystems. In this paper we present an agent-based peer-to-peer architecture that providessoft real-time guarantees to distributed tasks in peer-to-peer systems. The architectureexploits the urgency of the tasks; the objects at the peers and the resource utilization of thenodes; to dynamically determine an efficient schedule for the distributed activities. Themechanism uses only local knowledge and is entirely distributed and therefore scales wellwith the size of the system.,*,2003,*

An Active Learning Framework Incorporating User Input For Mining Urban Data,Nikolas Zygouras; Nikolaos Panagiotou; Nikos Zacheilas; Ioannis Boutsis; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,ABSTRACT Analyzing and detecting events from ubiquitous sensors across the city hasbeen an important goal in recent years. Different techniques that are able to automaticallydetect events by monitoring urban sensor's data have been efficiently applied in severalsmart cities to improve the citizens everyday life. However; the analysis of such voluminousdata streams often interferes with several constraints that arise in smart cities scenarios. Forexample it is impossible to hire human oracles that will monitor each data streamcontinuously to provide knowledge to these models and to annotate past instances. Thus;the development of novel techniques is required in order to build efficient supervisedlearning models that will be able to cope with urban data deluge. Our approach makes thefollowing contributions:(i) we formulate the problem of building supervised learning …,*,*,*

On Topic Aware Recommendation to Increase Popularity in Microblogging Services,Iouliana Litou; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract. The flourish of Web-based Online Social Networks (OSNs) has led to numerousapplications that exploit social relationships to boost the influence of content in the network.However; existing approaches focus on the social ties and ignore how the topic of a postand its structure relate to its popularity. Our work assists in filling this gap. The contribution ofthis work is two-fold:(i) we develop a scheme that automatically identifies the topic of a post;specifically tweets; in real-time without human participation in the process; and then (ii)based on the topic of the tweet and prior related posts; we recommend appropriate structuralproperties to increase the popularity of the particular tweet. By exploiting Wikipedia; ourmodel requires no training or expensive feature engineering for the classification of tweets totopics.,*,*,*

Efficient Ad-hoc Approximate Query Processing in Peer-to-Peer Databases1,Benjamin Arai; Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki,ABSTRACT Peer-to-peer databases are becoming prevalent on the Internet for distributionand sharing of documents; applications; and other digital media. The problem of answeringlarge scale; ad-hoc analysis queries–eg; aggregation queries–on these databases posesunique challenges. Exact solutions can be time consuming and difficult to implement giventhe distributed and dynamic nature of peer-to-peer databases. In this paper we presentnovel sampling-based techniques for approximate answering of ad-hoc aggregation queriesin such databases. Computing a high-quality random sample of the database efficiently inthe P2P environment is complicated due to several factors–the data is distributed (usually inuneven quantities) across many peers; within each peer the data is often highly correlated;and moreover; even collecting a random sample of the peers is difficult to accomplish.

A Caching Architecture for Peer-to-Peer Systems,Vana Kalogeraki; Aditya Mohan,As computers become more pervasive and communication technologies advance; a newgeneration of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems that provide persistence storage and allow usersto interact and share distributed resources (eg; files; CPU cycles) in wide-area environmentsare increasingly being deployed. Replication and caching are two popular techniques[Krishnamurthy] for reducing network latency and allowing users to fetch data from a peercache rather than a centralized server. Most of these techniques; however (1) exploit the useof dedicated hardware and (2) assume that the servers are always available and changeless frequently. The widespread usage of broadband networks in connection with the low-cost commodity hardware and the maturity of the software technologies; may offer alternativeways for building efficient caching architectures in large scale systems. This goal can be …,*,*,*

Approximating Aggregation Queries in Peer-to-Peer Networks,Benjamin Arai Gautam Das Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki,Peer-to-peer databases are becoming prevalent on the Internet for distribution and sharingof documents; applications; and other digital media. The problem of answering large scale;ad-hoc analysis queries~ eg; aggregation queries—on these databases poses uniquechallenges. Exact solutions can be time consuming and difﬁcult to implement given thedistributed and dynamic nature of peer-to-peer databases. In this paper we present novelsampling-based techniques for approximate answering of ad-hoc aggregation queries insuch databases. Computing a high-quality random sample of the database efficiently in thePZP environment is complicated due to several factors~ the data is distributed (usually inuneven quantities) across many peers; within each peer the data is often highly correlated;and moreover; even collecting a random sample of the peers is diﬁicult to accomplish.

Towards Self-Managing QoS-Enabled Peer-to-Peer Systems Vana Kalogeraki; Fang Chen; Thomas Repantis; Demetris Zeinalipour-Yazti Department of Computer...,Vana Kalogeraki,Abstract. Peer-to-peer systems that dynamically interact; collaborate and share resourcesare increasingly being deployed in wide-area environments. The inherent ad-hoc nature ofthese systems makes it difficult to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of thedistributed applications; thus having a direct impact on their scalability; efficiency andperformance. In this paper we propose adaptive algorithms to meet applications QoSdemands and balance the load across multiple peers. These comprise (a) resourcemanagement mechanisms to monitor resource loads and application latencies and (b) self-organization algorithms to dynamically select peers that maximize the probability of meetingthe applications' soft real-time and QoS requirements. Our algorithms use only localknowledge and therefore scale well with respect to the size of the network and the …,*,*,*
