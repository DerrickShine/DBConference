gspan: Graph-based substructure pattern mining,Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,We investigate new approaches for frequent graph-based pattern mining in graph datasetsand propose a novel algorithm called gSpan (graph-based substructure pattern mining);which discovers frequent substructures without candidate generation. gSpan builds a newlexicographic order among graphs; and maps each graph to a unique minimum DFS codeas its canonical label. Based on this lexicographic order gSpan adopts the depth-first searchstrategy to mine frequent connected subgraphs efficiently. Our performance study shows thatgSpan substantially outperforms previous algorithms; sometimes by an order of magnitude.,Data Mining; 2002. ICDM 2003.

Frequent pattern mining: current status and future directions,Jiawei Han; Hong Cheng; Dong Xin; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Frequent pattern mining has been a focused theme in data mining research for overa decade. Abundant literature has been dedicated to this research and tremendousprogress has been made; ranging from efficient and scalable algorithms for frequent itemsetmining in transaction databases to numerous research frontiers; such as sequential patternmining; structured pattern mining; correlation mining; associative classification; and frequentpattern-based clustering; as well as their broad applications. In this article; we provide a briefoverview of the current status of frequent pattern mining and discuss a few promisingresearch directions. We believe that frequent pattern mining research has substantiallybroadened the scope of data analysis and will have deep impact on data miningmethodologies and applications in the long run. However; there are still some …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2007,1221
CloSpan: Mining: Closed sequential patterns in large datasets,Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Ramin Afshar,Abstract Previous sequential pattern mining algorithms mine the full set of frequentsubsequences satisfying a min-sup threshold in a sequence database. However; since afrequent long sequence contains a combinatorial number of frequent subsequences; suchmining will generate an explosive number of frequent subsequences for long patterns; whichis prohibitively expensive in both time and space. In this paper; we propose an alternativebut equally powerful solution: instead of mining the complete set of frequent subsequences;we mine frequent closed subsequences only; ie; those containing no super-sequence withthe same support (ie; occurrence frequency). By exploring novel global optimizationtechniques; an efficient algorithm; called CloSpan (Clo sed S equential pa tter n mining) isdeveloped; which outperforms the previous work by one order of magnitude.

CloseGraph: mining closed frequent graph patterns,Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recent research on pattern discovery has progressed form mining frequentitemsets and sequences to mining structured patterns including trees; lattices; and graphs.As a general data structure; graph can model complicated relations among data with wideapplications in bioinformatics; Web exploration; and etc. However; mining large graphpatterns in challenging due to the presence of an exponential number of frequentsubgraphs. Instead of mining all the subgraphs; we propose to mine closed frequent graphpatterns. A graph g is closed in a database if there exists no proper supergraph of g that hasthe same support as g. A closed graph pattern mining algorithm; CloseGraph; is developedby exploring several interesting pruning methods. Our performance study shows thatCloseGraph not only dramatically reduces unnecessary subgraphs to be generated but …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,739
Graph indexing: a frequent structure-based approach,Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Graph has become increasingly important in modelling complicated structures andschemaless data such as proteins; chemical compounds; and XML documents. Given agraph query; it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via graph-basedindices. In this paper; we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novelsolution by applying a graph mining technique. Different from the existing path-basedmethods; our approach; called gIndex; makes use of frequent substructure as the basicindexing feature. Frequent substructures are ideal candidates since they explore the intrinsiccharacteristics of the data and are relatively stable to database updates. To reduce the sizeof index structure; two techniques; size-increasing support constraint and discriminativefragments; are introduced. Our performance study shows that gIndex has 10 times smaller …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,686
Mining frequent patterns in data streams at multiple time granularities,Chris Giannella; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu,Abstract: Although frequent-pattern mining has been widely studied and used; it ischallenging to extend it to data streams. Compared to mining from a static transaction dataset; the streaming case has far more information to track and far greater complexity tomanage. Infrequent items can become frequent later on and hence cannot be ignored. Thestorage structure needs to be dynamically adjusted to reflect the evolution of itemsetfrequencies over time. In this paper; we propose computing and maintaining all the frequentpatterns (which is usually more stable and smaller than the streaming data) and dynamicallyupdating them with the incoming data streams. We extended the framework to mine time-sensitive patterns with approximate support guarantee. We incrementally maintain tilted-timewindows for each pattern at multiple time granularities.

Pathsim: Meta path-based top-k similarity search in heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Tianyi Wu,ABSTRACT Similarity search is a primitive operation in database and Web search engines.With the advent of large-scale heterogeneous information networks that consist of multi-typed; interconnected objects; such as the bibliographic networks and social medianetworks; it is important to study similarity search in such networks. Intuitively; two objectsare similar if they are linked by many paths in the network. However; most existing similaritymeasures are defined for homogeneous networks. Different semantic meanings behindpaths are not taken into consideration. Thus they cannot be directly applied toheterogeneous networks. In this paper; we study similarity search that is defined among thesame type of objects in heterogeneous networks. Moreover; by considering different linkagepaths in a network; one could derive various similarity semantics. Therefore; we introduce …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,505
SOBER: statistical model-based bug localization,Chao Liu; Xifeng Yan; Long Fei; Jiawei Han; Samuel P Midkiff,Abstract Automated localization of software bugs is one of the essential issues in debuggingaids. Previous studies indicated that the evaluation history of program predicates maydisclose important clues about underlying bugs. In this paper; we propose a new statisticalmodel-based approach; called SOBER; which localizes software bugs without any priorknowledge of program semantics. Unlike existing statistical debugging approaches thatselect predicates correlated with program failures; SOBER models evaluation patterns ofpredicates in both correct and incorrect runs respectively and regards a predicate as bug-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrect runs differs significantly from that in correct ones.SOBER features a principled quantification of the pattern difference that measures the bug-relevance of program predicates. We systematically evaluated our approach under the …,ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes,2005,418
Discriminative frequent pattern analysis for effective classification,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Chih-Wei Hsu,The application of frequent patterns in classification appeared in sporadic studies andachieved initial success in the classification of relational data; text documents and graphs. Inthis paper; we conduct a systematic exploration of frequent pattern-based classification; andprovide solid reasons supporting this methodology. It was well known that featurecombinations (patterns) could capture more underlying semantics than single features.However; inclusion of infrequent patterns may not significantly improve the accuracy due totheir limited predictive power. By building a connection between pattern frequency anddiscriminative measures such as information gain and Fisher score; we develop a strategy toset minimum support in frequent pattern mining for generating useful patterns. Based on thisstrategy; coupled with a proposed feature selection algorithm; discriminative frequent …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,370
Mining coherent dense subgraphs across massive biological networks for functional discovery,Haiyan Hu; Xifeng Yan; Yu Huang; Jiawei Han; Xianghong Jasmine Zhou,Abstract Motivation: The rapid accumulation of biological network data translates into anurgent need for computational methods for graph pattern mining. One important problem isto identify recurrent patterns across multiple networks to discover biological modules.However; existing algorithms for frequent pattern mining become very costly in time andspace as the pattern sizes and network numbers increase. Currently; no efficient algorithm isavailable for mining recurrent patterns across large collections of genome-wide networks.Results: We developed a novel algorithm; CODENSE; to efficiently mine frequent coherentdense subgraphs across large numbers of massive graphs. Compared with previousmethods; our approach is scalable in the number and size of the input graphs andadjustable in terms of exact or approximate pattern mining.

Substructure similarity search in graph databases,Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Advanced database systems face a great challenge raised by the emergence ofmassive; complex structural data in bioinformatics; chem-informatics; and many otherapplications. The most fundamental support needed in these applications is the efficientsearch of complex structured data. Since exact matching is often too restrictive; similaritysearch of complex structures becomes a vital operation that must be supported efficiently. Inthis paper; we investigate the issues of substructure similarity search using indexed featuresin graph databases. By transforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into themaximum allowed missing features; our structural filtering algorithm; called Grafil; can filtermany graphs without performing pairwise similarity computations. It is further shown thatusing either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,318
Mining significant graph patterns by leap search,Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Abstract With ever-increasing amounts of graph data from disparate sources; there has beena strong need for exploiting significant graph patterns with user-specified objective functions.Most objective functions are not antimonotonic; which could fail all of frequency-centricgraph mining algorithms. In this paper; we give the first comprehensive study on generalmining method aiming to find most significant patterns directly. Our new mining framework;called LEAP (Descending Leap Mine); is developed to exploit the correlation betweenstructural similarity and significance similarity in a way that the most significant pattern couldbe identified quickly by searching dissimilar graph patterns. Two novel concepts; structuralleap search and frequency descending mining; are proposed to support leap search ingraph pattern space.

Statistical debugging: A hypothesis testing-based approach,Chao Liu; Long Fei; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Samuel P Midkiff,Manual debugging is tedious; as well as costly. The high cost has motivated thedevelopment of fault localization techniques; which help developers search for faultlocations. In this paper; we propose a new statistical method; called SOBER; whichautomatically localizes software faults without any prior knowledge of the programsemantics. Unlike existing statistical approaches that select predicates correlated withprogram failures; SOBER models the predicate evaluation in both correct and incorrectexecutions and regards a predicate as fault-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrectexecutions significantly diverges from that in correct ones. Featuring a rationale similar tothat of hypothesis testing; SOBER quantifies the fault relevance of each predicate in aprincipled way. We systematically evaluate SOBER under the same setting as previous …,IEEE Transactions on software engineering,2006,269
Mining compressed frequent-pattern sets,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng,Abstract A major challenge in frequent-pattern mining is the sheer size of its mining results.In many cases; a high min_sup threshold may discover only commonsense patterns but alow one may generate an explosive number of output patterns; which severely restricts itsusage. In this paper; we study the problem of compressing frequent-pattern sets. Typically;frequent patterns can be clustered with a tightness measure δ (called δ-cluster); and arepresentative pattern can be selected for each cluster. Unfortunately; finding a minimum setof representative patterns is NP-Hard. We develop two greedy methods; RPglobal andRPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compression bound but higher computationalcomplexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds but is far more efficient. Ourperformance study shows that the compression quality using RPlocal is very close to …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,250
IncSpan: incremental mining of sequential patterns in large database,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many real life sequence databases grow incrementally. It is undesirable to minesequential patterns from scratch each time when a small set of sequences grow; or whensome new sequences are added into the database. Incremental algorithm should bedeveloped for sequential pattern mining so that mining can be adapted to incrementaldatabase updates. However; it is nontrivial to mine sequential patterns incrementally;especially when the existing sequences grow incrementally because such growth may leadto the generation of many new patterns due to the interactions of the growing subsequenceswith the original ones. In this study; we develop an efficient algorithm; IncSpan; forincremental mining of sequential patterns; by exploring some interesting properties. Ourperformance study shows that IncSpan outperforms some previously proposed …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,245
TSP: Mining top-k closed sequential patterns,Petre Tzvetkov; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Sequential pattern mining has been studied extensively in the data miningcommunity. Most previous studies require the specification of a min _ support threshold formining a complete set of sequential patterns satisfying the threshold. However; in practice; itis difficult for users to provide an appropriate min _ support threshold. To overcome thisdifficulty; we propose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed sequentialpatterns of length no less than min _ℓ; where k is the desired number of closed sequentialpatterns to be mined and min _ℓ is the minimal length of each pattern. We mine the set ofclosed patterns because it is a compact representation of the complete set of frequentpatterns. An efficient algorithm; called TSP; is developed for mining such patterns withoutmin _ support. Starting at (absolute) min _ support= 1; the algorithm makes use of the …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2005,231
Summarizing itemset patterns: a profile-based approach,Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; Dong Xin,Abstract Frequent-pattern mining has been studied extensively on scalable methods formining various kinds of patterns including itemsets; sequences; and graphs. However; thebottleneck of frequent-pattern mining is not at the efficiency but at the interpretability; due tothe huge number of patterns generated by the mining process. In this paper; we examinehow to summarize a collection of itemset patterns using only K representatives; a smallnumber of patterns that a user can handle easily. The K representatives should not onlycover most of the frequent patterns but also approximate their supports. A generative modelis built to extract and profile these representatives; under which the supports of the patternscan be easily recovered without consulting the original dataset. Based on the restorationerror; we propose a quality measure function to determine the optimal value of parameter …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,222
Direct discriminative pattern mining for effective classification,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,The application of frequent patterns in classification has demonstrated its power in recentstudies. It often adopts a two-step approach: frequent pattern (or classification rule) miningfollowed by feature selection (or rule ranking). However; this two-step process could becomputationally expensive; especially when the problem scale is large or the minimumsupport is low. It was observed that frequent pattern mining usually produces a huge numberof" patterns" that could not only slow down the mining process but also make featureselection hard to complete. In this paper; we propose a direct discriminative pattern miningapproach; DDPMine; to tackle the efficiency issue arising from the two-step approach.DDPMine performs a branch-and-bound search for directly mining discriminative patternswithout generating the complete pattern set.

EntityRank: searching entities directly and holistically,Tao Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract As the Web has evolved into a data-rich repository; with the standard" page view;"current search engines are becoming increasingly inadequate for a wide range of querytasks. While we often search for various data" entities"(eg; phone number; paper PDF; date);today's engines only take us indirectly to pages. While entities appear in many pages;current engines only find each page individually. Toward searching directly and holisticallyfor finding information of finer granularity; we study the problem of entity search; a significantdeparture from traditional document retrieval. We focus on the core challenge of rankingentities; by distilling its underlying conceptual model Impression Model and developing aprobabilistic ranking framework; EntityRank; that is able to seamlessly integrate both localand global information in ranking.

Mining hidden community in heterogeneous social networks,Deng Cai; Zheng Shao; Xiaofei He; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Communitymining is one of the major directions in social network analysis. Most of the existing methodson community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network; andmoreover; the mining results are independent of the users' needs or preferences. However;in reality; there exist multiple; heterogeneous social networks; each representing a particularkind of relationship; and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task.Thus mining networks by assuming only one kind of relation may miss a lot of valuablehidden community information and may not be adaptable to the diverse information needsfrom different users.

Synthesizing near-optimal malware specifications from suspicious behaviors,Matt Fredrikson; Somesh Jha; Mihai Christodorescu; Reiner Sailer; Xifeng Yan,Fueled by an emerging underground economy; malware authors are exploitingvulnerabilities at an alarming rate. To make matters worse; obfuscation tools are commonlyavailable; and much of the malware is open source; leading to a huge number of variants.Behavior-based detection techniques are a promising solution to this growing problem.However; these detectors require precise specifications of malicious behavior that do notresult in an excessive number of false alarms. In this paper; we present an automatictechnique for extracting optimally discriminative specifications; which uniquely identify aclass of programs. Such a discriminative specification can be used by a behavior-basedmalware detector. Our technique; based on graph mining and concept analysis; scales tolarge classes of programs due to probabilistic sampling of the specification space.

Mining closed relational graphs with connectivity constraints,Xifeng Yan; X Zhou; Jiawei Han,Abstract Relational graphs are widely used in modeling large scale networks such asbiological networks and social networks. In this kind of graph; connectivity becomes criticalin identifying highly associated groups and clusters. In this paper; we investigate the issuesof mining closed frequent graphs with connectivity constraints in massive relational graphswhere each graph has around 10K nodes and 1M edges. We adopt the concept of edgeconnectivity and apply the results from graph theory; to speed up the mining process. Twoapproaches are developed to handle different mining requests: CloseCut; a pattern-growthapproach; and splat; a pattern-reduction approach. We have applied these methods inbiological datasets and found the discovered patterns interesting.,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,169
Pathselclus: Integrating meta-path selection with user-guided object clustering in heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Brandon Norick; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Xiao Yu,Abstract Real-world; multiple-typed objects are often interconnected; forming heterogeneousinformation networks. A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is theirpotential to generate many different results; carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. Inorder to generate desired clustering; we propose to use meta-path; a path that connectsobject types via a sequence of relations; to control clustering with distinct semantics.Nevertheless; it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (seeds) than a weightedcombination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus; wepropose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects innetworks; where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster asguidance. Then the system learns the weight for each meta-path that is consistent with the …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2013,166

To efficiently provision computing resources in the cloud;system administrators need the capabilities of characterizing and predicting workload on theVirtual Machines (VMs). In this paper; we use data traces obtained from a real data center todevelop such capabilities. First; we search for repeatable workload patterns by exploringcross-VM workload correlations resulted from the dependencies among applicationsrunning on different VMs. Treating workload data samples as time series; we develop a co-clustering technique to identify groups of VMs that frequently exhibit correlated workloadpatterns; and also the time periods in which these VM groups are active.

Graph OLAP: Towards online analytical processing on graphs,Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) is an important notion in data analysis. Recently;more and more graph or networked data sources come into being. There exists a similarneed to deploy graph analysis from different perspectives and with multiple granularities.However; traditional OLAP technology cannot handle such demands because it does notconsider the links among individual data tuples. In this paper; we develop a novel graphOLAP framework; which presents a multi-dimensional and multi-level view over graphs. Thecontributions of this work are two-fold. First; starting from basic definitions; ie; what aredimensions and measures in the graph OLAP scenario; we develop a conceptual frameworkfor data cubes on graphs. We also look into different semantics of OLAP operations; andclassify the framework into two major subcases: informational OLAP and topological …,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08.

Direct mining of discriminative and essential frequent patterns via model-based search tree,Wei Fan; Kun Zhang; Hong Cheng; Jing Gao; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Philip Yu; Olivier Verscheure,Abstract Frequent patterns provide solutions to datasets that do not have well-structuredfeature vectors. However; frequent pattern mining is non-trivial since the number of uniquepatterns is exponential but many are non-discriminative and correlated. Currently; frequentpattern mining is performed in two sequential steps: enumerating a set of frequent patterns;followed by feature selection. Although many methods have been proposed in the past fewyears on how to perform each separate step efficiently; there is still limited success ineventually finding highly compact and discriminative patterns. The culprit is due to theinherent nature of this widely adopted two-step approach. This paper discusses theseproblems and proposes a new and different method. It builds a decision tree that partitionsthe data onto different nodes. Then at each node; it directly discovers a discriminative …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,136
Towards effective partition management for large graphs,Shengqi Yang; Xifeng Yan; Bo Zong; Arijit Khan,Abstract Searching and mining large graphs today is critical to a variety of applicationdomains; ranging from community detection in social networks; to de novo genomesequence assembly. Scalable processing of large graphs requires careful partitioning anddistribution of graphs across clusters. In this paper; we investigate the problem of managinglarge-scale graphs in clusters and study access characteristics of local graph queries suchas breadth-first search; random walk; and SPARQL queries; which are popular in realapplications. These queries exhibit strong access locality; and therefore require specific datapartitioning strategies.

Mining behavior graphs for “backtrace” of noncrashing bugs,Chao Liu; Xifeng Yan; Hwanjo Yu; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Abstract Analyzing the executions of a buggy software program is essentially a data miningprocess. Although many interesting methods have been developed to trace crashing bugs(such as memory violation and core dumps); it is still difficult to analyze noncrashing bugs(such as logical errors). In this paper; we develop a novel method to classify the structuredtraces of program executions using software behavior graphs. By analyzing the correct andincorrect executions; we have made good progress at the isolation of program regions thatmay lead to the faulty executions. The classification framework is built on an integration ofclosed graph mining and SVM classification. More interestingly; suspicious regions areidentified through the capture of the classification accuracy change; which is measuredincrementally during program execution.

Identifying bug signatures using discriminative graph mining,Hong Cheng; David Lo; Yang Zhou; Xiaoyin Wang; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Bug localization has attracted a lot of attention recently. Most existing methodsfocus on pinpointing a single statement or function call which is very likely to contain bugs.Although such methods could be very accurate; it is usually very hard for developers tounderstand the context of the bug; given each bug location in isolation. In this study; wepropose to model software executions with graphs at two levels of granularity: methods andbasic blocks. An individual node represents a method or basic block and an edgerepresents a method call; method return or transition (at the method or basic blockgranularity). Given a set of graphs of correct and faulty executions; we propose to extract themost discriminative subgraphs which contrast the program flow of correct and faultyexecutions. The extracted subgraphs not only pinpoint the bug; but also provide an …,Proceedings of the eighteenth international symposium on Software testing and analysis,2009,128
Extracting redundancy-aware top-k patterns,Dong Xin; Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Observed in many applications; there is a potential need of extracting a small set offrequent patterns having not only high significance but also low redundancy. Thesignificance is usually defined by the context of applications. Previous studies have beenconcentrating on how to compute top-k significant patterns or how to remove redundancyamong patterns separately. There is limited work on finding those top-k patterns whichdemonstrate high-significance and low-redundancy simultaneously. In this paper; we studythe problem of extracting redundancy-aware top-k patterns from a large collection offrequent patterns. We first examine the evaluation functions for measuring the combinedsignificance of a pattern set and propose the MMS (Maximal Marginal Significance) as theproblem formulation. The problem is known as NP-hard. We further present a greedy …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,124
Graph indexing based on discriminative frequent structure analysis,Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Graphs have become increasingly important in modelling complicated structuresand schemaless data such as chemical compounds; proteins; and XML documents. Given agraph query; it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via indices. Inthis article; we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novel indexingmodel based on discriminative frequent structures that are identified through a graph miningprocess. We show that the compact index built under this model can achieve betterperformance in processing graph queries. Since discriminative frequent structures capturethe intrinsic characteristics of the data; they are relatively stable to database updates; thusfacilitating sampling-based feature extraction and incremental index maintenance.

Neighborhood based fast graph search in large networks,Arijit Khan; Nan Li; Xifeng Yan; Ziyu Guan; Supriyo Chakraborty; Shu Tao,Abstract Complex social and information network search becomes important with a variety ofapplications. In the core of these applications; lies a common and critical problem: Given alabeled network and a query graph; how to efficiently search the query graph in the targetnetwork. The presence of noise and the incomplete knowledge about the structure andcontent of the target network make it unrealistic to find an exact match. Rather; it is moreappealing to find the top-k approximate matches. In this paper; we propose a neighborhood-based similarity measure that could avoid costly graph isomorphism and edit distancecomputation. Under this new measure; we prove that subgraph similarity search is NP hard;while graph similarity match is polynomial. By studying the principles behind this measure;we found an information propagation model that is able to convert a large network into a …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,108
Near-optimal supervised feature selection among frequent subgraphs,Marisa Thoma; Hong Cheng; Arthur Gretton; Jiawei Han; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Alex Smola; Le Song; Philip S Yu; Xifeng Yan; Karsten Borgwardt,Abstract Graph classification is an increasingly important step in numerous applicationdomains; such as function prediction of molecules and proteins; computerised sceneanalysis; and anomaly detection in program flows. Among the various approaches proposedin the literature; graph classification based on frequent subgraphs is a popular branch:Graphs are represented as (usually binary) vectors; with components indicating whether agraph contains a particular subgraph that is frequent across the dataset. On large graphs;however; one faces the enormous problem that the number of these frequent subgraphsmay grow exponentially with the size of the graphs; but only few of them possess enoughdiscriminative power to make them useful for graph classification. Efficient and discriminativefeature selection among frequent subgraphs is hence a key challenge for graph mining …,*,2009,103
Mining colossal frequent patterns by core pattern fusion,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip; Hong Cheng,Extensive research for frequent-pattern mining in the past decade has brought forth anumber of pattern mining algorithms that are both effective and efficient. However; theexisting frequent-pattern mining algorithms encounter challenges at mining rather largepatterns; called colossal frequent patterns; in the presence of an explosive number offrequent patterns. Colossal patterns are critical to many applications; especially in domainslike bioinformatics. In this study; we investigate a novel mining approach called pattern-fusion to efficiently find a good approximation to the colossal patterns. With Pattern-Fusion; acolossal pattern is discovered by fusing its small core patterns in one step; whereas theincremental pattern-growth mining strategies; such as those adopted in Apriori and FP-growth; have to examine a large number of mid-sized ones.

Towards graph containment search and indexing,Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han; Dong-Qing Zhang; Xiaohui Gu,Abstract Given a set of model graphs D and a query graph q; containment search aims tofind all model graphs g ε D such that q contains g (q⊇ g). Due to the wide adoption of graphmodels; fast containment search of graph data finds many applications in various domains.In comparison to traditional graph search that retrieves all the graphs containing q (q⊆ g);containment search has its own indexing characteristics that have not yet been examined. Inthis paper; we perform a systematic study on these characteristics and propose a contrastsubgraph-based indexing model; called cIndex. Contrast subgraphs capture the structuredifferences between model graphs and query graphs; and are thus perfect for indexing dueto their high selectivity.

Interpreting the public sentiment variations on twitter,Shulong Tan; Yang Li; Huan Sun; Ziyu Guan; Xifeng Yan; Jiajun Bu; Chun Chen; Xiaofei He,Millions of users share their opinions on Twitter; making it a valuable platform for trackingand analyzing public sentiment. Such tracking and analysis can provide critical informationfor decision making in various domains. Therefore it has attracted attention in both academiaand industry. Previous research mainly focused on modeling and tracking public sentiment.In this work; we move one step further to interpret sentiment variations. We observed thatemerging topics (named foreground topics) within the sentiment variation periods are highlyrelated to the genuine reasons behind the variations. Based on this observation; we proposea Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based model; Foreground and Background LDA (FB-LDA); to distill foreground topics and filter out longstanding background topics. Theseforeground topics can give potential interpretations of the sentiment variations. To further …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2014,96
A graph-based approach to systematically reconstruct human transcriptional regulatory modules,Xifeng Yan; Michael R Mehan; Yu Huang; Michael S Waterman; Philip S Yu; Xianghong Jasmine Zhou,Abstract Motivation: A major challenge in studying gene regulation is to systematicallyreconstruct transcription regulatory modules; which are defined as sets of genes that areregulated by a common set of transcription factors. A commonly used approach fortranscription module reconstruction is to derive coexpression clusters from a microarraydataset. However; such results often contain false positives because genes from manytranscription modules may be simultaneously perturbed upon a given type of conditions. Inthis study; we propose and validate that genes; which form a coexpression cluster in multiplemicroarray datasets across diverse conditions; are more likely to form a transcriptionmodule. However; identifying genes coexpressed in a subset of many microarray datasets isnot a trivial computational problem. Results: We propose a graph-based data-mining …,Bioinformatics,2007,96
Nema: Fast graph search with label similarity,Arijit Khan; Yinghui Wu; Charu C Aggarwal; Xifeng Yan,Abstract It is increasingly common to find real-life data represented as networks of labeled;heterogeneous entities. To query these networks; one often needs to identify the matches ofa given query graph in a (typically large) network modeled as a target graph. Due to noiseand the lack of fixed schema in the target graph; the query graph can substantially differ fromits matches in the target graph in both structure and node labels; thus bringing challenges tothe graph querying tasks. In this paper; we propose NeMa (Network Match); a neighborhood-based subgraph matching technique for querying real-life networks.(1) To measure thequality of the match; we propose a novel subgraph matching cost metric that aggregates thecosts of matching individual nodes; and unifies both structure and node label similarities.(2)Based on the metric; we formulate the minimum cost subgraph matching problem.

gPrune: a constraint pushing framework for graph pattern mining,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,Abstract In graph mining applications; there has been an increasingly strong urge forimposing user-specified constraints on the mining results. However; unlike most traditionalitemset constraints; structural constraints; such as density and diameter of a graph; are veryhard to be pushed deep into the mining process. In this paper; we give the firstcomprehensive study on the pruning properties of both traditional and structural constraintsaiming to reduce not only the pattern search space but the data search space as well. A newgeneral framework; called gPrune; is proposed to incorporate all the constraints in such away that they recursively reinforce each other through the entire mining process. A newconcept; Pattern-inseparable Data-antimonotonicity; is proposed to handle the structuralconstraints unique in the context of graph; which; combined with known pruning …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2007,89
gapprox: Mining frequent approximate patterns from a massive network,Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han,Recently; there arise a large number of graphs with massive sizes and complex structures inmany new applications; such as biological networks; social networks; and the Web;demanding powerful data mining methods. Due to inherent noise or data diversity; it iscrucial to address the issue of approximation; if one wants to mine patterns that arepotentially interesting with tolerable variations. In this paper; we investigate the problem ofmining frequent approximate patterns from a massive network and propose a method calledgApprox. gApprox not only finds approximate network patterns; which is the key for manyknowledge discovery applications on structural data; but also enriches the library of graphmining methodologies by introducing several novel techniques such as:(1) a complete andredundancy-free strategy to explore the new pattern space faced by gApprox; and (2) …,Data Mining; 2007.

Systematic discovery of functional modules and context-specific functional annotation of human genome,Yu Huang; Haifeng Li; Haiyan Hu; Xifeng Yan; Michael S Waterman; Haiyan Huang; Xianghong Jasmine Zhou,Abstract Motivation: The rapid accumulation of microarray datasets provides uniqueopportunities to perform systematic functional characterization of the human genome. Wedesigned a graph-based approach to integrate cross-platform microarray data; and extractrecurrent expression patterns. A series of microarray datasets can be modeled as a series ofco-expression networks; in which we search for frequently occurring network patterns. Theintegrative approach provides three major advantages over the commonly used microarrayanalysis methods:(1) enhance signal to noise separation (2) identify functionally relatedgenes without co-expression and (3) provide a way to predict gene functions in a context-specific way.

Link mining: Models; algorithms; and applications,S Yu Philip; Jiawei Han; Christos Faloutsos,With the recent flourishing research activities on Web search and mining; social networkanalysis; information network analysis; information retrieval; link analysis; and structural datamining; research on link mining has been rapidly growing; forming a new field of datamining. Traditional data mining focuses on “flat” or “isolated” data in which each data objectis represented as an independent attribute vector. However; many real-world data sets areinter-connected; much richer in structure; involving objects of heterogeneous types andcomplex links. Hence; the study of link mining will have a high impact on various importantapplications such as Web and text mining; social network analysis; collaborative filtering;and bioinformatics. As an emerging research field; there are currently no books focusing onthe theory and techniques as well as the related applications for link mining; especially …,*,2010,73
Efficient ticket routing by resolution sequence mining,Qihong Shao; Yi Chen; Shu Tao; Xifeng Yan; Nikos Anerousis,Abstract IT problem management calls for quick identification of resolvers to reportedproblems. The efficiency of this process highly depends on ticket routing---transferringproblem ticket among various expert groups in search of the right resolver to the ticket. Toachieve efficient ticket routing; wise decision needs to be made at each step of ticket transferto determine which expert group is likely to be; or to lead to the resolver. In this paper; weaddress the possibility of improving ticket routing efficiency by mining ticket resolutionsequences alone; without accessing ticket content. To demonstrate this possibility; a Markovmodel is developed to statistically capture the right decisions that have been made towardproblem resolution; where the order of the Markov model is carefully chosen according tothe conditional entropy obtained from ticket data.

Mining evidences for named entity disambiguation,Yang Li; Chi Wang; Fangqiu Han; Jiawei Han; Dan Roth; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Named entity disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentionsin natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a knowledge basesuch as Wikipedia. Such disambiguation can help enhance readability and add semantics toplain text. It is also a central step in constructing high-quality information network orknowledge graph from unstructured text. Previous research has tackled this problem bymaking use of various textual and structural features from a knowledge base. Most of theproposed algorithms assume that a knowledge base can provide enough explicit and usefulinformation to help disambiguate a mention to the right entity. However; the existingknowledge bases are rarely complete (likely will never be); thus leading to poorperformance on short queries with not well-known contexts. In such cases; we need to …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,70

Responding to thisemerging trend; graphs have been growing rapidly and showing their critical importance inmany applications; such as the analysis of XML; social networks; Web; biological data;multimedia data and spatiotemporal data. Can we extend useful functions of databases anddata warehouse systems to handle graph structured data? In particular; OLAP (On-LineAnalytical Processing) has been a popular tool for fast and user-friendly multi-dimensionalanalysis of data warehouses. Can we OLAP graphs?

From sequential pattern mining to structured pattern mining: a pattern-growth approach,Jia-Wei Han; Jian Pei; Xi-Feng Yan,Abstract Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broadapplications. However; it is also a challenging problem since the mining may have togenerate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences.Recent studies have developed two major classes of sequential pattern mining methods:(1)a candidate generation-and-test approach; represented by (i) GSP; a horizontal format-based sequential pattern mining method; and (ii) SPADE; a vertical format-based method;and (2) a pattern-growth method; represented by PrefixSpan and its further extensions; suchas gSpan for mining structured patterns.

Searching substructures with superimposed distance,Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Efficient indexing techniques have been developed for the exact and approximatesubstructure search in large scale graph databases. Unfortunately; the retrieval problem ofstructures with categorical or geometric distance constraints is not solved yet. In this paper;we develop a method called PIS (Partition-based Graph Index and Search) to supportsimilarity search on substructures with superimposed distance constraints. PIS selectsdiscriminative fragments in a query graph and uses an index to prune the graphs that violatethe distance constraints. We identify a criterion to distinguish the selectivity of fragments inmultiple graphs and develop a partition method to obtain a set of highly selective fragments;which is able to improve the pruning performance. Experimental results show that PIS iseffective in processing real graph queries.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,68
Feature-based similarity search in graph structures,Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Similarity search of complex structures is an important operation in graph-relatedapplications since exact matching is often too restrictive. In this article; we investigate theissues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. Bytransforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed featuremisses; our structural filtering algorithm can filter graphs without performing pairwisesimilarity computation. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features canresult in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature setselection strategy that could maximize the filtering capability. We prove that the complexity ofoptimal feature set selection is Ω (2 m) in the worst case; where m is the number of featuresfor selection. In practice; we identify several criteria to build effective feature sets for …,ACM Transactions on Database systems (TODS),2006,61

Mining top-k large structural patterns in a massive network,Feida Zhu; Qiang Qu; David Lo; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,ABSTRACT With ever-growing popularity of social networks; web and bio-networks; mininglarge frequent patterns from a single huge network has become increasingly important. Yetthe existing pattern mining methods cannot offer the efficiency desirable for large patterndiscovery. We propose Spider-Mine; a novel algorithm to efficiently mine top-K largestfrequent patterns from a single massive network with any user-specified probability of 1− ϵ.Deviating from the existing edge-by-edge (ie; incremental) pattern-growth framework;SpiderMine achieves its efficiency by unleashing the power of small patterns of a boundeddiameter; which we call “spiders”. With the spider structure; our approach adopts aprobabilistic mining framework to find the top-k largest patterns by (i) identifying anaffordable set of promising growth paths toward large patterns;(ii) generating large …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,56
Mining graph patterns efficiently via randomized summaries,Chen Chen; Cindy X Lin; Matt Fredrikson; Mihai Christodorescu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Graphs are prevalent in many domains such as Bioinformatics; social networks;Web and cyber-security. Graph pattern mining has become an important tool in themanagement and analysis of complexly structured data; where example applicationsinclude indexing; clustering and classification. Existing graph mining algorithms haveachieved great success by exploiting various properties in the pattern space. Unfortunately;due to the fundamental role subgraph isomorphism plays in these methods; they may allenter into a pitfall when the cost to enumerate a huge set of isomorphic embeddings blowsup; especially in large graphs. The solution we propose for this problem resorts to reductionon the data space. For each graph; we build a summary of it and mine this shrunk graphinstead.

Top-k interesting subgraph discovery in information networks,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Xifeng Yan; Hasan Cam; Jiawei Han,In the real world; various systems can be modeled using heterogeneous networks whichconsist of entities of different types. Many problems on such networks can be mapped to anunderlying critical problem of discovering top-K subgraphs of entities with rare andsurprising associations. Answering such subgraph queries efficiently involves two mainchallenges:(1) computing all matching subgraphs which satisfy the query and (2) rankingsuch results based on the rarity and the interestingness of the associations among entities inthe subgraphs. Previous work on the matching problem can be harnessed for a naïveranking-after-matching solution. However; for large graphs; subgraph queries may haveenormous number of matches; and so it is inefficient to compute all matches when only thetop-K matches are desired.

Efficient topological OLAP on information networks,Qiang Qu; Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip; Hongyan Li,Abstract We propose a framework for efficient OLAP on information networks with a focus onthe most interesting kind; the topological OLAP (called “T-OLAP”); which incurs topologicalchanges in the underlying networks. T-OLAP operations generate new networks from theoriginal ones by rolling up a subset of nodes chosen by certain constraint criteria. The keychallenge is to efficiently compute measures for the newly generated networks and handleuser queries with varied constraints. Two effective computational techniques; T-Distributiveness and T-Monotonicity are proposed to achieve efficient query processing andcube materialization. We also provide a T-OLAP query processing framework into whichthese techniques are weaved. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work to give aframework study for topological OLAP on information networks.

Generative models for ticket resolution in expert networks,Gengxin Miao; Louise E Moser; Xifeng Yan; Shu Tao; Yi Chen; Nikos Anerousis,Abstract Ticket resolution is a critical; yet challenging; aspect of the delivery of IT services. Alarge service provider needs to handle; on a daily basis; thousands of tickets that reportvarious types of problems. Many of those tickets bounce among multiple expert groupsbefore being transferred to the group with the right expertise to solve the problem. Finding amethodology that reduces such bouncing and hence shortens ticket resolution time is a long-standing challenge. In this paper; we present a unified generative model; the OptimizedNetwork Model (ONM); that characterizes the lifecycle of a ticket; using both the content andthe routing sequence of the ticket. ONM uses maximum likelihood estimation; to representhow the information contained in a ticket is used by human experts to make ticket routingdecisions.

Towards proximity pattern mining in large graphs,Arijit Khan; Xifeng Yan; Kun-Lung Wu,Abstract Mining graph patterns in large networks is critical to a variety of applications suchas malware detection and biological module discovery. However; frequent subgraphs areoften ineffective to capture association existing in these applications; due to the complexityof isomorphism testing and the inelastic pattern definition. In this paper; we introduceproximity pattern which is a significant departure from the traditional concept of frequentsubgraphs. Defined as a set of labels that co-occur in neighborhoods; proximity pattern blursthe boundary between itemset and structure. It relaxes the rigid structure constraint offrequent subgraphs; while introducing connectivity to frequent itemsets. Therefore; it canbenefit from both: efficient mining in itemsets and structure proximity from graphs. Wedeveloped two models to define proximity patterns.

Synthetic review spamming and defense,Huan Sun; Alex Morales; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Online reviews have been popularly adopted in many applications. Since they caneither promote or harm the reputation of a product or a service; buying and selling fakereviews becomes a profitable business and a big threat. In this paper; we introduce a verysimple; but powerful review spamming technique that could fail the existing feature-baseddetection algorithms easily. It uses one truthful review as a template; and replaces itssentences with those from other reviews in a repository. Fake reviews generated by thismechanism are extremely hard to detect: Both the state-of-the-art computational approachesand human readers acquire an error rate of 35%-48%; just slightly better than a randomguess. While it is challenging to detect such fake reviews; we have made solid progress insuppressing them.

On flow authority discovery in social networks,Charu C Aggarwal; Arijit Khan; Xifeng Yan,Abstract A central characteristic of social networks is that it facilitates rapid dissemination ofinformation between large groups of individuals. This paper will examine the problem ofdetermination of information flow representatives; a small group of authoritativerepresentatives to whom the dissemination of a piece of information leads to the maximumspread. Clearly; information flow is affected by a number of different structural factors suchas the node degree; connectivity; intensity of information flow interaction and the globalstructural behavior of the underlying network. We will propose a stochastic information flowmodel; and use it to determine the authoritative representatives in the underlying socialnetwork.

Efficient multicasting for delay tolerant networks using graph indexing,Misael Mongiovì; Ambuj K Singh; Xifeng Yan; Bo Zong; Konstantinos Psounis,In Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs); end-to-end connectivity between nodes does not alwaysoccur due to limited radio coverage; node mobility and other factors. Remote communicationmay assist in guaranteeing delivery. However; it has a considerable cost; and consequently;minimizing it is an important task. For multicast routing; the problem is NP-hard; and naiveapproaches are infeasible on large problem instances. In this paper we define the problemof minimizing the remote communication cost for multicast in DTNs.

Discriminative frequent subgraph mining with optimality guarantees,Marisa Thoma; Hong Cheng; Arthur Gretton; Jiawei Han; Hans‐Peter Kriegel; Alex Smola; Le Song; Philip S Yu; Xifeng Yan; Karsten M Borgwardt,Abstract The goal of frequent subgraph mining is to detect subgraphs that frequently occur ina dataset of graphs. In classification settings; one is often interested in discoveringdiscriminative frequent subgraphs; whose presence or absence is indicative of the classmembership of a graph. In this article; we propose an approach to feature selection onfrequent subgraphs; called CORK; that combines two central advantages. First; it optimizes asubmodular quality criterion; which means that we can yield a near-optimal solution usinggreedy feature selection. Second; our submodular quality function criterion can beintegrated into gSpan; the state-of-the-art tool for frequent subgraph mining; and help toprune the search space for discriminative frequent subgraphs even during frequentsubgraph mining.

Querying knowledge graphs by example entity tuples,Nandish Jayaram; Arijit Khan; Chengkai Li; Xifeng Yan; Ramez Elmasri,We witness an unprecedented proliferation of knowledge graphs that record millions ofentities and their relationships. While knowledge graphs are structure-flexible and content-rich; they are difficult to use. The challenge lies in the gap between their overwhelmingcomplexity and the limited database knowledge of non-professional users. If writingstructured queries over “simple” tables is difficult; complex graphs are only harder to query.As an initial step toward improving the usability of knowledge graphs; we propose to querysuch data by example entity tuples; without requiring users to form complex graph queries.Our system; Graph Query By Example (GQBE); automatically discovers a weighted hiddenmaximum query graph based on input query tuples; to capture a user's query intent.

In this chapter; we first examine the existing frequent subgraph miningalgorithms and discuss their computational bottleneck. Then we introduce recent studies onmining various types of graph patterns; including significant; representative and densesubgraph patterns. We also discuss the mining tasks in new problem settings such as agraph stream and an uncertain graph model. These new mining algorithms represent thestate-of-the-art graph mining techniques: they not only avoid the exponential size of miningresult; but also improve the applicability of graph patterns significantly.,*,2014,37
Efficient discovery of frequent approximate sequential patterns,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,We propose an efficient algorithm for mining frequent approximate sequential patterns underthe Hamming distance model. Our algorithm gains its efficiency by adopting a" break-down-and-build-up" methodology. The" breakdown" is based on the observation that alloccurrences of a frequent pattern can be classified into groups; which we call strands. Wedeveloped efficient algorithms to quickly mine out all strands by iterative growth. In the" build-up" stage; these strands are grouped up to form the support sets from which all approximatepatterns would be identified. A salient feature of our algorithm is its ability to grow thefrequent patterns by iteratively assembling building blocks of significant sizes in a localsearch fashion. By avoiding incremental growth and global search; we achieve greaterefficiency without losing the completeness of the mining result. Our experimental studies …,Data Mining; 2007. ICDM 2007.

On compressing frequent patterns,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng,Abstract A major challenge in frequent-pattern mining is the sheer size of its mining results.To compress the frequent patterns; we propose to cluster frequent patterns with a tightnessmeasure δ (called δ-cluster); and select a representative pattern for each cluster. Theproblem of finding a minimum set of representative patterns is shown NP-Hard. We developtwo greedy methods; RPglobal and RPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compressionbound but higher computational complexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds butis far more efficient. Our performance study shows that the compression quality usingRPlocal is very close to RPglobal; and both can reduce the number of closed frequentpatterns by almost two orders of magnitude. Furthermore; RPlocal mines even faster thanFPClose [G. Grahne; J. Zhu; Efficiently using prefix-trees in mining frequent itemsets; in …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,35
Mining control flow abnormality for logic error isolation,Chao Liu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Analyzing the executions of a buggy program is essentially a data mining process:Tracing the data generated during program executions may disclose important patterns andoutliers that could eventually reveal the location of software errors. In this paper; weinvestigate program logic errors; which rarely incur memory access violations but generateincorrect outputs. We show that through mining program control flow abnormality; we couldisolate many logic errors without knowing the program semantics. In order to detect thecontrol abnormality; we propose a hypothesis testing-like approach that statistically contraststhe evaluation probability of condition statements between correct and incorrect executions.Based on this contrast; we develop two algorithms that effectively rank functions with respectto their likelihood of containing the hidden error. We evaluated these two algorithms on a …,*,2006,33
Mining knowledge from interconnected data: a heterogeneous information network analysis approach,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu,Abstract Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected; forming complex;heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However; most peopleconsider a database merely as a data repository that supports data storage and retrievalrather than one or a set of heterogeneous information networks that contain rich; inter-related; multi-typed data and information. Most network science researchers only studyhomogeneous networks; without distinguishing the different types of objects and links in thenetworks. In this tutorial; we view database and other interconnected data as heterogeneousinformation networks; and study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of types ofobjects and links in the networks.

Matri: a multi-aspect and transitive trust inference model,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Xifeng Yan; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Abstract Trust inference; which is the mechanism to build new pair-wise trustworthinessrelationship based on the existing ones; is a fundamental integral part in many realapplications; eg; e-commerce; social networks; peer-to-peer networks; etc. State-of-the-arttrust inference approaches mainly employ the transitivity property of trust by propagatingtrust along connected users (aka trust propagation); but largely ignore other importantproperties; eg; prior knowledge; multi-aspect; etc. In this paper; we propose a multi-aspecttrust inference model by exploring an equally important property of trust; ie; the multi-aspectproperty. The heart of our method is to view the problem as a recommendation problem; andhence opens the door to the rich methodologies in the field of collaborative filtering.

On effective presentation of graph patterns: a structural representative approach,Chen Chen; Cindy Xide Lin; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the past; quite a few fast algorithms have been developed to mine frequentpatterns over graph data; with the large spectrum covering many variants of the problem.However; the real bottleneck for knowledge discovery on graphs is neither efficiency norscalability; but the usability of patterns that are mined out. Currently; what the state-of-arttechniques give is a lengthy list of exact patterns; which are undesirable in the following twoaspects:(1) on the micro side; due to various inherent noises or data diversity; exact patternsare usually not too useful in many real applications; and (2) on the macro side; the rigidstructural requirement being posed often generates an excessive amount of patterns that areonly slightly different from each other; which easily overwhelm the users.

To build effectiveindices; a novel method; called SeqIndex; is proposed; in which the selection of indices isbased on the analysis of discriminative; frequent sequential patterns mined from largesequence databases. Such an analysis leads to the construction of compact and effectiveindexing structures. Furthermore; we eliminate the requirement of setting an optimal supportthreshold beforehand; which is difficult for users to provide in practice.

Assessing and ranking structural correlations in graphs,Ziyu Guan; Jian Wu; Qing Zhang; Ambuj Singh; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Real-life graphs not only have nodes and edges; but also have events taking place;eg; product sales in social networks and virus infection in communication networks. Amongdifferent events; some exhibit strong correlation with the network structure; while others donot. Such structural correlation will shed light on viral influence existing in the correspondingnetwork. Unfortunately; the traditional association mining concept is not applicable in graphssince it only works on homogeneous datasets like transactions and baskets. We propose anovel measure for assessing such structural correlations in heterogeneous graph datasetswith events. The measure applies hitting time to aggregate the proximity among nodes thathave the same event.

In these domains; there is a need to performaggregation operations on large-scale networks. Unfortunately the existing implementationof aggregation operations on relational databases does not guarantee superior performancein network space; especially when it involves edge traversals and joins of gigantic tables. Inthis paper; we investigate the neighborhood aggregation queries: Find nodes that have top-k highest aggregate values over their h-hop neighbors. While these basic queries arecommon in a wide range of search and recommendation tasks; surprisingly they have notbeen studied systematically. We developed a Local Neighborhood Aggregation …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,28
EasyTicket: a ticket routing recommendation engine for enterprise problem resolution,Qihong Shao; Yi Chen; Shu Tao; Xifeng Yan; Nikos Anerousis,Abstract Managing problem tickets is a key issue in IT service industry. A large serviceprovider may handle thousands of problem tickets from its customers on a daily basis. Theefficiency of processing these tickets highly depends on ticket routing---transferring problemtickets among expert groups in search of the right resolver to the ticket. Despite that manyticket management systems are available; ticket routing in these systems is still manuallyoperated by support personnel. In this demo; we introduce EasyTicket; a ticket routingrecommendation engine that helps automate this process. By mining ticket history data; wemodel an enterprise social network that represents the functional relationships amongvarious expert groups in ticket routing. Based on this network; our system then providesrouting recommendations to new tickets. Our experimental studies on 1.4 million real …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,24
Fine-grained knowledge sharing in collaborative environments,Ziyu Guan; Shengqi Yang; Huan Sun; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Xifeng Yan,In collaborative environments; members may try to acquire similar information on the web inorder to gain knowledge in one domain.

Memory efficient minimum substring partitioning,Yang Li; Pegah Kamousi; Fangqiu Han; Shengqi Yang; Xifeng Yan; Subhash Suri,Abstract Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies are revolutionizing genomicsresearch. Billions of short reads generated at low costs can be assembled for reconstructingthe whole genomes. Unfortunately; the large memory footprint of the existing de novoassembly algorithms makes it challenging to get the assembly done for higher eukaryoteslike mammals. In this work; we investigate the memory issue of constructing de Bruijn graph;a core task in leading assembly algorithms; which often consumes several hundreds ofgigabytes memory for large genomes. We propose a disk-based partition method; calledMinimum Substring Partitioning (MSP); to complete the task using less than 10 gigabytesmemory; without runtime slowdown. MSP breaks the short reads into multiple small disjointpartitions so that each partition can be loaded into memory; processed individually and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,22
Extracting probable command and control signatures for detecting botnets,Ali Zand; Giovanni Vigna; Xifeng Yan; Christopher Kruegel,Abstract Botnets; which are networks of compromised machines under the control of a singlemalicious entity; are a serious threat to online security. The fact that botnets; by definition;receive their commands from a single entity can be leveraged to fight them. To this end; onerequires techniques that can detect command and control (C&C) traffic; as well as theservers that host C&C services. Given the knowledge of a C&C server's IP address; one canuse this information to detect all hosts that attempt to contact such a server; andsubsequently disinfect; disable; or block the infected machines. This information can also beused by law enforcement to take down the C&C server.

GQBE: Querying knowledge graphs by example entity tuples,Nandish Jayaram; Mahesh Gupta; Arijit Khan; Chengkai Li; Xifeng Yan; Ramez Elmasri,We present GQBE; a system that presents a simple and intuitive mechanism to query largeknowledge graphs. Answers to tasks such as “list university professors who have designedsome programming languages and also won an award in Computer Science” are best foundin knowledge graphs that record entities and their relationships. Real-world knowledgegraphs are difficult to use due to their sheer size and complexity and the challenging task ofwriting complex structured graph queries. Toward better usability of query systems overknowledge graphs; GQBE allows users to query knowledge graphs by example entity tupleswithout writing complex queries.

Ontology-based subgraph querying,Yinghui Wu; Shengqi Yang; Xifeng Yan,Subgraph querying has been applied in a variety of emerging applications. Traditionalsubgraph querying based on subgraph isomorphism requires identical label matching;which is often too restrictive to capture the matches that are semantically close to the querygraphs. This paper extends subgraph querying to identify semantically related matches byleveraging ontology information.(1) We introduce the ontology-based subgraph querying;which revises subgraph isomorphism by mapping a query to semantically related subgraphsin terms of a given ontology graph. We introduce a metric to measure the similarity of thematches. Based on the metric; we introduce an optimization problem to find top K bestmatches.(2) We provide a filtering-and-verification framework to identify (top-K) matches forontology-based subgraph queries. The framework efficiently extracts a small subgraph of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,19

Content-aware resolution sequence mining for ticket routing,Peng Sun; Shu Tao; Xifeng Yan; Nikos Anerousis; Yi Chen,Abstract Ticket routing is key to the efficiency of IT problem management. Due to thecomplexity of many reported problems; problem tickets typically need to be routed amongvarious expert groups; to search for the right resolver. In this paper; we study the problem ofusing historical ticket data to make smarter routing recommendations for new tickets; so as toimprove the efficiency of ticket routing; in terms of the Mean number of Steps To Resolve(MSTR) a ticket. Previous studies on this problem have been focusing on mining ticketresolution sequences to generate more informed routing recommendations. In this work; weenhance the existing sequence-only approach by further mining the text content of tickets.Through extensive studies on real-world problem tickets; we find that neither resolutionsequence nor ticket content alone is sufficient to deliver the most reduction in MSTR …,International Conference on Business Process Management,2010,19
Co-occurrence-based diffusion for expert search on the web,Ziyu Guan; Gengxin Miao; Russell McLoughlin; Xifeng Yan; Deng Cai,Expert search has been studied in different contexts; eg; enterprises; academiccommunities. We examine a general expert search problem: searching experts on the web;where millions of webpages and thousands of names are considered. It has mainly twochallenging issues: 1) webpages could be of varying quality and full of noises; 2) Theexpertise evidences scattered in webpages are usually vague and ambiguous. We proposeto leverage the large amount of co-occurrence information to assess relevance andreputation of a person name for a query topic. The co-occurrence structure is modeled usinga hypergraph; on which a heat diffusion based ranking algorithm is proposed.

In such networks; information flow among members is driven by thetasks assigned to the network; and by the expertise of its members to complete those tasks.In this work; we analyze real-life collaborative networks to understand their commoncharacteristics and how information is routed in these networks. Our study shows thatcollaborative networks exhibit significantly different properties compared with other complexnetworks. Collaborative networks have truncated power-law node degree distributions andother organizational constraints. Furthermore; the number of steps along which informationis routed follows a truncated power-law distribution.

Mining knowledge from data: An information network analysis approach,Jiawei Han; Yizhou Sun; Xifeng Yan; S Yu Philip,Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected; forming complex; heterogeneousbut often semistructured information networks. However; many database researchersconsider a database merely as a data repository that supports storage and retrieval ratherthan an information-rich; inter-related and multi-typed information network that supportscomprehensive data analysis; whereas many network researchers focus on homogeneousnetworks. Departing from both; we view interconnected; semi-structured datasets asheterogeneous; information-rich networks and study how to uncover hidden knowledge insuch networks. For example; a university database can be viewed as a heterogeneousinformation network; where objects of multiple types; such as students; professors; courses;departments; and multiple typed relationships; such as teach and advise are intertwined …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,18

Because many social interactionscurrently take place in online networks; social scientists have access to unprecedentedamounts of information about social interaction. Prior to the advent of such online networks;these investigations required resource-intensive activities such as random trials; surveys;and manual data collection to gather even small data sets. Now; massive amounts ofinformation about social networks and social interactions are recorded. This wealth of bigdata can allow social scientists to study social interactions on a scale and at a level of detailthat has never before been possible.

Summarizing answer graphs induced by keyword queries,Yinghui Wu; Shengqi Yang; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Arun Iyengar; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Keyword search has been popularly used to query graph data. Due to the lack ofstructure support; a keyword query might generate an excessive number of matches;referred to as" answer graphs"; that could include different relationships among keywords.An ignored yet important task is to group and summarize answer graphs that share similarstructures and contents for better query interpretation and result understanding. This paperstudies the summarization problem for the answer graphs induced by a keyword query Q.(1)A notion of summary graph is proposed to characterize the summarization of answer graphs.Given Q and a set of answer graphs G; a summary graph preserves the relation of thekeywords in Q by summarizing the paths connecting the keywords nodes in G.(2) A qualitymetric of summary graphs; called coverage ratio; is developed to measure information …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,17
Emerging graph queries in linked data,Arijit Khan; Yinghui Wu; Xifeng Yan,In a wide array of disciplines; data can be modeled as an interconnected network of entities;where various attributes could be associated with both the entities and the relations amongthem. Knowledge is often hidden in the complex structure and attributes inside thesenetworks. While querying and mining these linked datasets are essential for variousapplications; traditional graph queries may not be able to capture the rich semantics in thesenetworks. With the advent of complex information networks; new graph queries areemerging; including graph pattern matching and mining; similarity search; ranking andexpert finding; graph aggregation and OLAP. These queries require both the topology andcontent information of the network data; and hence; different from classical graph algorithmssuch as shortest path; reach ability and minimum cut; which depend only on the structure …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,17
A probabilistic approach to uncovering attributed graph anomalies,Nan Li; Huan Sun; Kyle Chipman; Jemin George; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Uncovering subgraphs with an abnormal distribution of attributes reveals muchinsight into network behaviors. For example in social or communication networks; diseasesor intrusions usually do not propagate uniformly; which makes it critical to find anomalousregions with high concentrations of a specific disease or intrusion. In this paper; weintroduce a probabilistic model to identify anomalous subgraphs containing a significantlydifferent percentage of a certain vertex attribute; such as a specific disease or an intrusion;compared to the rest of the graph. Our framework; gAnomaly; models generative processesof vertex attributes and divides the graph into regions that are governed by background andanomaly processes. Two types of regularizers are employed to smoothen the regions and tofacilitate vertex assignment. We utilize deterministic annealing EM to learn the model …,*,2014,16

The highly reproducibleresistive switching is achieved in the 10% Ag-doped ZrO 2 devices. The improved resistiveswitching behaviour in the Ag doped ZrO 2 devices could be attributed to Ag doping effecton the formation of the stable filamentary conducting paths. In addition; dual-step resetprocesses corresponding to three stable resistance states are observed in the 10% Agdoped ZrO 2 devices; which may be implemented for the application of multi-bit storage.,Chinese Physics Letters,2008,16
giceberg: Towards iceberg analysis in large graphs,Nan Li; Ziyu Guan; Lijie Ren; Jian Wu; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan,Traditional multi-dimensional data analysis techniques such as iceberg cube cannot bedirectly applied to graphs for finding interesting or anomalous vertices due to the lack ofdimensionality in graphs. In this paper; we introduce the concept of graph icebergs that referto vertices for which the concentration (aggregation) of an attribute in their vicinities isabnormally high. Intuitively; these vertices shall be “close” to the attribute of interest in thegraph space. Based on this intuition; we propose a novel framework; called gIceberg; whichperforms aggregation using random walks; rather than traditional SUM and AVG aggregatefunctions. This proposed framework scores vertices by their different levels ofinterestingness and finds important vertices that meet a user-specified threshold.

Frequent trajectory mining on GPS data,Norma Saiph Savage; Shoji Nishimura; Norma Elva Chavez; Xifeng Yan,Abstract In this paper we propose a new algorithm for finding the frequent routes that a userhas in his daily routine; in our method we build a grid in which we map each of the GPS datapoints that belong to a certain sequence.(We consider that each sequence conforms a route)we then carry out an interpolation procedure that has a probabilistic basis and find a moreprecise description of the user's trajectory. For each trajectory we find the edges that werecrossed; with the crossed edges we create a histogram in which the bins denote the crossededges and the frequency value the number of times that edge was crossed for a certain user.We then select the K most frequent edges and combine them to create a list of the mostfrequent paths that a user has. We compared our results with the algorithm that wasproposed in Adaptive learning of semantic locations and routes [6] to find frequent routes …,Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Location and the Web,2010,15
MSPKmerCounter: a fast and memory efficient approach for k-mer counting,Yang Li,Abstract: A major challenge in next-generation genome sequencing (NGS) is to assemblemassive overlapping short reads that are randomly sampled from DNA fragments. Tocomplete assembling; one needs to finish a fundamental task in many leading assemblyalgorithms: counting the number of occurrences of k-mers (length-k substrings insequences). The counting results are critical for many components in assembly (eg variantsdetection and read error correction). For large genomes; the k-mer counting task can easilyconsume a huge amount of memory; making it impossible for large-scale parallel assemblyon commodity servers. In this paper; we develop MSPKmerCounter; a disk-based approach;to efficiently perform k-mer counting for large genomes using a small amount of memory.

Mining coherent dense subgraphs across massive biological network for functional discovery,Haiyan Hu; Xifeng Yan; Yu Huang; Jiawei Han; Xianghong Jasmine Zhou,ABSTRACT Motivation: The rapid accumulation of biological network data translates into anurgent need for computational methods for graph pattern mining. One important problem isto identify recurrent patterns across multiple networks to discover biological modules.However; existing algorithms for frequent pattern mining become very costly in time andspace as the pattern sizes and network numbers increase. Currently; no efficient algorithm isavailable for mining recurrent patterns across large collections of genome-wide networks.Results: We developed a novel algorithm; CODENSE; to efficiently mine frequent coherentdense subgraphs across large numbers of massive graphs.

Fast top-k search in knowledge graphs,Shengqi Yang; Fangqiu Han; Yinghui Wu; Xifeng Yan,Given a graph query Q posed on a knowledge graph G; top-k graph querying is to find kmatches in G with the highest ranking score according to a ranking function. Fast top-ksearch in knowledge graphs is challenging as both graph traversal and similarity search areexpensive. Conventional top-k graph search is typically based on threshold algorithm (TA);which can no long fit the demand in the new setting. This work proposes STAR; a top-kknowledge graph search framework. It has two components:(a) a fast top-k algorithm for starqueries; and (b) an assembling algorithm for general graph queries. The assemblingalgorithm uses star query as a building block and iteratively sweeps the star match lists witha dynamically adjusted bound.

Analyzing expert behaviors in collaborative networks,Huan Sun; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Shulong Tan; Yang Li; Lance M Kaplan; Shu Tao; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Collaborative networks are composed of experts who cooperate with each other tocomplete specific tasks; such as resolving problems reported by customers. A task is postedand subsequently routed in the network from an expert to another until being resolved.When an expert cannot solve a task; his routing decision (ie; where to transfer a task) iscritical since it can significantly affect the completion time of a task. In this work; we attempt todeduce the cognitive process of task routing; and model the decision making of experts as agenerative process where a routing decision is made based on mixed routing patterns. Inparticular; we observe an interesting phenomenon that an expert tends to transfer a task tosomeone whose knowledge is neither too similar to nor too different from his own. Based onthis observation; an expertise difference based routing pattern is developed.

Electron field emission from single-walled carbon nanotube nonwoven,Song Li; Liu Shuang; Zhang Geng-Min; Liu Li-Feng; Ma Wen-Jun; Liu Dong-Fang; Zhao Xiao-Wei; Luo Shu-Dong; Zhang Zeng-Xing; Xiang Yan-Juan; Shen Jun; Zhou Jian-Jun; Wang Gang; Zhou Wei-Ya,Abstract Field emission from single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) nonwoven has beeninvestigated under high vacuum with different vacuum gaps. A low turn-on electric field of1.05 V/μm is required to reach an emission current density of 10 μA/cm 2. An emissioncurrent density of 10 mA/cm 2 is obtained at an operating electric field of 1.88 V/μm. Nocurrent saturation is found even at an emission current of 5 mA. With the vacuum gapincreasing from 1 to 10 mm; the turn-on field decreases monotonically from 1.21 to 0.68V/μm; while the field amplification is augmented. The good field-emission behaviour isascribed to the combined effects of the intrinsic field emission of SWNT and the wavedtopography of the nonwoven.,Chinese Physics,2006,13

Informative web tables range across a largevariety of topics; which can naturally serve as a significant resource to satisfy userinformation needs. Driven by such observations; in this paper; we investigate an importantyet largely under-addressed problem: Given millions of tables; how to precisely retrievetable cells to answer a user question. This work proposes a novel table cell searchframework to attack this problem. We first formulate the concept of a relational chain whichconnects two cells in a table and represents the semantic relation between them.

Herein; we report a delivery nanosystem based on programmedDNA self-assembly mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) siRNA-loaded DNA nanotubes(DNA-NTs). We demonstrate that these siRNA-DNA-NTs can be effectively transfected intopulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) via endocytosis; and that the loadedmTOR siRNA can induce obvious autophagy and inhibit cell growth under both normal andhypoxic conditions. Moreover; we found that mTOR siRNA can control the autophagy andproliferation of PASMCs under hypoxic condition; suggesting a potential therapeuticapplication for mTOR siRNA in diseases involving abnormal autophagy in PASMCs.,Biomaterials,2015,11
Towards scalable critical alert mining,Bo Zong; Yinghui Wu; Jie Song; Ambuj K Singh; Hasan Cam; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Performance monitor software for data centers typically generates a great numberof alert sequences. These alert sequences indicate abnormal network events. Given a set ofobserved alert sequences; it is important to identify the most critical alerts that are potentiallythe causes of others. While the need for mining critical alerts over large scale alertsequences is evident; most alert analysis techniques stop at modeling and mining thecausal relations among the alerts. This paper studies the critical alert mining problem: Givena set of alert sequences; we aim to find a set of k critical alerts such that the number of alertspotentially triggered by them is maximized. We show that the problem is intractable;therefore; we resort to approximation and heuristic algorithms. First; we develop anapproximation algorithm that obtains a near-optimal alert set in quadratic time; and …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,11
Cloud service placement via subgraph matching,Bo Zong; Ramya Raghavendra; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Xifeng Yan; Ambuj K Singh; Kang-Won Lee,Fast service placement; finding a set of nodes with enough free capacity of computation;storage; and network connectivity; is a routine task in daily cloud administration. In this work;we formulate this as a subgraph matching problem. Different from the traditional setting;including approximate and probabilistic graphs; subgraph matching on data-center networkshas two unique properties.(1) Node/edge labels representing vacant CPU cycles andnetwork bandwidth change rapidly; while the network topology varies little.(2) There is apartial order on node/edge labels. Basically; one needs to place service in nodes withenough free capacity.

LAA defines a correlation factor that represents the connection between twodocuments; and considers the topic proportion of paired documents based on this factor.Words in the documents are assumed to be randomly generated by particular topicassignments and topic-to-word probability distributions. The paper also presents a newranking algorithm; based on LAA; that can be used to retrieve target documents that arepotentially associated with a given source document. The ranking algorithm uses the latentfactor in LAA to rank target documents by the strength of their semantic associations with …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,11
Assessing expertise awareness in resolution networks,Yi Chen; Shu Tao; Xifeng Yan; Nikos Anerousis; Qihong Shao,Problem resolution is a key issue in the IT service industry. A large service provider handles;on daily basis; thousands of tickets that report various types of problems from its customers.The efficiency of this process highly depends on the effective interactions among variousexpert groups; in search of the resolver to the reported problem. In fact; ticket transferdecisions reflect the expertise awareness between groups; thus encoding a sophisticatedresolution social network. In this paper; we propose a computational framework toquantitatively assess expertise awareness; ie; how well a group knows the expertise ofothers. An accurate assessment of expertise awareness could identify the weakestcomponents in a resolution system. The framework; built on our previously developedresolution engine; is able to calculate the performance difference caused by excluding a …,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2010 International Conference on,2010,11

Discovery of frequent substructures,Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Graphs become increasingly important in modeling complicated structures; such as circuits;images; chemical compounds; protein structures; biological networks; the Web; work flows;and XML documents. We have witnessed many graph-related algorithms developed inchemical informatics [3; 4; 26; 27]; computer vision [29]; video indexing [25]; and text retrieval[19]. Among various kinds of graph patterns; frequent substructures are very basic ones thatcan be discovered in a set of graphs. They are useful at characterizing graph sets;discriminating different groups of graphs; classifying and clustering graphs; and buildinggraph indices. Borgelt and Berthold [6] illustrated the discovery of active chemical structuresin a dataset that screened for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by contrasting thesupport of frequent graphs between different classes.

N-doped LaAlO3/Si (100) films with high-k; low-leakage current and good thermal stability,Xiang Wen-Feng; Lu Hui-Bin; Chen Zheng-Hao; He Meng; Lu Xu-Bing; Liu Li-Feng; Guo Hai-Zhong; Zhou Yue-Liang,Abstract High quality amorphous N-doped LaAlO 3 (LaAlON) films have been deposited onSi (100) in nitrogen gas by laser molecular beam epitaxy. The chemical nature and physicaldistribution of N in LaAlON films has been performed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy.Compared with LaAlO 3; a significant improvement in the interfacial quality and leakagecurrent density was obtained by nitrogen additive. At gate voltage+ 1 V; the leakage currentdensity of the LaAlON film with an equivalent oxide thickness as thin as 2 nm is obtained tobe 2.9× 10− 6 A/cm 2; which decreases almost two orders of magnitude from that of LaAlO 3film with the same thickness. Moreover; high-resolution transmission electron microscopeanalysis show that the LaAlON sample is still amorphous with a very sharp interfacebetween the LaAlON layer and the Si substrate after annealed at 900 degrees C for 60 s.,Chinese Physics Letters,2005,11

Semantic SPARQL similarity search over RDF knowledge graphs,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Wei Peng; Xifeng Yan; Shaoxu Song; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract RDF knowledge graphs have attracted increasing attentions these years. However;due to the schema-free nature of RDF data; it is very difficult for users to have full knowledgeof the underlying schema. Furthermore; the same kind of information can be represented indiverse graph fragments. Hence; it is a huge challenge to formulate complex SPARQLexpressions by taking the union of all possible structures. In this paper; we propose aneffective framework to access the RDF repository even if users have no full knowledge of theunderlying schema. Specifically; given a SPARQL query; the system could return as moreanswers that match the query based on the semantic similarity as possible. Interestingly; wepropose a systematic method to mine diverse semantically equivalent structure patterns.More importantly; incorporating both structural and semantic similarities we are the first to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,10

While theimportance of studying cascades has been recognized in various applications; it is difficult toobserve the complete structure of cascades in practice. In this paper we study the cascadeinference problem following the independent cascade model; and provide a full treatmentfrom complexity to algorithms:(a) we propose the idea of consistent trees as the inferredstructures for cascades; these trees connect source nodes and observed nodes with pathssatisfying the constraints from the observed temporal information.(b) We introduce metrics tomeasure the likelihood of consistent trees as inferred cascades; as well as severaloptimization problems for finding them.(c) We show that the decision problems for consistenttrees are in general NP-complete; and that the optimization problems are hard to …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,10
Effects of light intensity on Quercus liaotungensis seed germination and seedling growth.,Yan Xing-fu; Wang Jian-li; Zhou Li-biao,Abstract This paper studied the effects of different shading (55.4%; 18.9%; 5.5%; 2.2%;0.5%; and 0.3% natural sunlight) on the seed germination and seedling growth of Quercusliaotungensis. The seed germination rate and germination index were the highest (72.5%and 0.22; respectively) at 55.4% natural sunlight; declined with decreasing light intensity;and were the lowest (42.5% and 0.11; respectively) at 0.3% natural sunlight. Strong light haddefinite delaying effect on the germination. The index of germination vigor increased withdecreasing light intensity; being the maximum at 0-5% natural sunlight. The delay of seedgermination under strong light could be the selective tradeoff on varied seed fates. Stronglight benefited the basal stem diameter and root system growth and dry mass accumulationof Q. liaotunensis seedling; but resulted in the minimum seedlings height (6.06 cm) …,Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao,2011,10
Entity disambiguation with linkless knowledge bases,Yang Li; Shulong Tan; Huan Sun; Jiawei Han; Dan Roth; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Named Entity Disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentionsin natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a referenceknowledge base (eg Wikipedia). Such disambiguation can help add semantics to plain textand distinguish homonymous entities. Previous research has tackled this problem bymaking use of two types of context-aware features derived from the reference knowledgebase; namely; the context similarity and the semantic relatedness. Both features heavily relyon the cross-document hyperlinks within the knowledge base: the semantic relatednessfeature is directly measured via those hyperlinks; while the context similarity feature implicitlymakes use of those hyperlinks to expand entity candidates' descriptions and then comparesthem against the query context. Unfortunately; cross-document hyperlinks are rarely …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web,2016,9
Exploiting relevance feedback in knowledge graph search,Yu Su; Shengqi Yang; Huan Sun; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Sue Kase; Michelle Vanni; Xifeng Yan,Abstract The big data era is witnessing a prevalent shift of data from homogeneous toheterogeneous; from isolated to linked. Exemplar outcomes of this shift are a wide range ofgraph data such as information; social; and knowledge graphs. The unique characteristics ofgraph data are challenging traditional search techniques like SQL and keyword search.Graph query is emerging as a promising complementary search form. In this paper; we studyhow to improve graph query by relevance feedback. Specifically; we focus on knowledgegraph query; and formulate the graph relevance feedback (GRF) problem. We propose ageneral GRF framework that is able to (1) tune the original ranking function based on userfeedback and (2) further enrich the query itself by mining new features from user feedback.As a consequence; a query-specific ranking function is generated; which is better aligned …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,9
Towards a query-by-example system for knowledge graphs,Nandish Jayaram; Arijit Khan; Chengkai Li; Xifeng Yan; Ramez Elmasri,Abstract We witness an unprecedented proliferation of knowledge graphs that recordmillions of heterogeneous entities and their diverse relationships. While knowledge graphsare structure-flexible and content-rich; it is difficult to query them. The challenge lies in thegap between their overwhelming complexity and the limited database knowledge of non-professional users. If writing structured queries over" simple" tables is difficult; it gets evenharder to query complex knowledge graphs. As an initial step toward improving the usabilityof knowledge graphs; we propose to query such data by example entity tuples; withoutrequiring users to write complex graph queries. Our system; GQBE (Graph Query ByExample); is a proof of concept to show the possibility of this querying paradigm working inpractice.

Experimental study of creep characteristics of rock gypsum-salt and rock salt in Chuandong gas field,Ping LI; Jin-gen DENG; Yan SUN; Xin-jiang YAN; Xian-guang XU,Through analyzing mineral composition of the rock salt and rock gypsum-salt in Chuandonggas field; the creeping test study is carried out with the TAW-1000 deep pore pressure servotest system. The impacts of mineral compassion; deviator stress; temperature and confiningpressure on creep have been analyzed. Based on the creep curve and rock parametersobtained by the experiment; steady-state creep rate constitutive equation is proposed. Theresults show that the main mineral compassion of rock salt and rock gypsum-salt inChuandong gas filed are sodium chloride and calcium sulfate; the highest percentage ofsodium chloride can be as much as 93%; inherent mineral composition is the internal factorsof rock creep.

Reliable ticket routing in expert networks,Gengxin Miao; Louise E Moser; Xifeng Yan; Shu Tao; Yi Chen; Nikos Anerousis,Abstract Problem ticket resolution is an important aspect of the delivery of IT services. Alarge service provider needs to handle; on a daily basis; thousands of tickets that reportvarious types of problems. Many of those tickets bounce among multiple expert groupsbefore being transferred to the group with the expertise to solve the problem. Finding amethodology that can automatically make reliable ticket routing decisions and that reducessuch bouncing and; hence; shortens ticket resolution time is a long-standing challenge.Reliable ticket routing forwards the ticket to an expert who either can solve the problemreported in the ticket; or can reach an expert who can resolve the ticket.

Discovering an Evolutionary Classifier over a High-speed Nonstatic Stream,Jiong Yang; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Wei Wang,Summary With the emergence of large-volume and high-speed streaming data; mining datastreams has become a focus of increasing interest. The major new challenges in streamingdata mining are as follows: since streams may flow in and out indefinitely and at fast speed;it is usually expected that a stream-mining process can only scan a data stream once; andsince the characteristics of the data may evolve over time; it is desirable to incorporate theevolving features of data streams. This paper investigates the issues of developing a high-speed classification method for streaming data with concept drifts. Among several popularclassification techniques; the naïve Bayesian classifier is chosen due to its low constructioncost; ease of incremental maintenance; and high accuracy. An efficient algorithm; calledEvoClass (Evolutionary Classifier); is devised. EvoClass builds an incremental …,*,2005,9

Behavior query discovery in system-generated temporal graphs,Bo Zong; Xusheng Xiao; Zhichun Li; Zhenyu Wu; Zhiyun Qian; Xifeng Yan; Ambuj K Singh; Guofei Jiang,Abstract Computer system monitoring generates huge amounts of logs that record theinteraction of system entities. How to query such data to better understand system behaviorsand identify potential system risks and malicious behaviors becomes a challenging task forsystem administrators due to the dynamics and heterogeneity of the data. System monitoringdata are essentially heterogeneous temporal graphs with nodes being system entities andedges being their interactions over time. Given the complexity of such graphs; it becomestime-consuming for system administrators to manually formulate useful queries in order toexamine abnormal activities; attacks; and vulnerabilities in computer systems.

Query-based outlier detection in heterogeneous information networks,Jonathan Kuck; Honglei Zhuang; Xifeng Yan; Hasan Cam; Jiawei Han,Abstract Outlier or anomaly detection in large data sets is a fundamental task in datascience; with broad applications. However; in real data sets with high-dimensional space;most outliers are hidden in certain dimensional combinations and are relative to a user'ssearch space and interest. It is often more effective to give power to users and allow them tospecify outlier queries flexibly; and the system will then process such mining queriesefficiently. In this study; we introduce the concept of query-based outlier in heterogeneousinformation networks; design a query language to facilitate users to specify such queriesflexibly; define a good outlier measure in heterogeneous networks; and study how toprocess outlier queries efficiently in large data sets. Our experiments on real data sets showthat following such a methodology; interesting outliers can be defined and uncovered …,Advances in database technology: proceedings.

Synthesis and photocatalytic activities of chlorine-doped TiO2 pillared montmorillonite,YAN Xiaoling; JIA Lihua,Abstract Chlorine-doped titanium pillared montmorillonite (Cl-TM) was prepared by the sol-gel technique in order to improve the photocatalytic activity. X-ray diffraction (XRD);scanning electron microscope (SEM); energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS); UV-Vis diffusereflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis-DRS); photoluminescence spectrometer (PLS); X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); N2adsorption-desorption (BET) were used to characterize the products. The results show thatthe products had typical anatase phase while keeping the pillared structure ofmontmorillonite. The presence of montmorillonite can inhibite the phase transformation oftitania from anatase to rutile. In addition; Chlorine-doped sample can reduce the band gapenergy of TiO2 from 3.19 eV to 3.14 eV and therefore extend the light response of TiO2 to …,Chinese Journal of Applied Chemistry,2011,8
Mining diversity on networks,Lu Liu; Feida Zhu; Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip; Shiqiang Yang,Abstract Despite the recent emergence of many large-scale networks in different applicationdomains; an important measure that captures a participant's diversity in the network hasbeen largely neglected in previous studies. Namely; diversity characterizes how diverse agiven node connects with its peers. In this paper; we give a comprehensive study of thisconcept. We first lay out two criteria that capture the semantic meaning of diversity; and thenpropose a compliant definition which is simple enough to embed the idea. An efficient top-kdiversity ranking algorithm is developed for computation on dynamic networks. Experimentson both synthetic and real datasets give interesting results; where individual nodes identifiedwith high diversities are intuitive.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,8

Mining complaints for traffic-jam estimation: A social sensor application,Theodore Georgiou; Amr El Abbadi; Xifeng Yan; Jemin George,Abstract Physical events in the real world are known to trigger reactions and thendiscussions in online social media. Mining these reactions through online social sensorsoffers a fast and low cost way to understand what is happening in the physical world. Insome cases; however; further study of the affected population's emotional state can improvethis understanding. In our study we analyzed how car commuters react on Twitter while stuckin heavy traffic. We discovered that the online social footprint does not necessarily follow astrict linear correlation with the volume of a traffic jam. Through our analysis we offer apotential explanation: people's mood could be an additional factor; apart from traffic severityitself; that leads in fluctuations of the observed reaction in social media.

To solve this problem; a new strategy of real time reactive power voltagecoordinated control is proposed; and a real time coordinate control system (RTCCS) is alsobuilt. The strategy realizes real time coordinated control of wind farm reactive poweraccording to the voltage level and the action of wind turbine Crowbar protection at faulttimes. Considering that reactive power demand of the wind turbine increases after Crowbarprotection acts; STATCOM is designed into RTCCS to provide reactive power compensation.Through coordinated control; RTCCS can not only improve fault ride-through ability of windfarm; but also provide reactive power and voltage support to the power system at fault …,Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC); 2010 Asia-Pacific,2010,7

The Nb: BTO thin films with high crystallinity are epitaxially grown on MgOsubstrates. With more Nb-doped content; the impurity phases are found in Nb: BTO thinfilms. Hall measurement at room temperature confirms that the charge carriers of the Nb:BTO thin films are n-type. When the Nb-doped content increases; the carrier concentrationand carrier mobility increase. Meanwhile the optical transmittance decreases with theincrease of the Nb-doping; and the width of the forbidden band in each group is not affectedby the presence of Nb in the samples.

Improving semantic parsing via answer type inference,Semih Yavuz; Izzeddin Gur; Yu Su; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Xifeng Yan,Abstract In this work; we show the possibility of inferring the answer type before solving afactoid question and leveraging the type information to improve semantic parsing. Byreplacing the topic entity in a question with its type; we are able to generate an abstract formof the question; whose answer corresponds to the answer type of the original question. Abidirectional LSTM model is built to train over the abstract form of questions and infer theiranswer types. It is also observed that if we convert a question into a statement form; ourLSTM model achieves better accuracy. Using the predicted type information to rerank thelogical forms returned by AgendaIL; one of the leading semantic parsers; we are able toimprove the F1-score from 49.7% to 52.6% on the WEBQUESTIONS data.,Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2016,6
Multi-aspect+ transitivity+ bias: An integral trust inference model,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Xifeng Yan; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Inferring the pair-wise trust relationship is a core building block for many real applications.State-of-the-art approaches for such trust inference mainly employ the transitivity property oftrust by propagating trust along connected users; but largely ignore other importantproperties such as trust bias; multi-aspect; etc. In this paper; we propose a new trustinference model to integrate all these important properties. To apply the model to both binaryand continuous inference scenarios; we further propose a family of effective and efficientalgorithms. Extensive experimental evaluations on real data sets show that our methodachieves significant improvement over several existing benchmark approaches; for bothquantifying numerical trustworthiness scores and predicting binary trust/distrust signs. Inaddition; it enjoys linear scalability in both time and space.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,6
Analysis of large-scale distributed knowledge sources via autonomous cooperative graph mining,Georgiy Levchuk; Andres Ortiz; Xifeng Yan,In this paper; we present a model for processing distributed relational data across multipleautonomous heterogeneous computing resources in environments with limited control;resource failures; and communication bottlenecks. Our model exploits dependencies in thedata to enable collaborative distributed querying in noisy data. The collaboration policy forcomputational resources is efficiently constructed from the belief propagation algorithm. Toscale to large data sizes; we employ a combination of priority-based filtering; incrementalprocessing; and communication compression techniques. Our solution achieved highaccuracy of analysis results and orders of magnitude improvements in computation timecompared to the centralized graph matching solution.,Machine Intelligence and Bio-inspired Computation: Theory and Applications VIII,2014,6

Discriminative frequent pattern-based graph classification,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Frequent graph mining has been studied extensively with many scalable graphmining algorithms developed in the past. Graph patterns are essential not only forexploratory graph mining but also for advanced graph analysis tasks such as graphindexing; graph clustering; and graph classification. In this chapter; we examine the frequentpattern-based classification of graph data. We will introduce different types of patterns usedin graph classification and their efficient mining approaches. These approaches coulddirectly mine the most discriminative subgraphs without enumerating the complete set offrequent graph patterns. The application of graph classification into chemical compoundanalysis and software behavior prediction will be discussed to demonstrate the power ofdiscriminative subgraphs.,*,2010,6
Optimization of DGM (2; 1),Xin-Hai Kong; Yong Wei,Based on the grey differential equation of DGM (2; 1); its Connotation expression is derivedin this paper; and shows that DGM (2; 1) is a non-homogeneous exponential type. Further;by comparing the connotation expression with the solution of the whitenization equation; wefind that the solution is inconsistent with the connotation expression; and the differentialrestored value is also inconsistent with the inverse-accumulating restored value. So theoptimized DGM (2; 1) is presented; which has the white exponential superposition. Someexamples also show that the optimized model has a high simulation precision.,Journal of grey system,2009,6

Matrust: An effective multi-aspect trust inference model,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Xifeng Yan; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Abstract: Trust is a fundamental concept in many real-world applications such as e-commerce and peer-to-peer networks. In these applications; users can generate localopinions about the counterparts based on direct experiences; and these opinions can thenbe aggregated to build trust among unknown users. The mechanism to build new trustrelationships based on existing ones is referred to as trust inference. State-of-the-art trustinference approaches employ the transitivity property of trust by propagating trust alongconnected users. In this paper; we propose a novel trust inference model (MaTrust) byexploring an equally important property of trust; ie; the multi-aspect property. MaTrust directlycharacterizes multiple latent factors for each trustor and trustee from the locally-generatedtrust relationships. Furthermore; it can naturally incorporate prior knowledge as specified …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1211.2041,2012,5
A general framework to encode heterogeneous information sources for contextual pattern mining,Weishan Dong; Wei Fan; Lei Shi; Changjin Zhou; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Traditional pattern mining methods usually work on single data sources. However;in practice; there are often multiple and heterogeneous information sources. Theycollectively provide contextual information not available in any single source alonedescribing the same set of objects; and are useful for discovering hidden contextualpatterns. One important challenge is to provide a general methodology to mine contextualpatterns easily and efficiently. In this paper; we propose a general framework to encodecontextual information from multiple sources into a coherent representation---ContextualInformation Graph (CIG). The complexity of the encoding scheme is linear in both time andspace. More importantly; CIG can be handled by any single-source pattern miningalgorithms that accept taxonomies without any modification.

Static and dynamic structural correlations in graphs,Jian Wu; Ziyu Guan; Qing Zhang; Ambuj K Singh; Xifeng Yan,Real-life graphs not only contain nodes and edges; but also have events taking place; eg;product sales in social networks. Among different events; some exhibit strong correlationswith the network structure; while others do not. Such structural correlations will shed light onviral influence existing in the corresponding network. Unfortunately; the traditionalassociation mining concept is not applicable in graphs because it only works onhomogeneous data sets like transactions and baskets. We propose a novel measure forassessing such structural correlations in heterogeneous graph data sets with events. Themeasure applies hitting time to aggregate the proximity among nodes that have the sameevent. To calculate the correlation scores for many events in a large network; we develop ascalable framework; called gScore; using sampling and approximation.

Experiment of the flow field at the outlet of impeller of axial flow pump,Li Zhong; Yang Minguan; Wang Chunlin,Abstract: The flow field at the outlet of impeller in the designed axial-flow pump wasmeasured by using the five-hole probe. Three velocity components and circulation curveswere obtained. The measured results show that the flow field at the outlet of impeller is aspiral movement. Under the optimum condition; the rotary kinetic energy occupies 34% ofthe total outlet kinetic energy and decreases with the increase of the flux. Accompanied bythe small radial velocity; the axial velocity increases with the flow intensifying. The velocitycirculation decrease from the hub to the flange; wherefore the more circular velocity at theflange and the less at the hub are needed. The 3-D velocity distribution of flow field can bemeasured accurately by the probe. This method has the merits of simple operation and wellapplicability.,Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery,2009,4

Cross-domain Semantic Parsing via Paraphrasing,Yu Su; Xifeng Yan,Abstract: Existing studies on semantic parsing mainly focus on the in-domain setting. Weformulate cross-domain semantic parsing as a domain adaptation problem: train a semanticparser on some source domains and then adapt it to the target domain. Due to the diversityof logical forms in different domains; this problem presents unique and intriguing challenges.By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language; we reducesemantic parsing to paraphrasing; and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequenceparaphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover twoproblems; small micro variance and large macro variance; of pre-trained word embeddingsthat hurdle their direct use in neural networks; and propose standardization techniques as aremedy. On the popular Overnight dataset; which contains eight domains; we show that …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05974,2017,3
A fast kernel for attributed graphs,Yu Su; Fangqiu Han; Richard E Harang; Xifeng Yan,Abstract As a fundamental technique for graph analysis; graph kernels have beensuccessfully applied to a wide range of problems. Unfortunately; the high computationalcomplexity of existing graph kernels is limiting their further applications to larger-scale graphdatasets. In this paper; we propose a fast graph kernel; the descriptor matching (DM) kernel;for graphs with both categorical and numerical attributes. The computation time of the DMkernel is linear with respect to graph size. On graphs with n nodes and m edges; the kernelcomputation for two graphs can be done in O (n+ m) time. Although there are other linear-time graph kernels; most of them are restricted to graphs with only categorical attributes;their efficiency mainly comes from the sparseness of the feature space resulted from themutually orthogonal categorical attributes.

Fast motif discovery in short sequences,Honglei Liu; Fangqiu Han; Hongjun Zhou; Xifeng Yan; Kenneth S Kosik,Motif discovery in sequence data is fundamental to many biological problems such asantibody biomarker identification. Recent advances in instrumental techniques make itpossible to generate thousands of protein sequences at once; which raises a big data issuefor the existing motif finding algorithms: They either work only in a small scale of severalhundred sequences or have to trade accuracy for efficiency. In this work; we demonstratethat by intelligently clustering sequences; it is possible to significantly improve the scalabilityof all the existing motif finding algorithms without losing accuracy at all. An anchor basedsequence clustering algorithm (ASC) is thus proposed to divide a sequence dataset intomultiple smaller clusters so that sequences sharing the same motif will be located into thesame cluster. Then an existing motif finding algorithm can be applied to each individual …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,2

Due to relatively low and varyingextraction rates of DNA from cell lysates by genomic DNA extraction kits; it is desired toquantitatively determine DNA contents directly in cell lysates. However; the coexistence ofscatterers (eg; cell debris); absorbers; and intrinsic fluorophores in cell lysates preventseither UV–Vis spectrophotometric methods or fluorometric methods based on fluorescentdyes and ratiometric models to be directly applied to cell lysates. In this contribution; a novelfluorometric method based on an advanced chemometric model which can effectivelyeliminate the effects of scatterers and absorbers on fluorescence spectra of cell lysates wasproposed for the direct quantification of DNA in lysates of CEM cells.

Results show that there is a small scaled area with hightemperature around the modelling heat point source in DHLU system. The existence of thishigh temperature area is suggested as the power source of upwelling. Obvious upwellingflows upon the heating source were observed in DHLU system. The stream tube ofupwelling for DHLU system is just like an upside-down cone. The max ascending velocity ofhorizontal layer increases firstly and decreases then as the height increases. A few of fluidmasses with high ascend velocities were observed and the mechanism of the DHLU isrevealed.,Comput. Model. New Tech,2014,2
Noise-Resistant Bicluster Recognition,Huan Sun; Gengxin Miao; Xifeng Yan,Biclustering is crucial in finding co-expressed genes and their associated conditions in geneexpression data. While various biclustering algorithms (eg; combinatorial; probabilisticmodelling; and matrix factorization) have been proposed and constantly improved in thepast decade; data noise and bicluster overlaps make biclustering a still challenging task. Itbecomes difficult to further improve biclustering performance; without resorting to a newapproach. Inspired by the recent progress in unsupervised feature learning using deepneural networks; in this work; we propose a novel model for biclustering; named AutoDecoder (AD); by relating biclusters to features and leveraging a neural network that is ableto automatically learn features from the input data. To suppress severe noise present ingene expression data; we introduce a non-uniform signal recovery mechanism: Instead of …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2013,2
Measuring two-event structural correlations on graphs,Ziyu Guan; Xifeng Yan; Lance M Kaplan,Abstract Real-life graphs usually have various kinds of events happening on them; eg;product purchases in online social networks and intrusion alerts in computer networks. Theoccurrences of events on the same graph could be correlated; exhibiting either attraction orrepulsion. Such structural correlations can reveal important relationships between differentevents. Unfortunately; correlation relationships on graph structures are not well studied andcannot be captured by traditional measures. In this work; we design a novel measure forassessing two-event structural correlations on graphs. Given the occurrences of two events;we choose uniformly a sample of" reference nodes" from the vicinity of all event nodes andemploy the Kendall's τ rank correlation measure to compute the average concordance ofevent density changes. Significance can be efficiently assessed by τ's nice property of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,2
Structural data classification,*,Techniques for classifying structural data with skewed distribution are disclosed. By way ofexample; a method classifying structural input data comprises a computer system performingthe following steps. Multiple classifiers are constructed; wherein each classifier isconstructed on a subset of training data; using one or more selected composite features fromthe subset of training data. A consensus among the multiple classifiers is computed inaccordance with a voting scheme such that at least a portion of the structural input data isassigned to a particular class in accordance with the computed consensus. Such techniquesfor structured data classification are capable of handling skewed class distribution andpartial feature coverage issues.,*,2012,2

Combining near-optimal feature selection with gSpan,Karsten Borgwardt; Xifeng Yan; Marisa Thoma; Hong Cheng; Arthur Gretton; Lee Song; Alex Smola; Jiawei Han; Philip Yu; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Graph classification is an increasingly impor- tant step in numerous application domains; suchas function prediction of molecules and proteins; computerised scene analysis; and anomalydetection in program flows. Among the various approaches proposed in the literature; graphclassification based on frequent subgraphs is a popular branch: Graphs are represented as(usually binary) vectors; with components indicating whether a graph contains a particular subgraphthat is frequent across the dataset. On large graphs; however; one faces the enormous problemthat the number of these frequent subgraphs may grow exponentially with the size of thegraphs; but only few of them possess enough discriminative power to make them useful for graphclassification. Efficient and discriminative feature selection among frequent subgraphs is hencea key challenge for graph mining. In this article; we propose an approach to fea- ture …,MLG,2008,2

Query answering efficiency in expert networks under decentralized search,Liang Ma; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Derya Cansever; Xifeng Yan; Sue Kase; Michelle Vanni,Abstract Expert networks are formed by a group of expert-profes\-sionals with differentspecialties to collaboratively resolve specific queries. In such networks; when a queryreaches an expert who does not have sufficient expertise; this query needs to be routed toother experts for further processing until it is completely solved; therefore; query answeringefficiency is sensitive to the underlying query routing mechanism being used. Among allpossible query routing mechanisms; decentralized search; operating purely on each expert'slocal information without any knowledge of network global structure; represents the mostbasic and scalable routing mechanism. However; there is still a lack of fundamentalunderstanding of the efficiency of decentralized search in expert networks.

Let L be a second order non-negative self-adjoint operator on L 2(X). Assume that the semigroup e-tL generated by L satisfies the Davies-Gaffney estimates.Also; assume that L satisfies Plancherel type estimate. Under these conditions; we show thatStein's square function G δ (L) arising from Bochner-Riesz means associated to L isbounded from the Hardy spaces H p (X) to L p (X) for all 0< p≤ 1.,Acta Mathematica Scientia,2014,1
Synthesizing near-optimal malware specifications from suspicious behaviors,Somesh Jha; Matthew Fredrikson; Mihai Christodoresu; Reiner Sailer; Xifeng Yan,Behavior-based detection techniques are a promising solution to the problem of malwareproliferation. However; they require precise specifications of malicious behavior that do notresult in an excessive number of false alarms; while still remaining general enough to detectnew variants before traditional signatures can be created and distributed. In this paper; wepresent an automatic technique for extracting optimally discriminative specifications; whichuniquely identify a class of programs. Such a discriminative specification can be used by abehavior-based malware detector. Our technique; based on graph mining and stochasticoptimization; scales to large classes of programs. When this work was originally published;the technique yielded favorable results on malware targeted towards workstations (~ 86%detection rates on new malware). We believe that it can be brought to bear on emerging …,Malicious and Unwanted Software:" The Americas"(MALWARE); 2013 8th International Conference on,2013,1
Effect of substrate temperature and dislocation density on the epitaxial growth of YBCO thin films on textured metal tapes,Ya-Xin Xu; Jie Xiong; Yu-Dong Xia; Fei Zhang; Yan Xue; Bo-Wan Tao,Epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7-δ (YBCO) thin films were grown on Y2O3/YSZ/CeO2 (YYC) bufferedNi-5at% W substrates by direct-current sputtering; and induced by substrate temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the substrate temperature strongly influenced theepitaxial growth of YBCO films: the a-axis preferential grains grew at lower substratetemperature; and strictly c-axis epitaxial YBCO films were achieved at higher substratetemperature. The amount of a-axis YBCO component evaluated from the ratio of XRD χ-scanintegrated intensity of the a-axis and c-axis for the YBCO (102) plane decreased as thesubstrate temperature increased. Since the development of the a-axis component can resultin high angle grain boundaries; which can degrade the Ic passing through the a–b plane;the microstructure and the critical current density of YBCO thin films were improved as …,Wuji Cailiao Xuebao(Journal of Inorganic Materials),2013,1

The design and analysis of sub-wavelength metal-grating large-aperture VCSELs,XW Zhang; YQ Ning; L Qin; Y Liu; LJ Wang,Abstract The polarization control of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers with high poweremission has been demonstrated by using metal grating to import non-isotropic gain. Thegrating with a period of 186 nm and a duty ratio of 0.5 was fabricated on the GaAs-cap layerto provide additional reflectance for H-polarization. The pairs of P-distributed Braggreflectors were reduced to realize the maximum difference threshold gain of two orthogonalpolarizations. A polarization ratio of 3 with an output power of 860 mW at continuous-waveoperation was demonstrated at room temperature; and the high-order modes weresuppressed. As a result; the far-field beam divergence was suppressed to 12°.,Applied Physics B,2012,1
Pathological observation of Anoplophora glabripennis larva infected by Beauveria bassiana by using SEM and light microscope,Deng Caiping; Yan Xizhong; Liu Hongxia,Abstract The infection course of Beauveria bassiana in the integument of Anoplophoraglabripennis larva was examined by the scanning electronic microscope (SEM); and ahistopathological study with paraffin section of the midgut of the host was also conducted byusing a light microscope.

An increased secretion of IL-18 is generally a marker for manychronic inflammation and autoimmune disorders; implying its involvement in inflammatoryresponses. Here; it was showed that IL-18 stimulated the expression of CSF-1 in Jurkat Tlymphocytes that might be a manifestation for IL-18 to play its biological functions ininflammatory pathogenesis. The signaling mechanism that contributes to IL-18-inducedtranscriptional activation of CSF-1 was investigated further.

Cross-selling optimization for customized promotion,Nan Li; Yinghui Yang; Xifeng Yan,Abstract The profit of a retail product not only comes from its own sales; but also comes fromits influence on the sales of other products. How to promote the right products to the rightcustomers becomes one of the key issues in marketing. In this paper; we propose a newformulation of promotion value by considering cross-selling effects within selected productsand customers; which were largely ignored by existing work. We investigate the problem ofcustomized promotion; which identifies promotional products and customers so that thepromotion effect can be maximized. This problem can be decomposed into twosubproblems: product selection and customer selection. The baseline methods entail anexhaustive traversal of all possible product and customer combinations; which iscomputationally intractable.

Graph pattern mining has become an important tool in themanagement and analysis of complexly structured data; where example applicationsinclude indexing; clustering; and classification. Existing graph mining algorithms haveachieved great success by exploiting various properties in the pattern space. Unfortunately;due to the fundamental role subgraph isomorphism plays in these methods; they may allenter into a pitfall when the cost to enumerate a huge set of isomorphic embeddings blowsup; especially in large graphs.

The existence of SiO 2 mask leads to the deflection of electric field and effect onthe transportation of ions; which results in the formation of laterally tilted nanopores; whilethe nanopores go down directly when being far from the boundaries of SiO 2.

However; many existing studies rely onsupervised learning; their performance is dramatically limited by the availability of trainingdata. In this work; we generalize textual relation embedding to the distant supervisionsetting; where much larger-scale but noisy training data is available. We propose leveragingglobal statistics of relations; ie; the co-occurrence statistics of textual and knowledge baserelations collected from the entire corpus; to embed textual relations. This approach turns outto be more robust to the training noise introduced by distant supervision.

Recovering Question Answering Errors via Query Revision,Semih Yavuz; Izzeddin Gur; Yu Su; Xifeng Yan,Abstract The existing factoid QA systems often lack a post-inspection component that canhelp models recover from their own mistakes. In this work; we propose to crosscheck thecorresponding KB relations behind the predicted answers and identify potentialinconsistencies. Instead of developing a new model that accepts evidences collected fromthese relations; we choose to plug them back to the original questions directly and check ifthe revised question makes sense or not. A bidirectional LSTM is applied to encode revisedquestions. We develop a scoring mechanism over the revised question encodings to refinethe predictions of a base QA system. This approach can improve the F1 score of STAGG (Yihet al.; 2015); one of the leading QA systems; from 52.5% to 53.9% on WE-BQUESTIONSdata.,Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2017,*

Observability of Lattice Graphs,Fangqiu Han; Subhash Suri; Xifeng Yan,Abstract We consider a graph observability problem: how many edge colors are needed foran unlabeled graph so that an agent; walking from node to node; can uniquely determine itslocation from just the observed color sequence of the walk? Specifically; let G (n; d) be anedge-colored subgraph of d-dimensional (directed or undirected) lattice of size n^ d= n * n *⋯ * n nd= n× n×⋯× n. We say that G (n; d) is t-observable if an agent can uniquely determineits current position in the graph from the color sequence of any t-dimensional walk; wherethe dimension is the number of different directions spanned by the edges of the walk. A walkin an undirected lattice G (n; d) has dimension between 1 and d; but a directed walk canhave dimension between 1 and 2 d because of two different orientations for each axis.

Measuring Structural Correlations in Graphs,Ziyu Guan; Xifeng Yan,The rise of the Web; social networks; and bioinformatics has presented the scientists withnumerous graphs; each consisting of millions of nodes and edges. Hidden in these largedatasets are the answers to important questions in networking; sociology; business; andbiology. These graphs not only have topological structures but also contain events/activitiesthat occurred on their nodes. For example; an eBay customer could sell or bid on a product;a Facebook user could play a Zynga game with friends; a computer in the Internet couldsuffer various attacks from hackers. This complex combination raises new researchproblems in the graph data analysis (Ester et al.; 2006; Moser et al.; 2009; Silva; Meira; andZaki; 2010). Among different events taking place in a network; some exhibit strongcorrelations with the network structure; while others do not.

SLQ: A User-friendly Graph Querying System,Shengqi Yang Yinghui Wu Huan Sun; Xifeng Yan,Abstract—Querying complex graph databases such as knowledge graphs is a challengingtask for non-professional users. In this work; we present SLQ; a user-friendly graph queryingsystem enabling schemaless and structureless graph querying; where a user need notdescribe queries precisely as required by most databases. SLQ system combines searchingand ranking: it leverages a set of transformation functions; including abbreviation; ontology;synonym; etc.; that map keywords and linkages from a query to their matches in a datagraph; based on an automatically learned ranking model. To help users better understandsearch results at different levels of granularity; it supports effective result summarization with“drill-down” and “roll-up” operations. Better still; the architecture of SLQ is elastic for newtransformation functions; query logs and user feedback; to interactively refine ranking …,GSWC 2014,2014,*

Mining knowledge from interconnected data,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; S Yu Philip,Abstract Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected; forming complex;heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However; most peopleconsider a database merely as a data repository that supports data storage and retrievalrather than one or a set of heterogeneous information networks that contain rich; inter-related; multi-typed data and information. Most network science researchers only studyhomogeneous networks; without distinguishing the different types of objects and links in thenetworks. In this tutorial; we view database and other interconnected data as heterogeneousinformation networks; and study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of types ofobjects and links in the networks. We systematically introduce the technologies that caneffectively and efficiently mine useful knowledge from such information networks.© 2012 …,*,2012,*

An Indexing System for Mobility-aware Information Management,Misael Mongiovı; Ambuj Singh; Xifeng Yan; Bo Zong; Konstantinos Psounis,ABSTRACT We analyze the problem of minimizing the cost for satisfying informationdemand in a network of moving nodes; where the communication between nodes is subjectto distance constraints and a costly communication link with an information source (centralserver or Internet). This problem has applications in several fields ranging from vehicularnetworks to space exploration; and it is NP-hard. We propose a novel indexing system that isable to reduce the search space and show that in practical cases; our system is able to findan optimal solution in a reasonable length of time. An extensive experimental analysis onlarge real and synthetic datasets shows that the proposed method responds in less than 10seconds on datasets with millions of events and thousands of information requests; with animprovement of up to 100 times compared to the non-indexed solution.,*,2011,*

In this approach; time is divided such that beaconframes and the super frame duration of a given coordinator are sent during the inactiveperiod of its neighbor coordinators. The idea is that each coordinator selects the starting timeBeacon_Tx_Offset to transmit its beacon frame. The starting time must be different from thestarting times of its neighbor coordinators and their parents. This approach requires that acoordinator wakes up both in its active period and in its parent's active period.

Approximate Quantile Computation over Sensor Networks,Xifeng Yan; Jiong Yang; Wei Wang; Jiawei Han,Sensor networks have been deployed in various environments; from battle field surveillanceto weather monitoring. The amount of data generated by the sensors can be large. One wayto analyze such large data set is to capture the essential statistics of the data. Thus thequantile computation in the large scale sensor network becomes an important butchallenging problem. The data may be widely distributed; eg; there may be thousands ofsensors. In addition; the memory and bandwidth among sensors could be quite limited. Mostprevious quantile computation methods assume that the data is either stored or streaming ina centralized site; which could not be directly applied in the sensor environment. In thispaper; we propose a novel algorithm to compute the quantile for sensor network data; whichdynamically adapts to the memory limitations. Moreover; since sensors may update their …,*,2005,*

Trend Discovery; through the extraction of trending topics; is utilized inmarketing campaigns and by companies to identify customer interests and potential newmarkets. While there is a plethora of techniques to identify trending topics; there is a lack offocus on the characteristics of the underlying population that participate in a trend. Users thatmention a topic define a multivariate vector of demographics and user characteristics withthe potential to offer insights into the communities that are focused on a topic; both latent andobvious. We propose a novel algorithmic framework for the efficient and scalable extractionof the combination of user characteristics that define a community interested in a topic …,*,*,*

Analysis of Partition in Scale-free Network,Yuanyang Zhang; Xifeng Yan,1. ABSTRACT While social network is becoming more and more important in our everydaylife; it is becoming huger and huger. How to partition a social network is one of the mostfundamental and important problems in social network. In recent years; a lot of partitionalgorithms have been proposed for social networks. But none of them could achieve goodpartition results as they were in random graphs; which gives a small global cut betweenpartitions. A natural question is: Does there really exist partition methods for social network?This report takes a small step towards this question. Using the preferential attachmentmodel; the lower and upper bound of the expectation of cut when partitioning the graph intotwo parts have been presented in this report. Based on preferential attachment model; wepropose a partition growth model. The intuition behind it is that; when a new vertex adds …,*,*,*
A Configurable Natural Language Question Benchmark for Knowledge Bases,Yu Su; Huan Sun; Brian Sadler; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Izzeddin Gur; Zenghui Yan; Xifeng Yan,Abstract—Supporting natural language interface is crucial for accessing knowledge bases(KBs) due to the complexity of their schema. Many natural language interfaces to KBs(NLIKBs) have been built to simplify query formulation and facilitate advanced applicationslike personal intelligent assistant. Unfortunately; there is a lack of a comprehensive naturallanguage question benchmark that is able to fairly evaluate different NLIKBs in terms ofaccuracy and runtime. In this paper; we propose a framework to construct comprehensivequestion benchmarks; where an array of question characteristics; including query size;commonness; modifier; answer cardinality; and paraphrasing; are made configurable. Thebenchmark constructed in this way delivers unprecedentedly fine-grained performanceprofiling; broken down by each question characteristic; which is important for performance …,*,*,*

Under consideration for publication in Knowledge and Information Systems,Petre Tzvetkov; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract. Sequential pattern mining has been studied extensively in data mining community.Most previous studies require the specification of a min support threshold for mining acomplete set of sequential patterns satisfying the threshold. However; in practice; it is difficultfor users to provide an appropriate min support threshold. To overcome this difficulty; wepropose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed sequential patterns oflength no less than min ą; where k is the desired number of closed sequential patterns to bemined; and min ą is the minimal length of each pattern. We mine the set of closed patternssince it is a compact representation of the complete set of frequent patterns. An efficientalgorithm; called TSP; is developed for mining such patterns without min support. Starting at(absolute) min support= 1; the algorithm makes use of the length constraint and the …,*,*,*

Problems can be diverse in nature; including IT problems; expertfinding; information search; decision making; etc. In large organizations; it is sometimesextremely difficult to pinpoint the right problem resolver due to the great diversity of problemsand people's expertise. Typically; when an expert is assigned with a problem; she tries todiagnose and resolve it using her own knowledge. If the problem cannot be resolved; shewill then forward it; along with her diagnosis; to other experts she considers capable ofresolving it. The problem may continue being routed among experts until it is resolved by theright person.

Approximate Frequent Pattern Mining,S Yu Philip; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Hong Cheng; Feida Zhu,Summary Frequent pattern mining has been a focused theme in data mining research andan important first step in the analysis of data arising in a broad range of applications. Thetraditional exact model for frequent pattern requires that every item occurs in eachsupporting transaction. However; real application data is usually subject to random noise ormeasurement error; which poses new challenges for the efficient discovery of frequentpattern from the noisy data. Mining approximate frequent pattern in the presence of noiseinvolves two key issues: the definition of a noise-tolerant mining model and the design of anefficient mining algorithm. In this paper; we will give an overview of the approximate itemsetand sequential pattern mining.,*,*,*
