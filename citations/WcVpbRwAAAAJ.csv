Doping Strategies for Monolayer MoS2 via Surface Adsorption: A Systematic Study,Priyank Rastogi; Sanjay Kumar; Somnath Bhowmick; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,Using density functional theory calculations; we have systematically explored the effect ofsurface adsorption of different atoms on the electronic properties of monolayer molybdenumdisulfide (MoS2). We have chosen a few representative members from each group in theperiodic table; ranging from alkali metals (group I) to halogens (group VII); and calculatedthe electronic band structure of the adatom–MoS2 system for the most energetically stablelocation of the adatom adsorbed on MoS2. The calculated value of charge transfer from theadsorbed adatom to MoS2 and resultant shifting of the Fermi level to the conduction bandsuggest that the group I (Li; Na; K) and group II metals (Mg; Ca) are the most effectiveadatoms to enhance the n-type mobile carrier density in MoS2. Our calculation is in goodagreement with the experimental observation for K [Nano Lett. 2013; 13; 1991].,J. Phys. Chem. C,2014,44
Equation of motion approach to non-adiabatic quantum charge pumping,Amit Agarwal; Diptiman Sen,Abstract We use the equations of motion of non-interacting electrons in a one-dimensionalsystem to numerically study different aspects of charge pumping. We study the effects of thepumping frequency; amplitude; band filling and finite bias on the charge pumped per cycle;and the Fourier transforms of the charge and energy currents in the leads. Our method worksfor all values of parameters; and gives the complete time dependences of the current andcharge at any site of the system. Our results agree with Floquet and adiabatic scatteringtheory where these are applicable; and provides support for a mechanism proposedelsewhere for charge pumping by a travelling potential wave. For non-adiabatic and strongpumping; the charge and energy currents are found to have a marked asymmetry betweenthe two leads; and pumping can work even against a substantial bias.,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2007,36
Electric field induced gap modification in ultrathin blue phosphorous,Barun Ghosh; Suhas Nahas; Somnath Bhowmick; Amit Agarwal,Abstract We investigate the possibility of band structure engineering in the recently predicted2D layered form of blue phosphorus via an electric field (E z) applied perpendicular to thelayer (s). Using density functional theory; we study the effect of a transverse electric field inmonolayer as well as three differently stacked bilayer structures of blue phosphorus. We findthat for E z> 0.2 V/Å the direct energy gap at the Γ point; which is much larger than thedefault indirect band gap of mono-and bilayer blue phosphorus; decreases linearly with theincreasing electric field; becomes comparable to the default indirect band gap at E z≈ 0.45(0.35) V/Å for monolayer (bilayers); and decreases further until the semiconductor to metaltransition of 2D blue phosphorus takes place at E z≈ 0.7 (0.5) V/Å for monolayer (bilayers).Calculated values of the electron and hole effective masses along various high symmetry …,Phys.

Plasmon mass and Drude weight in strongly spin-orbit-coupled two-dimensional electron gases,Amit Agarwal; Stefano Chesi; T Jungwirth; Jairo Sinova; Giovanni Vignale; Marco Polini,Abstract Spin-orbit-coupled two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are a textbookexample of helical Fermi liquids; ie; quantum liquids in which spin (or pseudospin) andmomentum degrees of freedom at the Fermi surface have a well-defined correlation. Herewe study the long-wavelength plasmon dispersion and the Drude weight of archetypical spin-orbit-coupled 2DEGs. We first show that these measurable quantities are sensitive toelectron-electron interactions due to broken Galilean invariance and then discuss in detailwhy the popular random phase approximation is not capable of describing the collectivedynamics of these systems even at very long wavelengths. This work is focused onpresenting approximate microscopic calculations of these quantities based on the minimaltheoretical scheme that captures the basic physics correctly; ie; the time-dependent …,Physical Review B,2011,34
Nonadiabatic charge pumping in a one-dimensional system of noninteracting electrons by an oscillating potential,Amit Agarwal; Diptiman Sen,Abstract Using a tight-binding model; we study one-parameter charge pumping in a one-dimensional system of noninteracting electrons. An oscillating potential is applied at onesite; while a static potential is applied in a different region. Using Floquet scattering theory;we calculate the current up to second order in the oscillation amplitude and exactly in theoscillation frequency. For low frequency; the charge pumped per cycle is proportional to thefrequency and; therefore; vanishes in the adiabatic limit. If the static potential has a boundstate; we find that such a state has a significant effect on the pumped charge if the oscillatingpotential can excite the bound state into the continuum states or vice versa. Finally; we usethe equation of motion for the density matrix to numerically compute the pumped current forany value of the amplitude and frequency. The numerical results confirm the unusual …,Physical Review B,2007,29
Charge transport in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid: Effects of pumping and bias,Amit Agarwal; Diptiman Sen,Abstract We study the current produced in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by an applied biasand by weak; pointlike impurity potentials which are oscillating in time. We use bosonizationto perturbatively calculate the current up to second order in the impurity potentials. In theregime of small bias and low pumping frequency; both the dc and ac components of thecurrent have power-law dependences on the bias and pumping frequencies with anexponent 2 K− 1 for spinless electrons; where K is the interaction parameter. For K< 1∕ 2;the current grows large for special values of the bias. For noninteracting electrons with K= 1;our results agree with those obtained using Floquet scattering theory for Dirac fermions. Wealso discuss the cases of extended impurities and of spin-1∕ 2 electrons.,Physical Review B,2007,29
Finite time interaction quench in a Luttinger Liquid,Rashi Sachdeva; Tanay Nag; Amit Agarwal; Amit Dutta,Abstract We analyze the dynamics of a Luttinger model following a quench in the electron-electron interaction strength; where the change in the interaction strength occurs over a finitetime scale τ. We study the Loschmidt echo (the overlap between the initial and final state) asa function of time; both numerically and within a perturbation scheme; treating the change inthe interaction strength as a small parameter; for all τ. We derive the corrections appearingin (a) the Loschmidt echo for a finite quench duration τ;(b) the scaling of the echo following asudden (τ→ 0) quench; and (c) the scaling of the echo after an adiabatic (τ→∞) quench. Westudy in detail the limiting cases of the echo in the early-time and infinite-time limits; andprovide scaling arguments to understand these in a general context. We also show that ourperturbative results are in good agreement with the exact numerical ones.,Phys. Rev. B,2014,25
Enhancement of tunneling density of states at a junction of three Luttinger liquid wires,Amit Agarwal; Sourin Das; Sumathi Rao; Diptiman Sen,Abstract We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) for a junction of three Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid wires. We show that there are fixed points which allow for the enhancementof the TDOS; which is unusual for Luttinger liquids. The distance from the junction overwhich this enhancement occurs is of the order of x= v/(2 ω); where v is the plasmon velocityand ω is the bias frequency. Beyond this distance; the TDOS crosses over to the standardbulk value independent of the fixed point describing the junction. This finite range ofdistances opens up the possibility of experimentally probing the enhancement in each wireindividually.,Physical review letters,2009,25

The model is thoroughly validated with the TCAD simulationswith respect to ferroelectric thickness scaling and temperature effects. Interestingly; we findthat an NCFET with PZT ferroelectric of a large thickness provides a negative outputdifferential resistance in addition to an expected high ON current and a sub-60 mV/decadesubthreshold swing. The model is also tested for the Gummel symmetry and its transientcapabilities are highlighted through a ring oscillator circuit simulation.,IEEE transactions on electron devices,2016,20
Thickness and electric-field-dependent polarizability and dielectric constant in phosphorene,Piyush Kumar; BS Bhadoria; Sanjay Kumar; Somnath Bhowmick; Yogesh Singh Chauhan; Amit Agarwal,Abstract Based on extensive first-principles calculations; we explore the thickness-dependent effective dielectric constant and slab polarizability of few-layer blackphosphorene. We find that the dielectric constant in ultrathin phosphorene is thickness-dependent and it can be further tuned by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Thedecreasing dielectric constant with reducing number of layers of phosphorene is a directconsequence of the lower permittivity of the outer layers and the increasing surface-to-volume ratio. We also show that the slab polarizability depends linearly on the number oflayers; implying a nearly constant polarizability per phosphorus atom. Our calculation of thethickness-and electric-field-dependent dielectric properties will be useful for designing andinterpreting transport experiments in gated phosphorene devices; wherever electrostatic …,Physical Review B,2016,20
Long-lived spin plasmons in a spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gas,Amit Agarwal; Marco Polini; Giovanni Vignale; Michael E Flatte,Abstract Collective charge-density modes (plasmons) of the clean two-dimensionalunpolarized electron gas are stable; for momentum conservation prevents them fromdecaying into single-particle excitations. Collective spin-density modes (spin plasmons)possess no similar protection and rapidly decay by production of electron-hole pairs.Nevertheless; if the electron gas has a sufficiently high degree of spin polarization (P> 1/7;where P is the ratio of the equilibrium spin density and the total electron density; for aparabolic single-particle spectrum) we find that a long-lived spin plasmon—a collectivemode in which the densities of up and down spins oscillate with opposite phases—can existwithin a “pseudogap” of the single-particle excitation spectrum. The ensuing collectivizationof the spin excitation spectrum is quite remarkable and should be directly visible in …,Phys. Rev. B,2014,20
Plasmon modes of a massive Dirac plasma; and their superlattices,Rashi Sachdeva; Anmol Thakur; Giovanni Vignale; Amit Agarwal,Abstract We explore the collective density oscillations of a collection of charged massiveDirac particles; in one; two; and three dimensions; and their one-dimensional (1D)superlattice. We calculate the long-wavelength limit of the dynamical polarization functionanalytically; and use the random phase approximation to obtain the plasmon dispersion.The density dependence of the long-wavelength plasmon frequency in massive Diracsystems is found to be different compared to systems with parabolic and gapless Diracdispersion. We also calculate the long-wavelength plasmon dispersion of a 1D metamaterialmade from 1D and 2D massive Dirac plasma. Our analytical results will be useful forexploring the use of massive Dirac materials as electrostatically tunable plasmonicmetamaterials and can be experimentally verified by infrared spectroscopy; as in the case …,Physical Review B,2015,16
Conductance of quantum wires: A numerical study of effects of an impurity and interactions,Amit Agarwal; Diptiman Sen,Abstract We use the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism and a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation to numerically study the effects of a single impurity and interactionsbetween the electrons (with and without spin) on the conductance of a quantum wire. Westudy how the conductance varies with the wire length; the temperature; and the strengths ofthe impurity and interactions. The numerical results for the dependence of the conductanceon the wire length and temperature are compared with the results obtained from arenormalization group analysis based on the Hartree-Fock approximation. For the spin-1∕ 2model with a repulsive on-site interaction or the spinless model with an attractive nearestneighbor interaction; we find that the conductance increases with increasing wire length ordecreasing temperature. This can be explained using the Born approximation in …,Physical Review B,2006,15
Persistent spin oscillations in a spin-orbit-coupled superconductor,Amit Agarwal; Marco Polini; Rosario Fazio; G Vignale,Abstract Quasi-two-dimensional superconductors with tunable spin-orbit coupling are veryinteresting systems with properties that are also potentially useful for applications. In thisLetter we demonstrate that these systems exhibit undamped collective spin oscillations thatcan be excited by the application of a supercurrent.

Electric-field tunable Dirac semimetal state in phosphorene thin films,Barun Ghosh; Bahadur Singh; Rajendra Prasad; Amit Agarwal,Abstract We study the electric-field tunable electronic properties of phosphorene thin films;using the framework of density functional theory. We show that phosphorene thin films offera versatile material platform to study two-dimensional Dirac fermions on application of atransverse electric field. Increasing the strength of the transverse electric field beyond acertain critical value in phosphorene thin films leads to the formation of two symmetryprotected gapless Dirac fermions states with anisotropic energy dispersion. The spin-orbitcoupling splits each of these Dirac states into two spin-polarized Dirac cones which are alsoprotected by nonsymmorphic crystal symmetries. Our study shows that the position as wellas the carrier velocity of the spin-polarized Dirac cone states can be controlled by thestrength of the external electric field.,Physical Review B,2016,13
First-principles cluster expansion study of functionalization of black phosphorene via fluorination and oxidation,Suhas Nahas; Barun Ghosh; Somnath Bhowmick; Amit Agarwal,Abstract Predicting the ground states for surface adsorption is a challenging problembecause the number of degrees of freedom involved in the process is very high. Most of thestudies deal with some specific arrangements of adsorbates on a given surface; but very fewof them actually attempt to find the ground states for different adatom coverage. In this work;we show the effectiveness of the cluster expansion method to predict the “ground states”resulting from chemisorption of oxygen and fluorine atom on the surface of monolayer blackphosphorus or phosphorene. For device applications; we find that in addition to band-gaptuning; controlled chemisorption can change the unique anisotropic carrier effective mass forboth the electrons and holes and even rotate them by 90∘; which can be useful for exploringunusual quantum Hall effect and electronic devices based on phosphorene.,Physical Review B,2016,13
Compact model for ferroelectric negative capacitance transistor with MFIS structure,Girish Pahwa; Tapas Dutta; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,We present a physics-based compact model for a ferroelectric negative capacitance FET(NCFET) with a metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) structure. The model iscomputationally efficient; and it accurately calculates the gate charge density as a function ofthe applied voltages. For the first time; an explicit expression for the channel current in bulkNCFET is also deduced taking into account the spatial variation of ferroelectric polarizationin the longitudinal direction. Using current continuity condition in the channel; we find thatdifferent regions of the ferroelectric may operate in a positive or a negative capacitance statedepending on the external biases. The model captures the impact of ferroelectric thicknessscaling and variation in the ferroelectric material parameters; and has been validatedagainst the implicit approach involving full numerical computations as well as …,IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices,2017,12

Four allotropes of semiconducting layered arsenic that switch into a topological insulator via an electric field: Computational study,Sougata Mardanya; Vinay Kumar Thakur; Somnath Bhowmick; Amit Agarwal,Abstract We propose four different thermodynamically stable structural phases of arsenicmonolayers based on ab initio density functional theory calculations; all of which undergo atopological phase transition on application of a perpendicular electric field. All four arsenicmonolayer allotropes have a wide band gap; varying from 1.21 to 3.0 eV (based on GWcalculations); and in general they undergo a metal-insulator quantum phase transition onapplication of uniaxial in-layer strain. Additionally; an increasing transverse electric fieldinduces band inversion at the Γ point in all four monolayer allotropes; leading to a nontrivialtopological phase (insulating for three allotropes and metallic for one allotrope);characterized by the switching of the Z 2 index from 0 (before band inversion) to 1 (afterband inversion). The topological phase tuned by the transverse electric field should …,Physical Review B,2016,11

Plasmons in spin polarized graphene: a new way to measure spin polarization,Amit Agarwal; Giovanni Vignale,Abstract We study the collective charge excitations (plasmons) in spin-polarized graphene;and derive explicit expressions for their dispersion in the undamped regime. From this; weare able to calculate the critical wave vector beyond which the plasmon enters the electron-hole continuum; its quality factor decreasing sharply. We find that the value of the criticalwave vector is strongly spin-polarization dependent; in a way that has no analog in ordinarytwo-dimensional electron gases. The origin of this effect is in the coupling between theplasmon and the interband electron-hole pairs of the minority spin carriers. We show that theeffect is robust with respect to the inclusion of disorder and we suggest that it can beexploited to experimentally determine the spin polarization of graphene.,Phys. Rev. B,2015,10

Using a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for borophene; we analyticallycalculate the density-density response function of borophene and study its anisotropicplasmon dispersion and screening properties. We find that the anisotropic plasmon mode in8− P mmn borophene remains undamped for higher energies along the mirror symmetrydirection. The Friedel oscillation in borophene is found to decay as r− 3 in the large-r limit;with both the amplitude as well as the periodicity of the Friedel oscillations being anisotropic.,Physical Review B,2017,9

The polarization function is then used to find the dispersionof the plasmon modes; and electrostatic screening of Coulomb interactions within therandom phase approximation. We find that for massive Dirac systems; the oscillatingscreened potential (or density) decays as r− 2 and r− 3 in two and three dimensionsrespectively; and as r− 1 for one dimensional non-interacting systems.

Effective Doping of Monolayer Phosphorene by Surface Adsorption of Atoms for Electronic and Spintronic Applications,Priyank Rastogi; Sanjay Kumar; Somnath Bhowmick; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,ABSTRACT We study the effect of surface adsorption of 27 different adatoms on theelectronic and magnetic properties of monolayer black phosphorus using density functionaltheory. Choosing a few representative elements from each group; ranging from alkali metals(group I) to halogens (group VII); we calculate the band structure; density of states; magneticmoment and effective mass for the energetically most stable location of the adatom onmonolayer phosphorene. We predict that group I metals (Li; Na; K); and group III adatoms(Al; Ga; In) are effective in enhancing the n-type mobile carrier density; with group IIIadatoms resulting in lower effective mass of the electrons; and thus higher mobilities.Furthermore; we find that the adatoms of transition metals Ti and Fe produce a finitemagnetic moment (1.87 and 2.31 μ B) in monolayer phosphorene; with different band gap …,IETE Journal of Research,2017,8
Impact of channel thickness variation on bandstructure and source-to-drain tunneling in ultra-thin body III-V MOSFETs,Tapas Dutta; Sanjay Kumar; Priyank Rastogi; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,In nanoscale MOSFETs with sub-10 nm channels; the source-to-drain tunneling is expectedto be a critical bottleneck; especially in III-V devices on account of their extremely loweffective masses. Also; to maintain electrostatic integrity at extremely small gate lengths; thechannels need to be made ultrathin. In such devices; the bandstructure of the channelmaterial becomes thickness dependent due to quantum confinement effects; and deviatesremarkably from that of the bulk material. In this paper; we use first principle densityfunctional theory calculations to evaluate the variation of the effective mass and bandgapwith channel thickness. Then; we perform semi-classical ballistic and full quantum non-equilibrium Green's function transport simulations to study the impact on source-to-draintunneling in III-V nMOSFETs.

Line junction in a quantum Hall system with two filling fractions,Diptiman Sen; Amit Agarwal,Abstract We present a microscopic model for a line junction formed by counter orcopropagating single mode quantum Hall edges corresponding to different filling factors.The ends of the line junction can be described by two possible current splitting matriceswhich are dictated by the conditions of both lack of dissipation and the existence of a linearrelation between the bosonic fields. Tunneling between the two edges of the line junctionthen leads to a microscopic understanding of a phenomenological description of linejunctions introduced some time ago. The effect of density-density interactions between thetwo edges is considered; and renormalization-group ideas are used to study how thetunneling parameter changes with the length scale. This leads to a power-law variation ofthe conductance of the line junction with the temperature. Depending on the strength of …,Physical Review B,2008,7

The model is based on a calculation of the charge density along thechannel which is then used to solve Poisson's equation to get the variation of the channelpotential. This is then used to calculate the ballistic and drift-diffusive components of thecurrent. The model is capable of accurately predicting the terminal IV characteristics for alldrain and gate biases and includes short-channel effects.

In theabsence of the magnetic field; the time dependent average values of position and velocityshow damped oscillations dependent on the width of the wave packet. In the presence of atransverse magnetic field; the wave packet amplitude shows oscillatory behaviour over shorttimescales associated with classical cyclotron orbit; followed by the phenomena ofspontaneous collapse and revival over larger timescales. We relate the timescales of theseeffects based on general arguments. Our results may also be useful; for the interpretation …,The European Physical Journal B,2014,6

Thickness and Stacking Dependent Polarizability and Dielectric Constant of Graphene–Hexagonal Boron Nitride Composite Stacks,Piyush Kumar; Yogesh Singh Chauhan; Amit Agarwal; Somnath Bhowmick,The giant carrier mobility of graphene is significantly reduced due to external perturbations;such as substrate based charge impurities; and their impact can be minimized byencapsulating graphene between hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers. Using densityfunctional theory (DFT) based ab initio calculations; we study the static response of such acomposite by placing it in a vertical electric field. We find that at relatively low electric field(∼ 0.1 V/Å); although the relative permittivity (εr) of a composite stack increases with thenumber of layers; εr for a fixed stack thickness is independent of the field strength. However;at higher electric field strength; εr increases monotonically with the applied field strengtheven for a fixed stack thickness; signifying nonlinear response.

Anisotropic plasmons; excitons; and electron energy loss spectroscopy of phosphorene,Barun Ghosh; Piyush Kumar; Anmol Thakur; Yogesh Singh Chauhan; Somnath Bhowmick; Amit Agarwal,Abstract In this article; we explore the anisotropic electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) inmonolayer phosphorene based on ab initio time-dependent density-functional-theorycalculations. Similarly to black phosphorus; the EELS of undoped monolayer phosphoreneis characterized by anisotropic excitonic peaks for energies in the vicinity of the band gapand by interband plasmon peaks for higher energies. On doping; an additional intrabandplasmon peak also appears for energies within the band gap. Similarly to other two-dimensional systems; the intraband plasmon peak disperses as ω pl∝ q in both the zigzagand armchair directions in the long-wavelength limit and deviates for larger wave vectors.The anisotropy of the long-wavelength plasmon intraband dispersion is found to beinversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of the effective masses: ω pl (qy ̂)/ω …,Physical Review B,2017,3

Enhancement of tunneling density of states at a Y junction of spin-1/2 Tomonaga Luttinger liquid wires,Sougata Mardanya; Amit Agarwal,Abstract We calculate the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in a dissipationless three-wirejunction of interacting spin-1/2 electrons; and find an anomalous enhancement of the TDOSin the zero-bias limit; even for repulsive interactions for several bosonic fixed points. Thisenhancement is physically related to the reflection of holes from the junction for incidentelectrons; and it occurs only in the vicinity of the junction (x< v min/2 ω; where v min is theminimum of the velocity of charge or spin excitations and ω is the bias frequency); crossingover to the bulk value; which is always suppressed at larger distances.

Ab-initio study of doping versus adsorption in monolayer M0S2,Priyank Rastogi; Sanjay Kumar; Somnath Bhowmick; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,To modulate the conductivity of channel as well as for controlling threshold voltage of thedevice doping is required. Sometimes this doping can be unintentional via adsorption ofimpurities. We have found by ab-initio density functional theory calculations that K and Nbatoms change the system into n-type; and Br changes into p-type if adsorbed on monolayerof MoS 2. Similarly Cl; V and P introduce mid-gap states/trap levels in the band gap foradsorption. In case of substitutional doping; it is found that P and Nb make monolayer MoS 2p-type if these elements replace the S atom and the Mo atom; and Cl makes it degenerate n-type if it replaces the S atom in monolayer MoS 2.,Emerging Electronics (ICEE); 2014 IEEE 2nd International Conference on,2014,3
Time-resolved transport properties of a Y junction of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid wires,Amit Agarwal,Abstract We study time-resolved transport properties of a Y junction composed of interactingone-dimensional quantum wires using a bosonization approach.

An Improved Model for Quasi-Ballistic Transport in MOSFETs,Avirup Dasgupta; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,We have already presented a compact model for FETs operating in the quasi-ballisticregime [1]. However; this model suffers from two important problems: 1) the profile for chargedensity along the channel is not correctly accounted for and 2) current is not conservedthroughout the channel. In this brief; we propose improvement; which does away with theseinaccuracies.,IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices,2017,2
Unified compact model for nanowire transistors including quantum effects and quasi-ballistic transport,Avirup Dasgupta; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,We present a surface potential-based compact model for nanowire FETs; which considers 1-D electrostatics along with the effect of multiple energy subbands. The model is valid for anysemiconductor material; cross-sectional geometry; and any channel length with transportregimes varying from drift-diffusive to quasi-ballistic.

Casimir effect for a Bose–Einstein condensate inside a cylindrical tube,Shyamal Biswas; Saugata Bhattacharyya; Amit Agarwal,Abstract We explore the Casimir effect on an interacting Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC)inside a cylindrical tube. The Casimir force for the confined BEC consists of (i) a mean-fieldpart arising from the spatial inhomogeneity of the condensate order parameter; and (ii) aquantum fluctuation part arising from the confinement of Bogoliubov excitations in thecondensate. Our analytical result predicts Casimir force on a cylindrical shallow of 4 He wellbelow the λ-point; and can be tested experimentally.,Journal of Physics B: Atomic; Molecular and Optical Physics,2015,2
Dynamic current-current susceptibility in three-dimensional Dirac and Weyl semimetals,Anmol Thakur; Krishanu Sadhukhan; Amit Agarwal,Abstract We study the linear response of doped three-dimensional Dirac and Weylsemimetals to vector potentials; by calculating the wave-vector-and frequency-dependentcurrent-current response function analytically. The longitudinal part of the dynamic current-current response function is then used to study the plasmon dispersion and the opticalconductivity. The transverse response in the static limit yields the orbital magneticsusceptibility. In a Weyl semimetal; along with the current-current response function; allthese quantities are significantly impacted by the presence of parallel electric and magneticfields (a finite E· B term) and can be used to experimentally explore the chiral anomaly.,Physical Review B,2018,1
Band-to-band tunneling in Γ valley for Ge source lateral tunnel field effect transistor: Thickness scaling,Prateek Jain; Priyank Rastogi; Chandan Yadav; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,The direct and indirect valleys in Germanium (Ge) are separated by a very small offset;which opens up the prospect of direct tunneling in the Γ valley of an extended Ge sourcetunnel field effect transistor (TFET). We explore the impact of thickness scaling of extendedGe source lateral TFET on the band to band tunneling (BTBT) current. The Ge source isextended inside the gate by 2 nm to confine the tunneling in Ge only. We observe that as thethickness is scaled; the band alignment at the Si/Ge heterojunction changes significantly;which results in an increase in Ge to Si BTBT current. Based on density functionalcalculations; we first obtain the band structure parameters (bandgap; effective masses; etc.)for the Ge and Si slabs of varying thickness; and these are then used to obtain the thicknessdependent Kane's BTBT tunneling parameters. We find that electrostatics improves as the …,Journal of Applied Physics,2017,1
Evidence of density waves in single-crystalline nanowires of pyrochlore iridates,Abhishek Juyal; Amit Agarwal; Soumik Mukhopadhyay,Abstract We present experimental evidence of emergent density-wave instability in single-crystalline low-dimensional wires of yttrium-based pyrochlore iridates. We demonstrateelectric-field-induced nonlinear hysteretic switching of the density wave at low temperature;followed by smooth nonlinear conduction at higher temperature (T> 40 K) in Y 2− x Bi x Ir 2O 7; with x= 0 and 0.3. The ac transport measurements reveal the presence of four differentcollective relaxation processes which dominate at different temperature scales. There is astrong coupling of the normal charge carriers with the density-wave condensate; which isreflected in the linear scaling of the dc conductivity with the collective relaxation rate acrossa wide range of frequencies and temperatures. The evidence of the density wave in low-dimensional single crystals of pyrochlore iridate could be a precursor to the possible …,Physical Review B,2017,1
Power dissipation for systems with junctions of multiple quantum wires,Amit Agarwal; Sourin Das; Diptiman Sen,Abstract We study power dissipation for systems of multiple quantum wires meeting at ajunction; in terms of a current splitting matrix (M) describing the junction. We present aunified framework for studying dissipation for wires with either interacting electrons (ie;Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid wires with Fermi-liquid leads) or noninteracting electrons. Weshow that for a given matrix M; the eigenvalues of MTM characterize the dissipation; and theeigenvectors identify the combinations of bias voltages which need to be applied to thedifferent wires in order to maximize the dissipation associated with the junction. We use ouranalysis to propose and study some microscopic models of a dissipative junction whichemploy the edge states of a quantum Hall liquid. These models realize some specific formsof the M matrix whose entries depends on the tunneling amplitudes between the different …,Physical Review B,2010,1
AC conductivity of a quantum Hall line junction,Amit Agarwal; Diptiman Sen,Abstract We present a microscopic model for calculating the AC conductivity of a finite lengthline junction made up of two counter-or co-propagating single mode quantum Hall edgeswith possibly different filling fractions. The effect of density–density interactions and a localtunneling conductance (σ) between the two edges is considered. Assuming that σ isindependent of the frequency ω; we derive expressions for the AC conductivity as a functionof ω; the length of the line junction and other parameters of the system. We reproduce theresults of Sen and Agarwal (2008 Phys. Rev. B 78 085430) in the DC limit (\omega\to 0); andgeneralize those results for an interacting system. As a function of ω; the AC conductivityshows significant oscillations if σ is small; the oscillations become less prominent as σincreases.

Compact Modeling of Cross-Sectional Scaling in Gate-All-Around FETs: 3-D to 1-D Transition,Avirup Dasgupta; Priyank Rastogi; Amit Agarwal; Chenming Hu; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,We model the effects of cross-sectional radius scaling on ${C} $–${V} $ and ${I} $–${V} $characteristics of gate-all-around FETs (GAAFETs); capturing the continuous transition froma 3-D electron system to a 1-D electron system.

Negative Longitudinal Magnetoresistance in the Density Wave Phase of Y 2 Ir 2 O 7,Abhishek Juyal; Amit Agarwal; Soumik Mukhopadhyay,Abstract The ground state of nanowires of single-crystalline pyrochlore Y 2 Ir 2 O 7 is adensity wave. The application of a transverse magnetic field increases the threshold electricfield for the collective depinning of the density wave state at a low temperature; leading tocolossal magnetoresistance for voltages around the depinning threshold. This is in strikingcontrast to the case where even a vanishingly small longitudinal magnetic field sharplyreduces the depinning threshold voltage; resulting in negative magnetoresistance. Rulingout several other possibilities; we argue that this phenomenon is likely to be a consequenceof the chiral anomaly in the gapped out Weyl semimetal phase in Y 2 Ir 2 O 7.,Physical Review Letters,2018,*
Significant Enhancement of the Stark Effect in Rippled Monolayer Blue Phosphorous,Shantanu Agnihotri; Priyank Rastogi; Yogesh Singh Chauhan; Amit Agarwal; Somnath Bhowmick,Abstract We explore the impact of a vertical electric field on the electronic properties ofrippled monolayer blue phosphorus (blue-P). Based on density functional theory (DFT)calculations; we demonstrate electric field induced splitting and shifting of the energy levelsof rippled blue-P; similar to the Stark effect in atomic energy levels. The bandgap of rippledblue-P is found to decrease linearly either with increasing electric field strength for a fixedripple height or with increasing ripple height for a fixed electric field strength. The applicationof a transverse electric field also leads to a spatial separation of the conduction and valanceband states near the bottom and the top of the ripple; respectively. The demonstrated Starkeffect in rippled blue-P offers a potent bandgap engineering tool; and it may open a gatewayfor possible electronic and optoelectronic applications.,*,2018,*
Physical Insights on Negative Capacitance Transistors in Nonhysteresis and Hysteresis Regimes: MFMIS Versus MFIS Structures,Girish Pahwa; Tapas Dutta; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,We present a comprehensive comparison of the two different types of ferroelectric negativecapacitance FET (NCFET) structures: metal-ferroelectric-metal-insulator-semiconductor(MFMIS) and metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS). A new segmentationapproach is proposed to simulate MFIS NCFET; which correctly takes care of thenonuniformity in potential and horizontal electric field at the ferroelectric-oxide interface. Weshow that MFMIS NCFET provides a higher ON-current than MFIS NCFET except for theferroelectrics with very low remnant polarization ($ P_r $) in the high operating voltageregime. We find that this behavior is caused by a reduction or enhancement of thelongitudinal electric field in the channel of MFIS structure depending upon $ P_r $ of theferroelectric and the operating voltage. Moreover; there exists an optimum Pr which …,IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices,2018,*
Dynamics of edge current in a linearly quenched Haldane model,Sougata Mardanya; Utso Bhattacharya; Amit Agarwal; Amit Dutta,Abstract: In a finite time quantum quench of the Haldane model; the Chern numberdetermining the topology of the bulk remains invariant; as long as the dynamics is unitary.Nonetheless; the corresponding boundary attribute; the edge current; displays interestingdynamics. For the case of sudden and adiabatic quenches the post quench edge current issolely determined by the initial and the final Hamiltonians; respectively. However for a finitetime ($\tau $) linear quench in a Haldane nano ribbon; we show that the evolution of theedge current from the sudden to the adiabatic limit is not monotonic in $\tau $; and has aturning point at a characteristic time scale $\tau=\tau_c $. For small $\tau $; the excited stateslead to a huge unidirectional surge in the edge current of both the edges.

Nonlinear; anisotropic; and giant photoconductivity in intrinsic and doped graphene,Ashutosh Singh; Saikat Ghosh; Amit Agarwal,Abstract We present a framework to calculate the anisotropic and nonlinearphotoconductivity for two band systems with application to graphene. In contrast to the usualperturbative (second order in the optical field strength) techniques; we calculatephotoconductivity to all orders in the optical field strength. In particular; for graphene; we findthe photoresponse to be giant (at large optical field strengths) and anisotropic. Theanisotropic photoresponse in graphene is correlated with polarization of the incident field;with the response being similar to that of a half-wave plate. We predict that the anisotropy inthe simultaneous measurement of longitudinal (σ xx) and transverse (σ yx)photoconductivity; with four probes; offers a unique experimental signature of thephotovoltaic response; distinguishing it from the thermal-Seebeck and bolometric effects …,Physical Review B,2018,*
Impact of Process Variations on Negative Capacitance FinFET Devices and Circuits,Tapas Dutta; Girish Pahwa; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,We report on the impact of process variations on short-channel negative capacitance (NC)based FinFETs through statistical Monte Carlo simulations using a physics based model ofNC-FinFETs. We find that relative to regular FinFETs; the impact of geometrical variabilitycan be lesser or higher in NCFinFETs in different regimes of device operation and is stronglydependent on the nominal ferroelectric (FE) thickness (tfe). The contribution of the FE layerto the overall variability behaves non-monotonically with increase in the nominal tfe. Whilethe OFF-current and threshold voltage variabilities scale down; the ON-current variabilitydoesn't follow a monotonic trend with increase in the nominal tfe. We also show thatalthough relative to regular FinFET based ring oscillator (RO) circuit; NC-FinFET based RO(NC-RO) circuit displays increased immunity to process variation induced delay variability …,IEEE Electron Device Letters,2018,*
Surface potential based modeling of charge; current; and capacitances in DGTFET including mobile channel charge and ambipolar behaviour,Prateek Jain; Chandan Yadav; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,Abstract We present a surface potential based analytical model for double gate tunnel fieldeffect transistor (DGTFET) for the current; terminal charges; and terminal capacitances. Themodel accounts for the effect of the mobile charge in the channel and captures the devicephysics in depletion as well as in the strong inversion regime. The narrowing of the tunnelbarrier in the presence of mobile charges in the channel is incorporated via modeling of theinverse decay length; which is constant under channel depletion condition and biasdependent under inversion condition. To capture the ambipolar current behavior in themodel; tunneling at the drain junction is also included. The proposed model is validatedagainst TCAD simulation data and it shows close match with the simulation data.,Solid-State Electronics,2017,*
Compact Modeling of Gate Capacitance in III–V Channel Quadruple-Gate FETs,Chandan Yadav; Mohit D Ganeriwala; Nihar R Mohapatra; Amit Agarwal; Yogesh Singh Chauhan,In this paper; we present a compact model for charge density and gate capacitance for loweffective mass channel material based quadruple-gate FETs (QGFETs). The proposedmodel accounts for the effect of quantum capacitance and conduction band non-parabolicity;which are important in FETs comprised of the low effective mass channel material.

Our formulation is based on theoptical Bloch equations with phenomenological damping constants. In the nonlinear steadystate regime it yields an analytic solution for the population inversion and the interbandcoherence; which are nonlinear in the optical field intensity; including finite doping andtemperature effects. We explicitly show that the optical nonlinearities are controlled by asingle dimensionless parameter which is directly proportional to the incident field strengthand inversely proportional to the optical frequency.
