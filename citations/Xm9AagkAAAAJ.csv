I always assumed that I wasn't really that close to [her]: Reasoning about Invisible Algorithms in News Feeds,Motahhare Eslami; Aimee Rickman; Kristen Vaccaro; Amirhossein Aleyasen; Andy Vuong; Karrie Karahalios; Kevin Hamilton; Christian Sandvig,Abstract Our daily digital life is full of algorithmically selected content such as social mediafeeds; recommendations and personalized search results. These algorithms have greatpower to shape users' experiences; yet users are often unaware of their presence. Whetherit is useful to give users insight into these algorithms' existence or functionality and how suchinsight might affect their experience are open questions. To address them; we conducted auser study with 40 Facebook users to examine their perceptions of the Facebook News Feedcuration algorithm. Surprisingly; more than half of the participants (62.5%) were not aware ofthe News Feed curation algorithm's existence at all. Initial reactions for these previouslyunaware participants were surprise and anger. We developed a system; FeedVis; to revealthe difference between the algorithmically curated and an unadulterated News Feed to …,Proceedings of the 33rd annual ACM conference on human factors in computing systems,2015,122
Feedvis: A path for exploring news feed curation algorithms,Motahhare Eslami; Amirhossein Aleyasen; Karrie Karahalios; Kevin Hamilton; Christian Sandvig,Abstract Social media feeds; personalized search results and recommendations areexamples of algorithmically curated content in our daily digital Life. While the algorithms thatcurated this content have great power to shape users' experiences; they are mostly hiddenbehind the interface; leaving users unaware of their presence. Whether it is helpful to giveusers knowledge of the algorithms' existence and if this knowledge affects interactionbehavior are open questions. To assist us in addressing these questions; we developed asystem; FeedVis; that exposes Facebook users to comparisons between algorithmicallycurated and unadulterated News Feeds. We used the tools visualizations as concreteartifacts to study users' perceptions of the algorithms governing their social media feeds.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference Companion on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing,2015,18

Friend grouping algorithms for online social networks: Preference; bias; and implications,Motahhare Eslami; Amirhossein Aleyasen; Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam; Karrie Karahalios,Abstract Managing friendship relationships in social media is challenging due to the growingnumber of people in online social networks (OSNs). To deal with this challenge; OSNs' usersmay rely on manually grouping friends with personally meaningful labels. However; manualgrouping can become burdensome when users have to create multiple groups for variouspurposes such as privacy control; selective sharing; and filtering of content. More recently;recommendation-based grouping tools such as Facebook smart lists have been proposed toaddress this concern. In these tools; users must verify every single friend suggestion. Thiscan hinder users' adoption when creating large content sharing groups. In this paper; weproposed an automated friend grouping tool that applies three clustering algorithms on aFacebook friendship network to create groups of friends. Our goal was to uncover which …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2014,6
Evaluation of automated friend grouping in online social networks,Motahhare Eslami; Amirhossein Aleyasen; Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam; Karrie G Karahalios,Abstract Managing friendship relationships is challenging due to the growing number ofpeople in online social networks (OSNs). While grouping friends sometimes mitigates thischallenge; the burden of manual grouping still prevents OSNs users to create groups widelyfor privacy control; selective sharing and filtering. In this paper; we present an automatedfriend grouping tool which utilizes three different clustering algorithms to create groups fromFacebook friendship networks. By conducting 18 semi-structured interviews; we investigatedthe advantages and disadvantages of automated friend grouping in OSNs.,CHI'14 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2014,6
Why name ambiguity resolution matters for scholarly big data research,Jinseok Kim; Jana Diesner; Heejun Kim; Amirhossein Aleyasen; Hwan-Min Kim,This paper illustrates how data pre-processing choices about author name disambiguationcan affect research findings about scholarly networks and hypotheses about underlyingsocial mechanisms. We have analyzed three big scholarly datasets that were disambiguatedalgorithmically and via two common initial-based disambiguation methods; namely first-initial and all-initials disambiguation. The comparison of resulting bibliometric and networkproperties revealed that initial-disambiguation bears the prevalent risks of incorrectlymerging author identities; underestimating the number of unique authors and inflating theaverage productivity and number of collaborators per author. The gaps between outcomesof name ambiguity resolution methods range from-4.23% to-87.36% per dataset for thenumber of unique authors; from 3.75% to 691.20% for average productivity; and from 5.06 …,Big Data (Big Data); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,5
Computational assessment of the impact of social justice documentaries,Jana Diesner; Susie Pak; Jinseok Kim; Kiumars Soltani; Amirhossein Aleyasen,Documentaries are meant to tell a story; that is; to create memory; imagination and sharing(Rose; 2012). Moreover; documentaries aim to lead to change in people's knowledge and/orbehavior (Barrett & Leddy; 2008). How can we know if a documentary has achieved thesegoals? We report on a research project where we have been developing; applying andevaluating a theoretically-grounded; empirical and computational solution for assessing theimpact of social justice documentaries in a scalable; robust and rigorous fashion. Weleverage cutting-edge methods from socio-technical data analytics-namely natural languageprocessing and network analysis-for this purpose and provide a publicly availabletechnology (ConText) that supports these routines.

On the privacy practices of just plain sites,Amirhossein Aleyasen; Oleksii Starov; Alyssa Phung Au; Allan Schiffman; Jeff Shrager,Abstract In addition to visiting popular sites such as Facebook and Google; web users oftenvisit more modest sites; such as those operated by bloggers; or by local organizations suchas schools. Such sites; which we call" Just Plain Sites"(JPSs); are likely to inadvertentlypresent greater privacy risks than highly popular sites; because they are unable to affordprivacy expertise. To assess the prevalence of the privacy risks to which JPSs mayinadvertently be exposing their visitors; we examined privacy practices that could beobserved by analysis of JPS landing pages. We found that many JPSs collect a great deal ofinformation from their visitors; and share a great deal of information about their visitors withthird parties. For example; we found that an average of 7 third party organizations areinformed when a user visits a JPS. Many JPSs additionally permit a great deal of tracking …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society,2015,2
Towards representation independent similarity search over graph databases,Yodsawalai Chodpathumwan; Amirhossein Aleyasen; Arash Termehchy; Yizhou Sun,Abstract Finding similar entities is a fundamental problem in graph data analysis. Similaritysearch algorithms usually leverage the structural properties of the database to quantify thedegree of similarity between entities. However; the same information can be represented indifferent structures and the structural properties observed over particular representationsmay not hold for the alternatives. These algorithms are effective on some representationsand ineffective on others. We define the property of representation independence forsimilarity search algorithms as their robustness against transformations that modify thestructure of databases but preserve the information content. We introduce a widespreadgroup of such transformations called relationship reorganizing. We propose an algorithmcalled R-PathSim; which is provably robust under relationship reorganizing.

Representation Independent Proximity and Similarity Search,Amirhossein Aleyasen; Arash Termehchy; Yizhou Sun,ABSTRACT Finding similar or strongly related entities in a graph database is a fundamentalproblem in data management and analytics with applications in similarity query processing;entity resolution; and pattern matching. Similarity search algorithms usually leverage thestructural properties of the data graph to quantify the degree of similarity or relevancebetween entities. Nevertheless; the same information can be represented in many differentstructures and the structural properties observed over particular representations do notnecessarily hold for alternative structures. Thus; these algorithms are effective on somerepresentations and ineffective on others. We postulate that a similarity search algorithmshould return essentially the same answers over different databases that represent the sameinformation.

Entity recognition for multi-modal socio-technical systems,Amirhossein Aleyasen,Entity Recognition (ER) can be used as a method for extracting information about socio-technical systems from unstructured; natural language text data. This process is limited bythe set of entity classes considered in many current ER solutions. In this thesis; we report onthe development of an ER classifier that supports a wide range of entity classes that arerelevant for analyzing multi-modal; socio-technical systems. Another limitation with currententity extractors is that they mainly support the detection of named entities; typically in theform of proper nouns. The presented solution also detects entities not referred to by a name;such as general references to places (eg forest) or natural resources (eg timber). We usesupervised machine learning for this project. To overcome data sparseness issues thatresults from considering a large number of entity classes; we built two separate classifiers …,*,2015,*
