Efficient secure query evaluation over encrypted XML databases,Hui Wang; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Motivated by the" database-as-service" paradigm wherein data owned by a client ishosted on a third-party server; there is significant interest in secure query evaluation overencrypted databases. We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attackmodel where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and theiroccurrence frequencies; and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well asvalue associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of securityconstraints. For security reasons; sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted.There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for differentgranularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal; secure encryption scheme isNP-hard. For speeding up query processing; we propose to keep metadata; consisting of …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,150
Anonymizing moving objects: How to hide a mob in a crowd?,Roman Yarovoy; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Wendy Hui Wang,Abstract Moving object databases (MOD) have gained much interest in recent years due tothe advances in mobile communications and positioning technologies. Study of MOD canreveal useful information (eg; traffic patterns and congestion trends) that can be used inapplications for the common benefit. In order to mine and/or analyze the data; MOD must bepublished; which can pose a threat to the location privacy of a user. Indeed; based on priorknowledge of a user's location at several time points; an attacker can potentially associatethat user to a specific moving object (MOB) in the published database and learn her positioninformation at other time points. In this paper; we study the problem of privacy-preservingpublishing of moving object database. Unlike in microdata; we argue that in MOD; theredoes not exist a fixed set of quasi-identifier (QID) attributes for all the MOBs …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,140
Privacy-preserving mining of association rules from outsourced transaction databases,Fosca Giannotti; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Anna Monreale; Dino Pedreschi; Hui Wang,Spurred by developments such as cloud computing; there has been considerable recentinterest in the paradigm of data mining-as-a-service. A company (data owner) lacking inexpertise or computational resources can outsource its mining needs to a third party serviceprovider (server). However; both the items and the association rules of the outsourceddatabase are considered private property of the corporation (data owner). To protectcorporate privacy; the data owner transforms its data and ships it to the server; sends miningqueries to the server; and recovers the true patterns from the extracted patterns receivedfrom the server. In this paper; we study the problem of outsourcing the association rulemining task within a corporate privacy-preserving framework.

Answering tree pattern queries using views,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Hui Wang; Zheng Zhao,Abstract We study the query answering using views (QAV) problem for tree pattern queries.Given a query and a view; the QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways:(i) find anequivalent rewriting of the query using only the view; or (ii) find a maximal containedrewriting using only the view. The former is appropriate for classical query optimization andwas recently studied by Xu and Ozsoyoglu for tree pattern queries (TP). However; forinformation integration; we cannot rely on equivalent rewriting and must instead usemaximal contained rewriting as shown by Halevy. Motivated by this; we study maximalcontained rewriting for TP; a core subset of XPath; both in the absence and presence of aschema. In the absence of a schema; we show there are queries whose maximal containedrewriting (MCR) can only be expressed as the union of exponentially many TPs.

On testing satisfiability of tree pattern queries,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Ganesh Ramesh; Hui Wang; Zheng Zhao,Abstract XPath and XQuery (which includes XPath as a sublanguage) are the major querylanguages for XML. An important issue arising in efficient evaluation of queries expressed inthese languages is satisfiability; ie; whether there exists a database; consistent with theschema if one is available; on which the query has a non-empty answer. Our experienceshows satisfiability check can effect substantial savings in query evaluation. Wesystematically study satisfiability of tree pattern queries (which capture a useful fragment ofXPath) together with additional constraints; with or without a schema. We identify cases inwhich this problem can be solved in polynomial time and develop novel efficient algorithmsfor this purpose. We also show that in several cases; the problem is NP-complete.

Privacy-preserving data sharing in cloud computing,Hui Wang,Abstract Storing and sharing databases in the cloud of computers raise serious concern ofindividual privacy. We consider two kinds of privacy risk: presence leakage; by which theattackers can explicitly identify individuals in (or not in) the database; and associationleakage; by which the attackers can unambiguously associate individuals with sensitiveinformation. However; the existing privacy-preserving data sharing techniques either fail toprotect the presence privacy or incur considerable amounts of information loss. In this paper;we propose a novel technique; Ambiguity; to protect both presence privacy and associationprivacy with low information loss. We formally define the privacy model and quantify theprivacy guarantee of Ambiguity against both presence leakage and association leakage. Weprove both theoretically and empirically that the information loss of Ambiguity is always …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2010,48
Trajectory anonymity in publishing personal mobility data,Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Hui Wendy Wang,Abstract Recent years have witnessed pervasive use of location-aware devices such asGSM mobile phones; GPS-enabled PDAs; location sensors; and active RFID tags. The useof these devices generates a huge collection of spatio-temporal data; variously calledmoving object data; trajectory data; or moblity data. These data can be used for various dataanalysis purposes such as city traffic control; mobility management; urban planning; andlocation-based service advertisements. Clearly; the spatio-temporal data so collected mayhelp an attacker to discover personal and sensitive information like user habits; socialcustoms; religious and sexual preferences of individuals. Consequently; it raises seriousconcerns about privacy. Simply replacing users' real identifiers (name; SSN; etc.) withpseudonyms is insufficient to guarantee anonymity. The problem is that due to the …,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2011,45

A semantics-based approach to large-scale mobile social networking,Juan Li; Hui Wang; Samee Ullah Khan,Abstract Mobile ad hoc social networks are self-configuring social networks that connectusers using mobile devices; such as laptops; PDAs; and cellular phones. These socialnetworks facilitate users to form virtual communities of similar interests or commonalities.This paper proposes semantics-based mobile social network (SMSN); a novel framework ofa fully functional mobile ad hoc social network that incorporates semantics of users' socialdata. SMSN provides effective and efficient solutions to social network construction;semantics-based user profile matching; multi-hop semantics-based routing; and privacymanagement. Moreover; SMSN is rigorously benchmarked using an elaborate simulationsetup and released as a prototype system that can be run on cellular phones. Due to itsgenerality; SMSN can be applied to a wide range of critical applications; such as disaster …,Mobile Networks and Applications,2012,37
Answering XML queries using materialized views revisited,Xiaoying Wu; Dimitri Theodoratos; Wendy Hui Wang,Abstract Answering queries using views is a well-established technique in databases. In thiscontext; two outstanding problems can be formulated. The first one consists in decidingwhether a query can be answered exclusively using one or multiple materialized views.Given the many alternative ways to compute the query from the materialized views; thesecond problem consists in finding the best way to compute the query from the materializedviews. In the realm of XML; there is a restricted number of contributions in the direction ofthese problems due to the many limitations associated with the use of materialized views intraditional XML query evaluation models. In this paper; we adopt a recent evaluation model;called inverted lists model; and holistic algorithms which together have been established asthe prominent technique for evaluating queries on large persistent XML data; and we …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,27
Answering top-K selection queries in a relational engine,*,The subject invention leverages threshold-based strategies applied to relational data tofacilitate in determining an optimal execution plan for top-k selection queries. Thesestrategies utilize a given query and relational data metadata to identify possible executionplans. This allows alternatives to scanning techniques to be considered in order to furtherenhance the overall efficiency of the optimal execution plan. A query optimizer can prune; forexample; the alternative execution plans during enumeration of the plan space and/orduring cost evaluations of the possible alternative execution plans. A cost model for thequery optimizer can utilize a cost function based on an approximation of the number ofiterations required to complete a threshold-based strategy.,*,2006,26
The threshold algorithm: From middleware systems to the relational engine,Nicolas Bruno; Hui Wang,The answer to a top-k query is an ordered set of tuples; where the ordering is based on howclosely each tuple matches the query. In the context of middleware systems; new algorithmsto answer top-k queries have been recently proposed. Among these; the threshold algorithm(TA) is the most well-known instance due to its simplicity and memory requirements. TA isbased on an early-termination condition and can evaluate top-k queries without examiningall the tuples. This top-k query model is prevalent not only over middleware systems; butalso over plain relational data. In this work; we analyze the challenges that must beaddressed to adapt TA to a relational database system. We show that; depending on theavailable indices; many alternative TA strategies can be used to answer a given query.Choosing the best alternative requires a cost model that can be seamlessly integrated …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,23
Leakage-resilient RFID authentication with forward-privacy,Shin’ichiro Matsuo; Miyako Ohkubo; Moti Yung,Abstract Low power devices; such as smart-card and RFID-tags; will be used around our lifeincluding in commercial and financial activities. A prime application of such devices is entityauthentication in pervasive environment. The obvious concerns in this environment involvesgetting security against tag-forgery (even by adversary controlled readers) and; on the otherhand; giving users privacy against linking of different authentication transcripts. Manycryptographic protocols have realizes such requirements. However; there is no schemewhich realizes; both; forward-privacy and tag-forgery right after some leakage is occurred.Since some devices among the huge quantity of expected devices will surely becompromised; it seems highly important; from an engineering point of view; to deal withlimited damage of such exposures.

Towards publishing recommendation data with predictive anonymization,Chih-Cheng Chang; Brian Thompson; Hui Wendy Wang; Danfeng Yao,Abstract Recommender systems are used to predict user preferences for products orservices. In order to seek better prediction techniques; data owners of recommendersystems such as Netflix sometimes make their customers' reviews available to the public;which raises serious privacy concerns. With only a small amount of knowledge aboutindividuals and their ratings to some items in a recommender system; an adversary mayeasily identify the users and breach their privacy. Unfortunately; most of the existing privacymodels (eg; k-anonymity) cannot be directly applied to recommender systems. In this paper;we study the problem of privacy-preserving publishing of recommendation datasets.

Ensuring data storage security against frequency-based attacks in wireless networks,Hongbo Liu; Hui Wang; Yingying Chen,Abstract As wireless networks become more pervasive; the amount of the wireless data israpidly increasing. One of the biggest challenges is how to store these data. To address thischallenge; distributed data storage in wireless networks has attracted much attentionrecently; as it has major advantages over centralized approaches. To support thewidespread adoption of distributed data storage; secure data storage must be achieved. Inthis work; we study the frequency-based attack; a type of attack that is different frompreviously well-studied ones; that exploits additional adversary knowledge to crack theencrypted data. To cope with frequency-based attacks; the straightforward 1-to-1 substitutionencryption functions are not sufficient. We propose a data encryption strategy based on 1-to-n substitution via dividing and emulating techniques such that an attacker cannot derive …,International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems,2010,20
Semantics-enhanced privacy recommendation for social networking sites,Qingrui Li; Juan Li; Hui Wang; Ashok Ginjala,Privacy protection is a vital issue for safe social interactions within social networking sites(SNS). Although SNSs such as MySpace and Facebook allow users to configure theirprivacy settings; it is not a simple task for normal users with hundreds of online friends. Inthis paper; we propose an intelligent semantics-based privacy configuration system; namedSPAC; to automatically recommend privacy settings for SNS users. SPAC learns users'privacy configuration patterns and make predictions by utilizing machine learningtechniques on users' profiles and privacy setting history. To increase the accuracy of thepredicted privacy settings; especially in the context of heterogeneous user profiles; weenhance privacy configuration predictor by integrating it with structured semantic knowledgein the SNS. This; in turn; allows SPAC to make inferences based on additional source of …,Trust; Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom); 2011 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2011,18

Optimizing XML queries: Bitmapped materialized views vs. indexes,Xiaoying Wu; Dimitri Theodoratos; Wendy Hui Wang; Timos Sellis,Abstract Optimizing queries using materialized views has not been addressed adequately inthe context of XML due to the many limitations associated with the definition and usability ofmaterialized views in traditional XML query evaluation models. In this paper; we address theXML query optimization problem using materialized views in the framework of the invertedlists evaluation model which has been established as the most prominent one for evaluatingqueries on large persistent XML data. Under this framework; we propose a novel approachwhich instead of materializing the answer of a view materializes exactly the sublists of theinverted lists that are necessary for computing the answer of the view. A further originality ofour approach is that the view materializations are stored as compressed bitmaps.

Itraises several security issues. One of the issues is how the client can protect the privateinformation in the outsourced data. In this paper; we focus on data deduplication as the maindata cleaning task; and design two efficient privacy-preserving data-deduplication methodsfor the DCaS paradigm. We analyze the robustness of our two methods against the attacksthat exploit the auxiliary frequency distribution and the knowledge of the encodingalgorithms.

However; publishing non-aggregated data raises serious concerns indata privacy. One of the concerns is that when outliers exist in the dataset; they are easier tobe distinguished from the crowd and their privacy is prone to be compromised. In this paper;we study the problem of privacy-preserving publishing datasets that contain outliers. Wedefine the distinguishability-based attack by which the adversary can identify outliers andreveal their private information from an anonymized dataset. We show that the existingsyntactic privacy models (eg; k-anonymity and ℓ-diversity) cannot defend against thedistinguishability-based attack. We define the plain ℓ-diversity to provide privacy guaranteeto outliers against the distinguishability-based attack; and design efficient algorithms to …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2015,4

Arm: Authenticated approximate record matching for outsourced databases,Boxiang Dong; Wendy Wang,In this paper; we consider the outsourcing model in which a third-party server provides dataintegration as a service. Identifying approximately duplicate records in databases is anessential step for the information integration processes. Most existing approaches rely onestimating the similarity of potential duplicates. The service provider returns all records fromthe outsourced dataset that are similar according to specific distance metrics. A majorsecurity concern of this outsourcing paradigm is whether the service provider returns soundand complete near-duplicates. In this paper; we design ARM; an authentication system forthe outsourced record matching. The key idea of ARM is that besides the similar recordpairs; the server returns the verification object (VO) of these similar pairs to prove theircorrectness. First; we design an authenticated data structure named MB-tree for VO …,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2016 IEEE 17th International Conference on,2016,2
Result integrity verification of outsourced privacy-preserving frequent itemset mining,Ruilin Liu; Hui Wang,Abstract In the recently-emerged Data-Mining-as-a-Service (DMaS) paradigm; a clientoutsources her data and the data mining needs to a third party service provider. It raises afew security issues including privacy protection and result integrity verification. Most of therecent work studied these two issues separately. In this paper; we focus on the problem ofresult integrity verification of outsourced privacy-preserving frequent itemset mining. It ischallenging to discover the incorrect results by the service provider's misbehaviors from themining output that intends to be inaccurate due to privacy protection techniques. We designefficient approaches that can provide high probabilistic guarantee for both correctness andcompleteness of the frequent itemset mining results. Our experiment results show theefficiency and effectiveness of our approaches.,*,2015,2
Result integrity verification of outsourced Bayesian network structure learning,Ruilin Liu; Hui Wang; Changhe Yuan,Abstract There has been considerable recent interest in the data-mining-as-a-serviceparadigm: the client that lacks computational resources outsources his/her data and datamining needs to a third-party service provider. One of the security issues of this outsourcingparadigm is how the client can verify that the service provider indeed has returned correctdata mining results. In this paper; we focus on the problem of result verification of outsourcedBayesian network (BN) structure learning. We consider the untrusted service provider thatintends to return wrong BN structures. We develop three efficient probabilistic verificationapproaches to catch the incorrect BN structure with high probability and cheap overhead.Our experimental results demonstrate that our verification methods can capture wrong BNstructure effectively and efficiently.,*,2014,2
Defending against frequency-based attacks on distributed data storage in wireless networks,Hongbo Liu; Hui Wang; Yingying Chen; Dayong Jia,Abstract As wireless networks become more pervasive; the amount of the wireless data israpidly increasing. One of the biggest challenges of wide adoption of distributed datastorage is how to store these data securely. In this work; we study the frequency-basedattack; a type of attack that is different from previously well-studied ones; that exploitsadditional adversary knowledge of domain values and/or their exact/approximatefrequencies to crack the encrypted data. To cope with frequency-based attacks; thestraightforward 1-to-1 substitution encryption functions are not sufficient. We propose a dataencryption strategy based on 1-to-n substitution via dividing and emulating techniques todefend against the frequency-based attack; while enabling efficient query evaluation overencrypted data. We further develop two frameworks; incremental collection and clustered …,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN),2014,2
Efficient storage and temporal query evaluation in hierarchical data archiving systems,Hui Wendy Wang; Ruilin Liu; Dimitri Theodoratos; Xiaoying Wu,Abstract Data archiving has been commonly used in many fields for data backup andanalysis purposes. Although comprehensive application software; new computing andstorage technologies; and the Internet have made it easier to create; collect and store alltypes of data; the meaningful storing; accessing; and managing of database archives in acost-effective way remains extremely challenging. In this paper; we focus on hierarchicaldata archiving that has been popularly used in the scientific field and web datamanagement. First; we propose a novel compaction scheme for archiving hierarchical data.By compacting both data and timestamps; our scheme substantially reduces not only theamount of needed storage; but also the incremental archiving time. Second; we design atemporal query language to support data retrieval from the compact data archives. Third …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,2
To do or not to do: metadata-guided query evaluation in content caching networks,Hui Wang; Ruilin Liu; Xiuyuan Zheng; Yingying Chen; Hongbo Liu,To support emerging pervasive computer applications; efficient data access and informationsharing is essential in mobile wireless environments. The data-centric storage approachprovides energy-efficient data dissemination and organization. However; wireless deviceshave limited storage and are energy-constrained. To address these issues; we introduce theconcept of content caching networks; in which the collected data will be stored by its contentin a distributed manner; while the data in the network is cached for a certain period of timebefore it is sent to a centralized storage space for backup. Further; we propose the metadata-guided query evaluation approach to achieve query efficiency in content caching networks.Our clustering and compression based algorithm for metadata construction helps tominimize the information loss due to data compression; while achieving the memory …,Global Telecommunications Conference; 2009.

Hiding distinguished ones into crowd: privacy-preserving publishing data with outliers,Hui Wendy Wang; Ruilin Liu,Abstract Publishing microdata raises concerns of individual privacy. When there exist outlierrecords in the microdata; the distinguishability of the outliers enables their privacy to beeasier to be compromised than that of regular ones. However; none of the existinganonymization techniques can provide sufficient protection to the privacy of the outliers. Inthis paper; we study the problem of anonymizing the micro-data that contains outliers. Wedefine the distinguishability-based attack by which the adversary can infer the existence ofoutliers as well as their private information from the anonymized microdata. To defendagainst the distinguishability-based attack; we define the plain k-anonymity as the privacyprinciple. Based on the definition; we categorize the outliers into two types; the ones thatcannot be hidden by any plain k-anonymous group (called global outliers) and the ones …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,2

Frequency-hiding dependency-preserving encryption for outsourced databases,Boxiang Dong; Wendy Wang,The cloud paradigm enables users to outsource their data to computationally powerful third-party service providers for data management. Many data management tasks rely on the datadependency in the outsourced data. This raises an important issue of how the data ownercan protect the sensitive information in the outsourced data while preserving the datadependency. In this paper; we consider functional dependency (FD); an important type ofdata dependency. Although simple deterministic encryption schemes can preserve FDs;they may be vulnerable against the frequency analysis attack. We design a frequencyhiding; FD-preserving probabilistic encryption scheme; named F2; that enables the serviceprovider to discover the FDs from the encrypted dataset. We consider two attacks; namelythe frequency analysis (FA) attack and the FD-preserving chosen plaintext attack (FCPA) …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1
Understanding data completeness in network monitoring systems,Flip Korn; Ruilin Liu; Hui Wang,In many networks including Internet Service Providers; transportation monitoring systemsand the electric grid; measurements from a set of objects are continuously taken over timeand used for important decisions such as provisioning and pricing. It is therefore vital tounderstand the completeness and reliability of such data. Given the large volume of datagenerated by these systems; rather than enumerating the times and objects incurringmissing or spurious data; it is more effective to provide patterns (groups of tuples) conciselysummarizing trends that may not otherwise be readily observable. In this paper; we definethe Graph Tableau Discovery Problem where the measured tuples can be thought of asedges in a bipartite graph on an ordered attribute (time) and an unordered attribute (objectidentifiers). We define the problem of finding an optimal summary; show that it is NP …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,1

Predictive Anonymization: Utility-Preserving Publishing of Sparse Recommendation Data,Chih-Cheng Chang; Brian Thompson; H Wang; Danfeng Yao,ABSTRACT Recently; recommender systems have been introduced to predict userpreferences for products or services. In order to seek better prediction techniques; dataowners of recommender systems such as Netflix sometimes make their customers' reviewsavailable to the public; which raises serious privacy concerns. With only a small amount ofknowledge about individuals and their ratings to some items in a recommender system; anadversary may easily identify the users and breach their privacy. Unfortunately; most of theexisting privacy models (eg; k-anonymity) cannot be directly applied to recommendersystems.

Authenticated Outlier Mining for Outsourced Databases,Boxiang Dong; Hui Wendy Wang; Anna Monreale; Dino Pedreschi; Fosca Giannotti; Wenge Guo,The Data-Mining-as-a-Service (DMaS) paradigm is becoming the focus of research; as itallows the data owner (client) who lacks expertise and/or computational resources tooutsource their data and mining needs to a third-party service provider (server). Outsourcing;however; raises some issues about result integrity: how could the client verify the miningresults returned by the server are both sound and complete? In this paper; we focus onoutlier mining; an important mining task. Previous verification techniques use anauthenticated data structure (ADS) for correctness authentication; which may incur muchspace and communication cost. In this paper; we propose a novel solution that returns aprobabilistic result integrity guarantee with much cheaper verification cost.

Budget-Constrained Result Integrity Verification of Outsourced Data Mining Computations,Bo Zhang; Boxiang Dong; Wendy Wang,Abstract When outsourcing data mining needs to an untrusted service provider in the Data-Mining-as-a-Service (DMaS) paradigm; it is important to verify whether the service provider(server) returns correct mining results (in the format of data mining objects). We consider thesetting in which each data mining object is associated with a weight for its importance. Givena client who is equipped with limited verification budget; the server selects a subset ofmining results whose total verification cost does not exceed the given budget; while the totalweight of the selected results is maximized. This maps to the well-known budgetedmaximum coverage (BMC) problem; which is NP-hard. Therefore; the server may execute aheuristic algorithm to select a subset of mining results for verification. The server hasfinancial incentives to cheat on the heuristic output; so that the client has to pay more for …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2017,*
Pairwise Ranking Aggregation by Non-interactive Crowdsourcing with Budget Constraints,Changjiang Cai; Haipei Sun; Boxiang Dong; Bo Zhang; Ting Wang; Hui Wang,Crowdsourced ranking algorithms ask the crowd to compare the objects and infer the fullranking based on the crowdsourced pairwise comparison results. In this paper; we considerthe setting in which the task requester is equipped with a limited budget that can afford onlya small number of pairwise comparisons. To make the problem more complicated; the crowdmay return noisy comparison answers. We propose an approach to obtain a good-quality fullranking from a small number of pairwise preferences in two steps; namely task assignmentand result inference. In the task assignment step; we generate pairwise comparison tasksthat produce a full ranking with high probability. In the result inference step; based on thetransitive property of pairwise comparisons and truth discovery; we design an efficientheuristic algorithm to find the best full ranking from the potentially conflictive pairwise …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on,2017,*

Developing Online Privacy Education Tools with Inputs from the Crowd,Hui Wang,In this talk; we introduce an ongoing NSF-funded research project that is also related to ISeducation. Online social networking communities have undergone an explosion in recentyears; as both the kinds and numbers of sites have grown and their memberships haveincreased. This has led to the proliferation of personal data revealed by users of onlinecommunities; which presents a variety of privacy risks. Although these risks apply to individualsof all ages and backgrounds; younger users have been the primary focus of most academic researchregarding online privacy and safety. This focus is justified as many young users still know littleabout online privacy even though their awareness of online privacy has increased.

A reinforcement learning based framework for prediction of near likely nodes in data-centric mobile wireless networks,Yingying Chen; Hui Wendy Wang; Xiuyuan Zheng; Jie Yang,Abstract Data-centric storage provides energy-efficient data dissemination and organizationfor the increasing amount of wireless data. One of the approaches in data-centric storage isthat the nodes that collected data will transfer their data to other neighboring nodes thatstore the similar type of data. However; when the nodes are mobile; type-based datadistribution alone cannot provide robust data storage and retrieval; since the nodes thatstore similar types may move far away and cannot be easily reachable in the future. In orderto minimize the communication overhead and achieve efficient data retrieval in mobileenvironments; we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework called PARIS; whichutilizes past node trajectory information to predict the near likely nodes in the future as thebest content distributee.
