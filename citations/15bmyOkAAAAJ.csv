Efficient similarity joins for near-duplicate detection,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang,Abstract With the increasing amount of data and the need to integrate data from multipledata sources; one of the challenging issues is to identify near-duplicate records efficiently. Inthis article; we focus on efficient algorithms to find a pair of records such that their similaritiesare no less than a given threshold. Several existing algorithms rely on the prefix filteringprinciple to avoid computing similarity values for all possible pairs of records. We proposenew filtering techniques by exploiting the token ordering information; they are integrated intothe existing methods and drastically reduce the candidate sizes and hence improve theefficiency. We have also studied the implementation of our proposed algorithm in stand-alone and RDBMS-based settings. Experimental results show our proposed algorithms canoutperform previous algorithms on several real datasets.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,562

Ed-join: an efficient algorithm for similarity joins with edit distance constraints,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract There has been considerable interest in similarity join in the research communityrecently. Similarity join is a fundamental operation in many application areas; such as dataintegration and cleaning; bioinformatics; and pattern recognition. We focus on efficientalgorithms for similarity join with edit distance constraints. Existing approaches are mainlybased on converting the edit distance constraint to a weaker constraint on the number ofmatching q-grams between pair of strings. In this paper; we propose the novel perspective ofinvestigating mismatching q-grams. Technically; we derive two new edit distance lowerbounds by analyzing the locations and contents of mismatching q-grams. A new algorithm;Ed-Join; is proposed that exploits the new mismatch-based filtering methods; it achievessubstantial reduction of the candidate sizes and hence saves computation time.

Top-k set similarity joins,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Haichuan Shang,Similarity join is a useful primitive operation underlying many applications; such as nearduplicate Web page detection; data integration; and pattern recognition. Traditional similarityjoins require a user to specify a similarity threshold. In this paper; we study a variant of thesimilarity join; termed top-k set similarity join. It returns the top-k pairs of records ranked bytheir similarities; thus eliminating the guess work users have to perform when the similaritythreshold is unknown before hand. An algorithm; topk-join; is proposed to answer top-ksimilarity join efficiently. It is based on the prefix filtering principle and employs tight upperbounding of similarity values of unseen pairs. Experimental results demonstrate theefficiency of the proposed algorithm on large-scale real datasets.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,162
Efficient approximate entity extraction with edit distance constraints,Wei Wang; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin; Chengqi Zhang,Abstract Named entity recognition aims at extracting named entities from unstructured text. Arecent trend of named entity recognition is finding approximate matches in the text withrespect to a large dictionary of known entities; as the domain knowledge encoded in thedictionary helps to improve the extraction performance. In this paper; we study the problemof approximate dictionary matching with edit distance constraints. Compared to existingstudies using token-based similarity constraints; our problem definition enables us tocapture typographical or orthographical errors; both of which are common in entity extractiontasks yet may be missed by token-based similarity constraints. Our problem is technicallychallenging as existing approaches based on q-gram filtering have poor performance due tothe existence of many short entities in the dictionary.

Most existing methodanswering edit similarity queries rely on a signature scheme to generate candidates giventhe query string. We observe that the number of signatures generated by existing methods isfar greater than the lower bound; and this results in high query time and index spacecomplexities. In this paper; we show that the minimum signature size lower bound is t+ 1. Wethen propose asymmetric signature schemes that achieve this lower bound. We developefficient query processing algorithms based on the new scheme. Several dynamicprogramming-based candidate pruning methods are also developed to further speed up theperformance.

Efficient error-tolerant query autocompletion,Chuan Xiao; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Koji Tsuda; Kunihiko Sadakane,Abstract Query autocompletion is an important feature saving users many keystrokes fromtyping the entire query. In this paper we study the problem of query autocompletion thattolerates errors in users' input using edit distance constraints. Previous approaches indexdata strings in a trie; and continuously maintain all the prefixes of data strings whose editdistance from the query are within the threshold. The major inherent problem is that thenumber of such prefixes is huge for the first few characters of the query and is exponential inthe alphabet size. This results in slow query response even if the entire query approximatelymatches only few prefixes. In this paper; we propose a novel neighborhood generation-based algorithm; IncNGTrie; which can achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup overexisting methods for the error-tolerant query autocompletion problem.

Efficient query processing for streamed XML fragments,Huan Huo; Guoren Wang; Xiaoyun Hui; Rui Zhou; Bo Ning; Chuan Xiao,Abstract Unlike in traditional databases; queries on XML streams are bounded not only bymemory but also by real time processing. Recently proposed Hole-Filler model is promisingfor information transmission and publication; by slicing XML data into low consuming; easysynchronized fragments. However; XPath queries evaluate the elements in streamed XMLdata; not the XML fragments; and operation dependence caused by fragments deceleratesprocessing efficiency. By taking advantage of schema information for XML; this paperproposes a model of tid tree to optimize queries over XML fragments by removing“redundant” operations. It then proposes XFPro for processing XPath queries on XMLfragments to achieve processing and memory efficiency. Our performance study shows thatXFPro performs well both on execution time and memory metrics.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,30

Most existing methodsanswering edit similarity queries employ schemes to generate string subsequences assignatures and generate candidates by set overlap queries on query and data signatures. Inthis article; we show that for any such signature scheme; the lower bound of the minimumnumber of signatures is τ &plus; 1; which is lower than what is achieved by existing methods.We then propose several asymmetric signature schemes; that is; extracting differentnumbers of signatures for the data and query strings; which achieve this lower bound.

In this paper; we propose a new variation of the skylineproblem; called the combination skyline problem. The goal is to find the fixed-sizecombinations of objects which are skyline among all possible combinations. Our problem istechnically challenging as traditional skyline approaches are inapplicable to handle a hugenumber of possible combinations. By indexing objects with an R-tree; our solution is basedon object-selecting patterns that indicate the number of objects to be selected for each MBR.We develop two major pruning conditions to avoid unnecessary expansions andenumerations; as well as a technique to reduce space consumption on storing the skyline foreach rule in the object-selecting pattern.

Processing probabilistic range queries over Gaussian-based uncertain data,Tingting Dong; Chuan Xiao; Xi Guo; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Probabilistic range query is an important type of query in the area of uncertain datamanagement. A probabilistic range query returns all the objects within a specific range fromthe query object with a probability no less than a given threshold. In this paper we assumethat each uncertain object stored in the databases is associated with a multi-dimensionalGaussian distribution; which describes the probability distribution that the object appears inthe multi-dimensional space. A query object is either a certain object or an uncertain objectmodeled by a Gaussian distribution. We propose several filtering techniques and an R-tree-based index to efficiently support probabilistic range queries over Gaussian objects.Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,5

Local similarity search for unstructured text,Pei Wang; Chuan Xiao; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Xiaoyang Zhang; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract With the growing popularity of electronic documents; replication can occur for manyreasons. People may copy text segments from various sources and make modifications. Inthis paper; we study the problem of local similarity search to find partially replicated text.Unlike existing studies on similarity search which find entirely duplicated documents; ourtarget is to identify documents that approximately share a pair of sliding windows which differby no more than τ tokens. Our problem is technically challenging because for slidingwindows the tokens to be indexed are less selective than entire documents; rendering setsimilarity join-based algorithms less efficient. Our proposed method is based onenumerating token combinations to obtain signatures with high selectivity.

Content-based element search for presentation slide reuse,Jie Zhang; Chuan Xiao; Toyohide Watanabe; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Presentation slide composition is an important job for knowledge workers. Instead of startingfrom scratch; users tend to make new presentation slides by reusing existing ones. A primarychallenge in slide reuse is to select desired materials from a collection of existing slides. Thestate-of-the-art solution utilizes texts and images in slides as well as file names to help usersto retrieve the materials they want. However; it only allows users to choose an entire slide asa query but does not support the search for a single element such as a few keywords; asentence; an image; or a diagram.

Improving performance of graph similarity joins using selected substructures,Xiang Zhao; Chuan Xiao; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Jiuyang Tang,Abstract Similarity join of complex structures is an important operation in managing graphdata. In this paper; we investigate the problem of graph similarity join with edit distanceconstraints. Existing algorithms extract substructures–either rooted trees or simple paths–asfeatures; and transform the edit distance constraint into a weaker count filtering condition.However; the performance suffers from the heavy overlapping or low selectivity ofsubstructures. To resolve the issue; we first present a general framework for substructure-based similarity join and a tighter count filtering condition. It is observed under theframework that using either too few or too many substructures can result in poor filteringperformance. Thus; we devise an algorithm to select substructures for filtering.

But the major difference is plagiarism detection matches nearlyidentical documents; while the replication in text reuse is often done partially; ie; one or moresentences or paragraphs are copied but overall the documents differ significantly. There aretwo major drawbacks in the existing methods:(1) The segmentation is sensitive to edits; eg;combining sentences or changing word orders; and hence many meaningful results aremissed.(2) The segment matching is time-consuming if we want to find results with minordifferences.

Content Reuse Detection in Text Documents,Pei Wang; Chuan Xiao; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Text document collection typically contains reused information. Events or facts may berestated with reformulations and additions by various sources. Identifying text reuse enablesus to find original sources of facts and track information flow; and thus becomes an importanttask in text analysis. We develop a novel method for content reuse detection in textdocuments. Our basic idea is to use sliding windows; namely; a fixed number of wordsstarting from every position in the document. A pair of sliding windows that differ by no morethan τ words is regarded as reused contents. In order to efficiently identify sliding windowpairs that meet this constraint; we develop a filter-and-refine method; ie; first find a set ofpromising candidates and then verify if they satisfy the constraint. We propose the notion of k-wise signatures; each containing k words in a sliding window. A pair of sliding windows …,情報処理学会第 77 回全国大会,2015,*
Detecting Reused Elements in Presentation Slides,Jie Zhang; andChuan Xiao; Toyohide Watanabe; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract—Slide presentations have become a ubiquitous tool for business and educationalpurposes. Instead of starting from scratch; slide composers tend to make new presentationslides by browsing existing slides and reusing materials from them. In this paper; weinvestigate the problem of reused element detection in presentation slides. We developrespective techniques to identify both textual and visual elements that have been reusedacross multiple presentation files. Experiments are performed to evaluate the effectivenessof the proposed methods.,International Journal of Knowledge Engineering-IACSIT,2015,*
A Slide Element Retrieval Method for Presentation Reuse (データ工学),Jie Zhang; Chuan Xiao; Toyohide Watanabe; Yoshiharu ISHIKAWA,抄録 Presentation slide composition is an important job for knowledge workers. Instead ofstarting from scratch; users tend to make new presentation slides by reusing existing ones. Aprimary challenge in slide reuse is to select desired materials from a collection of existingslides. The state-of-the-art solution utilizes texts and images in slides as well as file names tohelp users to retrieve the materials they want. However; it only allows users to choose anentire slide as a query but does not support the search for a single element such as a fewkeywords; a sentence; an image; or a diagram. In this paper; we investigate content-basedsearch for a variety of elements in presentation slides. Users may freely choose a slideelement as a query. We propose different query processing methods to deal with varioustypes of queries and improve the search efficiency. Experiments are performed to …,電子情報通信学会技術研究報告. DE; データ工学,2014,*
A space-efficient indexing algorithm for boolean query processing,Jianbin Qin; Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Inverted indexes are the fundamental index for information retrieval systems. Due tothe correlation between terms; inverted lists in the index may have substantial overlap andhence redundancy. In this paper; we propose a new approach that reduces the size ofinverted lists while retaining time-efficiency. Our solution is based on merging inverted liststhat bear high overlap to each other and manage their content in the resulting condensedindex. An efficient algorithm is designed to discover heavily-overlapped inverted lists andconstruct the condensed index for a given dataset. We demonstrate that our algorithmdelivers considerable space saving while incurring little query performance overhead.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2012,*

Efficient Autocompletion with Error tolerance,Sheng HU; Chuan XIAO; Yoshiharu ISHIKAWA,Abstract Most popular search engines have provided query autocompletion features in theirsystems. When a user issues a query; without inputting complete keywords; the searchengine will prompt several options which complete the remaining part of the queryautomatically. This research will focus on investigating novel techniques for error-tolerantquery autocompletion by addressing several key issues of this feature; and eventuallyimprove the efficiency and the accuracy of the query processing. In our work; we proposedan improve expansion algorithm based on current state-of-the-art work. Moreover; we alsoimprove the index reduction method to reduce the index size as much as possible.Experiment results show that our new method can improve the algorithm efficiency andreduce the index size very well.,*,*,*
