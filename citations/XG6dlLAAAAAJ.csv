Thermally stable; efficient polymer solar cells with nanoscale control of the interpenetrating network morphology,Wanli Ma; Cuiying Yang; Xiong Gong; Kwanghee Lee; Alan J Heeger,Abstract By applying the specific fabrication conditions summarized in the Experimentalsection and post-production annealing at 150 C; polymer solar cells with power-conversionefficiency approaching 5% are demonstrated. These devices exhibit remarkable thermalstability. We attribute the improved performance to changes in the bulk heterojunctionmaterial induced by thermal annealing. The improved nanoscale morphology; the increasedcrystallinity of the semiconducting polymer; and the improved contact to the electron-collecting electrode facilitate charge generation; charge transport to; and charge collectionat the electrodes; thereby enhancing the device efficiency by lowering the series resistanceof the polymer solar cells.,Advanced Functional Materials,2005,4918
New Architecture for high‐efficiency polymer photovoltaic cells using solution‐based titanium oxide as an optical spacer,Jin Young Kim; Sun Hee Kim; H‐H Lee; Kwanghee Lee; Wanli Ma; Xiong Gong; Alan J Heeger,Photovoltaic cells based on polymer: fullerene composites continue to be of interest aspotential sources of renewable electrical energy.[1–4] In particular; because of theadvantages implied for polymer-based electronics; including low-cost fabrication in largeareas and low weight on flexible substrates; efficient “plastic” solar cells would have a majorimpact. Although encouraging progress has been made in recent years; with 3–4% power-conversion efficiencies [5; 6] and; more recently; power-conversion efficiencies approaching5%[7; 8] reported under AM 1.5 (AM: air mass) illumination; this efficiency is not sufficient tomeet realistic specifications for commercialization.

Operating at room temperature; the polymer photodetectors exhibitdetectivities greater than 10 12 cm Hz 1/2/W and a linear dynamic range over 100 decibels.The self-assembled nanomorphology and device architecture result in high photodetectivityover this wide spectral range and reduce the dark current (and noise) to values well belowdark currents obtained in narrow-band photodetectors made with inorganic …,Science,2009,723
Efficient; Air‐Stable Bulk Heterojunction Polymer Solar Cells Using MoOx as the Anode Interfacial Layer,Yanming Sun; Christopher J Takacs; Sarah R Cowan; Jung Hwa Seo; Xiong Gong; Anshuman Roy; Alan J Heeger,The development of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells continues to showprogress.[1–6] Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in the range of 6–8% have beenrecently reported.[7–12] However; for large-scale commercialization; further improvementsin PCE and stability are needed. A BHJ polymer solar cell generally consists of a transparentanode (typically indium tin oxide; ITO); a BHJ active layer (a mixture of donor polymer andfullerene acceptor); and a cathode (eg; Al or Ca). Anode/cathode interfacial layers are usedas charge selective contacts between the BHJ active layer and the electrodes.[13; 14]Experiments have shown that the lifetime of BHJ solar cells can be extended by inserting acathode interfacial layer such as titanium oxide (TiO x) or lithium fluoride (LiF) between theBHJ layer and the cathode.[15–17] Moreover; cathode interfacial layers (eg; TiO x or zinc …,Advanced materials,2011,518

Donor–acceptor conjugated polymer based on naphtho [1; 2-c: 5; 6-c] bis [1; 2; 5] thiadiazole for high-performance polymer solar cells,Ming Wang; Xiaowen Hu; Peng Liu; Wei Li; Xiong Gong; Fei Huang; Yong Cao,Donor–acceptor conjugated polymers PBDT-DTBT and PBDT-DTNT; based on 2; 1; 3-benzothiadiazole (BT) and naphtho [1; 2-c: 5; 6-c] bis [1; 2; 5] thiadiazole (NT); have beendesigned and synthesized for polymer solar cells. NT contains two fused 1; 2; 5-thiadiazolerings that lower the band gap; enhance the interchain packing; and improve the chargemobility of the resulting polymer. Consequently; the NT-based polymer PBDT-DTNTexhibited considerably better photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency(PCE) of 6.00% when compared with the BT-based polymer PBDT-DTBT; which gave a PCEof 2.11% under identical device configurations.,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2011,464

This nearly “universal” biosensor approach isbased on the observation that; while the conjugated polyelectrolyte specifically inhibits theability of single-stranded DNA to prevent the aggregation of gold-nanoparticles; no suchinhibition is observed with double-stranded or otherwise “folded” DNA structures.Colorimetric assays employing this mechanism for the detection of hybridization aresensitive and convenient—picomolar concentrations of target DNA are readily detected withthe naked eye; and the sensor works even when challenged with complex sample …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2010,413
Stabilized Blue Emission from Polyfluorene‐Based Light‐Emitting Diodes: Elimination of Fluorenone Defects,Xiong Gong; Parameswar K Iyer; Daniel Moses; Guilermo C Bazan; Alan J Heeger; Steven S Xiao,Abstract Polyfluorene (PF)-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) typically exhibit devicedegradation under operation with the emergence of a strong low-energy emission band(at∼ 2.2–2.4 eV). This longer wavelength band converts the desired blue emission to blue–green or even yellow. We have studied both the photoluminescence (PL) andelectroluminescence (EL) of PFs with different molecular structures and found that the low-energy emission band originates from fluorenone defects which are introduced by photo-oxidization; thermal oxidation; or during device fabrication. X-ray photo-emissionspectroscopy (XPS) results show that the oxidation of PF is strongly catalyzed by thepresence of calcium. The fluorenone defects generate a stronger contribution to the EL thanto the PL. By utilization of a novel electron-transporting material as a buffer layer between …,Advanced functional materials,2003,389

Biosensors from conjugated polyelectrolyte complexes,Deli Wang; Xiong Gong; Peter S Heeger; Frauke Rininsland; Guillermo C Bazan; Alan J Heeger,Abstract A charge neutral complex (CNC) was formed in aqueous solution by combining anorange light emitting anionic conjugated polyelectrolyte and a saturated cationicpolyelectrolyte at a 1: 1 ratio (per repeat unit). Photoluminescence (PL) from the CNC can bequenched by both the negatively charged dinitrophenol (DNP) derivative;(DNP-BS−); andpositively charged methyl viologen (MV 2+). Use of the CNC minimizes nonspecificinteractions (which modify the PL) between conjugated polyelectrolytes and biopolymers.Quenching of the PL from the CNC by the DNP derivative and specific unquenching onaddition of anti-DNP antibody (anti-DNP IgG) were observed. Thus; biosensing of the anti-DNP IgG was demonstrated.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2002,293
Water/Methanol‐Soluble Conjugated Copolymer as an Electron‐Transport Layer in Polymer Light‐Emitting Diodes,Wanli Ma; Parameswar K Iyer; Xiong Gong; Bin Liu; Daniel Moses; Guillermo C Bazan; Alan J Heeger,The principal criteria for a polymer-based electron-transport layer (ETL) for use in polymerlight-emitting diodes (PLEDs) are the following: 1) the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(LUMO) of the ETL must be at an energy close to; or even within the π*-band of the emissivesemiconducting polymer; and 2) the solvent used for casting the electron-injection materialmust not dissolve the underlying emissive polymer.

A power conversionefficiency (PCE) of 3.8% was observed from an inverted device structure with the ZnO bufferlayer. Without the ZnO layer; PSCs only show a PCE of 1.67%; which is less than half thevalue observed from PSCs with the ZnO buffer layer. When operated at room temperature;no obvious degradation was observed from the PSCs with the ZnO layer after continuouslyilluminating the devices for 4 h. However; a significant degradation was observed from thePSCs without the ZnO buffer layer after illuminating the devices only for 1 h. Furthermore;PSCs with the ZnO buffer layer also show very good shelf stability; only 5% degradation wasobserved in PCEs after 47 days.

High-performance polymer light-emitting diodes fabricated with a polymer hole injection layer,Xiong Gong; D Moses; AJ Heeger; S Liu; AK-Y Jen,Enhanced luminance (L) and luminous efficiency (LE) of polymer light-emitting diodes(PLEDs) is demonstrated using poly (bis (tetraphenyldiamino) biphenyl-perfluorocyclobutane); poly (BTPD-Si-PFCB); as the hole injection layer.

Electronic and Light-Emitting Properties of Some Polyimides Based on Bis (2; 2 ‘: 6 ‘; 2 ‘‘-terpyridine) Ruthenium (II) Complex,Wai Yue Ng; Xiong Gong; Wai Kin Chan,A series of novel aromatic polyimides that contain bis (2; 2 ': 6 '; 2 ''-terpyridine) ruthenium (II)complex was synthesized; and their optoelectronic properties were studied. The absorptionof the polymers at 500 nm was strongly enhanced by the ruthenium complex. As a result; thephotosensitivity of the polymers in the visible region is increased; as can be seen from theincrease in photoconductivity. The glass transition temperature of the polymers isapproximately 220° C and they also exhibit modest thermal stabilities. The electron and holecarrier mobilities of polyimides are on the order of 10-4 cm2 V-1 s-1; which suggests that theelectron-withdrawing diimide moieties play a role in the charge transport process.

Other types of polymers based on 1; 10-phenanthroline bis (2; 2-bipyridyl)ruthenium (II) or chlorotricarbonyl rhenium (I) complexes were also synthesized by the samereaction. In general; these polymers exhibit two absorption bands due to the π–π* transitionof the conjugated main chain and the d–π* metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transition of themetal complex. As a result; the photosensitivity of the polymers beyond 500 nm wasenhanced. Charge-carrier mobility measurements showed that the presence of metal …,Chemistry-A European Journal,2001,111

Polymer Solar Cells with a Low‐Temperature‐Annealed Sol–Gel‐Derived MoOx Film as a Hole Extraction Layer,Tingbin Yang; Ming Wang; Yan Cao; Fei Huang; Lin Huang; Junbiao Peng; Xiong Gong; Stephen ZD Cheng; Yong Cao,This broad weak absorption was attributed to the free electrons being trapped in oxygenvacancies in both T-MoO 3 and S-MoO x thin films by UV irradiation.[26] The opticalbandgap of S-MoO x obtained from the UV–vis spectrum is ca. 3.0 eV. The S-MoO x film istransparent in the visible region except for a weak broad absorption centered at 850 nm;which indicates that the S-MoO x film can function as a buffer layer on the ITO glass; in thatvisible light is able to pass through the ITO/S-MoO x layer into the polymer active layer. X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to characterize the majorcomponent of S-MoO x. Figure 2 shows the core level XPS spectra of Mo 3d and O 1s for S-MoO x film annealed at 250 C. XPS spectra are referenced to the residual hydrocarboncontamination at 284.6±0.1 eV.

Bulk heterojunction perovskite hybrid solar cells with large fill factor,Kai Wang; Chang Liu; Pengcheng Du; Jie Zheng; Xiong Gong,A major limitation to increasing the efficiency of perovskite hybrid solar cells (pero-HSCs) isthe fact that the diffusion length of the electrons is shorter than that of the holes. To facilitatethe electron extraction efficiency in pero-HSCs and to make this efficiency comparable withthat of the holes; we fabricated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) pero-HSCs by mixing perovskitematerials with water-/alcohol-soluble fullerene derivatives. The observed enhanced short-circuit current densities (JSC) and enlarged fill factors (FF) were a result of the balance in thecharge carrier extraction efficiency and the enlarged interfacial area between the perovskitematerials and the fullerene derivatives.

As a result of the redistribution of ions and the associated electrochemicaldoping; ap–i–n junction with a built-in potential is formed. The ions play an important role ascounterions for the electrochemical doping of the semiconducting polymers. This dopinggenerates lowresistance contacts (Ohmic contacts in many cases).

On the binding of cationic; water-soluble conjugated polymers to DNA: electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions,Fan Xia; Xiaolei Zuo; Renqiang Yang; Yi Xiao; Di Kang; Alexis Vallée-Bélisle; Xiong Gong; Alan J Heeger; Kevin W Plaxco,Water-soluble; cationic conjugated polymer binds single-stranded DNA with higher affinitythan it binds double-stranded or otherwise “folded” DNA. This stronger binding results fromthe greater hydrophobicity of single-stranded DNA. Upon reducing the strength of thehydrophobic interactions; the electrostatic attraction becomes the important interaction thatregulates the binding between the water-soluble conjugated polymer and DNA. The differentaffinities between the cationic conjugated polymer and various forms of DNA (molecularbeacons and its open state; single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA and complex DNA folds) can be used to design a variety of biosensors.,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2010,65

Resolution of two apparent paradoxes concerning quantum oscillations in underdoped high-T c superconductors,Xun Jia; Pallab Goswami; Sudip Chakravarty,Abstract Recent quantum-oscillation experiments in underdoped high-temperaturesuperconductors seem to imply two paradoxes. The first paradox concerns the apparentnonexistence of the signature of the electron pockets in angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear signature of a small electron pocketin quantum-oscillation experiments; but no evidence as yet of the corresponding holepockets of approximately double the frequency of the electron pocket. This hole pocketsshould be present if the Fermi-surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate densitywave; assuming that Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total numberof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these apparent paradoxesfrom the commensurate d-density wave theory. To address the first paradox we have …,Physical Review B,2009,21

The modified energy level alignmentcould reduce the energy barrier and facilitate charge transport; thereby increasing theefficiency of PSCs. Herein; we report a new mechanism toward enhanced efficiency byusing a nondipolar water/alcohol-soluble neutral fullerene derivative to reengineer thesurface of the zinc oxide (ZnO) electron extraction layer (EEL) in inverted PSCs. Because ofthe neutral property (ion-free) of the fullerene derivatives; no dipole moment was introducedat the EEL/active layer interface. A negligible change in open-circuit voltage was observedfrom inverted PSCs with the neutral fullerene derivative layer.

Effects of magnetic nanoparticles and external magnetostatic field on the bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells,Kai Wang; Chao Yi; Chang Liu; Xiaowen Hu; Steven Chuang; Xiong Gong,Abstract The price of energy to separate tightly bound electron-hole pair (or charge-transferstate) and extract freely movable charges from low-mobility materials representsfundamental losses for many low-cost photovoltaic devices. In bulk heterojunction (BHJ)polymer solar cells (PSCs); approximately 50% of the total efficiency lost among all energyloss pathways is due to the photogenerated charge carrier recombination within PSCs andlow charge carrier mobility of disordered organic materials. To address these issues; weintroduce magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and orientate these MNPS within BHJ compositeby an external magnetostatic field. Over 50% enhanced efficiency was observed from BHJPSCs incorporated with MNPs and an external magnetostatic field alignment whencompared to the control BHJ PSCs.

PLEDs made from MEH-PPV with 0.5 wt.%of MCC-POSS exhibit LE of 1 cd A− 1; four times higher than that observed in simple MEH-PPV devices. x-ray diffraction studies; measurements of photovoltaic response andmeasurements of photoconductivity from the films of pure MEH-PPV and MEH-PPV withMCC-POSS demonstrated that the improved device performance results from mixing of MCC-POSS with MEH-PPV. The enhanced electron-injection into the emissive layer results fromthe effect of the ionic conductivity introduced by the addition of MCC-POSS.,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2006,14

Inverted polymer solar cells with a solution-processed zinc oxide thin film as an electron collection layer,TingBin Yang; DongHuan Qin; LinFeng Lan; WenBo Huang; Xiong Gong; JunBiao Peng; Yong Cao,Abstract A solution-processed zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film as an electron collection layer forpolymer solar cells (PSCs) with an inverted device structure was investigated. Powerconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs made with a blend of poly (3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT)and [6; 6]-phenyl C 61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are 3.50% and 1.21% for PSCs withand without the ZnO thin film; respectively. Light intensity dependence of the photocurrentand the capacitance-voltage measurement demonstrate that the increased PCEs are due tothe restriction of the strong bimolecular recombination in the interface when a thin ZnO layeris inserted between the polymer active layer and the ITO electrode.

Four new minimum timings have beendetermined. Our analysis of eclipse timings observed during the past 79 years indicates acontinuous period increase at a fractional rate of+(1.2±0.1)× 10-10; in excellent agreementwith the value+ 1.1× 10-10 calculated from the Wilson-Devinney binary code. The new lightcurves display an inverse O'Connell effect increasing toward longer wavelengths. Hot-andcool-spot models are developed to describe these variations but we prefer a cool spot on thesecondary star.

Temperature dependence of electronic energy transfer from a polymer host to a triplet emitter in light emitting diode materials,Sang-Hyun Lim; Xiong Gong; Jacek Ostrowski; Guillermo C Bazan; Daniel Moses; Christopher J Bardeen,Abstract We investigate the temperature dependence of electronic energy transfer betweena polymer host; poly (N-vinylcarbazole) blended with 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1; 3; 4-oxadiazole; and the triplet emitter tris [9; 9-dihexyl-2-(phenyl-4′-(pyridin-2′′-yl))fluorene] iridium (III)(Ir (DPPF) 3). The photophysics of the blend are similar to those of neatpoly (N-vinylcarbazole); with two emitting species corresponding to shallow and deepexcimer traps. When the blend is doped with Ir (DPPF) 3; the deep trap emission ispreferentially quenched. This quenching cannot be explained by simple Förster energytransfer to the dopant. Instead; the data are consistent with a rapid; temperature-dependentpartitioning of the energy between the two host species and the Ir (DPPF) 3; each of whichdecays independently.,Chemical physics letters,2003,9

It is convenient to consider the overall operation of a PLED as asequence of five steps: charge injection at the electrodes; transport through the structure;recombination into a neutral excited state; emission of a photon; and transport of the photonout of the diode. The design of luminescent materials for use in PLED devices is as critical todevice performance as the process of constructing the device itself.,Organic Optoelectronics,2013,1

Organic Materials and Chemistry for Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells,Chun‐Hui Duan; Fei Huang; Yong Cao; Niyazi Serdar Sariciftci; Yongfang Li; Guillermo C Bazan; Xiong Gong,A solar cell is a photovoltaic device which can convert sunlight into electricity and isconsidered as one of the most attractive ways to address growing global energy needsusing a clean; abundant; and renewable resource. Silicon-based solar cells represent themost mature photovoltaic technology to date with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE)of more than 25%[1]. However; the large-scale commercial development of silicon-basedsolar cells is limited owing to their relatively high cost. Alternatively; organic photovoltaic(OPV) solar cells have been rapidly developing as one of the most promising candidates forlow-cost solar cells; owing to the possibility of fabricating large-area and flexible solar cellsby solution processing [2–4]. In 1986; Tang made a great breakthrough in the developmentof organic solar cells (OSC) s with the invention of a bilayer heterojunction solar cell …,Organic Chemistry-Breakthroughs and Perspectives,2012,*

Multilayer white lighting polymer light-emitting diodes,Xiong Gong; Shu Wang; Alan J Heeger,Organic and polymer light-emitting diodes (OLEDs/PLEDs) that emit white light are ofinterest and potential importance for use in active matrix displays (with color filters) andbecause they might eventually be used for solid-state lighting. In such applications; large-area devices and low-cost of manufacturing will be major issues. We demonstrated that highperformance multilayer white emitting PLEDs can be fabricated by using a blend ofluminescent semiconducting polymers and organometallic complexes as the emission layer;and water-soluble (or ethanol-soluble) polymers/small molecules (for example; PVK-SO 3Li) as the hole injection/transport layer (HIL/HTL) and water-soluble (or ethanol-soluble)polymers/small molecules (for example; t-Bu-PBD-SO 3 Na) as the electroninjection/transport layer (EIL/HTL). Each layer is spin-cast sequentially from solutions …,Organic Light Emitting Materials and Devices X,2006,*

High performance polymer light-emitting diodes fabricated with a novel hole injection layer,Xiong Gong; Sen Liu; Alex Jen; Daniel Moses; Alan Heeger,Abstract Enhanced luminance (L) and luminous efficiency (LE) of polymer light-emittingdiodes (PLEDs) is demonstrated using poly (bis (tetraphenyldiamino) biphenyl-perfluorocyclobutane); poly (BTPD-Si-PFCB); as the hole injection layer. The monomer iscast directly onto the indium-tin-oxide anode and thermally polymerized in situ. Holeinjection from poly (BTPD-Si-PFCB) into the Â" super yellowÂ" derivative of poly (phenylenevinylene) and into several blue emitting polymers is comparable to or better than that frompoly (enthylendioxythiophene): poly (styrene sulfonic acid)(PEDOT: PSSA). With poly (BTPD-Si-PFCB) as the hole injecting layer into super yellow; the performance is identical to thatobtained with PEDOT: PSSA (LE Â» 8 cd/A with little fall-off even at L> 104 cd/m2). For blue-emitting polymers; the use of poly (BTPD-Si-PFCB) leads to significant improvements in L …,APS March Meeting Abstracts,2003,*

Synthesis and photophysical properties of some conjugated polymers functionalized with ruthenium polypyridine complexes,Po King Ng; Wai Yue Ng; Xiong Gong; Wai Kin Chan,Abstract A series of conjugated polymers functionalized with different ruthenium polypyridinemetal complexes were synthesized by the palladium catalyzed reaction. Two conjugatedpolymer systems have been studied: 1. poly (phenylenevinylene) with bis (2; 2': 6'; 2”-terpyridine) ruthenium (II) on the mainchain and 2. quinoxaline based polymers with tris (2;2'-bipyridine) ruthenium (II). The ruthenium polypyridine complexes exhibit a long-livedmetal to ligand charge transfer excited state which can enhance the photosensitivity of theresulting polymers. Different physical properties such as the photoconductivity and chargemobility in these polymers are also studied.,MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive,1997,*

Stabilized Blue Emission from Polyfluorene-Based Light-Emitting,Xiong Gong,Polyfluorenes (PFs)" have emerged as a class of conjugated polymers that show promise foruse in polymer-based emissive displays. The PFs exhibit high photoluminescence (PL)efficien-cy; good charge transport; thermal stability; and tunability of physical parametersthrough chemical modification and copolymerization. The high-efficiency blue PL emissionfrom the PF structure is attractive for use in displays." Moreover; as a host material; the PFscan enable full color (blue; green; and red) via energy transfer to longer wavelength emittersin blends with other conjugated polymers and with phosphorescent dyes."*,*,*,*

The Stability of Electro-opto-active Organics,Steven Xiao; Pierre-Louis Brunner; Eujene Jin; Nir Tessler; Ishiang Shi; Yong Cao; Xiong Gong; Alan Heeger,ABSTRACT The marketing of OLED/PLED urges for long-life electro-active organicmaterials. Through collaborative works with UCSB (Dr. Alan Heeger's group); McGillUniversity (Dr. Ishiang Shin's group); Technion Institute (Dr. Nir Tessler's group) and SCUTof China (Dr; Yong Cao's group); we found the keto defect in polyfluorenes is catalyzed bythe presence of calcium. We also found that the high molecular weight polymers yield tohigh charge mobility; and that the introduction of bulky inorganic groups like POSS;improves the stability and efficiency of PLED; as well as increases the charge mobility of TFTdevice.,*,*,*
