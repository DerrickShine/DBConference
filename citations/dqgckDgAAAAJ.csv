E-store: Fine-grained elastic partitioning for distributed transaction processing systems,Rebecca Taft; Essam Mansour; Marco Serafini; Jennie Duggan; Aaron J Elmore; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Andrew Pavlo; Michael Stonebraker,Abstract On-line transaction processing (OLTP) database management systems (DBMSs)often serve time-varying workloads due to daily; weekly or seasonal fluctuations in demand;or because of rapid growth in demand due to a company's business success. In addition;many OLTP workloads are heavily skewed to" hot" tuples or ranges of tuples. For example;the majority of NYSE volume involves only 40 stocks. To deal with such fluctuations; anOLTP DBMS needs to be elastic; that is; it must be able to expand and contract resources inresponse to load fluctuations and dynamically balance load as hot tuples vary over time.This paper presents E-Store; an elastic partitioning framework for distributed OLTP DBMSs.It automatically scales resources in response to demand spikes; periodic events; andgradual changes in an application's workload.

ERA: efficient serial and parallel suffix tree construction for very long strings,Essam Mansour; Amin Allam; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Panos Kalnis,Abstract The suffix tree is a data structure for indexing strings. It is used in a variety ofapplications such as bioinformatics; time series analysis; clustering; text editing and datacompression. However; when the string and the resulting suffix tree are too large to fit intothe main memory; most existing construction algorithms become very inefficient. This paperpresents a disk-based suffix tree construction method; called Elastic Range (ERa); whichworks efficiently with very long strings that are much larger than the available memory. ERapartitions the tree construction process horizontally and vertically and minimizes I/Os bydynamically adjusting the horizontal partitions independently for each vertical partition;based on the evolving shape of the tree and the available memory. Where appropriate; ERaalso groups vertical partitions together to amortize the I/O cost. We developed a serial …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,39
Choosing the" Best" Sorting Algorithm for Optimal Energy Consumption.,Christian Bunse; Hagen Höpfner; Suman Roychoudhury; Essam Mansour,Abstract: Reducing energy consumption of mobile systems in order to prolong theiroperating time has been an interesting research topic over the past several years. Suchsystems are typically battery powered. Hence; their uptime depends on the energyconsumptions of the used components. By applying novel strategies that allow systems todynamically adapt at runtime can be effectively used to reduce energy consumption. Thefocus of this paper is based on a case study that uses an energy management componentthat can dynamically choose the “best” sorting algorithm duing a multi-party mobilecommunication. The results indicate that Insertionsort is the most optimal sorting algorithmwhen in comes to saving energy.,ICSOFT (2),2009,38
Exploring the energy consumption of data sorting algorithms in embedded and mobile environments,Christian Bunse; Hagen Höpfner; Essam Mansour; Suman Roychoudhury,Most mobile and embedded devices are battery powered. Hence; their uptime depends onthe energy consumption of the used components. Developers made severe effort to optimizehardware components in order to reduce their energy consumption. However; in this paperwe show that one also has to consider energy awareness in terms of software. In this studywe focus on sorting algorithms; which are not only used directly by the user of a device butalso very often implicitly by other algorithms. Our experiments show; that different sortingalgorithms consume different amounts of energy. In detail; the experiments show that thereis no direct correlation between the time complexity of an algorithm and its energyconsumption.,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009.

Accordion: Elastic scalability for database systems supporting distributed transactions,Marco Serafini; Essam Mansour; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Kenneth Salem; Taha Rafiq; Umar Farooq Minhas,Abstract Providing the ability to elastically use more or fewer servers on demand (scale outand scale in) as the load varies is essential for database management systems (DBMSes)deployed on today's distributed computing platforms; such as the cloud. This requiressolving the problem of dynamic (online) data placement; which has so far been addressedonly for workloads where all transactions are local to one sever. In DBMSes where ACIDtransactions can access more than one partition; distributed transactions represent a majorperformance bottleneck. Scaling out and spreading data across a larger number of serversdoes not necessarily result in a linear increase in the overall system throughput; becausetransactions that used to access only one server may become distributed. In this paper wepresent Accordion; a dynamic data placement system for partition-based DBMSes that …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,29
An event-driven approach to computerizing clinical guidelines using XML,Essam Mansour; Bing Wu; Kudakwashe Dube; Jian Xing Li,Clinical events form the basis of patient care practice. Their computerization is an importantaid to the work of clinicians. Clinical guidelines or protocols direct clinicians and patients onwhen and how to handle clinical problems. Thus; clinical guidelines are an encapsulation ofclinical events. Hence; an event-driven approach to computerizing the management ofclinical guidelines is worthy of investigation. In our framework; called SpEM; the main clinicalguideline management dimensions are specification; execution; and manipulation. Thispaper presents an event-driven approach; within the context of the SpEM framework; tomanage clinical guidelines. The event-driven approach is based on the event-condition-action (ECA) rule paradigm in which the ECA rules are specified using an XML-basedlanguage over an electronic healthcare record (EHCR) implemented using an XML …,Services Computing Workshops; 2006.

A demonstration of the solid platform for social web applications,Essam Mansour; Andrei Vlad Sambra; Sandro Hawke; Maged Zereba; Sarven Capadisli; Abdurrahman Ghanem; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Tim Berners-Lee,Abstract Solid is a decentralized platform for social Web applications. In the Solid platform;users' data is managed independently of the applications that create and consume this data.Each user stores their data in a Web-accessible personal online datastore (or pod). Eachuser can have one or more pods from different pod providers; and can easily switch betweenproviders. Applications access data in users' pods using well defined protocols; and adecentralized authentication and access control mechanism guarantees the privacy of thedata. In this decentralized architecture; applications can operate on users' data wherever it isstored. Users control access to their data; and have the option to switch betweenapplications at any time. We will demonstrate the utility of Solid and how it is experiencedfrom the point of view of end users and application developers.

Energy efficient data sorting using standard sorting algorithms,Christian Bunse; Hagen Höpfner; Suman Roychoudhury; Essam Mansour,Abstract Protecting the environment by saving energy and thus reducing carbon dioxideemissions is one of today's hottest and most challenging topics. Although the perspective forreducing energy consumption; from ecological and business perspectives is clear; from atechnological point of view; the realization especially for mobile systems still falls behindexpectations. Novel strategies that allow (software) systems to dynamically adaptthemselves at runtime can be effectively used to reduce energy consumption.

ACME: A scalable parallel system for extracting frequent patterns from a very long sequence,Majed Sahli; Essam Mansour; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Modern applications; including bioinformatics; time series; and web log analysis;require the extraction of frequent patterns; called motifs; from one very long (ie; severalgigabytes) sequence. Existing approaches are either heuristics that are error-prone; or exact(also called combinatorial) methods that are extremely slow; therefore; applicable only tovery small sequences (ie; in the order of megabytes). This paper presents ACME; acombinatorial approach that scales to gigabyte-long sequences and is the first to supportsupermaximal motifs. ACME is a versatile parallel system that can be deployed on desktopmulti-core systems; or on thousands of CPUs in the cloud. However; merely using morecompute nodes does not guarantee efficiency; because of the related overheads.

Parallel motif extraction from very long sequences,Majed Sahli; Essam Mansour; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Motifs are frequent patterns used to identify biological functionality in genomicsequences; periodicity in time series; or user trends in web logs. In contrast to a lot ofexisting work that focuses on collections of many short sequences; modern applicationsrequire mining of motifs in one very long sequence (ie; in the order of several gigabytes). Forthis case; there exist statistical approaches that are fast but inaccurate; or combinatorialmethods that are sound and complete. Unfortunately; existing combinatorial methods areserial and very slow. Consequently; they are limited to very short sequences (ie; a fewmegabytes); small alphabets (typically 4 symbols for DNA sequences); and restricted typesof motifs. This paper presents ACME; a combinatorial method for extracting motifs from asingle very long sequence.

Automatic tuning of bag-of-tasks applications,Majed Sahli; Essam Mansour; Tariq Alturkestani; Panos Kalnis,This paper presents APlug; a framework for automatic tuning of large scale applications ofmany independent tasks. APlug suggests the best decomposition of the original computationinto smaller tasks and the best number of CPUs to use; in order to meet user-specificconstraints. We show that the problem is not trivial because there is large variability in theexecution time of tasks; and it is possible for a task to occupy a CPU by performing uselesscomputations. APlug collects a sample of task execution times and builds a model; which isthen used by a discrete event simulator to calculate the optimal parameters. We provide aC++ API and a stand-alone implementation of APlug; and we integrate it with three typicalapplications from computational chemistry; bioinformatics; and data mining. A scenario foroptimizing resources utilization is used to demonstrate our framework. We run …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,8
MyMIDP: An JDBC driver for accessing MySQL from mobile devices,Hagen Höpfner; Jörg Schad; Sebastian Wendland; Essam Mansour,Cell phones are no longer merely used to make phone calls or to send short or multimediamessages. They more and more become information systems clients. Recent developmentsin the areas of mobile computing; wireless networks and information systems provide accessto data at almost every place and anytime by using this kind of lightweight mobile device. Buteven though mobile clients support the Java Mobile Edition or the. NET Micro Framework;most information systems for mobile clients require a middle-ware that handles datacommunication. Java's JDBC provides a standard way to access databases in Java; but thisinterface is missing in Java ME. In this paper we present our implementation of an MIDP-based Java ME driver for My SQL similar to JDBC that allows direct communication of MIDPapplications to My SQL servers without a middleware.,Advances in Databases; Knowledge; and Data Applications; 2009.

A Generic Approach and Framework for Managing Complex Information,Essam Mansour,Abstract Several application domains; such as healthcare; incorporate domain knowledgeinto their day-to-day activities to standardise and enhance their performance. Suchincorporation produces complex information; which contains two main clusters (active andpassive) of information that have internal connections between them. The active clusterdetermines the recommended procedure that should be taken as a reaction to specificsituations. The passive cluster determines the information that describes these situationsand other descriptive information plus the execution history of the complex information. Inthe healthcare domain; a medical patient plan is an example for complex informationproduced during the disease management activity from specific clinical guidelines.,Doctoral,2008,6

Towards an XML-Based Query and Contextual Information Model in Context-Aware Mobile Information Systems,Essam Mansour; Hagen Höpfner,Nowadays database systems (DBSs) are state-of-the art for managing complex data ininformation systems. Unfortunately; DBSs are not aware of the context of their usage. Queryresults are retrieved without considering the context of the user/device issuing the query. Inmany cases; this feature is added by a context managing middle-ware. This paper outlines ascenario for context aware mobile services. In the paper we introduce an XML-basedXREAL model for formalizing contextual information and queries highlighted in the scenarioand discuss how XREAL can be implemented in a modern database system. By utilizingXREAL; it is possible to realize context aware mobile information systems based on theavailable DBSs without additional middle-wares.,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009.

StarDB: a large-scale DBMS for strings,Majed Sahli; Essam Mansour; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Strings and applications using them are proliferating in science and business.Currently; strings are stored in file systems and processed using ad-hoc procedural code.Existing techniques are not flexible and cannot efficiently handle complex queries or largedatasets. In this paper; we demonstrate StarDB; a distributed database system for analyticson strings. StarDB hides data and system complexities and allows users to focus onanalytics. It uses a comprehensive set of parallel string operations and provides adeclarative query language to solve complex queries. StarDB automatically tunes itself andruns with over 90% efficiency on supercomputers; public clouds; clusters; and workstations.We test StarDB using real datasets that are 2 orders of magnitude larger than the datasetsreported by previous works.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,4
Replay the execution history of rule-based information,Essam Mansour; Hagen Höpfner,Software systems in health care; such as disease and medical-record management; orfinancial applications; such as customer relationship and portfolio management; have veryoften a temporal nature. Information is specified in form of rules as a pre-step for monitoringthe changes of interest in the application. Managing such applications requires to providereplay support for managed information at any specified review period. This paper presentsa replay support method for information formalized as rules. This method is based on anXML-based model and a replay query language for the rule-based information.

An approach to detecting relevant updates to cached data using XML and active databases,Essam Mansour; Hagen Höpfner,Abstract Client/server information systems use caching techniques to reduce the volume oftransmitted data as well as response time and; especially in the case of systems with mobileclients; to reduce energy consumptions. Updating the server database might causeinconsistencies between server data and cached data. Guaranteeing consistency at leastdemands to invalidate outdated caches. To avoid invalidation of caches that are not affectedby a particular update one must check the relevancy of each update for each cache. It hasbeen proven; that this can only be done on a stateful server. This paper presents the purelydatabase system (DBS) based DRUpE method for checking the relevance of server sideupdates to cached data by analyzing the intersection between modified data and cacheddata. A non-empty intersection means that the update operations are relevant to the …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,3
On Analyzing the Database Performance for Different Classes of XML Documents based on the used Storage Approach.,Hagen Höpfner; Jörg Schad; Essam Mansour,Abstract: With the increasing popularity of XML data also the need for permanent XMLdocument storage grows. As of today there exist number of different XML storagealternatives ranging from XML enabled relational database systems over a new class ofhybrid database systems providing native storage for XML and relational data to pure nativeXML systems. This paper examines how these different storage approaches perform inrespect to the different classes of XML data by devising a new benchmark HYBE with specialconsideration to certain features of hybrid database systems. First results indicate that hybriddatabase systems can deliver performance which is (almost) equivalent to native XMLdatabase systems making them the optimal choice for small to mid-size companies with theneed for both XML and relational data storage.,ICSOFT (2),2009,3
Managing complex information in reactive applications using an active temporal XML database approach.,Essam Mansour; Kudakwashe Dube; Bing Wu,Abstract: Tasks; such as those in patient care practice; require constant monitoring of adynamic context and environment based on best practices in the form of predefinedexperience-based information or knowledge. These applications could take the form ofreactive applications. The problem of incorporating best practices into routines used in suchtasks requires advanced approaches and methods for comprehensively managing complexinformation. This paper presents a generic and unified framework for Complex InformationManagement (CIM) in domains where best practices need to be incorporated into day-to-daywork.

Cme: A temporal relational model for efficient coalescing,Mohammed Al-Kateb; Essam Mansour; Mohamed E El-Sharkawi,Coalescing is a data restructuring operation applicable to temporal databases. It mergestimestamps of adjacent or overlapping tuples that have identical attribute values. Thelikelihood that a temporal query employs coalescing is very high. However; coalescing is anexpensive and time consuming operation. In this paper; we present a novel temporalrelational model through which coalescing becomes quite simple. The basic idea is toaugment each time-varying attribute in a temporal relation with two additional attributes thattrace changes in values of the corresponding time-varying attribute. One attribute traceschanges in values with respect to each individual instance (ie tuples having the same keyvalue); while the other attribute traces changes in values globally for all instances (ie alltuples in the temporal relation). Using these tracing attributes; coalescing could be easily …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2005. TIME 2005. 12th International Symposium on,2005,2

RACE: a scalable and elastic parallel system for discovering repeats in very long sequences,Essam Mansour; Ahmed El-Roby; Panos Kalnis; Aron Ahmadia; Ashraf Aboulnaga,Abstract A wide range of applications; including bioinformatics; time series; and log analysis;depend on the identification of repetitions in very long sequences. The problem of findingmaximal pairs subsumes most important types of repetition-finding tasks. Existing solutionsrequire both the input sequence and its index (typically an order of magnitude larger thanthe input) to fit in memory. Moreover; they are serial algorithms with long execution time.Therefore; they are limited to small datasets; despite the fact that modern applicationsdemand orders of magnitude longer sequences.

This limits users tocertain operations supported by existing procedural applications and requires manual queryplanning with limited tuning opportunities. SQL can be used to analyze strings; but itprovides limited support for native string operations because it is based on the relationalmodel. It is unnatural to represent and access strings using relational algebra and tuplecalculus. This paper presents StarQL; a generic and declarative query language for strings.StarQL is based on a native string data model that allows StarQL to support a large variety ofstring operations and provide semantic-based query optimization.

Solid: A Platform for Decentralized Social Applications Based on Linked Data,Andrei Vlad Sambra; Essam Mansour; Sandro Hawke; Maged Zereba; Nicola Greco; Abdurrahman Ghanem; Dmitri Zagidulin; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Tim Berners-Lee,Abstract. This paper presents Solid; a decentralized platform for social Web applications. InSolid; users' data is managed independently of the applications that create and consumethis data. The user's data is stored in a Web-accessible personal online datastore (or pod).Solid allows users to have one or more pods from different pod providers; while at the sametime enabling users to easily switch between providers. Developers can use Solid protocols;which is based on existing W3C recommendations; for reading; writing and access control ofthe contents of users' pods. In Solid architecture; applications can operate over data ownedby the user or the user has access to regardless the location of this data on the Web. Userscan also control access to their data; and have the option to switch between applications atany time. This is paradigm shift in integrating social features into Web applications. Our …,*,*,*
