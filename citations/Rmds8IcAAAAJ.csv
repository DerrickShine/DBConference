Clustering aggregation,Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract We consider the following problem: given a set of clusterings; find a singleclustering that agrees as much as possible with the input clusterings. This problem;clustering aggregation; appears naturally in various contexts. For example; clusteringcategorical data is an instance of the clustering aggregation problem; each categoricalattribute can be viewed as a clustering of the input rows where rows are grouped together ifthey take the same value on that attribute. Clustering aggregation can also be used as ametaclustering method to improve the robustness of clustering by combining the output ofmultiple algorithms. Furthermore; the problem formulation does not require a prioriinformation about the number of clusters; it is naturally determined by the optimizationfunction. In this article; we give a formal statement of the clustering aggregation problem …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2007,606
Finding authorities and hubs from link structures on the world wide web,Allan Borodin; Gareth O Roberts; Jeffrey S Rosenthal; Panayiotis Tsaparas,ABSTRACT Recently; there have been a number of algorithms proposed for analyzinghypertext link structure so as to determine the best “authorities” for a given topic or query.While such analysis is usually combined with content analysis; there is a sense in whichsome algorithms are deemed to be “more balanced” and others “more focused”. Weundertake a comparative study of hypertext link analysis algorithms. Guided by someexperimental queries; we propose some formal criteria for evaluating and comparing linkanalysis algorithms.,Proceedings of the 10th international conference on World Wide Web,2001,347
Link analysis ranking: algorithms; theory; and experiments,Allan Borodin; Gareth O Roberts; Jeffrey S Rosenthal; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The explosive growth and the widespread accessibility of the Web has led to asurge of research activity in the area of information retrieval on the World Wide Web. Theseminal papers of Kleinberg [1998; 1999] and Brin and Page [1998] introduced LinkAnalysis Ranking; where hyperlink structures are used to determine the relative authority ofa Web page and produce improved algorithms for the ranking of Web search results. In thisarticle we work within the hubs and authorities framework defined by Kleinberg and wepropose new families of algorithms. Two of the algorithms we propose use a Bayesianapproach; as opposed to the usual algebraic and graph theoretic approaches. We alsointroduce a theoretical framework for the study of Link Analysis Ranking algorithms. Theframework allows for the definition of specific properties of Link Analysis Ranking …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2005,331
LIMBO: Scalable clustering of categorical data,Periklis Andritsos; Panayiotis Tsaparas; Renée J Miller; Kenneth C Sevcik,Abstract Clustering is a problem of great practical importance in numerous applications. Theproblem of clustering becomes more challenging when the data is categorical; that is; whenthere is no inherent distance measure between data values. We introduce LIMBO; ascalable hierarchical categorical clustering algorithm that builds on the InformationBottleneck (IB) framework for quantifying the relevant information preserved when clustering.As a hierarchical algorithm; LIMBO has the advantage that it can produce clusterings ofdifferent sizes in a single execution. We use the IB framework to define a distance measurefor categorical tuples and we also present a novel distance measure for categorical attributevalues. We show how the LIMBO algorithm can be used to cluster both tuples and values.LIMBO handles large data sets by producing a memory bounded summary model for the …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,247
Assessing data mining results via swap randomization,Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Taneli Mielikäinen; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The problem of assessing the significance of data mining results on high-dimensional 0--1 datasets has been studied extensively in the literature. For problems suchas mining frequent sets and finding correlations; significance testing can be done bystandard statistical tests such as chi-square; or other methods. However; the results of suchtests depend only on the specific attributes and not on the dataset as a whole. Moreover; thetests are difficult to apply to sets of patterns or other complex results of data miningalgorithms. In this article; we consider a simple randomization technique that deals with thisshortcoming. The approach consists of producing random datasets that have the same rowand column margins as the given dataset; computing the results of interest on therandomized instances and comparing them to the results on the actual data.

Exploiting social context for review quality prediction,Yue Lu; Panayiotis Tsaparas; Alexandros Ntoulas; Livia Polanyi,Abstract Online reviews in which users publish detailed commentary about their experiencesand opinions with products; services; or events are extremely valuable to users who rely onthem to make informed decisions. However; reviews vary greatly in quality and areconstantly increasing in number; therefore; automatic assessment of review helpfulness is ofgrowing importance. Previous work has addressed the problem by treating a review as astand-alone document; extracting features from the review text; and learning a functionbased on these features for predicting the review quality. In this work; we exploit contextualinformation about authors' identities and social networks for improving review qualityprediction. We propose a generic framework for incorporating social context information byadding regularization constraints to the text-based predictor. Our approach can effectively …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,233
Using the wisdom of the crowds for keyword generation,Ariel Fuxman; Panayiotis Tsaparas; Kannan Achan; Rakesh Agrawal,Abstract In the sponsored search model; search engines are paid by businesses that areinterested in displaying ads for their site alongside the search results. Businesses bid forkeywords; and their ad is displayed when the keyword is queried to the search engine. Animportant problem in this process is' keyword generation': given a business that is interestedin launching a campaign; suggest keywords that are related to that campaign. We addressthis problem by making use of the query logs of the search engine. We identify queriesrelated to a campaign by exploiting the associations between queries and URLs as they arecaptured by the user's clicks. These queries form good keyword suggestions since theycapture the" wisdom of the crowd" as to what is related to a site. We formulate the problemas a semi-supervised learning problem; and propose algorithms within the Markov …,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web,2008,149
Method and apparatus for merging result lists from multiple search engines,*,This invention includes the step of transmitting a query to a set of search engines. Any resultlists returned from these search engines is received; and a subset of entries in each resultlist is selected. Each entry in this subset is assigned a scoring value according to a scoringfunction; and each result list is then assigned a representative value according to the scoringvalues assigned to its entries. A merged list of entries is produced based upon therepresentative value assigned to each result list.,*,2004,112
Ranked join indices,Panayiotis Tsaparas; Themistoklis Palpanas; Yannis Kotidis; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,A plethora of data sources contain data entities that could be ordered according to a varietyof attributes associated with the entities. Such orderings result effectively in a ranking of theentities according to the values in the attribute domain. Commonly; users correlate suchsources for query processing purposes through join operations. In query processing; it isdesirable to incorporate user preferences towards specific attributes or their values. A way toincorporate such preferences is by utilizing scoring functions that combine user preferencesand attribute values and return a numerical score for each tuple in the join result. Then; atarget query; which we refer to as top-k join query; seeks to identify the k tuples in the joinresult with the highest scores. We propose a novel technique; which we refer to as rankedjoin index; to efficiently answer top-k join queries for arbitrary; user specified; preferences …,Data Engineering; 2003.

Structured annotations of web queries,Nikos Sarkas; Stelios Paparizos; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Queries asked on web search engines often target structured data; such ascommercial products; movie showtimes; or airline schedules. However; surfacing relevantresults from such data is a highly challenging problem; due to the unstructured language ofthe web queries; and the imposing scalability and speed requirements of web search. In thispaper; we discover latent structured semantics in web queries and produce StructuredAnnotations for them. We consider an annotation as a mapping of a query to a table ofstructured data and attributes of this table. Given a collection of structured tables; we presenta fast and scalable tagging mechanism for obtaining all possible annotations of a query overthese tables. However; we observe that for a given query only few are sensible for the userneeds. We thus propose a principled probabilistic scoring mechanism; using a generative …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,93
Selecting a comprehensive set of reviews,Panayiotis Tsaparas; Alexandros Ntoulas; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Online user reviews play a central role in the decision-making process of users for avariety of tasks; ranging from entertainment and shopping to medical services. As user-generated reviews proliferate; it becomes critical to have a mechanism for helping the users(information consumers) deal with the information overload; and presenting them with asmall comprehensive set of reviews that satisfies their information need. This is particularlyimportant for mobile phone users; who need to make decisions quickly; and have a devicewith limited screen real-estate for displaying the reviews. Previous approaches haveaddressed the problem by ranking reviews according to their (estimated) helpfulness.However; such approaches do not account for the fact that the top few high-quality reviewsmay be highly redundant; repeating the same information; or presenting the same …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,82
Information-theoretic tools for mining database structure from large data sets,Periklis Andritsos; Renée J Miller; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Data design has been characterized as a process of arriving at a design thatmaximizes the information content of each piece of data (or equivalently; one that minimizesredundancy). Information content (or redundancy) is measured with respect to a prescribedmodel for the data; a model that is often expressed as a set of constraints. In this work; weconsider the problem of doing data redesign in an environment where the prescribed modelis unknown or incomplete. Specifically; we consider the problem of finding structural clues inan instance of data; an instance which may contain errors; missing values; and duplicaterecords. We propose a set of information-theoretic tools for finding structural summaries thatare useful in characterizing the information content of the data; and ultimately useful in datadesign. We provide algorithms for creating these summaries over large; categorical data …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,77
Global similarity and local divergence in human and mouse gene co-expression networks,Panayiotis Tsaparas; Leonardo Mariño-Ramírez; Olivier Bodenreider; Eugene V Koonin; I King Jordan,A genome-wide comparative analysis of human and mouse gene expression patterns wasperformed in order to evaluate the evolutionary divergence of mammalian gene expression.Tissue-specific expression profiles were analyzed for 9;105 human-mouse orthologousgene pairs across 28 tissues. Expression profiles were resolved into species-specificcoexpression networks; and the topological properties of the networks were comparedbetween species. At the global level; the topological properties of the human and mousegene coexpression networks are; essentially; identical. For instance; both networks havetopologies with small-world and scale-free properties as well as closely similar averagenode degrees; clustering coefficients; and path lengths. However; the human and mousecoexpression networks are highly divergent at the local level: only a small fraction (< 10 …,BMC evolutionary biology,2006,76
Mining the inner structure of the Web graph.,Debora Donato; Stefano Leonardi; Stefano Millozzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,ABSTRACT Despite being the sum of decentralized and uncoordinated efforts byheterogeneous groups and individuals; the World Wide Web exhibits a well definedstructure; characterized by several interesting properties. This structure was clearly revealedby Broder et al.[4] who presented the evocative bow-tie picture of the Web. Although; thebow-tie structure is a relatively clear abstraction of the macroscopic picture of the Web; it isquite uninformative with respect to the finer details of the Web graph. In this paper we minethe inner structure of the Web graph. We present a series of measurements on the Web;which offer a better understanding of the individual components of the bow-tie. In theprocess; we develop algorithmic techniques for performing these measurements. Wediscover that the scale-free properties permeate all the components of the bowtie which …,WebDB,2005,75
Efficient algorithms for sequence segmentation,Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The sequence segmentation problem asks for a partition of the sequence into k non-overlapping segments that cover all data points such that each segment is as homogeneousas possible. This problem can be solved optimally using dynamic programming in O (n 2 k)time; where n is the length of the sequence. Given that sequences in practice are too long; aquadratic algorithm is not an adequately fast solution. Here; we present an alternativeconstantfactor approximation algorithm with running time O (n 4/3 k 5/3). We call thisalgorithm the DNS algorithm. We also consider the recursive application of the DNSalgorithm; that results in a faster algorithm (O (n log log n) running time) with O (log n)approximation factor; and study the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff. Extensive experimentalresults show that these algorithms outperform other widely-used heuristics. The same …,*,2006,74

One or more seed documents orqueries are provided that contain content that is representative of a category. A query clicklog containing information regarding queries entered by at least one user into the searchengine and documents subsequently clicked in search engine results corresponding withthe queries is analyzed to determine which one or more queries resulted in clicks on theseed documents. Information is stored associating the one or more queries with the categoryif they resulted in clicks on the seed documents.,*,2011,72
Dimension induced clustering,Aristides Gionis; Alexander Hinneburg; Spiros Papadimitriou; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract It is commonly assumed that high-dimensional datasets contain points most ofwhich are located in low-dimensional manifolds. Detection of low-dimensional clusters is anextremely useful task for performing operations such as clustering and classification;however; it is a challenging computational problem. In this paper we study the problem offinding subsets of points with low intrinsic dimensionality. Our main contribution is to extendthe definition of fractal correlation dimension; which measures average volume growth rate;in order to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the data in local neighborhoods. Weprovide a careful analysis of several key examples in order to demonstrate the properties ofour measure. Based on our proposed measure; we introduce a novel approach to discoverclusters with low dimensionality.

Opinion maximization in social networks,Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The process of opinion formation through synthesis and contrast of differentviewpoints has been the subject of many studies in economics and social sciences. Today;this process manifests itself also in online social networks and social media. The keycharacteristic of successful promotion campaigns is that they take into consideration suchopinion-formation dynamics in order to create a overall favorable opinion about a specificinformation item; such as a person; a product; or an idea. In this paper; we adopt a well-established model for social-opinion dynamics and formalize the campaigndesign problemas the problem of identifying a set of target individuals whose positive opinion about aninformation item will maximize the overall positive opinion for the item in the social network.We call this problem CAMPAIGN.

Facet discovery for structured web search: a query-log mining approach,Jeffrey Pound; Stelios Paparizos; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract In recent years; there has been a strong trend of incorporating results fromstructured data sources into keyword-based web search systems such as Bing or Amazon.When presenting structured data; facets are a powerful tool for navigating; refining; andgrouping the results. For a given structured data source; a fundamental problem insupporting faceted search is finding an ordered selection of attributes and values that willpopulate the facets. This creates two sets of challenges. First; because of the limited screenreal-estate; it is important that the top facets best match the anticipated user intent. Second;the huge scale of available data to such engines demands an automated unsupervisedsolution. In this paper; we model the user faceted-search behavior using the intersection ofweb query-logs with existing structured data.

Generating labels from clicks,Rakesh Agrawal; Alan Halverson; Krishnaram Kenthapadi; Nina Mishra; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The ranking function used by search engines to order results is learned fromlabeled training data. Each training point is a (query; URL) pair that is labeled by a humanjudge who assigns a score of Perfect; Excellent; etc.; depending on how well the URLmatches the query. In this paper; we study whether clicks can be used to automaticallygenerate good labels. Intuitively; documents that are clicked (resp.; skipped) in aggregatecan indicate relevance (resp.; lack of relevance). We give a novel way of transforming clicksinto weighted; directed graphs inspired by eye-tracking studies and then devise an objectivefunction for finding cuts in these graphs that induce a good labeling. In its full generality; theproblem is NP-hard; but we show that; in the case of two labels; an optimum labeling can befound in linear time. For the more general case; we propose heuristic solutions …,Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2009,47
Stability in Adversarial Queueing Theory,Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract A queueing network is a set of interconnected servers. Customers are injectedcontinuously in the system; inducing some workload for each server. A fundamental issuethat arises in this context is that of stability: will the total workload in the system remainbounded over time? In this thesis; we investigate the question of stability within the modeldefined in [BKR+ 96]; where workload is induced by an adversary. Prior work in theadversarial model considers only packet routing networks; a special case of queueingnetworks; where all customers require unit service time. We extend this model to includemore general queueing networks; where the customers may require different service timesat different servers of the network. We show that the queueing policies proven to beuniversally stable for packet routing networks; are universally stable in the new …,*,1997,45
Nearest neighbor search in multidimensional spaces,Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The Nearest Neighbor Search problem is de ned as follows: given a set P of npoints; preprocess the points so as to e ciently answer queries that require nding the closestpoint in P to a query point q. If we are willing to settle for a point that is almost as close as thenearest neighbor; then we can relax the problem to the approximate Nearest NeighborSearch. Nearest Neighbor Search (exact or approximate) is an integral component in a widerange of applications that include multimedia databases; computational biology; datamining; and information retrieval. The common thread in all these applications is similaritysearch: given a database of objects; we want to return the object in the database that is mostsimilar to a query object. The objects are mapped onto points in a high dimensional metricspace; and similarity search reduces to a nearest neighbor search. The dimension of the …,*,2002,39
Using non-linear dynamical systems for web searching and ranking,Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract In the recent years there has been a surge of research activity in the area ofinformation retrieval on the World Wide Web; using link analysis of the underlying hypertextgraph topology. Most of the algorithms in the literature can be described as dynamicalsystems; that is; the repetitive application of a function on a set of weights. Algorithms thatrely on eigenvector computations; such as HITS and PAGERANK; correspond to lineardynamical systems. In this work we consider two families of link analysis ranking algorithmsthat no longer enjoy the linearity property of the previous approaches. We study in depth aninteresting special case of these two families. We prove that the corresponding non-lineardynamical system converges for any initialization; and we provide a rigorouscharacterization of the combinatorial properties of the stationary weights.

Improving classification accuracy using automatically extracted training data,Ariel Fuxman; Anitha Kannan; Andrew B Goldberg; Rakesh Agrawal; Panayiotis Tsaparas; John Shafer,Abstract Classification is a core task in knowledge discovery and data mining; and there hasbeen substantial research effort in developing sophisticated classification models. In aparallel thread; recent work from the NLP community suggests that for tasks such as naturallanguage disambiguation even a simple algorithm can outperform a sophisticated one; if it isprovided with large quantities of high quality training data. In those applications; trainingdata occurs naturally in text corpora; and high quality training data sets running into billionsof words have been reportedly used. We explore how we can apply the lessons from theNLP community to KDD tasks. Specifically; we investigate how to identify data sources thatcan yield training data at low cost and study whether the quantity of the automaticallyextracted training data can compensate for its lower quality. We carry out this …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,25
Ranking target objects of navigational queries,Louiqa Raschid; Yao Wu; Woei-Jyh Lee; María Esther Vidal; Panayiotis Tsaparas; Padmini Srinivasan; Aditya Kumar Sehgal,Abstract Web navigation plays an important role in exploring public interconnected datasources such as life science data. A navigational query in the life science graph produces aresult graph which is a layered directed acyclic graph (DAG). Traversing the result paths inthis graph reaches a target object set (TOS). The challenge for ranking the target objects isto provide recommendations that re ect the relative importance of the retrieved object; aswell as its relevance to the specific query posed by the scientist. We present a metric layeredgraph PageRank (lgPR) to rank target objects based on the link structure of the result graph.LgPR is a modification of PageRank; it avoids random jumps to respect the path structure ofthe result graph. We also outline a metric layered graph ObjectRank (lgOR) which extendsthe metric ObjectRank to layered graphs. We then present an initial evaluation of lgPR …,Proceedings of the 8th annual ACM international workshop on Web information and data management,2006,24
Using strong triadic closure to characterize ties in social networks,Stavros Sintos; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract In the past few years there has been an explosion of social networks in the onlineworld. Users flock these networks; creating profiles and linking themselves to otherindividuals. Connecting online has a small cost compared to the physical world; leading to aproliferation of connections; many of which carry little value or importance. Understandingthe strength and nature of these relationships is paramount to anyone interesting in makinguse of the online social network data. In this paper; we use the principle of Strong TriadicClosure to characterize the strength of relationships in social networks. The Strong TriadicClosure principle stipulates that it is not possible for two individuals to have a strongrelationship with a common friend and not know each other. We consider the problem oflabeling the ties of a social network as strong or weak so as to enforce the Strong Triadic …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,22
Aggregating time partitions,Taneli Mielikäinen; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Partitions of sequential data exist either per se or as a result of sequencesegmentation algorithms. It is often the case that the same timeline is partitioned in manydifferent ways. For example; different segmentation algorithms produce different partitions ofthe same underlying data points. In such cases; we are interested in producing anaggregate partition; ie; a segmentation that agrees as much as possible with the inputsegmentations. Each partition is defined as a set of continuous non-overlapping segments ofthe timeline. We show that this problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time usingdynamic programming. We also propose faster greedy heuristics that work well in practice.We experiment with our algorithms and we demonstrate their utility in clustering the behaviorof mobile-phone users and combining the results of different segmentation algorithms on …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,22
Models and algorithms for network immunization,George Giakkoupis; Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Recently; there has been significant research activity in the algorithmic analysis ofcomplex networks; such as social networks; or information networks. A problem of greatpractical importance is that of network immunization against virus spread. Given a network; avirus-propagation model; and an immunization cost function; we are interested in containingthe spread of the virus while minimizing the immunization cost. In this paper; we considertwo viruspropagation models and we propose immunization algorithms for each model. Theexperimental evaluation shows that our algorithms perform well on both synthetic and realgraphs. Furthermore; it reveals the following interesting facts (a) the simple heuristic ofimmunizing the nodes with the highest degree is not optimal; and (b) our algorithms performsignificantly better in small-world networks.,Technical Report; Technical Report C-2005-75,2005,22
Parameter-free spatial data mining using MDL,Spiros Papadimitriou; Aristides Gionis; Panayiotis Tsaparas; Risto A Vaisanen; Heikki Mannila; Christos Faloutsos,Consider spatial data consisting of a set of binary features taking values over a collection ofspatial extents (grid cells). We propose a method that simultaneously finds spatialcorrelation and feature co-occurrence patterns; without any parameters. In particular; weemploy the minimum description length (MDL) principle coupled with a natural way ofcompressing regions. This defines what" good" means: a feature co-occurrence pattern isgood; if it helps us better compress the set of locations for these features. Conversely; aspatial correlation is good; if it helps us better compress the set of features in thecorresponding region. Our approach is scalable for large datasets (both number of locationsand of features). We evaluate our method on both real and synthetic datasets.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,20

Selecting shortcuts for a smaller world,N Parotsidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The small world phenomenon is a desirable property of social networks; since itguarantees short paths between the nodes of the social graph and thus efficient informationspread on the network. It is thus in the benefit of both network users and network owners toenforce and maintain this property. In this work; we study the problem of finding a subset of kedges from a set of candidate edges whose addition to a network leads to the greatestreduction in its average shortest path length. We formulate the problem as a combinatorialoptimization problem; and show that it is NP-hard and that known approximation techniquesare not applicable. We describe an efficient method for computing the exact effect of a singleedge insertion on the average shortest path length; as well as several heuristics forefficiently estimating this effect.

TACI: Taxonomy-aware catalog integration,Panagiotis Papadimitriou; Panayiotis Tsaparas; Ariel Fuxman; Lise Getoor,A fundamental data integration task faced by online commercial portals and commercesearch engines is the integration of products coming from multiple providers to their productcatalogs. In this scenario; the commercial portal has its own taxonomy (the “mastertaxonomy”); while each data provider organizes its products into a different taxonomy (the“provider taxonomy”). In this paper; we consider the problem of categorizing products fromthe data providers into the master taxonomy; while making use of the provider taxonomyinformation. Our approach is based on a taxonomy-aware processing step that adjusts theresults of a text-based classifier to ensure that products that are close together in theprovider taxonomy remain close in the master taxonomy. We formulate this intuition as astructured prediction optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,15
Stability and similarity of link analysis ranking algorithms,Debora Donato; Stefano Leonardi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Recently; there has been a surge of research activity in the area of Link AnalysisRanking; where hyperlink structures are used to determine the relative authority of Webpages. One of the seminal works in this area is that of Kleinberg [15]; who proposed the Hitsalgorithm. In this paper; we undertake a theoretical analysis of the properties of the Hitsalgorithm on a broad class of random graphs. Working within the framework of Borodin etal.[7]; we prove that on this class (a) the Hits algorithm is stable with high probability; and (b)the Hits algorithm is similar to the InDegree heuristic that assigns to each node weightproportional to the number of incoming links. We demonstrate that our results go through forthe case that the expected in-degrees of the graph follow a power-law distribution; asituation observed in the actual Web graph [9]. We also study experimentally the similarity …,Internet Mathematics,2006,15

Foreach set of structured data tuples; a set of tokens may be determined from the terms of thequery by the computing device based on attribute values of attributes associated with thestructured data tuples in the set of structured data tuples. An annotated query may bedetermined from each of the sets of tokens. A probability score may be determined for eachof the determined annotated queries. The annotated query having the highest determinedprobability score may be selected; and one or more structured data tuples may be identifiedfrom the structured data tuples that have attributes with attribute values that match one ormore tokens of the selected annotated query.,*,2011,14
Determining query intent,*,A tree structure has a node associated with each category of a hierarchy of item categories.Child nodes of the tree are associated with sub-categories of the categories associated withparent nodes. Training data including received queries and indicators of a selected itemcategory for each received query is combined with the tree structure by associating eachquery with the node corresponding to the selected category of the query. When a query isreceived; a classifier is applied to the nodes to generate a probability that the query isintended to match an item of the category associated with the node. The classifier is applieduntil the probability is below a threshold. One or more categories associated with the nodesthat are closest to the intent of the received query are selected and indicators of items ofthose categories that match the received query are output.,*,2013,12

Source objects can be assigned to those classes with probabilitiesthat meet a desired threshold and meet a desired rate. A classification cost for target classescan be determined for respective unassigned source objects; which can comprisedetermining an assignment cost and separation cost for the source objects for respectivedesired target classes.

Centrality-aware link recommendations,Nikos Parotsidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Link recommendations are critical for both improving the utility and expediting thegrowth of social networks. Most previous approaches focus on suggesting links that arehighly likely to be adopted. In this paper; we add a different perspective to the problem byaiming at recommending links that also improve specific properties of the network. Inparticular; our goal is to recommend to users links that if adopted would improve theircentrality in the network. Specifically; we introduce the centrality-aware link recommendationproblem as the problem of recommending to a user u; k links from a pool of recommendedlinks so as to maximize the expected decrease of the sum of the shortest path distances of $u $ to all other nodes in the network. We show that the problem is NP-hard; but ouroptimization function is monotone and sub-modular which guarantees a constant …,Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2016,11
Review Synthesis for Micro-Review Summarization,Thanh-Son Nguyen; Hady W Lauw; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Micro-reviews is a new type of user-generated content arising from the prevalenceof mobile devices and social media in the past few years. Micro-reviews are bite-sizereviews (usually under 200 characters); commonly posted on social media or check-inservices; using a mobile device.

Using micro-reviews to select an efficient set of reviews,Thanh-Son Nguyen; Hady W Lauw; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Online reviews are an invaluable resource for web users trying to make decisionsregarding products or services. However; the abundance of review content; as well as theunstructured; lengthy; and verbose nature of reviews make it hard for users to locate theappropriate reviews; and distill the useful information. With the recent growth of socialnetworking and micro-blogging services; we observe the emergence of a new type of onlinereview content; consisting of bite-sized; 140 character-long reviews often posted reactivelyon the spot via mobile devices. These micro-reviews are short; concise; and focused; nicelycomplementing the lengthy; elaborate; and verbose nature of full-text reviews. We propose anovel methodology that brings together these two diverse types of review content; to obtainsomething that is more than the sum of its parts.

Recommending packages to groups,Shuyao Qi; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massive research effortin both industry and academia. Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggestpackages of items to single users; or single items to groups of users. However; to the best ofour knowledge; the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users(P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications;such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups; entertainment packages togroups of friends; or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper; we formulate theP2G problem; and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a grouptowards a package; incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability.

How people describe themselves on Twitter,Konstantinos Semertzidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Twitter; being both a micro-blogging service and a social network; has become oneof the primary means of communicating and disseminating information online. As such;significant amount of research has been devoted to analyzing the Twitter graph; the tweets;and the behavior of its users. In this work; we undertake a study of the user profile bios onTwitter. The goal of our study is two-fold: first; to understand what Twitter users choose toexpose about themselves in their profile bio; and second; to investigate if it is possible toexploit the information in the user bio for tasks such as predicting connections betweenTwitter users.,Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Databases and Social Networks,2013,9
Rating computation on social networks,*,A social network may be used to determine a rating of a user with no prior history. Theratings for unrated nodes may be inferred from the existing ratings of users associated withthe unrated node in either or both the underlying social network or other social networks.Additionally in some implementations; the effect of the rating of a rated node to an unratednode diminishes as the strength of their relationships decreases. In some cases; a socialnetwork may be modeled as an electrical network; and ratings may be modeled as voltageson the nodes of the social network; relationships in the social network may be modeled asconnections in the electrical network; and in some cases the strength of relationships maybe modeled as conductance of the connections. Ratings for nodes may be determined usingKirchhoff's Law and in some cases by solving a set of linear equations or by propagating …,*,2009,9
Review selection using micro-reviews,Thanh-Son Nguyen; Hady W Lauw; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Given the proliferation of review content; and the fact that reviews are highly diverse andoften unnecessarily verbose; users frequently face the problem of selecting the appropriatereviews to consume. Micro-reviews are emerging as a new type of online review content inthe social media. Micro-reviews are posted by users of check-in services such asFoursquare. They are concise (up to 200 characters long) and highly focused; in contrast tothe comprehensive and verbose reviews. In this paper; we propose a novel mining problem;which brings together these two disparate sources of review content. Specifically; we usecoverage of micro-reviews as an objective for selecting a set of reviews that cover efficientlythe salient aspects of an entity. Our approach consists of a two-step process: matchingreview sentences to micro-reviews; and selecting a small set of reviews that cover as …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,8
Fairness in package-to-group recommendations,Dimitris Serbos; Shuyao Qi; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Recommending packages of items to groups of users has several applications;including recommending vacation packages to groups of tourists; entertainment packages togroups of friends; or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper; we focus on a novelaspect of package-to-group recommendations; that of fairness. Specifically; when werecommend a package to a group of people; we ask that this recommendation is fair in thesense that every group member is satisfied by a sufficient number of items in the package.We explore two definitions of fairness and show that for either definition the problem offinding the most fair package is NP-hard. We exploit the fact that our problem can bemodeled as a coverage problem; and we propose greedy algorithms that find approximatesolutions within reasonable time. In addition; we study two extensions of the problem …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,6
Facet determination using query logs,*,Previously received queries from a search log are analyzed to determine a category ofstructured data associated with each query. For example; the categories may correspond toconsumer product categories such as televisions; digital cameras; etc. For each category;the terms of the queries associated with the category are correlated with the attributes andattribute values of the structured data tuples associated with the category. The attributes maybe ranked based on the correlation. When a subsequent query is received; the category ofthe query is determined and the ranked attributes associated with the category are used toselect facets that are displayed to the user along with the search results.,*,2012,6
Mining chains of relations,Foto Aftrati; Gautam Das; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Taneli Mielikäinen; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Traditional data mining methods consider the problem of mining a single relationthat relates two different attributes. For example; in a scientific bibliography database;authors are related to papers; and we may be interested in discovering association rulesbetween authors based on the papers that they have co-authored. However; in real life it isoften the case that we have multiple attributes related through chains of relations. Forexample; authors write papers; and papers belong to one or more topics; defining a three-level chain of relations. In this paper we consider the problem of mining such relationalchains. We formulate a generic problem of finding selector sets (subsets of objects from oneof the attributes) such that the projected dataset—the part of the dataset determined by theselector set—satisfies a specific property.

Diffusion maximization in evolving social networks,Nathalie TH Gayraud; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Diffusion in social networks has been studied extensively in the past few years.Most previous work assumes that the underlying network is a static object that remainsunchanged as the diffusion process progresses. However; there are several real-lifenetworks that change dynamically over time. In this paper; we study diffusion on suchevolving networks and extend the popular Independent Cascade and Linear Thresholdmodels to account for network evolution. In particular; we introduce two natural variations; apersistent and a transient one; to capture diffusions of different types. We consider theproblem of influence maximization where the goal is to select a few influential nodes toinitiate a diffusion with maximum spread. We show that; surprisingly; when consideringevolving networks the diffusion function is no longer submodular for the transient models …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM on Conference on Online Social Networks,2015,5
Determining preferences from user queries,*,A query may be received at a computing device through a network. One or more attributevalues that are preferences for a subset of the one or more terms of the query may beidentified by the computing device. One or more products or services having associatedattributes that have values that match a subset of the identified attribute values may beidentified by the computing device; and a subset of the identified products or services maybe presented by the computing device through the network. Implementations may alsoidentify latent preferences; that is; preferences that are found for a query even where such apreference is not explicitly part of a term or token of the query.,*,2013,5
Deep sequencing reveals new aspects of progesterone receptor signaling in breast cancer cells,Anastasia Kougioumtzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas; Angeliki Magklara,Despite the pleiotropic effects of the progesterone receptor in breast cancer; the molecularmechanisms in play remain largely unknown. To gain a global view of the PR-orchestratednetworks; we used next-generation sequencing to determine the progestin-regulatedtranscriptome in T47D breast cancer cells. We identify a large number of PR target genesinvolved in critical cellular programs; such as regulation of transcription; apoptosis; cellmotion and angiogenesis. Integration of the transcriptomic data with the PR-binding profilingof hormonally treated cells identifies numerous components of the small-GTPases signalingpathways as direct PR targets.

On Assigning Implicit Reputation Scores in an Online Labor Marketplace.,Maria Daltayanni; Luca De Alfaro; Panagiotis Papadimitriou; Panayiotis Tsaparas,ABSTRACT In online labor marketplaces employers post job openings and receiveapplications by workers interested in them. The employers decide which applicant to hireand then they work with the selected worker to accomplish the job requirements. At the endof the contract; an employer can provide his worker with some rating that becomes visible inthe online worker profile and can guide future hiring decisions of other employers. In thispaper; we discuss some of the shortcomings of the existing reputation system and wepropose a new reputation mechanism that combines employer implicit feedback signals in alink-analysis-based approach. The new system addresses the shortcomings of the existingone while yielding similar or better signal for the worker quality.,EDBT,2014,4
Measuring and moderating opinion polarization in social networks,Antonis Matakos; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The polarization of society over controversial social issues has been the subject ofstudy in social sciences for decades (Isenberg in J Personal Soc Psychol 50 (6): 1141–1151; 1986; Sunstein in J Polit Philos 10 (2): 175–195; 2002). The widespread usage ofonline social networks and social media; and the tendency of people to connect and interactwith like-minded individuals has only intensified the phenomenon of polarization (Bakshy etal. in Science 348 (6239): 1130–1132; 2015). In this paper; we consider the problem ofmeasuring and reducing polarization of opinions in a social network. Using a standardopinion formation model (Friedkin and Johnsen in J Math Soc 15 (3–4): 193–206; 1990); wedefine the polarization index; which; given a network and the opinions of the individuals inthe network; it quantifies the polarization observed in the network.

Troll vulnerability in online social networks,Paraskevas Tsantarliotis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Trolling describes a range of antisocial online behaviors that aim at disrupting the normaloperation of online social networks and media. Combating trolling is an important problem inthe online world. Existing approaches rely on human-based or automatic mechanisms foridentifying trolls and troll posts. In this paper we take a novel approach to the trollingproblem: our goal is to identify the targets of the trolls; so as to prevent trolling before ithappens. We thus define the troll vulnerability prediction problem; where given a post weaim at predicting whether it is vulnerable to trolling. Towards this end; we define a novel trollvulnerability metric of how likely a post is to be attacked by trolls; and we construct modelsfor predicting troll-vulnerable posts; using features from the content and the history of thepost.

Identifying Converging Pairs of Nodes on a Budget.,Konstantina Lazaridou; Konstantinos Semertzidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,ABSTRACT In this paper; we consider large graphs that evolve over time; such as graphsthat model social networks. Given two instances of the graph at two points in time; we ask toidentify the top pairs of nodes whose shortest path distance has decreased the most. We callthese pairs converging. The straightforward way to address this problem is by computing theshortest path distances of all pairs at both instances and keeping the ones with the largestdifferences. Since for large networks this is computationally infeasible; we consider abudgeted version of the problem; where given a fixed budget of single-source shortest pathcomputations; we seek to identify nodes that participate in as many converging pairs aspossible. We evaluate a number of different approaches for our problem; that employcentrality-based; dispersion-based; and landmark-based distance estimation metrics. We …,EDBT,2015,3
Estimating the relative utility of networks for predicting user activities,Nina Mishra; Daniel M Romero; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Link structure in online networks carries varying semantics.

In this paper; weintroduce a new related problem: given a collection of networks; how can we determine therelative importance of each network for predicting user activities? We propose a frameworkthat allows us to quantify the relative predictive value of each network in a setting wheremultiple networks are available. We give an ɛ-net algorithm to solve the problem and provethat it finds a solution that is arbitrarily close to the optimal solution.

Enabling direct interest-aware audience selection,Ariel Fuxman; Anitha Kannan; Zhenhui Li; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Advertisers typically have a fairly accurate idea of the interests of their targetaudience. However; today's online advertising systems are unable to leverage thisinformation. The reasons are two-fold. First; there is no agreed upon vocabulary of interestsfor advertisers and advertising systems to communicate. More importantly; advertisingsystems lack a mechanism for mapping users to the interest vocabulary. In this paper; wetackle both problems. We present a system for direct interest-aware audience selection. Thissystem takes the query histories of search engine users as input; extracts their interests; anddescribes them with interpretable labels. The labels are not drawn from a predefinedtaxonomy; but rather dynamically generated from the query histories; and are thus easy forthe advertisers to interpret and use for targeting users. In addition; the system enables …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,3

Stability of open multiclass networks in adversarial queueing theory,Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Queueing networks are important models of complex systems; such as packetrouting networks; manufacturing systems; and time shared computer systems. In this paper;we investigate the question of stability of multiclass queueing networks within theadversarial queueing theory model; where workload is induced by an adversary. Prior workin the adversarial model considers only a special case of queueing networks; where allcustomers require unit service times. We extend this model to include more generalqueueing networks; where the customers may require di erent service times at di erentservers of the network. We prove that; unlike the previous model; in the generalized model;the unidirectional ring topology is no longer universally stable (stable against alladversaries). Nevertheless; the queueing policies proven to be universally stable for the …,*,2000,1

Micro-review synthesis for multi-entity summarization,Thanh-Son Nguyen; Hady W Lauw; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Location-based social networks (LBSNs); exemplified by Foursquare; are fastgaining popularity. One important feature of LBSNs is micro-review. Upon check-in at aparticular venue; a user may leave a short review (up to 200 characters long); also known asa tip. These tips are an important source of information for others to know more aboutvarious aspects of an entity (eg; restaurant); such as food; waiting time; or service. However;a user is often interested not in one particular entity; but rather in several entities collectively;for instance within a neighborhood or a category. In this paper; we address the problem ofsummarizing the tips of multiple entities in a collection; by way of synthesizing new micro-reviews that pertain to the collection; rather than to the individual entities per se.

Sentiment-Based Topic Suggestion for Micro-Reviews.,Ziyu Lu; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Location-based social sites; such as Foursquare or Yelp; are gaining increasingpopularity. These sites allow users to check in at venues and leave a short commentary inthe form of a micro-review. Micro-reviews are rich in content as they offer a distilled andconcise account of user experience. In this paper we consider the problem of predicting thetopic of a micro-review by a user who visits a new venue. Such a prediction can help usersmake informed decisions; and also help venue owners personalize users' experiences.However; topic modeling for micro-reviews is particularly difficult; due to their short andfragmented nature. We address this issue using pooling strategies; which aggregate micro-reviews at the venue or user level; and we propose novel probabilistic models based onLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for extracting the topics related to a user-venue pair.
