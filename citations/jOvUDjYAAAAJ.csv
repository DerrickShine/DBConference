Query processing in spatial network databases,Dimitris Papadias; Jun Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,Abstract Despite the importance of spatial networks in real-life applications; most of thespatial database literature focuses on Euclidean spaces. In this paper we propose anarchitecture that integrates network and Euclidean information; capturing pragmaticconstraints. Based on this architecture; we develop a Euclidean restriction and a networkexpansion framework that take advantage of location and connectivity to efficiently prune thesearch space. These frameworks are successfully applied to the most popular spatialqueries; namely nearest neighbors; range search; closest pairs and e-distance joins; in thecontext of spatial network databases.,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,772
Secure knn computation on encrypted databases,Wai Kit Wong; David Wai-lok Cheung; Ben Kao; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Service providers like Google and Amazon are moving into the SaaS (Software as aService) business. They turn their huge infrastructure into a cloud-computing environmentand aggressively recruit businesses to run applications on their platforms. To enforcesecurity and privacy on such a service model; we need to protect the data running on theplatform. Unfortunately; traditional encryption methods that aim at providing" unbreakable"protection are often not adequate because they do not support the execution of applicationssuch as database queries on the encrypted data. In this paper we discuss the generalproblem of secure computation on an encrypted database and propose a SCONEDB SecureComputation ON an Encrypted DataBase) model; which captures the execution and securityrequirements. As a case study; we focus on the problem of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,464
On discovering moving clusters in spatio-temporal data,Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Spiridon Bakiras,Abstract A moving cluster is defined by a set of objects that move close to each other for along time interval. Real-life examples are a group of migrating animals; a convoy of carsmoving in a city; etc. We study the discovery of moving clusters in a database of objecttrajectories. The difference of this problem compared to clustering trajectories and miningmovement patterns is that the identity of a moving cluster remains unchanged while itslocation and content may change over time. For example; while a group of animals aremigrating; some animals may leave the group or new animals may enter it. We provide aformal definition for moving clusters and describe three algorithms for their automaticdiscovery:(i) a straight-forward method based on the definition;(ii) a more efficient methodwhich avoids redundant checks and (iii) an approximate algorithm which trades accuracy …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,412
Mining; indexing; and querying historical spatiotemporal data,Nikos Mamoulis; Huiping Cao; George Kollios; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Yufei Tao; David W Cheung,Abstract In many applications that track and analyze spatiotemporal data; movements obeyperiodic patterns; the objects follow the same routes (approximately) over regular timeintervals. For example; people wake up at the same time and follow more or less the sameroute to their work everyday. The discovery of hidden periodic patterns in spatiotemporaldata; apart from unveiling important information to the data analyst; can facilitate datamanagement substantially. Based on this observation; we propose a framework thatanalyzes; manages; and queries object movements that follow such patterns. We define thespatiotemporal periodic pattern mining problem and propose an effective and fast miningalgorithm for retrieving maximal periodic patterns. We also devise a novel; specialized indexstructure that can benefit from the discovered patterns to support more efficient execution …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,318
Mining frequent spatio-temporal sequential patterns,Huiping Cao; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Many applications track the movement of mobile objects; which can be represented assequences of timestamped locations. Given such a spatiotemporal series; we study theproblem of discovering sequential patterns; which are routes frequently followed by theobject. Sequential pattern mining algorithms for transaction data are not directly applicablefor this setting. The challenges to address are:(i) the fuzziness of locations in patterns; and(ii) the identification of non-explicit pattern instances. In this paper; we define patternelements as spatial regions around frequent line segments. Our method first transforms theoriginal sequence into a list of sequence segments; and detects frequent regions in aheuristic way. Then; we propose algorithms to find patterns by employing a newly proposedsubstring tree structure and improving a priori technique.

Continuous nearest neighbor monitoring in road networks,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Man Lung Yiu; Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Recent research has focused on continuous monitoring of nearest neighbors (NN)in highly dynamic scenarios; where the queries and the data objects move frequently andarbitrarily. All existing methods; however; assume the Euclidean distance metric. In thispaper we study k-NN monitoring in road networks; where the distance between a query anda data object is determined by the length of the shortest path connecting them. We proposetwo methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns; as well asfluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing onlyupdates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the sharedexecution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular; it groups together thequeries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network; and …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,289
An efficient and scalable algorithm for clustering XML documents by structure,Wang Lian; Nikos Mamoulis; Siu-Ming Yiu,With the standardization of XML as an information exchange language over the Internet; ahuge amount of information is formatted in XML documents. In order to analyze thisinformation efficiently; decomposing the XML documents and storing them in relationaltables is a popular practice. However; query processing becomes expensive since; in manycases; an excessive number of joins is required to recover information from the fragmenteddata. If a collection consists of documents with different structures (for example; they comefrom different DTDs); mining clusters in the documents could alleviate the fragmentationproblem. We propose a hierarchical algorithm (S-GRACE) for clustering XML documentsbased on structural information in the data. The notion of structure graph (s-graph) isproposed; supporting a computationally efficient distance metric defined between …,IEEE transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,270
Fast data anonymization with low information loss,Gabriel Ghinita; Panagiotis Karras; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Recent research studied the problem of publishing microdata without revealingsensitive information; leading to the privacy preserving paradigms of k-anonymity and l-diversity. k-anonymity protects against the identification of an individual's record. l-diversity;in addition; safeguards against the association of an individual with specific sensitiveinformation. However; existing approaches suffer from at least one of the followingdrawbacks:(i) The information loss metrics are counter-intuitive and fail to capture datainaccuracies inflicted for the sake of privacy.(ii) l-diversity is solved by techniques developedfor the simpler k-anonymity problem; which introduces unnecessary inaccuracies.(iii) Theanonymization process is inefficient in terms of computation and I/O cost. In this paper wepropose a framework for efficient privacy preservation that addresses these deficiencies …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,269
Privacy-preserving anonymization of set-valued data,Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis; Panos Kalnis,Abstract In this paper we study the problem of protecting privacy in the publication of set-valued data. Consider a collection of transactional data that contains detailed informationabout items bought together by individuals. Even after removing all personal characteristicsof the buyer; which can serve as links to his identity; the publication of such data is stillsubject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about the set. Unlikemost previous works; we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive; but weconsider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data; depending onthe point of view of the adversary. We define a new version of the k-anonymity guarantee;the k m-anonymity; to limit the effects of the data dimensionality and we propose efficientalgorithms to transform the database.

Privacy preservation in the publication of trajectories,Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis,We study the problem of protecting privacy in the publication of location sequences.Consider a database of trajectories; corresponding to movements of people; captured bytheir transactions when they use credit or RFID debit cards. We show that; if such trajectoriesare published exactly (by only hiding the identities of persons that followed them); there is ahigh risk of privacy breach by adversaries who hold partial information about them (eg; shopowners). In particular; we show that one can use partial trajectory knowledge as a quasi-identifier for the remaining locations in the sequence. We device a data suppressiontechnique; which prevents this type of breach; while keeping the posted data as accurate aspossible.,Mobile Data Management; 2008.

Aggregate nearest neighbor queries in road networks,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Aggregate nearest neighbor queries return the object that minimizes an aggregate distancefunction with respect to a set of query points. Consider; for example; several users at specificlocations (query points) that want to find the restaurant (data point); which leads to theminimum sum of distances that they have to travel in order to meet. We study the processingof such queries for the case where the position and accessibility of spatial objects areconstrained by spatial (eg; road) networks. We consider alternative aggregate functions andtechniques that utilize Euclidean distance bounds; spatial access methods; and/or networkdistance materialization structures. Our algorithms are experimentally evaluated withsynthetic and real data. The results show that their relative performance depends on theproblem characteristics.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,213
Efficient processing of top-k dominating queries on multi-dimensional data,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract The top-k dominating query returns k data objects which dominate the highestnumber of objects in a dataset. This query is an important tool for decision support since itprovides data analysts an intuitive way for finding significant objects. In addition; it combinesthe advantages of top-k and skyline queries without sharing their disadvantages:(i) theoutput size can be controlled;(ii) no ranking functions need to be specified by users; and (iii)the result is independent of the scales at different dimensions. Despite their importance; top-k dominating queries have not received adequate attention from the research community. Inthis paper; we design specialized algorithms that apply on indexed multi-dimensional dataand fully exploit the characteristics of the problem. Experiments on synthetic datasetsdemonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform a previous skyline-based …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,165
Reverse nearest neighbors in large graphs,Man Lung Yiu; Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,A reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query returns the data objects that have a query point astheir nearest neighbor (NN). Although such queries have been studied quite extensively inEuclidean spaces; there is no previous work in the context of large graphs. In this paper; weprovide a fundamental lemma; which can be used to prune the search space whiletraversing the graph in search for RNN. Based on it; we develop two RNN methods; aneager algorithm that attempts to prune network nodes as soon as they are visited and a lazytechnique that prunes the search space when a data point is discovered. We study retrievalof an arbitrary number k of reverse nearest neighbors; investigate the benefits ofmaterialization; cover several query types; and deal with cases where the queries and thedata objects reside on nodes or edges of the graph. The proposed techniques are …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,157
Location recommendation in location-based social networks using user check-in data,Hao Wang; Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract This paper studies the problem of recommending new venues to users whoparticipate in location-based social networks (LBSNs). As an increasingly larger number ofusers partake in LBSNs; the recommendation problem in this setting has attracted significantattention in research and in practical applications. The detailed information about past userbehavior that is traced by the LBSN differentiates the problem significantly from its traditionalsettings. The spatial nature in the past user behavior and also the information about the usersocial interaction with other users; provide a richer background to build a more accurate andexpressive recommendation model. Although there have been extensive studies onrecommender systems working with user-item ratings; GPS trajectories; and other types ofdata; there are very few approaches that exploit the unique properties of the LBSN user …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2013,142
The Bdual-Tree: indexing moving objects by space filling curves in the dual space,Man Lung Yiu; Yufei Tao; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Existing spatiotemporal indexes suffer from either large update cost or poor queryperformance; except for the B x-tree (the state-of-the-art); which consists of multiple B+-treesindexing the 1D values transformed from the (multi-dimensional) moving objects based on aspace filling curve (Hilbert; in particular). This curve; however; does not consider objectvelocities; and as a result; query processing with a B x-tree retrieves a large number of falsehits; which seriously compromises its efficiency. It is natural to wonder" can we obtain betterperformance by capturing also the velocity information; using a Hilbert curve of a higherdimensionality?". This paper provides a positive answer by developing the B dual-tree; anovel spatiotemporal access method leveraging pure relational methodology. We show; withtheoretical evidence; that the B dual-tree indeed outperforms the B x-tree in most circum …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,139
Fast mining of spatial collocations,Xin Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung; Yutao Shou,Abstract Spatial collocation patterns associate the co-existence of non-spatial features in aspatial neighborhood. An example of such a pattern can associate contaminated waterreservoirs with certain deceases in their spatial neighborhood. Previous work on discoveringcollocation patterns converts neighborhoods of feature instances to itemsets and appliesmining techniques for transactional data to discover the patterns. We propose a method thatcombines the discovery of spatial neighborhoods with the mining process. Our technique isan extension of a spatial join algorithm that operates on multiple inputs and counts longpattern instances. As demonstrated by experimentation; it yields significant performanceimprovements compared to previous approaches.,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,137
Clustering objects on a spatial network,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Clustering is one of the most important analysis tasks in spatial databases. Westudy the problem of clustering objects; which lie on edges of a large weighted spatialnetwork. The distance between two objects is defined by their shortest path distance overthe network. Past algorithms are based on the Euclidean distance and cannot be applied forthis setting. We propose variants of partitioning; density-based; and hierarchical methods.Their effectiveness and efficiency is evaluated for collections of objects which appear on realroad networks. The results show that our methods can correctly identify clusters and they arescalable for large problems.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,137
Reverse nearest neighbor search in metric spaces,Yufei Tao; Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,Given a set D of objects; a reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query returns the objects o in Dsuch that o is closer to a query object q than to any other object in D; according to a certainsimilarity metric. The existing RNN solutions are not sufficient because they either 1) rely onprecomputed information that is expensive to maintain in the presence of updates or 2) areapplicable only when the data consists of" Euclidean objects" and similarity is measuredusing the L 2 norm. In this paper; we present the first algorithms for efficient RNN search ingeneric metric spaces. Our techniques require no detailed representations of objects; andcan be applied as long as their mutual distances can be computed and the distance metricsatisfies the triangle inequality. We confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods withextensive experiments,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,132
Discovery of periodic patterns in spatiotemporal sequences,Huiping Cao; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,In many applications that track and analyze spatiotemporal data; movements obey periodicpatterns; the objects follow the same routes (approximately) over regular time intervals. Forexample; people wake up at the same time and follow more or less the same route to theirwork everyday. The discovery of hidden periodic patterns in spatiotemporal data couldunveil important information to the data analyst. Existing approaches for discovering periodicpatterns focus on symbol sequences. However; these methods cannot directly be applied toa spatiotemporal sequence because of the fuzziness of spatial locations in the sequence. Inthis paper; we define the problem of mining periodic patterns in spatiotemporal data andpropose an effective and efficient algorithm for retrieving maximal periodic patterns. Inaddition; we study two interesting variants of the problem. The first is the retrieval of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,131
Scalable skyline computation using object-based space partitioning,Shiming Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Abstract The skyline operator returns from a set of multi-dimensional objects a subset ofsuperior objects that are not dominated by others. This operation is considered veryimportant in multi-objective analysis of large datasets. Although a large number of skylinemethods have been proposed; the majority of them focuses on minimizing the I/O cost.However; in high dimensional spaces; the problem can easily become CPU-bound due tothe large number of computations required for comparing objects with current skyline pointswhile scanning the database. Based on this observation; we propose a dynamic indexingtechnique for skyline points that can be integrated into state-of-the-art sort-based skylinealgorithms to boost their computational performance. The new indexing and dominancechecking approach is supported by a theoretical analysis; while our experiments show …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,119
An efficient cost model for optimization of nearest neighbor search in low and medium dimensional spaces,Yufei Tao; Jun Zhang; Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis,Existing models for nearest neighbor search in multidimensional spaces are not appropriatefor query optimization because they either lead to erroneous estimation or involve complexequations that are expensive to evaluate in real-time. This article proposes an alternativemethod that captures the performance of nearest neighbor queries using approximation. Foruniform data; our model involves closed formulae that are very efficient to compute andaccurate for up to 10 dimensions. Further; the proposed equations can be applied onnonuniform data with the aid of histograms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the modelby using it to solve several optimization problems related to nearest neighbor search.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,117
All-nearest-neighbors queries in spatial databases,Jun Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao,Given two sets A and B of multidimensional objects; the all-nearest-neighbors (ANN) queryretrieves for each object in A its nearest neighbor in B. Although this operation is common inseveral applications; it has not received much attention in the database literature. In thispaper we study alternative methods for processing ANN queries depending on whether Aand B are indexed: Our algorithms are evaluated through extensive experimentation usingsynthetic and real datasets. The performance studies show that they are an order ofmagnitude faster than a previous approach based on closest-pairs query processing.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004.

Processing and optimization of multiway spatial joins using R-trees,Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Yannis Theodoridis,ABSTRACT One of the most important types of query processing in spatial databases andgeographic information systems is the spatial join; an operation that selects; from tworelations; all object pairs satisfying some spatial predicate. A multiway join combines dataoriginated from more than two relations. Although several techniques have been proposedfor pairwise spatial joins; only limited work has focused on multiway spatial join processing.This paper solves multiway spatial joins by applying systematic search algorithms thatexploit R-trees to efficiently guide search; without building temporary indexes ormaterializing intermediate results. In addition to general methodologies; we propose costmodels and an optimization algorithm; and evaluate them through extensiveexperimentation.,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,115
Security in outsourcing of association rule mining,Wai Kit Wong; David W Cheung; Edward Hung; Ben Kao; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Outsourcing association rule mining to an outside service provider brings severalimportant benefits to the data owner. These include (i) relief from the high mining cost;(ii)minimization of demands in resources; and (iii) effective centralized mining for multipledistributed owners. On the other hand; security is an issue; the service provider should beprevented from accessing the actual data since (i) the data may be associated with privateinformation;(ii) the frequency analysis is meant to be used solely by the owner. This paperproposes substitution cipher techniques in the encryption of transactional data foroutsourcing association rule mining. After identifying the non-trivial threats to astraightforward one-to-one item mapping substitution cipher; we propose a more secureencryption scheme based on a one-to-n item mapping that transforms transactions non …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,113
Efficient top-k aggregation of ranked inputs,Nikos Mamoulis; Man Lung Yiu; Kit Hung Cheng; David W Cheung,Abstract A top-k query combines different rankings of the same set of objects and returns thek objects with the highest combined score according to an aggregate function. We bring tolight some key observations; which impose two phases that any top-k algorithm; based onsorted accesses; should go through. Based on them; we propose a new algorithm; which isdesigned to minimize the number of object accesses; the computational cost; and thememory requirements of top-k search with monotone aggregate functions. We provide ananalysis for its cost and show that it is always no worse than the baseline “no randomaccesses” algorithm in terms of computations; accesses; and memory required. As a sidecontribution; we perform a space analysis; which indicates the memory requirements of top-kalgorithms that only perform sorted accesses. For the case; where the required space …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,109
Top-k spatial preference queries,Man Lung Yiu; Xiangyuan Dai; Nikos Mamoulis; Michail Vaitis,A spatial preference query ranks objects based on the qualities of features in their spatialneighborhood. For example; consider a real estate agency office that holds a database withavailable flats for lease. A customer may want to rank the flats with respect to theappropriateness of their location; defined after aggregating the qualities of other features(eg; restaurants; cafes; hospital; market; etc.) within a distance range from them. In thispaper; we formally define spatial preference queries and propose appropriate indexingtechniques and search algorithms for them.

View selection using randomized search,Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract An important issue in data warehouse development is the selection of a set of viewsto materialize in order to accelerate On-line analytical processing queries; given certainspace and maintenance time constraints. Existing methods provide good results but theirhigh execution cost limits their applicability for large problems. In this paper; we explore theapplication of randomized; local search algorithms to the view selection problem. Theefficiency of the proposed techniques is evaluated using synthetic datasets; which cover awide range of data and query distributions. The results show that randomized searchmethods provide near-optimal solutions in limited time; being robust to data and query skew.Furthermore; they can be easily adapted for various versions of the problem; including thesimultaneous existence of size and time constraints; and view selection in dynamic …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2002,106
Evaluation of iceberg distance joins,Yutao Shou; Nikos Mamoulis; Huiping Cao; Dimitris Papadias; David W Cheung,Abstract The iceberg distance join returns object pairs within some distance from each other;provided that the first object appears at least a number of times in the result; eg;“find hotelswhich are within 1km to at least 10 restaurants”. The output of this query is the subset of thecorresponding distance join (eg;“find hotels which are within 1km to some restaurant”) thatsatisfies the additional cardinality constraint. Therefore; it could be processed by using aconventional spatial join algorithm and then filtering-out the non-qualifying pairs. Thisapproach; however; is expensive; especially when the cardinality constraint is highlyselective. In this paper; we propose output-sensitive algorithms that prune the search spaceby integrating the cardinality with the distance constraint. We deal with cases of indexed/non-indexed datasets and evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques with …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,105
Probabilistic spatial queries on existentially uncertain data,Xiangyuan Dai; Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao; Michail Vaitis,Abstract We study the problem of answering spatial queries in databases where objectsexist with some uncertainty and they are associated with an existential probability. The goalof a thresholding probabilistic spatial query is to retrieve the objects that qualify the spatialpredicates with probability that exceeds a threshold. Accordingly; a ranking probabilisticspatial query selects the objects with the highest probabilities to qualify the spatialpredicates. We propose adaptations of spatial access methods and search algorithms forprobabilistic versions of range queries and nearest neighbors and conduct an extensiveexperimental study; which evaluates the effectiveness of proposed solutions.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,104
Efficient k-NN search on vertically decomposed data,Arjen P de Vries; Nikos Mamoulis; Niels Nes; Martin Kersten,Abstract Applications like multimedia retrieval require efficient support for similarity searchon large data collections. Yet; nearest neighbor search is a difficult problem in highdimensional spaces; rendering efficient applications hard to realize: index structuresdegrade rapidly with increasing dimensionality; while sequential search is not an attractivesolution for repositories with millions of objects. This paper approaches the problem from adifferent angle. A solution is sought in an unconventional storage scheme; that opens up anew range of techniques for processing k-NN queries; especially suited for high dimensionalspaces. The suggested (physical) database design accommodates well a novel variant ofbranch-and-bound search; that reduces the high dimensional space quickly to a smallcandidate set. The paper provides insight in applying this idea to k-NN search using two …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,102
Multiway spatial joins,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Due to the evolution of Geographical Information Systems; large collections ofspatial data having various thematic contents are currently available. As a result; the interestof users is not limited to simple spatial selections and joins; but complex query types thatimplicate numerous spatial inputs become more common. Although several algorithms havebeen proposed for computing the result of pairwise spatial joins; limited work exists onprocessing and optimization of multiway spatial joins. In this article; we review pairwisespatial join algorithms and show how they can be combined for multiple inputs. In addition;we explore the application of synchronous traversal (ST); a methodology that processessynchronously all inputs without producing intermediate results.

RPJ: Producing fast join results on streams through rate-based optimization,Yufei Tao; Man Lung Yiu; Dimitris Papadias; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract We consider the problem of" progressively" joining relations whose records arecontinuously retrieved from remote sources through an unstable network that may incurtemporary failures. The objectives are to (i) start reporting the first output tuples as soon aspossible (before the participating relations are completely received); and (ii) produce theremaining results at a fast rate. We develop a new algorithm RPJ (< u> R</u> ate-based< u>P</u> rogressive< u> J</u> oin) based on solid theoretical analysis. RPJ maximizes theoutput rate by optimizing its execution according to the characteristics of the join relations(eg; data distribution; tuple arrival pattern; etc.). Extensive experiments prove that ourtechnique delivers results significantly faster than the previous methods.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,96
Algorithms for querying by spatial structure,Dimitrios Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; B Delis,Structural queries constitute a special form of content-based retrieval where the userspecifies a set of spatial constraints among query variables and asks for all configurations ofactual objects that (totally or partially) match these constraints. Processing such queries canbe thought of as a general form of spatial joins; ie; instead of pairs; the result consists of n-tuples of objects; where n is the number of query variables. In this paper we describe aflexible framework which permits the representation of configurations in different resolutionlevels and supports the automatic derivation of similarity measures. We subsequentlypropose three algorithms for structural query processing which integrate constraintsatisfaction with spatial indexing (R-trees). For each algorithm we apply several optimizationtechniques and experimentally evaluate performance using real data.,Proceedings of Very Large Data Bases Conference (VLDB); New York,1998,93
Efficient processing of joins on set-valued attributes,Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Object-oriented and object-relational DBMS support set valued attributes; which area natural and concise way to model complex information. However; there has been limitedresearch to-date on the evaluation of query operators that apply on sets. In this paper westudy the join of two relations on their set-valued attributes. Various join types areconsidered; namely the set containment; set equality; and set overlap joins. We show thatthe inverted file; a powerful index for selection queries; can also facilitate the efficientevaluation of most join predicates. We propose join algorithms that utilize inverted files andcompare them with signature-based methods for several set-comparison predicates.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,92
Integration of spatial join algorithms for processing multiple inputs,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Several techniques that compute the join between two spatial datasets have beenproposed during the last decade. Among these methods; some consider existing indices forthe joined inputs; while others treat datasets with no index; providing solutions for the casewhere at least one input comes as an intermediate result of another database operator. Inthis paper we analyze previous work on spatial joins and propose a novel algorithm; calledslot index spatial join (SISJ); that efficiently computes the spatial join between two inputs;only one of which is indexed by an R-tree. Going one step further; we show how SISJ andother spatial join algorithms can be implemented as operators in a database environmentthat joins more than two spatial datasets. We study the differences between relational andspatial multiway joins; and propose a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,91
Iterative projected clustering by subspace mining,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,Irrelevant attributes add noise to high-dimensional clusters and render traditional clusteringtechniques inappropriate. Recently; several algorithms that discover projected clusters andtheir associated subspaces have been proposed. We realize the analogy between miningfrequent itemsets and discovering dense projected clusters around random points. Based onthis; we propose a technique that improves the efficiency of a projected clustering algorithm(DOC). Our method is an optimized adaptation of the frequent pattern tree growth methodused for mining frequent itemsets. We propose several techniques that employ the branchand bound paradigm to efficiently discover the projected clusters. An experimental studywith synthetic and real data demonstrates that our technique significantly improves on theaccuracy and speed of previous techniques.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,84
Local and global recoding methods for anonymizing set-valued data,Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis; Panos Kalnis,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of protecting privacy in the publication of set-valued data.

Even after removing all personalcharacteristics of the buyer; which can serve as links to his identity; the publication of suchdata is still subject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about theset. Unlike most previous works; we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive;but we consider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data;depending on the knowledge of the adversary.

One-pass wavelet synopses for maximum-error metrics,Panagiotis Karras; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract We study the problem of computing wavelet-based synopses for massive data setsin static and streaming environments. A compact representation of a data set is obtainedafter a thresholding process is applied on the coefficients of its wavelet decomposition.Existing polynomial-time thresholding schemes that minimize maximum error metrics aredisadvantaged by impracticable time and space complexities and are not applicable in adata stream context. This is a cardinal issue; as the problem at hand in its most practicallyinteresting form involves the time-efficient approximation of huge amounts of data;potentially in a streaming environment.

Frequent-pattern based iterative projected clustering,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,Irrelevant attributes add noise to high dimensional clusters and make traditional clusteringtechniques inappropriate. Projected clustering algorithms have been proposed to find theclusters in hidden subspaces. We realize the analogy between mining frequent itemsets anddiscovering the relevant subspace for a given cluster. We propose a methodology for findingprojected clusters by mining frequent itemsets and present heuristics that improve its quality.Our techniques are evaluated with synthetic and real data; they are scalable and discoverprojected clusters accurately.,Data Mining; 2003.

A framework for efficient data anonymization under privacy and accuracy constraints,Gabriel Ghinita; Panagiotis Karras; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Recent research studied the problem of publishing microdata without revealingsensitive information; leading to the privacy-preserving paradigms of k-anonymity and l-diversity. k-anonymity protects against the identification of an individual's record. l-diversity;in addition; safeguards against the association of an individual with specific sensitiveinformation. However; existing approaches suffer from at least one of the followingdrawbacks:(i) l-diversification is solved by techniques developed for the simpler k-anonymization problem; causing unnecessary information loss.(ii) The anonymizationprocess is inefficient in terms of computational and I/O cost.(iii) Previous research focusedexclusively on the privacy-constrained problem and ignored the equally important accuracy-constrained (or dual) anonymization problem. In this article; we propose a framework for …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,77
Efficient evaluation of probabilistic advanced spatial queries on existentially uncertain data,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Xiangyuan Dai; Yufei Tao; Michail Vaitis,We study the problem of answering spatial queries in databases where objects exist withsome uncertainty and they are associated with an existential probability. The goal of athresholding probabilistic spatial query is to retrieve the objects that qualify the spatialpredicates with probability that exceeds a threshold. Accordingly; a ranking probabilisticspatial query selects the objects with the highest probabilities to qualify the spatialpredicates. We propose adaptations of spatial access methods and search algorithms forprobabilistic versions of range queries; nearest neighbors; spatial skylines; and reversenearest neighbors and conduct an extensive experimental study; which evaluates theeffectiveness of proposed solutions.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,73
Discovery of collocation episodes in spatiotemporal data,Huiping Cao; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Given a collection of trajectories of moving objects with different types (eg; pumas; deers;vultures; etc.); we introduce the problem of discovering collocation episodes in them (eg; if apuma is moving near a deer; then a vulture is also going to move close to the same deerwith high probability within the next 3 minutes). Collocation episodes catch the inter-movement regularities among different types of objects. We formally define the problem ofmining collocation episodes and propose two scaleable algorithms for its efficient solution.We empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed methods using syntheticallygenerated data that emulate real-world object movements.,Data Mining; 2006.

Reverse nearest neighbors search in ad hoc subspaces,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,Given an object q; modeled by a multidimensional point; a reverse nearest neighbors (RNN)query returns the set of objects in the database that have q as their nearest neighbor. In thispaper; we study an interesting generalization of the RNN query; where not all dimensionsare considered; but only an ad hoc subset thereof. The rationale is that 1) the dimensionalitymight be too high for the result of a regular RNN query to be useful; 2) missing values mayimplicitly define a meaningful subspace for RNN retrieval; and 3) analysts may be interestedin the query results only for a set of (ad hoc) problem dimensions (ie; object attributes). Weconsider a suitable storage scheme and develop appropriate algorithms for projected RNNqueries; without relying on multidimensional indexes. Given the significant cost differencebetween random and sequential data accesses; our algorithms are based on applying …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,63
Querying uncertain spatio-temporal data,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zufle,The problem of modeling and managing uncertain data has received a great deal of interest;due to its manifold applications in spatial; temporal; multimedia and sensor databases.There exists a wide range of work covering spatial uncertainty in the static (snapshot) case;where only one point of time is considered. In contrast; the problem of modeling andquerying uncertain spatio-temporal data has only been treated as a simple extension of thespatial case; disregarding time dependencies between consecutive timestamps. In this work;we present a framework for efficiently modeling and querying uncertain spatio-temporaldata. The key idea of our approach is to model possible object trajectories by stochasticprocesses. This approach has three major advantages over previous work. First it allowsanswering queries in accordance with the possible worlds model. Second; dependencies …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,62
Privacy preservation by disassociation,Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis; John Liagouris; Spiros Skiadopoulos,Abstract In this work; we focus on protection against identity disclosure in the publication ofsparse multidimensional data. Existing multidimensional anonymization techniques (a)protect the privacy of users either by altering the set of quasi-identifiers of the original data(eg; by generalization or suppression) or by adding noise (eg; using differential privacy)and/or (b) assume a clear distinction between sensitive and non-sensitive information andsever the possible linkage. In many real world applications the above techniques are notapplicable. For instance; consider web search query logs. Suppressing or generalizinganonymization methods would remove the most valuable information in the dataset: theoriginal query terms. Additionally; web search query logs contain millions of query termswhich cannot be categorized as sensitive or non-sensitive since a term may be sensitive …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,61
Slot index spatial join,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Efficient processing of spatial joins is very important due to their high cost and frequentapplication in spatial databases and other areas involving multidimensional data. This paperproposes slot index spatial join (SISJ); an algorithm that joins a nonindexed data set withone indexed by an R-tree. We explore two optimization techniques that reduce the spacerequirements and the computational cost of SISJ and we compare it; analytically andexperimentally; with other spatial join methods for two cases: 1) when the nonindexed inputis read from disk and 2) when it is an intermediate result of a preceding database operator ina complex query plan. The importance of buffer splitting between consecutive join operatorsis also demonstrated through a two-join case study and a method that estimates the optimalsplitting is proposed. Our evaluation shows that SISJ outperforms alternative methods in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,61
Spatio-textual similarity joins,Panagiotis Bouros; Shen Ge; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Given a collection of objects that carry both spatial and textual information; a spatio-textual similarity join retrieves the pairs of objects that are spatially close and textuallysimilar. As an example; consider a social network with spatially and textually tagged persons(ie; their locations and profiles). A useful task (for friendship recommendation) would be tofind pairs of persons that are spatially close and their profiles have a large overlap (ie; theyhave common interests). Another application is data de-duplication (eg; finding photographswhich are spatially close to each other and high overlap in their descriptive tags). Despitethe importance of this operation; there is very little previous work that studies its efficientevaluation and in fact under a different definition; only the best match for each object isidentified. In this paper; we combine ideas from state-of-the-art spatial distance join and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,60
Non-homogeneous generalization in privacy preserving data publishing,Wai Kit Wong; Nikos Mamoulis; David Wai Lok Cheung,Abstract Most previous research on privacy-preserving data publishing; based on the k-anonymity model; has followed the simplistic approach of homogeneously giving the samegeneralized value in all quasi-identifiers within a partition. We observe that theanonymization error can be reduced if we follow a non-homogeneous generalizationapproach for groups of size larger than k. Such an approach would allow tuples within apartition to take different generalized quasi-identifier values. Anonymization following thismodel is not trivial; as its direct application can easily violate k-anonymity. In addition; non-homogeneous generalization allows for additional types of attack; which should beconsidered in the process. We provide a methodology for verifying whether a non-homogeneous generalization violates k-anonymity. Then; we propose a technique that …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,52
Algorithms for quantified constraint satisfaction problems,Nikos Mamoulis; Kostas Stergiou,Abstract Many propagation and search algorithms have been developed for constraintsatisfaction problems (CSPs). In a standard CSP all variables are existentially quantified.The CSP formalism can be extended to allow universally quantified variables; in which casethe complexity of the basic reasoning tasks rises from NP-complete to PSPACE-complete.Such problems have; so far; been studied mainly in the context of quantified Booleanformulae. Little work has been done on problems with discrete non-Boolean domains. Weattempt to fill this gap by extending propagation and search algorithms from standard CSPsto the quantified case. We also show how the notion of value interchangeability can beexploited to break symmetries and speed up search by orders of magnitude. Finally; we testexperimentally the algorithms and methods proposed.,International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming,2004,49
A survey on multidimensional access methods,H-K Ahn; Nikos Mamoulis; Ho Min Wong,The extraordinary format of spatial data and the fact that there is no straightforward mappingof spatial objects from the multidimensional space to the 1-dimensional space; stimulatedvarious researchers during the past two decades to develop multidimensional accessmethods that facilitate efficient indexing of spatial objects in large databases. This surveypaper tries a classification of existing multidimensional access methods; according to thetypes of data they are most suitable for (points or objects with spatial extent); their structure(hierarchical or flat); and their performance over spatial queries. Most of this work is basedon an excellent survey paper [Gaed97],*,2001,49
An audit environment for outsourcing of frequent itemset mining,Wai Kit Wong; David W Cheung; Edward Hung; Ben Kao; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Finding frequent itemsets is the most costly task in association rule mining.Outsourcing this task to a service provider brings several benefits to the data owner such ascost relief and a less commitment to storage and computational resources. Mining results;however; can be corrupted if the service provider (i) is honest but makes mistakes in themining process; or (ii) is lazy and reduces costly computation; returning incomplete results;or (iii) is malicious and contaminates the mining results. We address the integrity issue in theoutsourcing process; ie; how the data owner verifies the correctness of the mining results.For this purpose; we propose and develop an audit environment; which consists of adatabase transformation method and a result verification method. The main component ofour audit environment is an artificial itemset planting (AIP) technique. We provide a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,48
Capacity constrained assignment in spatial databases,Man Lung Yiu; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Given a point set P of customers (eg; WiFi receivers) and a point set Q of serviceproviders (eg; wireless access points); where each q∈ Q has a capacity qk; the capacityconstrained assignment (CCA) is a matching M⊆ Q× P such that (i) each point q∈ Q (p∈ P)appears at most k times (at most once) in M;(ii) the size of M is maximized (ie; it comprisesmin {| P|;∑ q∈ Q q. k} pairs); and (iii) the total assignment cost (ie; the sum of Euclideandistances within all pairs) is minimized. Thus; the CCA problem is to identify the assignmentwith the optimal overall quality; intuitively; the quality of q's service to p in a given (q; p) pairis anti-proportional to their distance. Although max-flow algorithms are applicable to thisproblem; they require the complete distance-based bipartite graph between Q and P. Forlarge spatial datasets; this graph is expensive to compute and it may be too large to fit in …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,48
Efficient aggregation of ranked inputs,Nikos Mamoulis; Kit Hung Cheng; Man Lung Yiu; David W Cheung,A top-k query combines different rankings of the same set of objects and returns the kobjects with the highest combined score according to an aggregate function. We bring tolight some key observations; which impose two phases that any top-k algorithm; based onsorted accesses; should go through. Based on them; we propose a new algorithm; which isdesigned to minimize the number of object accesses; the computational cost; and thememory requirements of top-k search. Adaptations of our algorithm for search variants (exactscores; on-line and incremental search; top-k joins; other aggregate functions; etc.) are alsoprovided. Extensive experiments with synthetic and real data show that; compared toprevious techniques; our method accesses fewer objects; while being orders of magnitudefaster.,Data Engineering; 2006.

Exploiting duality in summarization with deterministic guarantees,Panagiotis Karras; Dimitris Sacharidis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Summarization is an important task in data mining. A major challenge over the pastyears has been the efficient construction of fixed-space synopses that provide adeterministic quality guarantee; often expressed in terms of a maximum-error metric.Histograms and several hierarchical techniques have been proposed for this problem.However; their time and/or space complexities remain impractically high and depend notonly on the data set size n; but also on the space budget B. These handicaps stem from arequirement to tabulate all allocations of synopsis space to different regions of the data. Inthis paper we develop an alternative methodology that dispels these deficiencies; thanks toa fruitful application of the solution to the dual problem: given a maximum allowed error;determine the minimum-space synopsis that achieves it. Compared to the state-of-the-art …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2007,42
Scalable probabilistic similarity ranking in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,This paper introduces a scalable approach for probabilistic top-k similarity ranking onuncertain vector data. Each uncertain object is represented by a set of vector instances thatis assumed to be mutually exclusive. The objective is to rank the uncertain data according totheir distance to a reference object. We propose a framework that incrementally computesfor each object instance and ranking position; the probability of the object falling at thatranking position. The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for severalstate-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models. Existing approaches compute this probabilitydistribution by applying the Poisson binomial recurrence technique of quadratic complexity.In this paper; we theoretically as well as experimentally show that our framework reducesthis to a linear-time complexity while having the same memory requirements; facilitated by …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,41
Similarity search in sets and categorical data using the signature tree,Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung; Wang Lian,Data mining applications analyze large collections of set data and high dimensionalcategorical data. Search on these data types is not restricted to the classic problems ofmining association rules and classification; but similarity search is also a frequently appliedoperation. Access methods/or multidimensional numerical data are inappropriate for thisproblem and specialized indexes are needed. We propose a method that represents setdata as bitmaps (signatures) and organizes them into a hierarchical index; suitable forsimilarity search and other related query types. In contrast to a previous technique; thesignature tree is dynamic and does not rely on hardwired constants. Experiments withsynthetic and real datasets show that it is robust to different data characteristics; scalable tothe database size and efficient for various queries.,Data Engineering; 2003.

Selectivity estimation of complex spatial queries,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Several studies have focused on the efficient processing of simple spatial querytypes such as selections and spatial joins. Little work; however; has been done towards theoptimization of queries that process several spatial inputs and combine them through joinand selection conditions. This paper identifies the dependencies between spatial operatorsand illustrates how they can affect the outcome of complex queries. A thorough analysisyields selectivity estimations that can be used to optimize any combination of spatial andnon-spatial selection and join operators. The accuracy of the formulae is evaluated throughexperimentation with various queries. In addition to their importance for spatial databases;the presented results can be applied in several other domains; where dependencies existbetween operators.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,41
Probabilistic nearest neighbor queries on uncertain moving object trajectories,Johannes Niedermayer; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Nikos Mamoulis; Lei Chen; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Nearest neighbor (NN) queries in trajectory databases have received significantattention in the past; due to their applications in spatio-temporal data analysis. More recentwork has considered the realistic case where the trajectories are uncertain; however; onlysimple uncertainty models have been proposed; which do not allow for accurateprobabilistic search. In this paper; we fill this gap by addressing probabilistic nearestneighbor queries in databases with uncertain trajectories modeled by stochastic processes;specifically the Markov chain model. We study three nearest neighbor query semantics thattake as input a query state or trajectory q and a time interval; and theoretically evaluate theirruntime complexity. Furthermore we propose a sampling approach which uses Bayesianinference to guarantee that sampled trajectories conform to the observation data stored in …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,40
Ranking spatial data by quality preferences,Man Lung Yiu; Hua Lu; Nikos Mamoulis; Michail Vaitis,A spatial preference query ranks objects based on the qualities of features in their spatialneighborhood. For example; using a real estate agency database of flats for lease; acustomer may want to rank the flats with respect to the appropriateness of their location;defined after aggregating the qualities of other features (eg; restaurants; cafes; hospital;market; etc.) within their spatial neighborhood. Such a neighborhood concept can bespecified by the user via different functions. It can be an explicit circular region within a givendistance from the flat. Another intuitive definition is to assign higher weights to the featuresbased on their proximity to the flat. In this paper; we formally define spatial preferencequeries and propose appropriate indexing techniques and search algorithms for them.Extensive evaluation of our methods on both real and synthetic data reveals that an …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,40
Discovering partial periodic patterns in discrete data sequences,Huiping Cao; David W Cheung; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract The problem of partial periodic pattern mining in a discrete data sequence is to findsubsequences that appear periodically and frequently in the data sequence. Two essentialsubproblems are the efficient mining of frequent patterns and the automatic discovery ofperiods that correspond to these patterns. Previous methods for this problem in eventsequence databases assume that the periods are given in advance or require additionaldatabase scans to compute periods that define candidate patterns. In this work; we proposea new structure; the abbreviated list table (ALT); and several efficient algorithms to computethe periods and the patterns; that require only a small number of passes. A performancestudy is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2004,40
Density-based place clustering in geo-social networks,Jieming Shi; Nikos Mamoulis; Dingming Wu; David W Cheung,Abstract Spatial clustering deals with the unsupervised grouping of places into clusters andfinds important applications in urban planning and marketing. Current spatial clusteringmodels disregard information about the people who are related to the clustered places. Inthis paper; we show how the density-based clustering paradigm can be extended to applyon places which are visited by users of a geo-social network. Our model considers bothspatial information and the social relationships between users who visit the clustered places.After formally defining the model and the distance measure it relies on; we present efficientalgorithms for its implementation; based on spatial indexing. We evaluate the effectivenessof our model via a case study on real data; in addition; we design two quantitative measures;called social entropy and community score to evaluate the quality of the discovered …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,39
Fast and exact warping of time series using adaptive segmental approximations,Yutao Shou; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Abstract Similarity search is a core module of many data analysis tasks; including search byexample; classification; and clustering. For time series data; Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)has been proven a very effective similarity measure; since it minimizes the effects of shiftingand distortion in time. However; the quadratic cost of DTW computation to the length of thematched sequences makes its direct application on databases of long time series veryexpensive. We propose a technique that decomposes the sequences into a number ofsegments and uses cheap approximations thereof to compute fast lower bounds for theirwarping distances. We present several; progressively tighter bounds; relying on theexistence or not of warping constraints. Finally; we develop an index and a multi-steptechnique that uses the proposed bounds and performs two levels of filtering to efficiently …,Machine Learning,2005,38
A novel probabilistic pruning approach to speed up similarity queries in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,In this paper; we propose a novel; effective and efficient probabilistic pruning criterion forprobabilistic similarity queries on uncertain data. Our approach supports a generaluncertainty model using continuous probabilistic density functions to describe the (possiblycorrelated) uncertain attributes of objects. In a nutshell; the problem to be solved is tocompute the PDF of the random variable denoted by the probabilistic domination count:Given an uncertain database object B; an uncertain reference object R and a set D ofuncertain database objects in a multi-dimensional space; the probabilistic domination countdenotes the number of uncertain objects in D that are closer to R than B. This dominationcount can be used to answer a wide range of probabilistic similarity queries. Specifically; wepropose a novel geometric pruning filter and introduce an iterative filter-refinement …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,34
An on-chip short-time interval measurement technique for testing high-speed communication links,Jiun-Lang Huang; Kwang-Ting Cheng,In this paper; we present a BIST scheme for on-chip short-time interval measurementintended for characterizing the time-domain specifications; eg; the rise/fall time of modernhigh-speed communication transceivers. To reduce hardware overhead; the proposed BISTtechnique uses the coherent under-sampling principle; and measures implicitly the timeinterval in a two-pass manner. Simulation results are shown to validate the proposedtechnique.,VLSI Test Symposium; 19th IEEE Proceedings on. VTS 2001,2001,31
Content-based retrieval using heuristic search,Dimitris Papadias; Marios Mantzourogiannis; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Ishfaq Ahmad,ABSTRACT The fast growth of multimedia information in image and video databases hastriggered research on efficient retrieval methods. This paper deals with structural queries; atype of content-based retrieval where similarity is not defined on visual properties such ascolor and texture; but on object relations in space. We propose the application of heuristicalgorithms which provide good; but not necessarily optimal; solutions in a pre-determinedtime period; and compare our approach with systematic search methods which areguaranteed to find optimal solutions but require exponential time in the worst case. Thequality of the output is calculated using a relation framework which is an extension of Allen'srelations. With this framework our methods can be applied in multiple resolutions anddimensions; thus covering a wide range of applications in spatial; multimedia and video …,Proceedings of the 22nd annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,1999,31
Durable top-k search in document archives,Nikos Mamoulis; Klaus Berberich; Srikanta Bedathur,Abstract We propose and study a new ranking problem in versioned databases. Consider adatabase of versioned objects which have different valid instances along a history (eg;documents in a web archive). Durable top-k search finds the set of objects that areconsistently in the top-k results of a query (eg; a keyword query) throughout a given timeinterval (eg; from June 2008 to May 2009). Existing work on temporal top-k queries mainlyfocuses on finding the most representative top-k elements within a time interval. Suchmethods are not readily applicable to durable top-k queries. To address this need; wepropose two techniques that compute the durable top-k result. The first is adapted from theclassic top-k rank aggregation algorithm NRA. The second technique is based on a sharedexecution paradigm and is more efficient than the first approach. In addition; we propose …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,30
Voronoi-based nearest neighbor search for multi-dimensional uncertain databases,Peiwu Zhang; Reynold Cheng; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle; Yu Tang; Tobias Emrich,In Voronoi-based nearest neighbor search; the Voronoi cell of every point p in a databasecan be used to check whether p is the closest to some query point q. We extend the notion ofVoronoi cells to support uncertain objects; whose attribute values are inexact. Particularly;we propose the Possible Voronoi cell (or PV-cell). A PV-cell of a multi-dimensional uncertainobject o is a region R; such that for any point pϵR; o may be the nearest neighbor of p. If thePV-cells of all objects in a database S are known; they can be used to identify objects thathave a chance to be the nearest neighbor of q. However; there is no efficient algorithm forcomputing an exact PV-cell. We hence study how to derive an axis-parallel hyper-rectangle(called the Uncertain Bounding Rectangle; or UBR) that tightly contains a PV-cell. We furtherdevelop the PV-index; a structure that stores UBRs; to evaluate probabilistic nearest …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,29
Indexing uncertain spatio-temporal data,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract The advances in sensing and telecommunication technologies allow the collectionand management of vast amounts of spatio-temporal data combining location and timeinformation. Due to physical and resource limitations of data collection devices (eg; RFIDreaders; GPS receivers and other sensors) data are typically collected only at discrete pointsof time. In-between these discrete time instances; the positions of tracked moving objects areuncertain. In this work; we propose novel approximation techniques in order toprobabilistically bound the uncertain movement of objects; these techniques allow forefficient and effective filtering during query evaluation using an hierarchical index structure.To the best of our knowledge; this is the first approach that supports query evaluation onvery large uncertain spatio-temporal databases; adhering to possible worlds semantics …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,29
Efficient all top-k computation-a unified solution for all top-k; reverse top-k and top-m influential queries,Shen Ge; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Given a set of objects P and a set of ranking functions F over P; an interesting problem is tocompute the top ranked objects for all functions. Evaluation of multiple top-k queries findsapplication in systems; where there is a heavy workload of ranking queries (eg; onlinesearch engines and product recommendation systems). The simple solution of evaluatingthe top-k queries one-by-one does not scale well; instead; the system can make use of thefact that similar queries share common results to accelerate search. This paper is the first; toour knowledge; thorough study of this problem. We propose methods that compute all top-kqueries in batch. Our first solution applies the block indexed nested loops paradigm; whileour second technique is a view-based algorithm. We propose appropriate optimizationtechniques for the two approaches and demonstrate experimentally that the second …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,27
Constraint-based processing of multiway spatial joins,Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract. A multiway spatial join combines information found in three or more spatialrelations with respect to some spatial predicates. Motivated by their close correspondencewith constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs); we show how multiway spatial joins can beprocessed by systematic search algorithms traditionally used for CSPs. This paper describestwo different strategies; window reduction and synchronous traversal; that take advantage ofunderlying spatial indexes to prune the search space effectively. In addition; we provide costmodels and optimization methods that combine the two strategies to compute more efficientexecution plans. Finally; we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed techniques and theaccuracy of the cost models through extensive experimentation with several query and datacombinations.,Algorithmica,2001,26
Reverse top-k search using random walk with restart,Adams Wei Yu; Nikos Mamoulis; Hao Su,Abstract With the increasing popularity of social networks; large volumes of graph data arebecoming available. Large graphs are also derived by structure extraction from relational;text; or scientific data (eg; relational tuple networks; citation graphs; ontology networks;protein-protein interaction graphs). Node-to-node proximity is the key building block formany graph-based applications that search or analyze the data. Among various proximitymeasures; random walk with restart (RWR) is widely adopted because of its ability toconsider the global structure of the whole network. Although RWR-based similarity searchhas been well studied before; there is no prior work on reverse top-k proximity search ingraphs based on RWR. We discuss the applicability of this query and show that its directevaluation using existing methods on RWR-based similarity search has very high …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,25
The Haar+ tree: a refined synopsis data structure,Panagiotis Karras; Nikos Mamoulis,We introduce the Haar+ tree: a refined; wavelet-inspired data structure for synopsisconstruction. The advantages of this structure are twofold: First; it achieves higher synopsisquality at the task of summarizing data sets with sharp discontinuities than state-of-the-arthistogram and Haar wavelet techniques. Second; thanks to its search space delimitationcapacity; Haar+ synopsis construction operates in time linear to the size of the data set forany monotonic distributive error metric. Through experimentation; we demonstrate thesuperiority of Haar+ synopses over histogram and Haar wavelet methods in bothconstruction time and achieved quality for representative error metrics.,Data Engineering; 2007.

Indexing and retrieval of historical aggregate information about moving objects,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Jun Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; Qiongmao Shen; Jimeng Sun,Spatio-temporal databases store information about the positions of individual objects overtime. In many applications however; such as traffic supervision or mobile communicationsystems; only summarized data; like the average number of cars in an area for a specificperiod; or phones serviced by a cell each day; is required. Although this information can beobtained from operational databases; its computation is expensive; rendering onlineprocessing inapplicable. A vital solution is the construction of a spatiotemporal datawarehouse. In this paper; we describe a framework for supporting OLAP operations overspatiotemporal data. We argue that the spatial and temporal dimensions should be modeledas a combined dimension on the data cube and present data structures; which integratespatiotemporal indexing with pre-aggregation.

Acceleration of composite order bilinear pairing on graphics hardware,Ye Zhang; Chun Jason Xue; Duncan S Wong; Nikos Mamoulis; Siu Ming Yiu,Abstract Recently; composite-order bilinear pairing has been shown to be useful in manycryptographic constructions. However; it is time-costly to evaluate. This is because thecomposite order should be at least 1024bit and; hence; the elliptic curve group order n andbase field become too large; rendering the bilinear pairing algorithm itself too slow to bepractical (eg; the Miller loop is Ω (n)). Thus; composite-order computation easily becomesthe bottleneck of a cryptographic construction; especially; in the case where many pairingsneed to be evaluated at the same time. The existing solution to this problem that convertscomposite-order pairings to prime-order ones is only valid for certain constructions. In thispaper; we leverage the huge number of threads available on Graphics Processing Units(GPUs) to speed up composite-order pairing computation. We investigate suitable SIMD …,International Conference on Information and Communications Security,2012,24

Meta structure: Computing relevance in large heterogeneous information networks,Zhipeng Huang; Yudian Zheng; Reynold Cheng; Yizhou Sun; Nikos Mamoulis; Xiang Li,Abstract A heterogeneous information network (HIN) is a graph model in which objects andedges are annotated with types. Large and complex databases; such as YAGO and DBLP;can be modeled as HINs. A fundamental problem in HINs is the computation of closeness; orrelevance; between two HIN objects. Relevance measures can be used in variousapplications; including entity resolution; recommendation; and information retrieval. Severalstudies have investigated the use of HIN information for relevance computation; however;most of them only utilize simple structure; such as path; to measure the similarity betweenobjects. In this paper; we propose to use meta structure; which is a directed acyclic graph ofobject types with edge types connecting in between; to measure the proximity betweenobjects. The strength of meta structure is that it can describe complex relationship …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2016,23
Interesting-phrase mining for ad-hoc text analytics,Srikanta Bedathur; Klaus Berberich; Jens Dittrich; Nikos Mamoulis; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Large text corpora with news; customer mail and reports; or Web 2.0 contributionsoffer a great potential for enhancing business-intelligence applications. We propose aframework for performing text analytics on such data in a versatile; efficient; and scalablemanner. While much of the prior literature has emphasized mining keywords or tags in blogsor social-tagging communities; we emphasize the analysis of interesting phrases. Theseinclude named entities; important quotations; market slogans; and other multi-word phrasesthat are prominent in a dynamically derived ad-hoc subset of the corpus; eg; being frequentin the subset but relatively infrequent in the overall corpus. We develop preprocessing andindexing methods for phrases; paired with new search techniques for the top-k mostinteresting phrases in ad-hoc subsets of the corpus. Our framework is evaluated using a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,23
Overlapping community regularization for rating prediction in social recommender systems,Hui Li; Dingming Wu; Wenbin Tang; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Recommender systems have become de facto tools for suggesting items that are ofpotential interest to users. Predicting a user's rating on an item is the fundamentalrecommendation task. Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use datafrom social networks to improve accuracy. However; most of the social-network basedrecommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when thetargeted user has few social connections. In this paper; we propose two alternative modelsthat incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorizationframework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperformthe state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,2015,22
Optimal route queries with arbitrary order constraints,Jing Li; Yin David Yang; Nikos Mamoulis,Given a set of spatial points DS; each of which is associated with categorical information; eg;restaurant; pub; etc.; the optimal route query finds the shortest path that starts from the querypoint (eg; a home or hotel); and covers a user-specified set of categories (eg;{pub;restaurant; museum}). The user may also specify partial order constraints between differentcategories; eg; a restaurant must be visited before a pub. Previous work has focused on aspecial case where the query contains the total order of all categories to be visited (eg;museum→ restaurant→ pub). For the general scenario without such a total order; the onlyknown solution reduces the problem to multiple; total-order optimal route queries. As weshow in this paper; this naive approach incurs a significant amount of repeatedcomputations; and; thus; is not scalable to large data sets. Motivated by this; we propose …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,22
Approximate spatio-temporal retrieval,Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Vasilis Delis,Abstract This paper proposes a framework for the handling of spatio-temporal queries withinexact matches; using the concept of relation similarity. We initially describe a binary stringencoding for 1D relations that permits the automatic derivation of similarity measures. Wethen extend this model to various granularity levels and many dimensions; and show thatreasoning on spatio-temporal structure is significantly facilitated in the new framework.Finally; we provide algorithms and optimization methods for four types of queries:(i) objectretrieval based on some spatio-temporal relations with respect to a reference object;(ii)spatial joins; ie; retrieval of object pairs that satisfy some input relation;(iii) structural queries;which retrieve configurations matching a particular spatio-temporal structure; and (iv) specialcases of motion queries. Considering the current large availability of multidimensional …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2001,22
Optimal matching between spatial datasets under capacity constraints,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Consider a set of customers (eg; WiFi receivers) and a set of service providers (eg;wireless access points); where each provider has a capacity and the quality of serviceoffered to its customers is anti-proportional to their distance. The Capacity ConstrainedAssignment (CCA) is a matching between the two sets such that (i) each customer isassigned to at most one provider;(ii) every provider serves no more customers than itscapacity;(iii) the maximum possible number of customers are served; and (iv) the sum ofEuclidean distances within the assigned provider-customer pairs is minimized. Althoughmax-flow algorithms are applicable to this problem; they require the complete distance-based bipartite graph between the customer and provider sets. For large spatial datasets;this graph is expensive to compute and it may be too large to fit in main memory …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,21
Indexing useful structural patterns for XML query processing,Wang Lian; Nikos Mamoulis; David Wai-lok Cheung; Siu-Ming Yiu,Queries on semistructured data are hard to process due to the complex nature of the dataand call for specialized techniques. Existing path-based indexes and query processingalgorithms are not efficient for searching complex structures beyond simple paths; evenwhen the queries are high-selective. We introduce the definition of minimal infrequentstructures (MIS); which are structures that 1) exist in the data; 2) are not frequent with respectto a support threshold; and 3) all substructures of them are frequent. By indexing theoccurrences of MIS; we can efficiently locate the high-selective substructures of a query;improving search performance significantly. An efficient data mining algorithm is proposed;which finds the minimal infrequent structures. Their occurrences in the XML data are thenindexed by a lightweight data structure and used as a fast filter step in query evaluation …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,21
Validity information retrieval for spatio-temporal queries: Theoretical performance bounds,Yufei Tao; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The results of traditional spatial queries (ie; range search; nearest neighbor; etc.)are usually meaningless in spatio-temporal applications; because they will be invalidated bythe movements of query and/or data objects. In practice; a query result R should beaccompanied with validity information specifying (i) the (future) time T that R will expire; and(ii) the change C of R at time T (so that R can be updated incrementally). Although severalalgorithms have been proposed for this problem; their worst-case performance is the sameas that of sequential scan. This paper presents the first theoretical study on validity queries;and develops indexes and algorithms with attractive I/O complexities. Our discussion coversnumerous important variations of the problem and different query/object mobilitycombinations. The solutions involve a set of non-trivial reductions that reveal the problem …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,21
Operator placement for snapshot multi-predicate queries in wireless sensor networks,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Huseyin Hakkoymaz; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,This work aims at minimize the cost of answering snapshot multi-predicate queries in high-communication-cost networks. High-communication-cost (HCC) networks is a family ofnetworks where communicating data is very demanding in resources; for example inwireless sensor networks transmitting data drains the battery life of sensors involved. Theimportant class of multi-predicate queries in horizontally or vertically distributed databases isaddressed. We show that minimizing the communication cost for multi-predicate queries isNP-hard and we propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal solutionfor small problem instances. We also propose a low complexity; approximate; heuristicalgorithm for solving larger problem instances efficiently and running it on nodes with lowcomputational power (eg sensors). Finally; we present a variant of the Fermat point …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09. Tenth International Conference on,2009,20
Computation and monitoring of exclusive closest pairs,Nikos Mamoulis; Man Lung Yiu,Given two datasets A and B; their exclusive closest pairs (ECP) join is a one-to-oneassignment of objects from the two datasets; such that (i) the closest pair (a; b) in A times B isin the result and (ii) the remaining pairs are determined by removing objects a; b from A; Brespectively; and recursively searching for the next closest pair. A real application ofexclusive closest pairs is the computation of (car; parking slot) assignments. This paperintroduces the problem and proposes several solutions that solve it in main-memory;exploiting space partitioning. In addition; we define a dynamic version of the problem; wherethe objective is to continuously monitor the ECP join solution; in an environment where thejoined datasets change positions and content. Finally; we study an extended form of thequery; where objects in one of the two joined sets (eg; parking slots) have a capacity …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,20
Efficient skyline evaluation over partially ordered domains,Shiming Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung; Ben Kao,Abstract Although there has been a considerable body of work on skyline evaluation inmultidimensional data with totally ordered attribute domains; there are only a few methodsthat consider attributes with partially ordered domains. Existing work maps each partiallyordered domain to a total order and then adapts algorithms for totally-ordered domains tosolve the problem. Nevertheless these methods either use stronger notions of dominance;which generate false positives; or require expensive dominance checks. In this paper; wepropose two new methods; which do not have these drawbacks. The first method uses anappropriate mapping of a partial order to a total order; inspired by the lattice theorem and anoff-the-shelf skyline algorithm. The second technique uses an appropriate storage andindexing approach; inspired by column stores; which enables efficient verification of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,19
Retrieval of spatial join pattern instances from sensor networks,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Spiridon Bakiras,Abstract We study the continuous evaluation of spatial join queries and extensions thereof;defined by interesting combinations of sensor readings (events) that co-occur in a spatialneighborhood. An example of such a pattern is “a high temperature reading in the vicinity ofat least four high-pressure readings”. We devise protocols for 'in-network'evaluation of thisclass of queries; aiming at the minimization of power consumption. In addition; we developcost models that suggest the appropriateness of each protocol; based on various factors;including selectivity of query elements; energy requirements for sensing; and networktopology. Finally; we experimentally compare the effectiveness of the proposed solutions onan experimental platform that emulates real sensor networks.,GeoInformatica,2009,18
Accelerating SPARQL queries by exploiting hash-based locality and adaptive partitioning,Razen Harbi; Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Yasser Ebrahim; Majed Sahli,Abstract State-of-the-art distributed RDF systems partition data across multiple computernodes (workers). Some systems perform cheap hash partitioning; which may result inexpensive query evaluation. Others try to minimize inter-node communication; whichrequires an expensive data preprocessing phase; leading to a high startup cost. Aprioriknowledge of the query workload has also been used to create partitions; which; however;are static and do not adapt to workload changes. In this paper; we propose AdPart; adistributed RDF system; which addresses the shortcomings of previous work. First; AdPartapplies lightweight partitioning on the initial data; which distributes triples by hashing ontheir subjects; this renders its startup overhead low. At the same time; the locality-awarequery optimizer of AdPart takes full advantage of the partitioning to (1) support the fully …,The VLDB Journal,2016,17
Hierarchical synopses with optimal error guarantees,Panagiotis Karras; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Hierarchical synopsis structures offer a viable alternative in terms of efficiency andflexibility in relation to traditional summarization techniques such as histograms. Previousresearch on such structures has mostly focused on a single model; based on the Haarwavelet decomposition. In previous work; we have introduced a more refined; wavelet-inspired hierarchical index structure for synopsis construction: the Haar+ tree. The chiefadvantages of this structure are twofold. First; it achieves higher synopsis quality at the taskof summarizing data sets with sharp discontinuities than state-of-the-art histogram and Haarwavelet techniques. Second; thanks to its search space delimitation capacity; Haar+synopsis construction operates in time linear in the size of the data set for any monotonicdistributive error metric. Contemporaneous research has introduced another hierarchical …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2008,17
Common influence join: A natural join operation for spatial pointsets,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Panagiotis Karras,We identify and formalize a novel join operator for two spatial pointsets P and Q. Thecommon influence join (CIJ) returns the pairs of points (p; q); pP; qQ; such that there exists alocation in space; being closer to p than to any other point in P and at the same time closerto q than to any other point in Q. In contrast to existing join operators between pointsets (ie;-distance joins and k-closest pairs); CIJ is parameter-free; providing a natural join result thatfinds application in marketing and decision support. We propose algorithms for the efficientevaluation of CIJ; for pointsets indexed by hierarchical multi-dimensional indexes. Wevalidate the effectiveness and the efficiency of these methods via experimentation withsynthetic and real spatial datasets. The experimental results show that a non-blockingalgorithm; which computes intersecting pairs of Voronoi cells on-demand; is very efficient …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Optimization of spatial joins on mobile devices,Nikos Mamoulis; Panos Kalnis; Spiridon Bakiras; Xiaochen Li,Abstract Mobile devices like PDAs are capable of retrieving information from various types ofservices. In many cases; the user requests cannot directly be processed by the serviceproviders; if their hosts have limited query capabilities or the query combines data fromvarious sources; which do not collaborate with each other. In this paper; we present aframework for optimizing spatial join queries that belong to this class. We presume that theconnection and queries are ad-hoc; there is no mediator available and the services are non-collaborative. We also assume that the services are not willing to share their statistics orindexes with the client. We retrieve statistics dynamically in order to generate a low-costexecution plan; while considering the storage and computational power limitations of thePDA. Since acquiring the statistics causes overhead; we describe an adaptive algorithm …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,17
Location aware keyword query suggestion based on document proximity,Shuyao Qi; Dingming Wu; Nikos Mamoulis,Keyword suggestion in web search helps users to access relevant information withouthaving to know how to precisely express their queries. Existing keyword suggestiontechniques do not consider the locations of the users and the query results; ie; the spatialproximity of a user to the retrieved results is not taken as a factor in the recommendation.However; the relevance of search results in many applications (eg; location-based services)is known to be correlated with their spatial proximity to the query issuer. In this paper; wedesign a location-aware keyword query suggestion framework. We propose a weightedkeyword-document graph; which captures both the semantic relevance between keywordqueries and the spatial distance between the resulting documents and the user location. Thegraph is browsed in a random-walk-with-restart fashion; to select the keyword queries …,ieee transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2016,16
Earth mover's distance based similarity search at scale,Yu Tang; Yilun Cai; Nikos Mamoulis; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Earth Mover's Distance (EMD); as a similarity measure; has received a lot ofattention in the fields of multimedia and probabilistic databases; computer vision; imageretrieval; machine learning; etc. EMD on multidimensional histograms provides betterdistinguishability between the objects approximated by the histograms (eg; images);compared to classic measures like Euclidean distance. Despite its usefulness; EMD has ahigh computational cost; therefore; a number of effective filtering methods have beenproposed; to reduce the pairs of histograms for which the exact EMD has to be computed;during similarity search. Still; EMD calculations in the refinement step remain the bottleneckof the whole similarity search process. In this paper; we focus on optimizing the refinementphase of EMD-based similarity search by (i) adapting an efficient min-cost flow algorithm …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,16
Inverse queries for multidimensional spaces,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Shiming Zhang; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Traditional spatial queries return; for a given query object q; all database objectsthat satisfy a given predicate; such as epsilon range and k-nearest neighbors. This paperdefines and studies inverse spatial queries; which; given a subset of database objects Q anda query predicate; return all objects which; if used as query objects with the predicate;contain Q in their result. We first show a straightforward solution for answering inversespatial queries for any query predicate. Then; we propose a filter-and-refinement frameworkthat can be used to improve efficiency. We show how to apply this framework on a variety ofinverse queries; using appropriate space pruning strategies. In particular; we proposesolutions for inverse epsilon range queries; inverse k-nearest neighbor queries; and inverseskyline queries. Our experiments show that our framework is significantly more efficient …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,16
Oblivious transfer with access control: realizing disjunction without duplication,Ye Zhang; Man Ho Au; Duncan S Wong; Qiong Huang; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung; Siu-Ming Yiu,Abstract Oblivious Transfer with Access Control (AC-OT) is a protocol which allows a user toobtain a database record with a credential satisfying the access policy of the record whilethe database server learns nothing about the record or the credential. The only AC-OTconstruction that supports policy in disjunctive form requires duplication of records in thedatabase; each with a different conjunction of attributes (representing one possible criterionfor accessing the record). In this paper; we propose a new AC-OT construction secure in thestandard model. It supports policy in disjunctive form directly; without the above duplicationissue. Due to the duplication issue in the previous construction; the size of an encryptedrecord is in O(i=1^tn_i) for a CNF policy (A_1;1∨...∨A_1;n_1)∧...∧(A_t;1∨...∨A_t;n_t) andin O(nk) for ak-of-n threshold gate. In our construction; the encrypted record size can be …,International Conference on Pairing-Based Cryptography,2010,16
Anonymity in unstructured data,Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis; Panos Kalnis,Abstract In this paper we study the problem of protecting privacy in the publication of set-valued data. Consider a collection of transactional data that contains detailed informationabout items bought together by individuals. Even after removing all personal characteristicsof the buyer; which can serve as links to his identity; the publication of such data is stillsubject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about the set. Unlikemost previous works; we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive; but weconsider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data; depending onthe point of view of the adversary. We define a new version of the k-anonymity guarantee;the km-anonymity; to limit the effects of the data dimensionality and we propose efficientalgorithms to transform the database. Our anonymization model relies on generalization …,Proc. of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB),2008,16
Hierarchical constraint satisfaction in spatial databases,Dimitris Papadias; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Several content-based queries in spatial databases and geographic informationsystems (GISs) can be modelled and processed as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).Regular CSP algorithms; however; work for main memory retrieval without utilizing indices toprune the search space. This paper shows how systematic and local search techniques cantake advantage of the hierarchical decomposition of space; preserved by spatial datastructures; to efficiently guide search. We study the conditions under which hierarchicalconstraint satisfaction outperforms traditional methods with extensive experimentation.,Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1999,16
Reverse-nearest neighbor queries on uncertain moving object trajectories,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries in spatial and spatio-temporal databaseshave received significant attention in the database research community over the lastdecade. A reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query finds the objects having a given queryobject as its nearest neighbor. RNN queries find applications in data mining; marketinganalysis; and decision making. Most previous research on RNN queries over trajectorydatabases assume that the data are certain. In realistic scenarios; however; trajectories areinherently uncertain due to measurement errors or time-discretized sampling. In this paper;we study RNN queries in databases of uncertain trajectories. We propose two types of RNNqueries based on a well established model for uncertain spatial temporal data based onstochastic processes; namely the Markov model. To the best of our knowledge our work is …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,15
A novel distributed framework for optimizing query routing trees in wireless sensor networks via optimal operator placement,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract In this paper; we focus the attention on the operator placement problem in WirelessSensor Networks (WSN). This problem is very relevant for in-network query processing overWSN; where query routing trees are decomposed into three sub-components that must beprocessed at query time; namely operator tree; operator placement assignment scheme androuting scheme. In particular; the operator placement assignment defines on which node ofthe network each (query) operator will be hosted and executed. Hence; operator placementplays a key role in the context of query optimization issues in WSN research. In line with thismain motivation; in this paper we present an optimal distributed algorithm to adapt theplacement of a single operator in high communication cost networks; such as a wirelesssensor network. Our parameter-free algorithm finds the optimal node to host the operator …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2013,15
Size-l object summaries for relational keyword search,Georgios J Fakas; Zhi Cai; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract A previously proposed keyword search paradigm produces; as a query result; aranked list of Object Summaries (OSs). An OS is a tree structure of related tuples thatsummarizes all data held in a relational database about a particular Data Subject (DS).However; some of these OSs are very large in size and therefore unfriendly to users thatinitially prefer synoptic information before proceeding to more comprehensive informationabout a particular DS. In this paper; we investigate the effective and efficient retrieval ofconcise and informative OSs. We argue that a good size-l OS should be a stand-alone andmeaningful synopsis of the most important information about the particular DS. Moreprecisely; we define a size-l OS as a partial OS composed of l important tuples. We proposethree algorithms for the efficient generation of size-l OSs (in addition to the optimal …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,15
Continuous monitoring of exclusive closest pairs,Nikos Mamoulis; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract Given two datasets A and B; their exclusive closest pairs (ECP) join is a one-to-oneassignment of objects from the two datasets; such that (i) the closest pair (a; b) in A× B is inthe result and (ii) the remaining pairs are determined by removing objects a; b from A; Brespectively; and recursively searching for the next closest pair. An application of exclusiveclosest pairs is the computation of (car; parking slot) assignments. In this paper; we proposealgorithms for the computation and continuous monitoring of ECP joins in memory; given astream of events that indicate dynamic assignment requests and releases of pairs.Experimental results on a system prototype demonstrate the efficiency of our solutions inpractice.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,15
Mixed language query disambiguation,Pascale Fung; LIU Xiaohu; Cheung Chi Shun,Abstract We propose a mixed language query disambiguation approach by using co-occurrence information from monolingual data only. A mixed language query consists ofwords in a< i> primary language</i> and a< i> secondary language</i>. Our methodtranslates the query into monolingual queries in either language. Two novel features fordisambiguation; namely contextual word voting and 1-best contextual word; are introducedand compared to a baseline feature; the nearest neighbor. Average query translationaccuracy for the two features are 81.37% and 83.72%; compared to the baseline accuracy of75.50%.,Proceedings of the 37th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Computational Linguistics,1999,15
Joint search by social and spatial proximity,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Jing Li; Yu Tang; Nikos Mamoulis,The diffusion of social networks introduces new challenges and opportunities for advancedservices; especially so with their ongoing addition of location-based features. We show howapplications like company and friend recommendation could significantly benefit fromincorporating social and spatial proximity; and study a query type that captures these two-fold semantics. We develop highly scalable algorithms for its processing; and enhance themwith elaborate optimizations. Finally; we use real social network data to empirically verify theefficiency and efficacy of our solutions.,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2015,14
Representative clustering of uncertain data,Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Nikos Mamoulis; Arthur Zimek; Matthias Renz,Abstract This paper targets the problem of computing meaningful clusterings from uncertaindata sets. Existing methods for clustering uncertain data compute a single clustering withoutany indication of its quality and reliability; thus; decisions based on their results arequestionable. In this paper; we describe a framework; based on possible-worlds semantics;when applied on an uncertain dataset; it computes a set of representative clusterings; eachof which has a probabilistic guarantee not to exceed some maximum distance to the groundtruth clustering; ie; the clustering of the actual (but unknown) data. Our framework can becombined with any existing clustering algorithm and it is the first to provide qualityguarantees about its result. In addition; our experimental evaluation shows that ourrepresentative clusterings have a much smaller deviation from the ground truth clustering …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,14
Managing uncertainty in spatial and spatio-temporal data,Reynold Cheng; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Goce Trajcevski; Andreas Zufle,Location-related data has a tremendous impact in many applications of high societalrelevance and its growing volume from heterogeneous sources is one true example of a BigData [1]. An inherent property of any spatio-temporal dataset is uncertainty due to varioussources of imprecision. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the differentchallenges involved in managing uncertain spatial and spatio-temporal data and presentsstate-of-the-art techniques for addressing them.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,14
Efficient answering of set containment queries for skewed item distributions,Manolis Terrovitis; Panagiotis Bouros; Panos Vassiliadis; Timos Sellis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of efficiently evaluating containment (ie;subset; equality; and superset) queries over set-valued data. We propose a novel indexingscheme; the Ordered Inverted File (OIF) which; differently from the state-of-the-art; indexesset-valued attributes in an ordered fashion. We introduce query processing algorithms thatpractically treat containment queries as range queries over the ordered postings lists of OIFand exploit this ordering to quickly prune unnecessary page accesses. OIF is simple toimplement and our experiments on both real and synthetic data show that it greatlyoutperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for all three classes of containment queries.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,14
Anonymous fuzzy identity-based encryption for similarity search,David W Cheung; Nikos Mamoulis; Wai Kit Wong; Siu-Ming Yiu; Ye Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we consider the problem of predicate encryption and focus on thepredicate for testing whether the Hamming distance between the attribute X of a data itemand a target V is equal to (or less than) a threshold t where X and V are of length m. Existingsolutions either do not provide attribute protection or produce a big ciphertext of size O (2 m).For the equality version of the problem; we provide a scheme which is match-concealing(MC) secure and the sizes of the ciphertext and token are both O (m). For the inequalityversion of the problem; we give a practical scheme; also achieving MC security; whichproduces a ciphertext with size O(m^t_max) if the maximum value of t; t max; is known inadvance and is a constant. We also show how to update the ciphertext if the user wants toincrease t max without constructing the ciphertext from scratch.,International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation,2010,14
Solving non-binary CSPs using the hidden variable encoding,Nikos Mamoulis; Kostas Stergiou,Abstract Non-binary constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) can be solved in two differentways. We can either translate the problem into an equivalent binary one and solve it usingwell-established binary CSP techniques or use extended versions of binary techniquesdirectly on the non-binary problem. Recently; it has been shown that the hidden variableencoding is a promising method of translating non-binary CSPs into binary ones. In thispaper we make a theoretical and empirical investigation of arc consistency and searchalgorithms for the hidden variable encoding. We analyze the potential benefits of applyingarc consistency on the hidden encoding compared to generalized arc consistency on thenon-binary representation. We also show that search algorithms for nonbinary constraintscan be emulated by corresponding binary algorithms that operate on the hidden variable …,International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming,2001,14
Evaluating SPARQL queries on massive RDF datasets,Razen Harbi; Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Distributed RDF systems partition data across multiple computer nodes. Partitioningis typically based on heuristics that minimize inter-node communication and it is performedin an initial; data pre-processing phase. Therefore; the resulting partitions are static and donot adapt to changes in the query workload; as a result; existing systems are unable toconsistently avoid communication for queries that are not favored by the initial datapartitioning. Furthermore; for very large RDF knowledge bases; the partitioning phasebecomes prohibitively expensive; leading to high startup costs. In this paper; we proposeAdHash; a distributed RDF system which addresses the shortcomings of previous work.First; AdHash initially applies lightweight hash partitioning; which drastically minimizes thestartup cost; while favoring the parallel processing of join patterns on subjects; without …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,13
Weighted coverage based reviewer assignment,Ngai Meng Kou; U Leong Hou; Nikos Mamoulis; Zhiguo Gong,Abstract Peer reviewing is a standard process for assessing the quality of submissions atacademic conferences and journals. A very important task in this process is the assignmentof reviewers to papers. However; achieving an appropriate assignment is not easy; becauseall reviewers should have similar load and the subjects of the assigned papers should beconsistent with the reviewers' expertise. In this paper; we propose a generalized frameworkfor fair reviewer assignment. We first extract the domain knowledge from the reviewers'published papers and model this knowledge as a set of topics. Then; we perform a groupassignment of reviewers to papers; which is a generalization of the classic ReviewerAssignment Problem (RAP); considering the relevance of the papers to topics as weights.We study a special case of the problem; where reviewers are to be found for just one …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,13
Durable queries over historical time series,Hao Wang; Yilun Cai; Yin Yang; Shiming Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis,This paper studies the problem of finding objects with durable quality over time in historicaltime series databases. For example; a sociologist may be interested in the top 10 websearch terms during the period of some historical events; the police may seek for vehiclesthat move close to a suspect 70 percent of the time during a certain time period and so on.Durable top-k (DTop-k) and nearest neighbor (DkNN) queries can be viewed as naturalextensions of the standard snapshot top-k and NN queries to timestamped sequences ofvalues or locations. Although their snapshot counterparts have been studied extensively; toour knowledge; there is little prior work that addresses this new class of durable queries.Existing methods for DTop-k processing either apply trivial solutions; or rely on domain-specific properties. Motivated by this; we propose efficient and scalable algorithms for the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,13
Non-contiguous sequence pattern queries,Nikos Mamoulis; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract Non-contiguous subsequence pattern queries search for symbol instances in a longsequence that satisfy some soft temporal constraints. In this paper; we propose amethodology that indexes long sequences; in order to efficiently process such queries. Thesequence data are decomposed into tables and queries are evaluated as multiway joinsbetween them. We describe non-blocking join operators and provide query preprocessingand optimization techniques that tighten the join predicates and suggest a good join orderplan. As opposed to previous approaches; our method can efficiently handle a broaderrange of queries and can be easily supported by existing DBMS. Its efficiency is evaluatedby experimentation on synthetic and real data.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,13
Sparse complete Gabor systems on a lattice,Yang Wang,Abstract It is well known that if a Gabor system G (Λ; g) is complete and Λ is a lattice then D(Λ)⩾ 1; where D (·) denotes the Beurling density. But what if Λ is a subset of a lattice but isnot itself a lattice? We investigate this question here. We show that the upper Beurlingdensity of Λ can be arbitrarily small; provided that the lattice containing Λ has density greaterthan 1.

An effective encoding scheme for spatial RDF data,John Liagouris; Nikos Mamoulis; Panagiotis Bouros; Manolis Terrovitis,Abstract The RDF data model has recently been extended to support representation andquerying of spatial information (ie; locations and geometries); which is associated with RDFentities. Still; there are limited efforts towards extending RDF stores to efficiently supportspatial queries; such as range selections (eg; find entities within a given range) and spatialjoins (eg; find pairs of entities whose locations are close to each other). In this paper; wepropose an extension for RDF stores that supports efficient spatial data management. Ourcontributions include an effective encoding scheme for entities having spatial locations; theintroduction of on-the-fly spatial filters and spatial join algorithms; and several optimizationsthat minimize the overhead of geometry and dictionary accesses. We implemented theproposed techniques as an extension to the opensource RDF-3X engine and we …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,12
Geo-social skyline queries,Tobias Emrich; Maximilian Franzke; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract By leveraging the capabilities of modern GPS-equipped mobile devices providingsocial-networking services; the interest in developing advanced services that combinelocation-based services with social networking services is growing drastically. Based on geo-social networks that couple personal location information with personal social contextinformation; such services are facilitated by geo-social queries that extract useful informationcombining social relationships and current locations of the users. In this paper; we tackle theproblem of geo-social skyline queries; a problem that has not been addressed so far. Givena set of persons D connected in a social network SN with information about their currentlocation; a geo-social skyline query reports for a given user U ε D and a given location P (notnecessarily the location of the user) the pareto-optimal set of persons who are close to P …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,12
A distributed technique for dynamic operator placement in wireless sensor networks,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,We present an optimal distributed algorithm to adapt the placement of a single operator inhigh communication cost networks; such as a wireless sensor network. Our parameter-freealgorithm finds the optimal node to host the operator with minimum communication costoverhead. Three techniques; proposed here; make this feature possible: 1) identifying thespecial; and most frequent case; where no flooding is needed; otherwise 2) limitation of theneighborhood to be flooded and 3) variable speed flooding and eves-dropping. When noflooding is needed the communication cost overhead for adapting the operator placement isnegligible. In addition; our algorithm does not require any extra communication cost whilethe query is executed. In our experiments we show that for the rest of cases our algorithmsaves 30%-85% of the energy compared to previously proposed techniques.

Evaluation of top-k OLAP queries using aggregate r–trees,Nikos Mamoulis; Spiridon Bakiras; Panos Kalnis,Abstract A top-k OLAP query groups measures with respect to some abstraction level ofinteresting dimensions and selects the k groups with the highest aggregate value. Anexample of such a query is “find the 10 combinations of product-type and month with thelargest sum of sales”. Such queries may also be applied in a spatial database context;where objects are augmented with some measures that must be aggregated according to aspatial division. For instance; consider a map of objects (eg; restaurants); where each objectcarries some non-spatial measure (eg; the number of customers served during the lastmonth). Given a partitioning of the space into regions (eg; by a regular grid); the goal is tofind the regions with the highest number of served customers. A straightforward method toevaluate a top-k OLAP query is to compute the aggregate value for each group and then …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,12

Efficient evaluation of multiple preference queries,Nikos Mamoulis; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Consider multiple users searching for a hotel room; based on size; cost; distance to thebeach; etc. Users may have variable preferences expressed by different weights on theattributes of the searched objects. Although individual preference queries can be evaluatedby selecting the object in the database with the highest aggregate score; in the case ofmultiple requests at the same time; a single object cannot be assigned to more than oneusers. The challenge is to compute a fair 1-1 matching between the queries and a subset ofthe objects. We model this as a stable-marriage problem and propose an efficient techniquefor its evaluation. Our algorithm is an iterative process; which finds at each step the query-object pair with the highest score and removes it from the problem. This is done efficiently bymaintaining and matching the skyline of the remaining objects with the remaining queries …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,11
Processing ad-hoc joins on mobile devices,Eric Lo; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung; Wai Shing Ho; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Mobile devices are capable of retrieving and processing data from remotedatabases. In a wireless data transmission environment; users are typically charged by thesize of transferred data; rather than the amount of time they stay connected. We proposealgorithms that join information from non-collaborative remote databases on mobile devices.Our methods minimize the data transferred during the join process; by also considering thelimitations of mobile devices. Experimental results show that our approach can perform joinprocessing on mobile devices effectively.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,11
Recommending packages to groups,Shuyao Qi; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massive research effortin both industry and academia. Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggestpackages of items to single users; or single items to groups of users. However; to the best ofour knowledge; the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users(P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications;such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups; entertainment packages togroups of friends; or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper; we formulate theP2G problem; and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a grouptowards a package; incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We alsoinvestigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,10
Efficient time-stamped event sequence anonymization,Reza Sherkat; Jing Li; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract With the rapid growth of applications which generate timestamped sequences (clickstreams; GPS trajectories; RFID sequences); sequence anonymization has become animportant problem; in that should such data be published or shared. Existing trajectoryanonymization techniques disregard the importance of time or the sensitivity of events. Thisarticle is the first; to our knowledge; thorough study on time-stamped event sequenceanonymization. We propose a novel and tunable generalization framework tailored to eventsequences. We generalize time stamps using time intervals and events using a taxonomywhich models the domain semantics. We consider two scenarios:(i) sharing the data with asingle receiver (the SSR setting); where the receiver's background knowledge is confined toa set of time stamps and time generalization suffices; and (ii) sharing the data with …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2013,10

Efficient quantile retrieval on multi-dimensional data,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,Abstract Given a set of N multi-dimensional points; we study the computation of φ-quantilesaccording to a ranking function F; which is provided by the user at runtime. Specifically; Fcomputes a score based on the coordinates of each point; our objective is to report theobject whose score is the φN-th smallest in the dataset. φ-quantiles provide a succinctsummary about the F-distribution of the underlying data; which is useful for online decisionsupport; data mining; selectivity estimation; query optimization; etc. Assuming that thedataset is indexed by a spatial access method; we propose several algorithms for retrievinga quantile efficiently. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that a branch-and-bound method is highly effective in practice; outperforming alternative approaches by asignificant factor.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,10
Complex spatial query processing,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias; Dinos Arkoumanis,Abstract The user of a Geographical Information System is not limited to conventional spatialselections and joins; but may also pose more complicated and descriptive queries. In thispaper; we focus on the efficient processing and optimization of complex spatial queries thatinvolve combinations of spatial selections and joins. Our contribution is manifold; we firstprovide formulae that accurately estimate the selectivity of such queries. These formulae;paired with cost models for selections and joins can be used to combine spatial operators inan optimal way. Second; we propose algorithms that process spatial joins and selectionssimultaneously and are typically more efficient than combinations of simple operators.Finally we study the problem of optimizing complex spatial queries using these operators; byproviding (i) cost models; and (ii) rules that reduce the optimization space significantly …,GeoInformatica,2004,10

Personalized location recommendation by aggregating multiple recommenders in diversity,Ziyu Lu; Hao Wang; Nikos Mamoulis; Wenting Tu; David W Cheung,Abstract Location recommendation is an important feature of social network applications andlocation-based services. Most existing studies focus on developing one single method ormodel for all users. By analyzing data from two real location-based social networks(Foursquare and Gowalla); in this paper we reveal that the decisions of users on place visitsdepend on multiple factors; and different users may be affected differently by these factors.We design a location recommendation framework that combines results from variousrecommenders that consider different factors. Our framework estimates; for each individualuser; the underlying influence of each factor to her. Based on the estimation; we aggregatesuggestions from different recommenders to derive personalized recommendations.Experiments on Foursquare and Gowalla show that our proposed method outperforms …,GeoInformatica,2017,9
Efficient point-based trajectory search,Shuyao Qi; Panagiotis Bouros; Dimitris Sacharidis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Trajectory data capture the traveling history of moving objects such as people orvehicles. With the proliferation of GPS and tracking technology; huge volumes of trajectoriesare rapidly generated and collected. Under this; applications such as route recommendationand traveling behavior mining call for efficient trajectory retrieval. In this paper; we first focuson distance-based trajectory search; given a collection of trajectories and a set query points;the goal is to retrieve the top-k trajectories that pass as close as possible to all query points.We advance the state-of-the-art by combining existing approaches to a hybrid method andalso proposing an alternative; more efficient range-based approach. Second; we proposeand study the practical variant of bounded distance-based search; which takes into accountthe temporal characteristics of the searched trajectories.

Versatile size-$ l $ object summaries for relational keyword search,Georgios J Fakas; Zhi Cai; Nikos Mamoulis,The Object Summary (OS) is a recently proposed tree structure; which summarizes all dataheld in a relational database about a data subject. An OS can potentially be very large insize and therefore unfriendly for users who wish to view synoptic information about the datasubject. In this paper; we investigate the effective and efficient retrieval of concise andinformative OS snippets (denoted as size-l OSs). We propose and investigate theeffectiveness of two types of size-l OSs; namely size-l OS (t) s and size-l OS (a) s that consistof l tuple nodes and l attribute nodes respectively. For computing size-l OSs; we propose anoptimal dynamic programming algorithm; two greedy algorithms and preprocessingheuristics. By collecting feedback from real users (eg; from DBLP authors); we assess therelative usability of the two different types of snippets; the choice of the size-l parameter …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,9
A fair assignment algorithm for multiple preference queries,Nikos Mamoulis; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract Consider an internship assignment system; where at the end of each academicyear; interested university students search and apply for available positions; based on theirpreferences (eg; nature of the job; salary; office location; etc). In a variety of facility; task orposition assignment contexts; users have personal preferences expressed by differentweights on the attributes of the searched objects. Although individual preference queriescan be evaluated by selecting the object in the database with the highest aggregate score;in the case of multiple simultaneous requests; a single object cannot be assigned to morethan one users. The challenge is to compute a fair 1--1 matching between the queries andthe objects. We model this as a stable-marriage problem and propose an efficient method forits processing.

Lattice histograms: a resilient synopsis structure,Panagiotis Karras; Nikos Mamoulis,Despite the surge of interest in data reduction techniques over the past years; no methodhas been proposed to date that can always achieve approximation quality preferable to thatof the optimal plain histogram for a target error metric. In this paper; we introduce the LatticeHistogram: a novel data reduction method that discovers and exploits any arbitrary hierarchyin the data; and achieves approximation quality provably at least as high as an optimalhistogram for any data reduction problem. We formulate LH construction techniques withapproximation guarantees for general error metrics. We show that the case of minimizing amaximum-error metric can be solved by a specialized; memory-sparing approach; we exploitthis solution to design reduced-space heuristics for the general-error case.

Constraint satisfaction in semi-structured data graphs,Nikos Mamoulis; Kostas Stergiou,Abstract XML data can be modeled as node-labeled graphs and XML queries can beexpressed by structural relationships between labeled elements. XML query evaluation hasbeen addressed using mainly database; and in some cases graph search; techniques. Wepropose an alternative method that models and solves such queries as constraintsatisfaction problems (CSPs). We describe common constraint types occurring in XMLqueries and show how query evaluation can benefit from methods for preprocessing andsolving CSPs. We identify an important non-binary constraint that is a common module ofXML queries and describe a generalized arc consistency algorithm with low cost that canensure polynomial query evaluation. Finally; we demonstrate that maintaining theconsistency of such non-binary constraints can greatly accelerate search in intractable …,International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming,2004,9
Improving search using indexing: a study with temporal CSPs,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Most studies concerning constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) involve variables that takevalues from small domains. This paper deals with an alternative form of temporal CSPs; thenumber of variables is relatively small and the domains are large collections of intervals.Such situations may arise in temporal databases where several types of queries can bemodeled and processed as CSPs. For these problems; systematic CSP algorithms can takeadvantage of temporal indexing to accelerate search. Directed search versions ofchronological backtracking and forward checking are presented and tested.

Conceptual Title Abstractions: Modeling and Querying Very Large Interactive Multimedia Repositories.,Elina Megalou; Thanasis Hadzilacos; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Organised units of interactive multimedia material; called “titles”; are becomingrapidly available beyond their original format; namely Compact Disks; and they appear inDigital Libraries and on the Web. For large collections of such titles; browsers and querymechanisms addressing the multimedia assets alone while reasonably well developed areinadequate: we lack techniques for efficient generic retrieval of structured multimediainformation. In this paper we present the notion of conceptual title abstractions; arepresentation of one or more titles that captures and abstracts at a variable level of detailthe structure; interactivity and generic content of the represented titles. We develop analgebra for title abstractions-which form a partial order-and present a language which canbe used for specifying and abstracting titles.

Time-Sensitive Opinion Mining for Prediction.,Wenting Tu; David Wai-Lok Cheung; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Users commonly use Web 2.0 platforms to post their opinions and their predictionsabout future events (eg; the movement of a stock). Therefore; opinion mining can be used asa tool for predicting future events. Previous work on opinion mining extracts from the textonly the polarity of opinions as sentiment indicators. We observe that a typical opinion postalso contains temporal references which can improve prediction. This short paper presentsour preliminary work on extracting reference time tags and integrating them into an opinionmining model; in order to improve the accuracy of future event prediction. We conduct anexperimental evaluation using a collection of microblogs posted by investors to demonstratethe effectiveness of our approach.,AAAI,2015,8
Continuous spatial assignment of moving users,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Consider a set of servers and a set of users; where each server has a coverageregion (ie; an area of service) and a capacity (ie; a maximum number of users it can serve).Our task is to assign every user to one server subject to the coverage and capacityconstraints. To offer the highest quality of service; we wish to minimize the average distancebetween users and their assigned server. This is an instance of a well-studied problem inoperations research; termed optimal assignment. Even though there exist several solutionsfor the static case (where user locations are fixed); there is currently no method for dynamicsettings. In this paper; we consider the continuous assignment problem (CAP); where anoptimal assignment must be constantly maintained between mobile users and a set ofservers. The fact that the users are mobile necessitates real-time reassignment so that the …,The VLDB Journal,2010,8
Detecting the direction of motion in a binary sensor network,Panagiotis Karras; Nikos Mamoulis,We examine the problem of detecting the direction of motion in a binary sensor network; insuch a network each sensor's value is supplied reliably in a single bit of information: whetherthe moving object is approaching towards or moving away from the sensor. We demonstratethat the geometric properties of the network itself can be exploited for the detection ofmovement direction; from a single instance of sensor reading only. Moreover the estimationis performed in a distributed processing fashion; with only a minimal data collection atsituation-dependent leading sensors and features a low computational burden on eachsensor. In addition; different detection instances drain the resources of different groups ofsensors; of a small size compared to the size of the whole network.

Efficient notification of meeting points for moving groups via independent safe regions,Jing Li; Jeppe Rishede Thomsen; Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,In applications like social networking services and online games; multiple moving userswhich form a group may wish to be continuously notified about the best meeting point fromtheir locations. A promising technique for reducing the communication frequency of theapplication server is to employ safe regions; which capture the validity of query results withrespect to the users' locations. Unfortunately; the safe regions in our problem exhibitcharacteristics such as irregular shapes and inter-dependencies; which render existingmethods that compute a single safe region inapplicable to our problem. To tackle thesechallenges; we first examine the shapes of safe regions in our problem's context andpropose feasible approximations for them. We design efficient algorithms for computingthese safe regions. We also study a variant of the problem called the sum-optimal …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,7
Image similarity retrieval by spatial constraints,Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Meretakis,1. ABSTRACT This paper deals with queries involving the retrieval of images that containcertain object configurations. Consider; for instance; that a user wants to" find all imageswhere there exists a building adjacent to the west side of a park which is southwest and neara commercial center". This query can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem(CSF) where the query variables are nodes of the corresponding constraint network and theimage objects constitute the domain of each variable. The arcs of the network correspond tospatial constraints (eg; adjacent л west (Xi; X2); southwest л near (X2; X3)). Problems of theabove nature are; in general; intractable. In addition; spatial constraints (eg; southwest;near) lack universally accepted semantics and cannot always be modeled by crisp relations;a fact that further complicates query processing.

Fairness in package-to-group recommendations,Dimitris Serbos; Shuyao Qi; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Recommending packages of items to groups of users has several applications;including recommending vacation packages to groups of tourists; entertainment packages togroups of friends; or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper; we focus on a novelaspect of package-to-group recommendations; that of fairness. Specifically; when werecommend a package to a group of people; we ask that this recommendation is fair in thesense that every group member is satisfied by a sufficient number of items in the package.We explore two definitions of fairness and show that for either definition the problem offinding the most fair package is NP-hard. We exploit the fact that our problem can bemodeled as a coverage problem; and we propose greedy algorithms that find approximatesolutions within reasonable time. In addition; we study two extensions of the problem …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,6
Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding for Meta Path based Proximity,Zhipeng Huang; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract: A network embedding is a representation of a large graph in a low-dimensionalspace; where vertices are modeled as vectors. The objective of a good embedding is topreserve the proximity between vertices in the original graph. This way; typical search andmining methods can be applied in the embedded space with the help of off-the-shelfmultidimensional indexing approaches. Existing network embedding techniques focus onhomogeneous networks; where all vertices are considered to belong to a single class.Subjects: Artificial Intelligence (cs.

SPARTex: a vertex-centric framework for RDF data analytics,Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Razen Harbi; Semih Salihoglu; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract A growing number of applications require combining SPARQL queries with genericgraph search on RDF data. However; the lack of procedural capabilities in SPARQL makes itinappropriate for graph analytics. Moreover; RDF engines focus on SPARQL queryevaluation whereas graph management frameworks perform only generic graphcomputations. In this work; we bridge the gap by introducing SPARTex; an RDF analyticsframework based on the vertex-centric computation model. In SPARTex; user-defined vertexcentric programs can be invoked from SPARQL as stored procedures. SPARTex allows theexecution of a pipeline of graph algorithms without the need for multiple reads/writes of inputdata and intermediate results. We use a cost-based optimizer for minimizing thecommunication cost. SPARTex evaluates queries that combine SPARQL and generic …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,6
Geo-social co-location mining,Michael Weiler; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz,Abstract Modern technology to capture geo-spatial information produces a huge flood of geo-spatial and geo-spatio-temporal data with a new user mentality of utilizing this technology tovoluntarily share information. This location information; enriched with social information; is anew source to discover new and useful knowledge. This work introduces geo-social co-location mining; the problem of finding social groups that are frequently found at the samelocation. This problem has applications in social sciences; allowing to research interactionsbetween social groups and permitting social-link prediction. It can be divided into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem of finding spatial co-location instances; requires to properlyaddress the inherent uncertainty in geo-social network data; which is a consequence ofgenerally very sparse check-in data; and thus very sparse trajectory information.

Diverse and proportional size-l object summaries for keyword search,Georgios Fakas; Zhi Cai; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract The abundance and ubiquity of graphs (eg; Online Social Networks such asGoogle+ and Facebook; bibliographic graphs such as DBLP) necessitates the effective andefficient search over them. Given a set of keywords that can identify a Data Subject (DS); arecently proposed relational keyword search paradigm produces; as a query result; a set ofObject Summaries (OSs). An OS is a tree structure rooted at the DS node (ie; a tuplecontaining the keywords) with surrounding nodes that summarize all data held on the graphabout the DS. OS snippets; denoted as size-l OSs; have also been investigated. Size-l OSsare partial OSs containing l nodes such that the summation of their importance scoresresults in the maximum possible total score. However; the set of nodes that maximize thetotal importance score may result in an uninformative size-l OSs; as very important nodes …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,6
Activity-partner recommendation,Wenting Tu; David W Cheung; Nikos Mamoulis; Min Yang; Ziyu Lu,Abstract In many activities; such as watching movies or having dinner; people prefer to findpartners before participation. Therefore; when recommending activity items (eg; movietickets) to users; it makes sense to also recommend suitable activity partners. This way;(i) theusers save time for finding activity partners;(ii) the effectiveness of the item recommendationis increased (users may prefer activity items more if they can find suitable activitypartners);(iii) recommender systems become more interesting and enkindle users' socialenthusiasm. In this paper; we identify the usefulness of suggesting activity partners togetherwith items in recommender systems. In addition; we propose and compare several methodsfor activity-partner recommendation.

Dominance relationship analysis with budget constraints,Shen Ge; Nikos Mamoulis; David WL Cheung,Abstract Creating a new product that dominates all its competitors is one of the mainobjectives in marketing. Nevertheless; this might not be feasible since in practice thedevelopment process is confined by some constraints; eg; limited funding or low targetselling price. We model these constraints by a constraint function; which determines thefeasible characteristics of a new product. Given such a budget; our task is to decide the bestpossible features of the new product that maximize its profitability. In general; a product ismarketable if it dominates a large set of existing products; while it is not dominated by many.Based on this; we define dominance relationship analysis and use it to measure theprofitability of the new product. The decision problem is then modeled as a budgetconstrained optimization query (BOQ). Computing BOQ is challenging due to the …,Knowledge and information systems,2015,6
Efficient top-k spatial distance joins,Shuyao Qi; Panagiotis Bouros; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Consider two sets of spatial objects R and S; where each object is assigned a score(eg; ranking). Given a spatial distance threshold ε and an integer k; the top-k spatial distancejoin (k-SDJ) returns the k pairs of objects; which have the highest combined score (based onan aggregate function γ) among all object pairs in R× S which have spatial distance at mostε. Despite the practical application value of this query; it has not received adequate attentionin the past. In this paper; we fill this gap by proposing methods that utilize both location andscore information from the objects; enabling top-k join computation by accessing a limitednumber of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a technique which accessesblocks of data from R and S ordered by the object scores and then joins them using an aR-tree based module performs best in practice and outperforms alternative solutions by a …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,6
Continuous inverse ranking queries in uncertain streams,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract This paper introduces a scalable approach for continuous inverse ranking onuncertain streams. An uncertain stream is a stream of object instances with confidences; egobserved positions of moving objects derived from a sensor. The confidence value assignedto each instance reflects the likelihood that the instance conforms with the current true objectstate. The inverse ranking query retrieves the rank of a given query object according to agiven score function. In this paper we present a framework that is able to update the queryresult very efficiently; as the stream provides new observations of the objects. We willtheoretically and experimentally show that the query update can be performed in linear timecomplexity. We conduct an experimental evaluation on synthetic data; which demonstratesthe efficiency of our approach.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,6
Extracting k most important groups from data efficiently,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Vagelis Hristidis,Abstract We study an important data analysis operator; which extracts the k most importantgroups from data (ie; the k groups with the highest aggregate values). In a data warehousingcontext; an example of the above query is “find the 10 combinations of product-type andmonth with the largest sum of sales”. The problem is challenging as the potential number ofgroups can be much larger than the memory capacity. We propose on-demand methods forefficient top-k groups processing; under limited memory size. In particular; we design top-kgroups retrieval techniques for three representative scenarios as follows. For the scenariowith data physically ordered by measure; we propose the write-optimized multi-pass sortedaccess algorithm (WMSA); that exploits available memory for efficient top-k groupscomputation. Regarding the scenario with unordered data; we develop the recursive hash …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2008,6
Continuous constraint query evaluation for spatiotemporal streams,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,Abstract In this paper we study the evaluation of continuous constraint queries (CCQs) forspatiotemporal streams. A CCQ triggers an alert whenever a configuration of constraintsbetween streaming events in space and time are satisfied. Consider; for instance; a serverthat receives updates from GPS-enabled agents that report their positions and othermeasurements (eg; environmental readings). An example of CCQ is:“Alert whenever at least5 readings closer than 5km to each other and within a time difference of 5 minutes reporthigh pressures and low temperatures”. We model CCQs as Constraint Satisfaction Problems(CSPs) and develop solutions for their continuous evaluation. Our techniques (1) considerthe fast arrival rate of incoming events; and (2) minimize the memory requirements; withoutusing predefined window constraints; but by utilizing the structure of the queries.

A topic-based reviewer assignment system,Ngai Meng Kou; Nikos Mamoulis; Yuhong Li; Ye Li; Zhiguo Gong,Abstract Peer reviewing is a widely accepted mechanism for assessing the quality ofsubmitted articles to scientific conferences or journals. Conference management systems(CMS) are used by conference organizers to invite appropriate reviewers and assign them tosubmitted papers. Typical CMS rely on paper bids entered by the reviewers and applysimple matching algorithms to compute the paper assignment. In this paper; we demonstrateour Reviewer Assignment System (RAS); which has advanced features compared to broadlyused CMSs. First; RAS automatically extracts the profiles of reviewers and submissions inthe form of topic vectors. These profiles can be used to automatically assign reviewers topapers without relying on a bidding process; which can be tedious and error-prone.

A revisit to social network-based recommender systems,Hui Li; Dingming Wu; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract With the rapid expansion of online social networks; social network-basedrecommendation has become a meaningful and effective way of suggesting new items oractivities to users. In this paper; we propose two methods to improve the performance of thestate-of-art social network-based recommender system (SNRS); which is based on aprobabilistic model. Our first method classifies the correlations between pairs of users'ratings. The other is making the system robust to sparse data; ie; few immediate friendshaving few common ratings with the target user. Our experimental study demonstrates thatour techniques significantly improve the accuracy of SNRS.,Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval,2014,5
Ring-constrained join: deriving fair middleman locations from pointsets via a geometric constraint,Man Lung Yiu; Panagiotis Karras; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract We introduce a novel spatial join operator; the ring-constrained join (RCJ). Giventwo sets P and Q of spatial points; the result of RCJ consists of pairs (p; q)(where p ε P; q ε Q)satisfying an intuitive geometric constraint: the smallest circle enclosing p and q contains noother points in P; Q. This new operation has important applications in decision support; eg;placing recycling stations at fair locations between restaurants and residential complexes.Clearly; RCJ is defined based on a geometric constraint but not on distances betweenpoints. Thus; our operation is fundamentally different from the conventional distance joinsand closest pairs problems. We are not aware of efficient processing algorithms for RCJ inthe literature. A brute-force solution requires computational cost quadratic to input size and itdoes not scale well for large datasets. In view of this; we develop efficient R-tree based …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,5
Querying by Spatial Structure,Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Vasilis Delis,Abstract: Structural queries constitute a special form of content-based retrieval where theuser specifies a set of spatial constraints among query variables and searches for allconfigurations of actual objects that (totally or partially) match these constraints. Processingof such queries can be thought of as a general form of spatial joins; ie; instead of pairs; theresult consists of n-tuples of objects; where n is the number of query variables. In this paperwe propose a flexible framework which permits the representation of configurations indifferent resolution levels and supports the automatic derivation of similarity measures. Wesubsequently describe three algorithms for structural query processing which integrateconstraint satisfaction with spatial indexing. For each algorithm we apply severaloptimization techniques and experimentally evaluate performance using real data.,Proceedings of VLDB,1998,5
Set containment join revisited,Panagiotis Bouros; Nikos Mamoulis; Shen Ge; Manolis Terrovitis,Abstract Given two collections of set objects R and S; the R ⋈ _ ⊆ SR⋈⊆ S set containmentjoin returns all object pairs (r; s) ∈ R * S (r; s)∈ R× S such that r ⊆ sr⊆ s. Besides being abasic operator in all modern data management systems with a wide range of applications;the join can be used to evaluate complex SQL queries based on relational division and as amodule of data mining algorithms. The state-of-the-art algorithm for set containment joins(PRETTI PRETTI) builds an inverted index on the right-hand collection S and a prefix tree onthe left-hand collection R that groups set objects with common prefixes and thus; avoidsredundant processing. In this paper; we present a framework which improves PRETTIPRETTI in two directions. First; we limit the prefix tree construction by proposing an adaptivemethodology based on a cost model; this way; we can greatly reduce the space and time …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2016,4
Lightweight privacy-preserving peer-to-peer data integration,Ye Zhang; Wai-Kit Wong; Siu-Ming Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Abstract Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) are an attractive solution for managingdistributed heterogeneous information. When a peer (client) requests data from another peer(server) with a different schema; translations of the query and its answer are done by asequence of intermediate peers (translators). There are two privacy issues in this P2P dataintegration process:(i) answer privacy: no unauthorized parties (including the translators)should learn the query result;(ii) mapping privacy: the schema and the value mappings usedby the translators to perform the translation should not be revealed to other peers.Elmeleegy and Ouzzani proposed the PPP protocol that is the first to support privacy-preserving querying in PDMS. However; PPP suffers from several shortcomings. First; PPPdoes not satisfy the requirement of answer privacy; because it is based on commutative …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,4
Special issue on data management for mobile services,Ralf Hartmut Güting; Nikos Mamoulis,Small; GPS-enabled and wireless networked mobile devices such as mobile phones;personal digital assistants; or car navigation systems have become powerful; affordable; andwide-spread. Not only do these devices interact with the environment such as local servicesand facilities; searching for useful information; but they are also capable of collecting andtransmitting position data. There is a need for addressing both aspects; of supporting onlineservices by managing the locations of large sets of currently moving users; and of analyzingenormous volumes of captured trajectory data. The latter may in particular be useful forimproving mobile services. This special issue focuses on managing information aboutmoving objects in space and time; both for online applications and for analysis of'historical'trajectory data.

A data-mining approach for multiple structural alignment of proteins,Wing-Yan Siu; Nikos Mamoulis; Siu-Ming Yiu; Ho-Leung Chan,Abstract Comparing the 3D structures of proteins is an important but computationally hardproblem in bioinformatics. In this paper; we propose studying the problem when much lessinformation or assumptions are available. We model the structural alignment of proteins as acombinatorial problem. In the problem; each protein is simply a set of points in the 3D space;without sequence order information; and the objective is to discover all large enoughalignments for any subset of the input. We propose a data-mining approach for this problem.We first perform geometric hashing of the structures such that points with similar locations inthe 3D space are hashed into the same bin in the hash table. The novelty is that we considereach bin as a coincidence group and mine for frequent patterns; which is a well-studiedtechnique in data mining. We observe that these frequent patterns are already potentially …,Bioinformation,2010,4
Evaluation of spatial pattern queries in sensor networks,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Spiridon Bakiras,Abstract We study the continuous evaluation of spatial join queries and extensions thereof;defined by interesting combinations of sensor readings (events) that co-occur in a spatialneighborhood. An example of such a pattern is “a high temperature reading in the vicinity ofat least four high-pressure readings”. We devise protocols for 'in-network'evaluation of thisclass of queries; aiming at the minimization of power consumption. In addition; we developcost models that suggest the appropriateness of each protocol; based on various factors;including selectivity of query elements; energy requirements for sensing; and networktopology. Finally; we experimentally compare the effectiveness of the proposed solutions onan experimental platform that emulates real sensor networks.,University of Hong Kong; Tech. Rep.

Ad-hoc distributed spatial joins on mobile devices,Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Spiridon Bakiras; Xiaochen Li,PDAs; cellular phones and other mobile devices are now capable of supporting complexdata manipulation operations. Here; we focus on ad-hoc spatial joins of datasets residing inmultiple non-cooperative servers. Assuming that there is no mediator available; the spatialjoins must be evaluated on the mobile device. Contrary to common applications thatconsider the cost at the server side; our main issue is the minimization of the transferreddata; while meeting the resource constraints of the device. We show that existing methods;based on partitioning and pruning; are inadequate in many realistic situations. Then; wepresent novel algorithms that estimate the data distribution before deciding the physicaloperator independently for each partition. Our experiments with a prototype implementationon a WiFi-enabled PDA; suggest that the proposed methods outperform the competitors …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2006.

Local suppression and splitting techniques for privacy preserving publication of trajectories,Manolis Terrovitis; Giorgos Poulis; Nikos Mamoulis; Spiros Skiadopoulos,We study the problem of preserving user privacy in the publication of location sequences.Consider a database of trajectories; corresponding to movements of people; captured bytheir transactions when they use credit cards; RFID debit cards; or NFC (http://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication) compliant devices. We show that; if such trajectoriesare published exactly (by only hiding the identities of persons that followed them); one canuse partial trajectory knowledge as a quasi-identifier for the remaining locations in thesequence. We devise four intuitive techniques; based on combinations of locationssuppression and trajectories splitting; and we show that they can prevent privacy breacheswhile keeping published data accurate for aggregate query answering and frequent subsetsdata mining.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,3
Investment recommendation using investor opinions in social media,Wenting Tu; David W Cheung; Nikos Mamoulis; Min Yang; Ziyu Lu,Abstract Investor social media; such as StockTwist; are gaining increasing popularity. Thesesites allow users to post their investing opinions and suggestions in the form of microblogs.Given the growth of the posted data; a significant and challenging research problem is howto utilize the personal wisdom and different viewpoints in these opinions to help investment.Previous work aggregates sentiments related to stocks and generates buy or holdrecommendations for stocks obtaining favorable votes while suggesting sell or short actionsfor stocks with negative votes. However; considering the fact that there always existunreasonable or misleading posts; sentiment aggregation should be improved to be robustto noise. In this paper; we improve investment recommendation by modeling and using thequality of each investment opinion. To model the quality of an opinion; we use multiple …,Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2016,3
Top-k relevant semantic place retrieval on spatial RDF data,Jieming Shi; Dingming Wu; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract RDF data are traditionally accessed using structured query languages; such asSPARQL. However; this requires users to understand the language as well as the RDFschema. Keyword search on RDF data aims at relieving the user from these requirements;the user only inputs a set of keywords and the goal is to find small RDF subgraphs whichcontain all keywords. At the same time; popular RDF knowledge bases also include spatialsemantics; which opens the road to location-based search operations. In this work; wepropose and study a novel location-based keyword search query on RDF data. Theobjective of top-k relevant semantic places (kSP) retrieval is to find RDF subgraphs whichcontain the query keywords and are rooted at spatial entities close to the query location. Thenovelty of kSP queries is that they are location-aware and that they do not rely on the use …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,3
Textually relevant spatial skylines,Jieming Shi; Dingming Wu; Nikos Mamoulis,We study the modeling and evaluation of a spatio-textual skyline (STS) query; in which theskyline points are selected not only based on their distances to a set of query locations; butalso based on their relevance to a set of query keywords. STS is especially relevant tomodern applications; where points of interest are typically augmented with textualdescriptions. We investigate three models for integrating textual relevance into the spatialskyline. Among them; model STD; which combines spatial distance with textual relevance ina derived dimensional space; is found to be the most effective one. STD computes a skylinewhich not only satisfies the intent of STS; but also has a small and easy-to-interpret size. Wepropose an efficient algorithm for computing STD-based skylines; which operates on an IR-tree that indexes the data.

Clustering in geo-social networks,Dingming Wu; Nikos Mamoulis; Jieming Shi,The rapid growth of Geo-Social Networks (GeoSNs) provides a new and rich form of data.Users of GeoSNs can capture their geographic locations and share them with other usersvia an operation named checkin. Thus; GeoSNs can track the connections (and the time ofthese connections) of geographic data to their users. In addition; the users are organized ina social network; which can be extended to a heterogeneous network if the connections toplaces via checkins are also considered. The goal of this paper is to analyze theopportunities in clustering this rich form of data. We first present a model for clusteringgeographic locations; based on GeoSN data. Then; we discuss how this model can beextended to consider temporal information from checkins. Finally; we study how theaccuracy of community detection approaches can be improved by taking into account the …,Bulletin of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Data Engineering,2015,3
A collective topic model for milestone paper discovery,Ziyu Lu; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Abstract Prior arts stay at the foundation for future work in academic research. However theincreasingly large amount of publications makes it difficult for researchers to effectivelydiscover the most important previous works to the topic of their research.

Similarity search on uncertain spatio-temporal data,Johannes Niedermayer; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Nikos Mamoulis; Lei Chen; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract In this work; we address the problem of similarity search in a database of uncertainspatio-temporal objects. Each object is defined by a set of observations ((time; location)-tuples) and a Markov chain which describes the objects uncertain motion in space and time.To model similarity-which is an important building block for many applications such asidentifying frequent motion patterns or trajectory clustering-we employ the well-knownLongest Common Subsequence (LCSS) measure; which becomes a distribution onuncertain spatio-temporal data (ULCSS). We show how the aligned version (without timeshifting) of the ULCSS can be exactly computed in PTIME; which is also verified by extensiveexperiments.,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2013,3

Efficient warping of segmented time-series,Yutao Shou; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Abstract Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has been proven a very effective similarity measurefor time-series. However; its quadratic cost to the length of the matched sequences makes itsdirect application on databases of long time-series very expensive. We propose a techniquethat decomposes the sequences into a number of segments and uses cheap approximationsthereof to compute fast lower bounds for their warping distances. We present several;progressively tighter bounds; relying on the existence or not of warping constraints. Finally;we develop an index and a multi-step technique that uses the proposed bounds andperforms two levels of filtering to efficiently process similarity queries. A thoroughexperimental study suggests that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-artmethods for DTW similarity search.,Tech. rep.; HKU CSIS Tech rep; TR-2004-01,2004,3
Snapshot and continuous points-based trajectory search,Shuyao Qi; Dimitris Sacharidis; Panagiotis Bouros; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Trajectory data capture the traveling history of moving objects such as people orvehicles. With the proliferation of GPS and tracking technologies; huge volumes oftrajectories are rapidly generated and collected. Under this; applications such as routerecommendation and traveling behavior mining call for efficient trajectory retrieval. In thispaper; we first focus on distance-to-points trajectory search; given a collection of trajectoriesand a set query points; the goal is to retrieve the top-k trajectories that pass as close aspossible to all query points. We advance the state-of-the-art by combining existingapproaches to a hybrid nearest neighbor-based method while also proposing an alternative;more efficient spatial range-based approach.

Hbgg: a hierarchical Bayesian geographical model for group recommendation,Ziyu Lu; Hui Li; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Abstract Location-based social networks such as Foursquare and Plancast have gainedincreasing popularity. On those sites; users can organize and participate in group activities;hence; recommending venues to a group is of practical importance. In this paper; we studythe problem of recommending venues to groups of users and propose a HierarchicalBayesian Model (HBGG) for this purpose. First; a generative group geographical topic model(GG) which exploits group membership; group mobility regions and group preferences isproposed. And we integrate social structure into one-class collaborative filtering as social-based collaborative filtering (SOCF) to leverage social wisdom.

Extended characteristic sets: graph indexing for SPARQL query optimization,Marios Meimaris; George Papastefanatos; Nikos Mamoulis; Ioannis Anagnostopoulos,SPARQL query execution in state of the art RDF engines depends on; and is often limited bythe underlying storage and indexing schemes. Typically; these systems exhaustively storepermutations of the standard three-column triples table. However; even though RDF cangive birth to datasets with loosely defined schemas; it is common for an emerging structureto appear in the data. In this paper; we introduce a novel indexing scheme for RDF data; thattakes advantage of the inherent structure of triples. To this end; we define the ExtendedCharacteristic Set (ECS); a schema abstraction that classifies triples based on the propertiesof their subjects and objects; and we discuss methods and algorithms for the identificationand extraction of ECSs. We show how these can be used to assist query processing; and weimplement axonDB; an RDF storage and querying engine based on ECS indexing.

Maximizing a Record’s Standing in a Relation,Yilun Cai; Yu Tang; Nikos Mamoulis,Given a database table with records that can be ranked; an interesting problem is to identifyselection conditions for the table; which are qualified by an input record and render itsranking as high as possible among the qualifying tuples. In this paper; we study thisstanding maximization problem; which finds application in object promotion andcharacterization. After showing the hardness of the problem; we propose greedy methods;which are experimentally shown to achieve high accuracy compared to exhaustiveenumeration; while scaling very well to the problem input size.

Improving Microblog Retrieval from Exterior Corpus by Automatically Constructing Microblogging Corpus.,Wenting Tu; David Wai-Lok Cheung; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract A large-scale training corpus consisting of microblogs belonging to a desiredcategory is important for highaccuracy microblog retrieval. Obtaining such a large-scalemicroblgging corpus manually is very time and laborconsuming. Therefore; some models forthe automatic retrieval of microblogs from an exterior corpus have been proposed. However;these approaches may fail in considering microblog-specific features. To alleviate this issue;we propose a methodology that constructs a simulated microblogging corpus rather thandirectly building a model from the exterior corpus. The performance of our model is bettersince the microblog-special knowledge of the microblogging corpus is used in the end bythe retrieval model. Experimental results on real-world microblogs demonstrate thesuperiority of our technique compared to the previous approaches.,AAAI,2015,2
Real-time detection and sorting of news on microblogging platforms,Wenting Tu; David Wai-Lok Cheung; Nikos Mamoulis; Min Yang; Ziyu Lu,Due to the increasing popularity of microblog-ging platforms (eg; Twitter); detecting real-Time news from microblogs (eg; tweets) has recently drawn a lot of attention. Most of theprevious work on this subject detect news by analyzing propagation patterns of microblogs.This approach has two limitations:(i) many non-news microblogs (eg marketing activi-Ties)have propagation patterns similar to news microblogs and therefore they can be false-lyreported as news;(ii) using propagation patterns to identify news involves a time de-lay untilthe pattern is formed; therefore news are not detected in real time. We propose analternative approach; which; motivated by the necessity of real-Time detection of news; doesnot rely on propagation of posts. More-over; we propose a real-Time sorting strategy thatorders the detected news microblogs us-ing a translational approach.

Continuous spatial assignment of moving users,U Leong Hou; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Consider a set of servers and a set of users; where each server has a coverageregion (ie; an area of service) and a capacity (ie; a maximum number of users it can serve).Our task is to assign every user to one server subject to the coverage and capacityconstraints. To offer the highest quality of service; we wish to minimize the average distancebetween users and their assigned server. This is an instance of a well-studied problem inoperations research; termed optimal assignment. Even though there exist several solutionsfor the static case (where user locations are fixed); there is currently no method for dynamicsettings. In this paper; we consider the continuous assignment problem (CAP); where anoptimal assignment must be constantly maintained between mobile users and a set ofservers. The fact that the users are mobile necessitates real-time reassignment so that the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,2

Spatio-temporal data mining,Nikos Mamoulis,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,2
Discovering minimal infrequent structures from xml documents,Wang Lian; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung; Siu-Ming Yiu,Abstract More and more data (documents) are wrapped in XML format. Mining thesedocuments involves mining the corresponding XML structures. However; the semi-structured(tree structured) XML makes it somewhat difficult for traditional data mining algorithms towork properly. Recently; several new algorithms were proposed to mine XML documents.These algorithms mainly focus on mining frequent tree structures from XML documents.However; none of them was designed for mining infrequent structures which are alsoimportant in many applications; such as query processing and identification of exceptionalcases. In this paper; we consider the problem of identifying infrequent tree structures fromXML documents. Intuitively; if a tree structure is infrequent; all tree structures that contain thissubtree is also infrequent. So; we propose to consider the minimal infrequent structure …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2004,2
More focus on what you care about: Personalized top reviews set,Wenting Tu; David W Cheung; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Users of e-commerce sites often read reviews of products before deciding topurchase them. Many commercial sites simply select the reviews with the highest quality;according to the votes they have received by users who read the reviews. However; recentwork has shown that such a selection may contain redundant information. Therefore; whileselecting top reviews; it has been proposed to also consider their coverage (ie; how manyproduct aspects are covered by them). The goal of this paper is to further improve the topreviews set; using personalization criteria. This is motivated by the fact that the importance ofproduct aspects to different users may vary and users prefer to focus on the most importantaspects to them. The objective of our work is to consider the personal preferences of users inreview recommendation; by selecting a personalized top reviews set (PTRS); which …,Neurocomputing,2017,1
A forward scan based plane sweep algorithm for parallel interval joins,Panagiotis Bouros; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract The interval join is a basic operation that finds application in temporal; spatial; anduncertain databases. Although a number of centralized and distributed algorithms havebeen proposed for the efficient evaluation of interval joins; classic plane sweep approacheshave not been considered at their full potential. A recent piece of related work proposes anoptimized approach based on plane sweep (PS) for modern hardware; showing that itgreatly outperforms previous work. However; this approach depends on the development ofa complex data structure and its parallelization has not been adequately studied. In thispaper; we explore the applicability of a largely ignored forward scan (FS) based planesweep algorithm; which is extremely simple to implement.

Diverse and proportional size-l object summaries using pairwise relevance,Georgios J Fakas; Zhi Cai; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract The abundance and ubiquity of graphs (eg; online social networks such asGoogle++ and Facebook; bibliographic graphs such as DBLP) necessitates the effective andefficient search over them. Given a set of keywords that can identify a data subject (DS); arecently proposed keyword search paradigm produces a set of object summaries (OSs) asresults. An OS is a tree structure rooted at the DS node (ie; a node containing the keywords)with surrounding nodes that summarize all data held on the graph about the DS. OSsnippets; denoted as size-l OSs; have also been investigated. A size-l OS is a partial OScontaining l nodes such that the summation of their importance scores results in themaximum possible total score. However; the set of nodes that maximize the total importancescore may result in an uninformative size-l OSs; as very important nodes may be repeated …,The VLDB Journal,2016,1
Scaling similarity joins over tree-structured data,Yu Tang; Yilun Cai; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Given a large collection of tree-structured objects (eg; XML documents); thesimilarity join finds the pairs of objects that are similar to each other; based on a similaritythreshold and a tree edit distance measure. The state-of-the-art similarity join methodscompare simpler approximations of the objects (eg; strings); in order to prune pairs thatcannot be part of the similarity join result based on distance bounds derived by theapproximations. In this paper; we propose a novel similarity join approach; which is basedon the dynamic decomposition of the tree objects into subgraphs; according to the similaritythreshold. Our technique avoids computing the exact distance between two tree objects; ifthe objects do not share at least one common subgraph. In order to scale up the join; thecomputed subgraphs are managed in a two-layer index. Our experimental results on real …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,1

Managing uncertain spatio-temporal data,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Andreas Zuefle; Lei Chen; Xiang Lian; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Many spatial query problems defined on uncertain data are computationallyexpensive; in particular; if in addition to spatial attributes; a time component is added.Although there exists a wide range of applications dealing with uncertain spatio-temporaldata; there is no solution for efficient management of such data available yet. This paper isthe first work to propose general models for spatio-temporal uncertain data that have thepotential to allow efficient processing on a wide range of queries. The main challenge hereis to unfold this potential by developing new algorithms based on these models. In addition;we give examples of interesting spatio-temporal queries on uncertain data.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Querying and Mining Uncertain Spatio-Temporal Data,2011,1
Privacy preservation in the publication of sparse multidimensional data,Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis; Panos Kalnis,Nowadays; most human activities leave some trace in a digital registry. Whether one buyssomething in a supermarket or gets admitted in the hospital; an entry to her credit cardhistory or to her medical record will be made. Data collected this way can be used toimprove the quality of services; eg; companies can adjust faster to the needs of theconsumers; or even contribute to science advancement; doctors can study the medicalhistories of thousands or even millions of patients. On the other hand; such data collectionspose a significant threat to the privacy of the individuals that are associated with them. Evenif some information that directly identifies a person (eg; the name or the social securitynumber) is removed from a database record; the individual that is associated to the recordcan be identified by linking the remaining information (eg; age; zip code of residence) to …,Privacy-Aware Knowledge Discovery: Novel Applications and New Techniques,2010,1
Temporal data mining,Nikos Mamoulis,There are two kinds of tables: frequency tables that display the count of respondents at thecrossing of the categorical attributes (in N) and magnitude tables that display information ona numerical attribute at the crossing of the categorical attributes (in R). For example; givensome census microdata containing attributes “Job” and “Town;” one can generate afrequency table displaying the count of respondents doing each job type in each town. If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,1

A filter index for complex queries on semi-structured data,Wang Lian; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Abstract Answering a query on XML data usually involves breaking it into a number of smallcomponents (eg; edges; paths; twigs; etc.); evaluating them and joining the results. In thispaper we propose an alternative technique that uses these components to filter a large partof the database that does not qualify them; before validating the query on the actual data.Our methodology uses a signature index to search fast and prune effectively the searchspace. The efficiency of the proposed technique is demonstrated by comparison with anexisting index; on real data.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2003,1

Efficient image retrieval by exploiting vertical fragmentation,Arjen P De Vries; Nikos Mamoulis; NJ Núñes; NJ Nes; ML Kersten; Arjen P De Vries; Nikos Mamoulis; Niels J Nes; Martin L Kersten,Abstract In content-based retrieval systems; the goal of similarity search is to identify the kmost similar images to a given example. Images are represented and queried by high-dimensional feature vectors encoding dominant characteristics like color and texture. Wepropose an e# cient similarity search method that is robust to dimensionality and has optimalspace complexity. Our approach fragments the feature vectors vertically; and computes thesimilarity of all images dimension by dimension. The innovation lies in gradually removingimages that cannot participate in the response set.

Efficient All Top-k Computation,Shen Ge; U Leong Hou; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Abstract—Given a set of objects P and a set of ranking functions F over P; an interestingproblem is to compute the top ranked objects for all functions. Evaluation of multiple top-kqueries finds application in systems; where there is a heavy workload of ranking queries (eg;online search engines and product recommendation systems). The simple solution ofevaluating the top-k queries one-by-one does not scale well; instead; the system can makeuse of the fact that similar queries share common results to accelerate search. This paper isthe first; to our knowledge; thorough study of this problem. We propose methods thatcompute all top-k queries in batch. Our first solution applies the block indexed nested loopsparadigm; while our second technique is a view-based algorithm.

Dsanls: Accelerating distributed nonnegative matrix factorization via sketching,Yuqiu Qian; Conghui Tan; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung,Abstract Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been successfully applied in differentfields; such as text mining; image processing; and video analysis. NMF is the problem ofdetermining two nonnegative low rank matrices U and V; for a given input matrix M; such thatm≈ UV⊥. There is an increasing interest in parallel and distributed NMF algorithms; due tothe high cost of centralized NMF on large matrices. In this paper; we propose a distributedsketched alternating nonnegative least squares (DSANLS) framework for NMF; whichutilizes a matrix sketching technique to reduce the size of nonnegative least squaressubproblems in each iteration for U and V. We design and analyze two different randommatrix generation techniques and two subproblem solvers.

Recommending packages with validity constraints to groups of users,Shuyao Qi; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massiveresearch effort in both industry and academia. Recent work has generalizedrecommendations to suggest packages of items to single users; or single items to groups ofusers. However; to the best of our knowledge; the interesting problem of recommending apackage to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem withseveral practical applications; such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups;entertainment packages to groups of friends or sets of courses to groups of students. In thispaper; we formulate the P2G problem; and we propose probabilistic models that capture thepreference of a group toward a package; incorporating factors such as user impact andpackage viability.

Thematic ranking of object summaries for keyword search,Georgios J Fakas; Yilun Cai; Zhi Cai; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract An Object Summary (OS) is a tree structure of tuples that summarizes the context ofa particular Data Subject (DS) tuple. The OS has been used as a model of keyword searchin relational databases; where given a set of keywords; the objective is to identify the DSstuples relevant to the keywords and their corresponding OSs. However; a query result mayreturn a large amount of OSs; which brings in the issue of effectively and efficiently rankingthem in order to present only the most important ones to the user. In this paper; we proposea model that ranks OSs containing a set of identifying keywords (eg; Chen) according to theirrelevance to a set of thematic keywords (eg Mining). We argue that the effective thematicranking of OSs should combine gracefully IR-style properties; authoritative ranking andaffinity.

Activity Recommendation with Partners,Wenting Tu; David W Cheung; Nikos Mamoulis; Min Yang; Ziyu Lu,Abstract Recommending social activities; such as watching movies or having dinner; is acommon function found in social networks or e-commerce sites. Besides certain websiteswhich manage activity-related locations (eg; foursquare. com); many items on product saleplatforms (eg; groupon. com) can naturally be mapped to social activities. For example;movie tickets can be thought of as activity items; which can be mapped as a social activity of“watch a movie.” Traditional recommender systems estimate the degree of interest for atarget user on candidate items (or activities); and accordingly; recommend the top-k activityitems to the user.

Such meeting point queries havebeen studied in the context of spatial databases; where typically the suggested points arethe ones that minimize an aggregate traveling distance. Recently; meeting point querieshave been enriched to take as input; besides the locations of users; also some preferencecriteria (eg; expressed by some keywords). However; in many applications; a group of usersmay require a meeting point recommendation without explicitly specifying any preferences.Motivated by this; we study this scenario of group recommendation for such passive users.We use topic modeling to infer the preferences of the group on the different points of interestand combine these preferences with the aggregate spatial distance of the group …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2017,*
Location-Aware Query Recommendation for Search Engines at Scale,Zhipeng Huang; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Query recommendation is a popular add-on feature of search engines; whichprovides related and helpful reformulations of a keyword query. Due to the dropping pricesof smartphones and the increasing coverage and bandwidth of mobile networks; a largepercentage of search engine queries are issued from mobile devices. This makes it possibleto provide better query recommendations by considering the physical locations of the queryissuers. However; limited research has been done on location-aware queryrecommendation for search engines.

When crowdsourcing tabular data;eg; the attribute values of an entity set; a worker's answers on the different attributes (eg; thenationality and age of a celebrity star) are often treated independently. This assumption isnot always true and can lead to suboptimal crowdsourcing performance.

Particularly; T-Crowd integrateseach worker's answers on different attributes to effectively learn his/her trustworthiness andthe true data values.

Matrix Factorization (MF) is one of themost popular recommendation approaches; the original user-product rating matrix R withmillions of rows and columns is decomposed into a user matrix Q and an item matrix P; suchthat the product QTP approximates R. Each column q (p) of Q (P) holds the latent factors ofthe corresponding user (item); and q T p is a prediction of the rating to item p by user q.Recommender systems based on MF suggest to a user in q the items with the top-k scores inq T P. For this problem; we propose a Fast and EXact Inner PROduct retrieval (FEXIPRO)framework; based on sequential scan; which includes three elements.

Sentiment-Based Topic Suggestion for Micro-Reviews.,Ziyu Lu; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Location-based social sites; such as Foursquare or Yelp; are gaining increasingpopularity. These sites allow users to check in at venues and leave a short commentary inthe form of a micro-review. Micro-reviews are rich in content as they offer a distilled andconcise account of user experience. In this paper we consider the problem of predicting thetopic of a micro-review by a user who visits a new venue. Such a prediction can help usersmake informed decisions; and also help venue owners personalize users' experiences.However; topic modeling for micro-reviews is particularly difficult; due to their short andfragmented nature. We address this issue using pooling strategies; which aggregate micro-reviews at the venue or user level; and we propose novel probabilistic models based onLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for extracting the topics related to a user-venue pair.

This requires an expensive data preprocessing phase; leading tohigh startup costs for very large RDF knowledge bases. Apriori knowledge of the queryworkload has also been used to create partitions; which however are static and do not adaptto workload changes; hence; inter-node communication cannot be consistently avoided forqueries that are not favored by the initial data partitioning.

Efficient Top-k Joins on Complex Data Types,Shuyao Qi; Panagiotis Bouros; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Consider two collections of objects R and S; where each object is assigned a score(eg; a rating). Given a join predicate φ and an integer k; a top-k join query returns the k pairsof objects which have the highest combined score (based on an aggregate scoring functionγ) among all object pairs in R⇥ S that qualify φ. This query type has been extensivelystudied in the relational database context where the join predicate is equality; with the maingoal of minimizing the number of tuples accessed from relations R and S. However; if the top-k join involves a non-equijoin predicate φ on complex data types; the computational cost caneasily become the bottleneck of query evaluation. In view of this; we propose a novelevaluation paradigm for top-k joins; which aims at minimizing the computations cost; withoutcompromising the access cost.

Scalable Probabilistic Similarity Ranking in Uncertain Databases (Technical Report),Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract: This paper introduces a scalable approach for probabilistic top-k similarity rankingon uncertain vector data. Each uncertain object is represented by a set of vector instancesthat are assumed to be mutually-exclusive. The objective is to rank the uncertain dataaccording to their distance to a reference object. We propose a framework that incrementallycomputes for each object instance and ranking position; the probability of the object falling atthat ranking position. The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for severalstate-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models. Existing approaches compute this probabilitydistribution by applying a dynamic programming approach of quadratic complexity. In thispaper we theoretically as well as experimentally show that our framework reduces this to alinear-time complexity while having the same memory requirements; facilitated by …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0907.2868,2009,*

A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

First look at average-case complexity for planar maximum-likelihood detection,Kai-Kit Wong; N Mamoulis,In this paper; an efficient exact maximum-likelihood (ML) detection scheme is presented fora multiple-input single-output (MISO) system with real signal constellations. The proposedtechnique has a geometrical interpretation of exploring the points jointly" close" in allcoordinate axes around the decoding hyperplane and is therefore dubbed planar detection.The fact that the lattice points which are close in all coordinate axes are much less; leads todramatic reduction in detection complexity. Making a few approximations; this paper derivesthe average-case complexity exponent; ec; for planar detection analytically in a closed form.Numerical results show that for an (n; 1) system; although the expected complexity is stillexponential; complexity reduction of 2 exponents; ie; from ec to e c-2; is realized and suchadvantage is promised irrespective of the size of the signal constellations and the …,Information; Communications and Signal Processing; 2005 Fifth International Conference on,2005,*
Improving Query Performance by Clustering XML Documents,L Wang; DWL Cheung; N Mamoulis; SM Yiu,ABSTRACT Using RDBMS to store XML documents is an established trend. However; itfragments the documents into tables and usually requires many joins to answer a query.This may seriously degrade query performance. It was observed that clustering XMLdocuments intelligently based on their structures will alleviate the problem. This is because itonly needs to access the cluster (s) of documents that satisfy the query rather than accessthe whole database. To achieve a good clustering; we propose a computationallyinexpensive distance metric. It can be integrated with many available clustering algorithms.Our experiment with real data such as the DBLP database shows that our approach canimprove query performance significantly.,Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Computing; Communications and Control Technologies: CCCT 2004; Volume III,2004,*
Novel Forms of Nearest Neighbor Queries in Spatio-Temporal Applications,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Jun Zhang; Qiongmao Shen; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Several types of nearest neighbor (NN) search have been proposed and studied inthe context of spatial databases. The most common type is the point NN query; whichretrieves the nearest neighbors of an input point. Such a query; however; is usuallymeaningless in highly dynamic environments where the query point or the database objectsmove/change over time. In this paper we study alternative forms of nearest neighbor queriessuitable for spatio-temporal applications. In particular; we first describe time-parameterizedqueries; where in addition to the current nearest neighbors of a query point; the resultcontains the expected validity period of the result (given the query and object movement); aswell as the change that will occur at the end of the validity period. Then; we discusscontinuous NN search where the goal is to retrieve all nearest neighbors of a query …,HDMS,2002,*

REPORT INS-R0109 OCTOBER 31; 2001,AP de Vries; N Mamoulis; NJ Nes; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT In content-based retrieval systems; the goal of similarity search is to identify thek most similar images to a given example. Images are represented and queried by high-dimensional feature vectors encoding dominant characteristics like color and texture. Wepropose an efficient similarity search method that is robust to dimensionality and has optimalspace complexity. Our approach fragments the feature vectors vertically; and computes thesimilarity of all images dimension by dimension. The innovation lies in gradually removingimages that cannot participate in the response set. We show how to apply this scheme fortwo common similarity metrics; namely histogram intersection and euclidean distance. Theimplementation of our algorithm in Monet illustrates that core database technology supportsimage retrieval well; without special extensions. Finally; we report the effectiveness of our …,*,2001,*

MODELING AND QUERYING,ELINA MEGALOU; THANASIS HADZILACOS; NIKOS MAMOULIS,Abstract Organised units of interactive multimedia material; called “titles”; are becomingrapidly available beyond their original format; namely Compact Disks; and they appear inDigital Libraries and on the Web. For large collections of such titles; browsers and querymechanisms addressing the multimedia assets alone while reasonably well developed areinadequate: we lack techniques for efficient generic retrieval of structured multimediainformation. In this paper we present the notion of conceptual title abstractions; arepresentation of one or more titles that captures and abstracts at a variable level of detailthe structure; interactivity and generic content of the represented titles. We develop analgebra for title abstractions-which form a partial order-and present a language which canbe used for specifying and abstracting titles.

We propose aframework for performing text analytics on such data in a versatile; efficient; and scalablemanner. While much of the prior literature has emphasized mining keywords or tags in blogsor social-tagging communities; we emphasize the analysis of interesting phrases. Theseinclude named entities; important quotations; market slogans; and other multi-word phrasesthat are prominent in a dynamically derived ad-hoc subset of the corpus; eg; being frequentin the subset but relatively infrequent in the overall corpus. The ad-hoc subset may bederived by means of a keyword query against the corpus; or by focusing on a particular timeperiod.

Anagrams for String Database Anonymity,Reza Sherkat; Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis,ABSTRACT In this paper we focus on the privacy preserving publication of string data. Stringdata are common to variety of application fields ranging from biological data (with DNA andRNA sequences) to web logs; where users' sessions are modeled as sequences of useractions. The existence of structural information in each record; ie the sequence of terms;renders the problem of anonymizing collections of string data significantly harder thanrelated problems; as the anonymization of set values. Applying well known taxonomybasedgeneralization techniques results to large reduction in the information quality of theanonymized dataset; specially when the alphabet of the dataset is relatively small. Toovercome the limitations of value generalization based methods we propose to alsogeneralize structure. We inject anagrams into strings by partially relaxing the order …,*,*,*
