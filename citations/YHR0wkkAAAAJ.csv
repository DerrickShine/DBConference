Consistent query answers in inconsistent databases,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossi; Jan Chomicki,Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of the logical characterization of the notion ofconsistent answer in a relational database that may violate given integrity constraints. Thisnotion is captured in terms of the possible repaired versions of the database. A rnethod forcomputing consistent answers is given and its soundness and completeness (for someclasses of constraints and queries) proved. The method is based on an iterative procedurewhose termination for several classes of constraints is proved as well.,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,824
Semantics and complexity of SPARQL,Jorge Pérez; Marcelo Arenas; Claudio Gutierrez,Abstract SPARQL is the standard language for querying RDF data. In this article; we addresssystematically the formal study of the database aspects of SPARQL; concentrating in itsgraph pattern matching facility. We provide a compositional semantics for the core part ofSPARQL; and study the complexity of the evaluation of several fragments of the language.Among other complexity results; we show that the evaluation of general SPARQL patterns isPSPACE-complete. We identify a large class of SPARQL patterns; defined by imposing asimple and natural syntactic restriction; where the query evaluation problem can be solvedmore efficiently. This restriction gives rise to the class of well-designed patterns. We showthat the evaluation problem is coNP-complete for well-designed patterns. Moreover; weprovide several rewriting rules for well-designed patterns whose application may have a …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,651
A normal form for XML documents,Marcelo Arenas; Leonid Libkin,Abstract This article takes a first step towards the design and normalization theory for XMLdocuments. We show that; like relational databases; XML documents may contain redundantinformation; and may be prone to update anomalies. Furthermore; such problems arecaused by certain functional dependencies among paths in the document. Our goal is to finda way of converting an arbitrary DTD into a well-designed one; that avoids these problems.We first introduce the concept of a functional dependency for XML; and define its semanticsvia a relational representation of XML. We then define an XML normal form; XNF; that avoidsupdate anomalies and redundancies. We study its properties; and show that XNFgeneralizes BCNF; we also discuss the relationship between XNF and normal forms fornested relations. Finally; we present a lossless algorithm for converting any DTD into one …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2004,560
Semantics and Complexity of SPARQL,Jorge Pérez; Marcelo Arenas; Claudio Gutierrez,Abstract SPARQL is the W3C candidate recommendation query language for RDF. In thispaper we address systematically the formal study of SPARQL; concentrating in its graphpattern facility. We consider for this study simple RDF graphs without special semantics forliterals and a simplified version of filters which encompasses all the main issues. We providea compositional semantics; prove there are normal forms; prove complexity bounds; amongothers that the evaluation of SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete; compare our semanticsto an alternative operational semantics; give simple and natural conditions when bothsemantics coincide and discuss optimization procedures.,International semantic web conference,2006,558
Mapping data in peer-to-peer systems: Semantics and algorithmic issues,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Marcelo Arenas; Renée J Miller,Abstract We consider the problem of mapping data in peer-to-peer data-sharing systems.Such systems often rely on the use of mapping tables listing pairs of corresponding values tosearch for data residing in different peers. In this paper; we address semantic andalgorithmic issues related to the use of mapping tables. We begin by arguing why mappingtables are appropriate for data mapping in a peer-to-peer environment. We discussalternative semantics for these tables and we present a language that allows the user tospecify mapping tables under different semantics. Then; we show that by treating mappingtables as constraints (called mapping constraints) on the exchange of information betweenpeers it is possible to reason about them. We motivate why reasoning capabilities areneeded to manage mapping tables and show the importance of inferring new mapping …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,323
XML data exchange: consistency and query answering,Marcelo Arenas; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Data exchange is the problem of finding an instance of a target schema; given aninstance of a source schema and a specification of the relationship between the source andthe target. Theoretical foundations of data exchange have recently been investigated forrelational data. In this article; we start looking into the basic properties of XML dataexchange; that is; restructuring of XML documents that conform to a source DTD under atarget DTD; and answering queries written over the target schema. We define XML dataexchange settings in which source-to-target dependencies refer to the hierarchical structureof the data. Combining DTDs and dependencies makes some XML data exchange settingsinconsistent. We investigate the consistency problem and determine its exact complexity.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2008,254
The hyperion project: from data integration to data coordination,Marcelo Arenas; Vasiliki Kantere; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Iluju Kiringa; Renée J Miller; John Mylopoulos,Abstract We present an architecture and a set of challenges for peer database managementsystems. These systems team up to build a network of nodes (peers) that coordinate at runtime most of the typical DBMS tasks such as the querying; updating; and sharing of data.Such a network works in a way similar to conventional multidatabases. Conventionalmultidatabase systems are founded on key concepts such as those of a global schema;central administrative authority; data integration; global access to multiple databases;permanent participation of databases; etc. Instead; our proposal assumes total absence ofany central authority or control; no global schema; transient participation of peer databases;and constantly evolving coordination rules among databases. In this work; we describe thestatus of the Hyperion project; present our current solutions; and outline remaining …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2003,227
Answer sets for consistent query answering in inconsistent databases,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossi; Jan Chomicki,Abstract: A relational database is inconsistent if it does not satisfy a given set of integrityconstraints. Nevertheless; it is likely that most of the data in it is consistent with theconstraints. In this paper we apply logic programming based on answer sets to the problemof retrieving consistent information from a possibly inconsistent database. Since consistentinformation persists from the original database to every of its minimal repairs; the approachis based on a specification of database repairs using disjunctive logic programs withexceptions; whose answer set semantics can be represented and computed by systems thatimplement stable model semantics. These programs allow us to declare persistence bydefaults and repairing changes by exceptions. We concentrate mainly on logic programs forbinary integrity constraints; among which we find most of the integrity constraints found in …,arXiv preprint cs/0207094,2002,195
An information-theoretic approach to normal forms for relational and XML data,Marcelo Arenas; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Normalization as a way of producing good relational database designs is a well-understood topic. However; the same problem of distinguishing well-designed databasesfrom poorly designed ones arises in other data models; in particular; XML. While; in therelational world; the criteria for being well designed are usually very intuitive and clear tostate; they become more obscure when one moves to more complex data models. Our goalis to provide a set of tools for testing when a condition on a database design; specified by anormal form; corresponds to a good design. We use techniques of information theory; anddefine a measure of information content of elements in a database with respect to a set ofconstraints. We first test this measure in the relational context; providing information-theoretic justification for familiar normal forms such as BCNF; 4NF; PJ/NF; 5NFR; DK/NF …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2005,158
nSPARQL: A navigational language for RDF,Jorge Pérez; Marcelo Arenas; Claudio Gutierrez,Abstract Navigational features have been largely recognized as fundamental for graphdatabase query languages. This fact has motivated several authors to propose RDF querylanguages with navigational capabilities. In this paper; we propose the query languagenSPARQL that uses nested regular expressions to navigate RDF data. We study some of thefundamental properties of nSPARQL and nested regular expressions concerningexpressiveness and complexity of evaluation. Regarding expressiveness; we show thatnSPARQL is expressive enough to answer queries considering the semantics of the RDFSvocabulary by directly traversing the input graph. We also show that nesting is necessary innSPARQL to obtain this last result; and we study the expressiveness of the combination ofnested regular expressions and SPARQL operators. Regarding complexity of evaluation …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2010,139
Scalar aggregation in inconsistent databases,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossi; Jan Chomicki; Xin He; Vijay Raghavan; Jeremy Spinrad,Abstract We consider here scalar aggregation queries in databases that may violate a givenset of functional dependencies. We define consistent answers to such queries to be greatest-lowest/least-upper bounds on the value of the scalar function across all (minimal) repairs ofthe database. We show how to compute such answers. We provide a completecharacterization of the computational complexity of this problem. We also show howtractability can be improved in several special cases (one involves a novel application ofBoyce–Codd Normal Form) and present a practical hybrid query evaluation method.,Theoretical Computer Science,2003,132

Querying semantic web data with SPARQL,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez,Abstract The Semantic Web is the initiative of the W3C to make information on the Webreadable not only by humans but also by machines. RDF is the data model for SemanticWeb data; and SPARQL is the standard query language for this data model. In the last tenyears; we have witnessed a constant growth in the amount of RDF data available on theWeb; which have motivated the theoretical study of some fundamental aspects of SPARQLand the development of efficient mechanisms for implementing this query language. Someof the distinctive features of RDF have made the study and implementation of SPARQLchallenging. First; as opposed to usual database applications; the semantics of RDF is openworld; making RDF databases inherently incomplete. Thus; one usually obtains partialanswers when querying RDF with SPARQL; and the possibility of adding optional …,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,102
Counting beyond a Yottabyte; or how SPARQL 1.1 property paths will prevent adoption of the standard,Marcelo Arenas; Sebastián Conca; Jorge Pérez,Abstract SPARQL-the standard query language for querying RDF-provides only limitednavigational functionalities; although these features are of fundamental importance for graphdata formats such as RDF. This has led the W3C to include the property path feature in theupcoming version of the standard; SPARQL 1.1. We tested several implementations ofSPARQL 1.1 handling property path queries; and we observed that their evaluation methodsfor this class of queries have a poor performance even in some very simple scenarios. Toformally explain this fact; we conduct a theoretical study of the computational complexity ofproperty paths evaluation. Our results imply that the poor performance of the testedimplementations is not a problem of these particular systems; but of the specification itself. Infact; we show that any implementation that adheres to the SPARQL 1.1 specification (as …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,97
Relational and XML data exchange,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barcelo; Leonid Libkin; Filip Murlak,Abstract Data exchange is the problem of finding an instance of a target schema; given aninstance of a source schema and a specification of the relationship between the source andthe target. Such a target instance should correctly represent information from the sourceinstance under the constraints imposed by the target schema; and it should allow one toevaluate queries on the target instance in a way that is semantically consistent with thesource data. Data exchange is an old problem that re-emerged as an active research topicrecently; due to the increased need for exchange of data in various formats; often in e-business applications. In this lecture; we give an overview of the basic concepts of dataexchange in both relational and XML contexts. We give examples of data exchangeproblems; and we introduce the main tasks that need to addressed. We then discuss …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2010,95
Efficient incremental validation of XML documents,Denilson Barbosa; Alberto O Mendelzon; Leonid Libkin; Laurent Mignet; Marcelo Arenas,We discuss incremental validation of XML documents with respect to DTDs and XMLschema definitions. We consider insertions and deletions of subtrees; as opposed to leafnodes only; and we also consider the validation of ID and IDREF attributes. For arbitraryschemas; we give a worst-case n log n time and linear space algorithm; and show that itoften is far superior to revalidation from scratch. We present two classes of schemas; whichcapture most real-life DTDs; and show that they admit a logarithmic time incrementalvalidation algorithm that; in many cases; requires only constant auxiliary space. We thendiscuss an implementation of these algorithms that is independent of; and can becustomized for different storage mechanisms for XML. Finally; we present extensiveexperimental results showing that our approach is highly efficient and scalable.,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,95
Specifying and querying database repairs using logic programs with exceptions,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossi; Jan Chomicki,Abstract Databases may be inconsistent with respect to a given set of integrity constraints.Nevertheless; most of the data may be consistent. In this paper we show how to specifyconsistent data and how to query a relational database in such a way that only consistentdata is retrieved. The specification and queries are based on disjunctive extended logicprograms with positive and negative exceptions that generalize those previously introducedby Kowalski and Sadri.,*,2001,95
On verifying consistency of XML specifications,Marcelo Arenas; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin,Abstract XML specifications often consist of a type definition (typically; a DTD) and a set ofintegrity constraints. It has been shown previously that such specifications can beinconsistent; and thus it is often desirable to check consistency at compile-time. It is knownthat for general keys and foreign keys; and DTDs; the consistency problem is undecidable;however; it becomes NP-complete when all keys are one-attribute (unary); and tractable; ifno foreign keys are used. In this paper; we consider a variety of constraints for XML data;and study the complexity of the consistency problem. Our main conclusion is that in thepresence of foreign keys; compile-time verification of consistency is usually infeasible. Welook at two types of constraints: absolute (that hold in the entire document); and relative (thatonly hold in a part of the document). For absolute constraints; we extend earlier …,Proceedings of the twenty-first ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2002,94
On directly mapping relational databases to RDF and OWL,Juan F Sequeda; Marcelo Arenas; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract Mapping relational databases to RDF is a fundamental problem for thedevelopment of the Semantic Web. We present a solution; inspired by draft methods definedby the W3C where relational databases are directly mapped to RDF and OWL. Given arelational database schema and its integrity constraints; this direct mapping produces anOWL ontology; which; provides the basis for generating RDF instances. The semantics ofthis mapping is defined using Datalog. Two fundamental properties are informationpreservation and query preservation. We prove that our mapping satisfies both conditions;even for relational databases that contain null values. We also consider two desirableproperties: monotonicity and semantics preservation. We prove that our mapping ismonotone and also prove that no monotone mapping; including ours; is semantic …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,86
Locally consistent transformations and query answering in data exchange,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Ronald Fagin; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Data exchange is the problem of taking data structured under a source schema andcreating an instance of a target schema. Given a source instance; there may be manysolutions-target instances that satisfy the constraints of the data exchange problem. Previouswork has identified two classes of desirable solutions: canonical universal solutions; andtheir cores. Query answering in data exchange amounts to rewriting a query over the targetschema to another query that; over a materialized target instance; gives the result that issemantically consistent with the source. A basic question is then whether there exists atransformation sending a source instance into a solution over which target queries can beanswered. We show that the answer is negative for many data exchange transformationsthat have structural properties similar to canonical universal solutions and cores. Namely …,Proceedings of the twenty-third ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2004,82
The recovery of a schema mapping: bringing exchanged data back,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Cristian Riveros,Abstract A schema mapping is a specification that describes how data from a source schemais to be mapped to a target schema. Once the data has been transferred from the source tothe target; a natural question is whether one can undo the process and recover the initialdata; or at least part of it. In fact; it would be desirable to find a reverse schema mapping fromtarget to source that specifies how to bring the exchanged data back. In this article; weintroduce the notion of a recovery of a schema mapping: it is a reverse mapping; M′ for amapping M; that recovers sound data with respect to M. We further introduce an orderrelation on recoveries. This allows us to choose mappings that recover the maximumamount of sound information. We call such mappings maximum recoveries. We studymaximum recoveries in detail; providing a necessary and sufficient condition for their …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,81
First-order and temporal logics for nested words,Rajeev Alur; Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barcelo; Kousha Etessami; Neil Immerman; Leonid Libkin,Nested words are a structured model of execution paths in procedural programs; reflectingtheir call and return nesting structure. Finite nested words also capture the structure of parsetrees and other tree-structured data; such as XML. We provide new temporal logics for finiteand infinite nested words; which are natural extensions of LTL; and prove that these logicsare first-order expressively-complete. One of them is based on adding a" within" modality;evaluating a formula on a subword; to a logic CaRet previously studied in the context ofverifying properties of recursive state machines. The other logic is based on the notion of asummary path that combines the linear and nesting structures. For that logic; both model-checking and satisfiability are shown to be EXPTIME-complete. Finally; we prove that first-order logic over nested words has the three-variable property; and we present a temporal …,Logic in Computer Science; 2007.

Semantics and optimization of the SPARQL 1.1 federation extension,Carlos Buil-Aranda; Marcelo Arenas; Oscar Corcho,Abstract The W3C SPARQL working group is defining the new SPARQL 1.1 query language.The current working draft of SPARQL 1.1 focuses mainly on the description of the language.In this paper; we provide a formalization of the syntax and semantics of the SPARQL 1.1federation extension; an important fragment of the language that has not yet received muchattention. Besides; we propose optimization techniques for this fragment; provide animplementation of the fragment including these techniques; and carry out a series ofexperiments that show that our optimization procedures significantly speed up the queryevaluation process.,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2011,76
On blank nodes,Alejandro Mallea; Marcelo Arenas; Aidan Hogan; Axel Polleres,Abstract Blank nodes are defined in RDF as 'existential variables' in the same way that hasbeen used before in mathematical logic. However; evidence suggests that actual usage ofRDF does not follow this definition. In this paper we thoroughly cover the issue of blanknodes; from incomplete information in database theory; over different treatments of blanknodes across the W3C stack of RDF-related standards; to empirical analysis of RDF datapublicly available on the Web. We then summarize alternative approaches to the problem;weighing up advantages and disadvantages; also discussing proposals for Skolemization.,International Semantic Web Conference,2011,75
What’s hard about xml schema constraints?,Marcelo Arenas; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Data description for XML usually comes in the form of a type specification (eg; aDTD) together with integrity constraints. XML Schema allows one to mix DTD features withsemantic information; such as keys and foreign keys. It was shown recently [[2];[7]] that theinteraction of DTDs with constraints may be rather nontrivial. In particular; testing if a generalspecification is consistent is undecidable; but for the most common case of single-attributeconstraints it is NP-complete; and linear time if no foreign keys are present. However; XMLSchema design did not adopt the form of constraints prevalent in the database literature; andslightly changed the semantics of keys; foreign keys; and unique constraints. In this paperwe demonstrate the very costly effect of this slight change on the feasibility of consistencychecking. In particular; all the known hardness results extend to the XML Schema case …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,74
nSPARQL: A navigational language for RDF,Jorge Pérez; Marcelo Arenas; Claudio Gutierrez,Abstract Navigational features have been largely recognized as fundamental for graphdatabase query languages. This fact has motivated several authors to propose RDF querylanguages with navigational capabilities. In particular; we have argued in a previous paperthat nested regular expressions are appropriate to navigate RDF data; and we haveproposed the nSPARQL query language for RDF; that uses nested regular expressions asbuilding blocks. In this paper; we study some of the fundamental properties of nSPARQLconcerning expressiveness and complexity of evaluation. Regarding expressiveness; weshow that nSPARQL is expressive enough to answer queries considering the semantics ofthe RDFS vocabulary by directly traversing the input graph. We also show that nesting isnecessary to obtain this last result; and we study the expressiveness of the combination of …,International Semantic Web Conference,2008,72
Data sharing through query translation in autonomous sources,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Marcelo Arenas,Abstract We consider the problem of data sharing between autonomous data sources in anenvironment where constraints cannot be placed on the shared contents of sources. Oursolutions rely on the use of mapping tables which define how data from different sources areassociated. In this setting; the answer to a local query; that is; a query posed against theschema of a single source; is augmented by retrieving related data from associated sources.This retrieval of data is achieved by translating; through mapping tables; the local query intoa set of queries that are executed against the associated sources. We consider both soundtranslations (which only retrieve correct answers) and complete translations (which retrieveall correct answers; and no incorrect answers) and we present algorithms to compute suchtranslations. Our solutions are implemented and tested experimentally and we describe …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,70
Federating queries in SPARQL 1.1: Syntax; semantics and evaluation,Carlos Buil-Aranda; Marcelo Arenas; Oscar Corcho; Axel Polleres,Abstract Given the sustained growth that we are experiencing in the number of SPARQLendpoints available; the need to be able to send federated SPARQL queries across thesehas also grown. To address this use case; the W3C SPARQL working group is defining afederation extension for SPARQL 1.1 which allows for combining graph patterns that can beevaluated over several endpoints within a single query. In this paper; we describe the syntaxof that extension and formalize its semantics. Additionally; we describe how a queryevaluation system can be implemented for that federation extension; describing some staticoptimization techniques and reusing a query engine used for data-intensive science; so asto deal with large amounts of intermediate and final results. Finally we carry out a series ofexperiments that show that our optimizations speed up the federated query evaluation …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2013,68
Foundations of RDF databases,Marcelo Arenas; Claudio Gutierrez; Jorge Pérez,Abstract The goal of this paper is to give an overview of the basics of the theory of RDFdatabases. We provide a formal definition of RDF that includes the features that distinguishthis model from other graph data models. We then move into the fundamental issue ofquerying RDF data. We start by considering the RDF query language SPARQL; which is aW3C Recommendation since January 2008. We provide an algebraic syntax and acompositional semantics for this language; study the complexity of the evaluation problemfor different fragments of SPARQL; and consider the problem of optimizing the evaluation ofSPARQL queries; showing that a natural fragment of this language has some goodproperties in this respect. We furthermore study the expressive power of SPARQL; bycomparing it with some well-known query languages such as relational algebra. We …,Reasoning Web International Summer School,2009,66
Foundations of Data Exchange,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Leonid Libkin; Filip Murlak,The problem of exchanging data between different databases with different schemas is anarea of immense importance. Consequently data exchange has been one of the most activeresearch topics in databases over the past decade. Foundational questions related to dataexchange largely revolve around three key problems: how to build target solutions; how toanswer queries over target solutions; and how to manipulate schema mappingsthemselves? The last question is also known under the name'metadata management'; sincemappings represent metadata; rather than data in the database. In this book the authorssummarize the key developments of a decade of research. Part I introduces the problem ofdata exchange via examples; both relational and XML; Part II deals with exchangingrelational data; Part III focuses on exchanging XML data; and Part IV covers metadata …,*,2014,56

In January 2008; it was releasedthe recommendation of the W3C for querying RDF data; a query language called SPARQL.In this chapter; we give a detailed description of the semantics of this language.

Scalar aggregation in FD-inconsistent databases,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossi; Jan Chomicki,Abstract We consider here scalar aggregation queries in databases that may violate a givenset of functional dependencies. We show how to compute consistent answers (answers truein every minimal repair of the database) to such queries. We provide a completecharacterization of the computational complexity of this problem. We also show howtractability can be obtained in several special cases (one involves a novel application of theperfect graph theory) and present a practical hybrid query evaluation method.,International Conference on Database Theory,2001,53
On the complexity of verifying consistency of XML specifications,Marcelo Arenas; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin,XML specifications often consist of a type definition (typically; a document type definition(DTD)) and a set of integrity constraints. It has been shown previously that suchspecifications can be inconsistent; and thus it is often desirable to check consistency atcompile time. It is known [W. Fan and L. Libkin; J. ACM; 49 (2002); pp. 368–406] that forgeneral keys; foreign keys; and DTDs the consistency problem is undecidable; however; itbecomes NP-complete when all keys are one-attribute (unary) and tractable; if no foreignkeys are used. In this paper; we consider a variety of previously studied constraints for XMLdata and investigate the complexity of the consistency problem. Our main conclusion is that;in the presence of foreign key constraints; compile-time verification of consistency isinfeasible. We look at absolute constraints that hold in the entire document and relative …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2008,52
Expressive languages for querying the semantic web,Marcelo Arenas; Georg Gottlob; Andreas Pieris,Abstract The problem of querying RDF data is a central issue for the development of theSemantic Web. The query language SPARQL has become the standard language forquerying RDF; since its standardization in 2008. However; the 2008 version of this languagemissed some important functionalities: reasoning capabilities to deal with RDFS and OWLvocabularies; navigational capabilities to exploit the graph structure of RDF data; and ageneral form of recursion much needed to express some natural queries. To overcomethese limitations; a new version of SPARQL; called SPARQL 1.1; was recently released;which includes entailment regimes for RDFS and OWL vocabularies; and a mechanism toexpress navigation patterns through regular expressions. Unfortunately; there are still someuseful navigation patterns that cannot be expressed in SPARQL 1.1; and the language …,Proceedings of the 33rd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2014,51
Coordinating peer databases using ECA rules,Vasiliki Kantere; Iluju Kiringa; John Mylopoulos; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Marcelo Arenas,Abstract Peer databases are stand-alone; independently developed databases that arelinked to each other through acquaintances. They each contain local data; a set of mappingtables and expressions; and a set of ECA rules that are used to exchange data among them.The set of acquaintances and peers constitutes a dynamic peer-to-peer network in whichacquaintances are continuously established and abolished. We present techniques forspecifying data exchange policies on-the-fly based on constraints imposed on the way inwhich peers exchange and share data. We realize the on-the-fly specification of dataexchange policies by building coordination ECA rules at acquaintance time. Finally; wedescribe mechanisms related to establishing and abolishing acquaintances by means ofexamples. Specifically; we consider syntactical constructs and executional semantics of …,International Workshop on Databases; Information Systems; and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2003,51
Applications of annotated predicate calculus to querying inconsistent databases,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossi; Michael Kifer,Abstract We consider the problem of specifying and computing consistent answers toqueries against databases that do not satisfy given integrity constraints. This is done bysimultaneously embedding the database and the integrity constraints; which are mutuallyinconsistent in classical logic; into a theory in annotated predicate calculus—a logic thatallows non trivial reasoning in the presence of inconsistency. In this way; several goals areachieved:(a) A logical specification of the class of all minimal “repairs” of the originaldatabase; and the ability to reason about them;(b) The ability to distinguish betweenconsistent and inconsistent information in the database; and (c) The development ofcomputational mechanisms for retrieving consistent query answers; ie; answers that are notaffected by the violation of the integrity constraints.,*,2000,51
Data exchange beyond complete data,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter,Abstract In the traditional data exchange setting; source instances are restricted to becomplete in the sense that every fact is either true or false in these instances. Althoughnatural for a typical database translation scenario; this restriction is gradually becoming animpediment to the development of a wide range of applications that need to exchangeobjects that admit several interpretations. In particular; we are motivated by two specificapplications that go beyond the usual data exchange scenario: exchanging incompleteinformation and exchanging knowledge bases. In this article; we propose a generalframework for data exchange that can deal with these two applications. More specifically; weaddress the problem of exchanging information given by representation systems; which areessentially finite descriptions of (possibly infinite) sets of complete instances. We make …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2013,45

Faceted search over ontology-enhanced RDF data,Marcelo Arenas; Bernardo Cuenca Grau; Evgeny Kharlamov; Sarunas Marciuska; Dmitriy Zheleznyakov,Abstract An increasing number of applications rely on RDF; OWL 2; and SPARQL for storingand querying data. SPARQL; however; is not targeted towards end-users; and suitablequery interfaces are needed. Faceted search is a prominent approach for end-user dataaccess; and several RDF-based faceted search systems have been developed. There is;however; a lack of rigorous theoretical underpinning for faceted search in the context of RDFand OWL 2. In this paper; we provide such solid foundations. We formalise facetedinterfaces for this context; identify a fragment of first-order logic capturing the underlyingqueries; and study the complexity of answering such queries for RDF and OWL 2 profiles.We then study interface generation and update; and devise efficiently implementablealgorithms. Finally; we have implemented and tested our faceted search algorithms for …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,38
Everything you always wanted to know about blank nodes,Aidan Hogan; Marcelo Arenas; Alejandro Mallea; Axel Polleres,Abstract In this paper we thoroughly cover the issue of blank nodes; which have beendefined in RDF as 'existential variables'. We first introduce the theoretical precedent forexistential blank nodes from first order logic and incomplete information in database theory.We then cover the different (and sometimes incompatible) treatment of blank nodes acrossthe W3C stack of RDF-related standards. We present an empirical survey of the blank nodespresent in a large sample of RDF data published on the Web (the BTC-2012 dataset); wherewe find that 25.7% of unique RDF terms are blank nodes; that 44.9% of documents and66.2% of domains featured use of at least one blank node; and that aside from one LinkedData domain whose RDF data contains many “blank node cycles”; the vast majority of blanknodes form tree structures that are efficient to compute simple entailment over.

Foundations of schema mapping management,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan L Reutter; Cristian Riveros,Abstract In the last few years; a lot of attention has been paid to the specification andsubsequent manipulation of schema mappings; a problem which is of fundamentalimportance in metadata management. There have been many achievements in this area;and semantics have been defined for operators on schema mappings such as compositionand inverse. However; little research has been pursued towards providing formal tools tocompare schema mappings; in terms of their ability to transfer data and avoid storingredundant information; which has hampered the development of foundations for morecomplex operators as many of them involve these notions. In this paper; we address theproblem of providing foundations for metadata management by developing an order tocompare the amount of information transferred by schema mappings. From this order we …,Proceedings of the twenty-ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2010,36
Managing data mappings in the hyperion project,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Marcelo Arenas; Renée J Miller,We consider the problem of mapping data in peer-to-peer systems. Such systems rely onsimple value searches to locate data of interest. However; different peers may use differentvalues to identify or describe the same data. To accommodate this; peer-to-peer systemsoften rely on mapping tables that list pairs of corresponding values for search domains thatare used in different peers. We illustrate how such tables are used in the genomicscommunity by expert curators. We then argue why mapping tables are appropriate for datamapping in a peer-to-peer environment and motivate the problem of managing these tables.The work presented is part of the Hyperion project.,Data Engineering; 2003.

Query languages for data exchange: Beyond unions of conjunctive queries,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Juan Reutter,Abstract The class of unions of conjunctive queries (UCQ) has been shown to be particularlywell-behaved for data exchange; its certain answers can be computed in polynomial time (interms of data complexity). However; this is not the only class with this property; the certainanswers to any Datalog program can also can be computed in polynomial time. The problemis that both UCQ and Datalog do not allow negated atoms; as adding an unrestricted form ofnegation to these languages yields to intractability. In this paper; we propose a languagecalled Datalog C (≠) that extends Datalog with a restricted form of negation; and study someof its fundamental properties. In particular; we show that the certain answers to a Datalog C(≠) program can be computed in polynomial time (in terms of data complexity); and thatevery union of conjunctive queries with at most one inequality or negated relational atom …,Theory of Computing Systems,2011,34
Composition with target constraints,Marcelo Arenas; Ronald Fagin; Alan Nash,Abstract It is known that the composition of schema mappings; each specified by source-to-target tgds (st-tgds); can be specified by a second-order tgd (SO tgd). We consider thequestion of what happens when target constraints are allowed. Specifically; we consider thequestion of specifying the composition of standard schema mappings (those specified by st-tgds; target egds; and a weakly-acyclic set of target tgds). We show that SO tgds; even withthe assistance of arbitrary source constraints and target constraints; cannot specify ingeneral the composition of two standard schema mappings. Therefore; we introduce source-to-target second-order dependencies (st-SO dependencies); which are similar to SO tgds;but allow equations in the conclusion. We show that st-SO dependencies (along with targetegds and target tgds) are sufficient to express the composition of every finite sequence of …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Database Theory,2010,32
SemFacet: semantic faceted search over yago,Marcelo Arenas; Bernardo Cuenca Grau; Evgeny Kharlamov; Sarunas Marciuska; Dmitriy Zheleznyakov; Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz,Abstract In this paper we demonstrate a system SemFacet; that is a proof of conceptprototype for our semantic faceted search approach. SemFacet is implemented on top of theYago knowledge base; powered by the OWL 2 RL triple store RDFox; and the full text searchengine Lucene. SemFacet has provided very encouraging results. Via logical reasoningSemFacet can automatically (i) extract facets;(ii) update the faceted query interface withfacets relevant for the current stage of the users query construction's session. SemFacetsupports faceted queries that are much more expressive than the ones of traditional facetedsearch applications; in particular SemFacet allows to (i) relate several collections ofdocuments; and (ii) change the focus of queries (and; thus; SemFacet provides control overthe documents in the query output to be displayed on the screen).

Composition and inversion of schema mappings,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter; Cristian Riveros,A schema mapping is a specification that describes how data from a source schema is to bemapped to a target schema. Schema mappings have proved to be essential for data-interoperability tasks such as data exchange and data integration. The research on this areahas mainly focused on performing these tasks. However; as Bernstein pointed out [7]; manyinformation-system problems involve not only the design and integration of complexapplication artifacts; but also their subsequent manipulation. Driven by this consideration;Bernstein proposed in [7] a general framework for managing schema mappings. In thisframework; mappings are usually specified in a logical language; and high-level algebraicoperators are used to manipulate them [7; 16; 33; 12; 8]. Two of the most fundamentaloperators in this framework are the composition and inversion of schema mappings …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2010,31
Inverting schema mappings: bridging the gap between theory and practice,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter; Cristian Riveros,Abstract The inversion of schema mappings has been identified as one of the fundamentaloperators for the development of a general framework for metadata management. In fact;during the last years three alternative notions of inversion for schema mappings have beenproposed (Fagin-inverse [10]; quasi-inverse [14] and maximum recovery [2]). However; theprocedures that have been developed for computing these operators have some featuresthat limit their practical applicability. First; these algorithms work in exponential time andproduce inverse mappings of exponential size. Second; these algorithms express inversesin some mappings languages which include features that are difficult to use in practice. Atypical example is the use of disjunction in the conclusion of the mapping rules; whichmakes the process of exchanging data much more complicated. In this paper; we propose …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,31
Consistency of XML specifications,Marcelo Arenas; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Specifications of XML documents typically consist of typing information (forexample; a DTD); and integrity constraints (for example; keys and foreign keys). We showthat combining the two may lead to seemingly reasonable specifications that arenevertheless inconsistent: there is no XML document that both conforms to the DTD andsatisfies the constraints. We then survey results on the complexity of consistency checking;and show that; depending on the classes of DTDs and constraints involved; it ranges fromlinear time to undecidable. Furthermore; we show that for some of the most common classesof specifications checking consistency is intractable.,*,2005,30
SCDBR: An automated reasoner for specifications of database updates,Leopoldo Bertossi; Marcelo Arenas; Cristian Ferretti,Abstract In this paper we describe SCDBR; a system that is able to reason automaticallyfrom specifications of database updates written in the situation calculus; a first–orderlanguage originally proposed by John McCarthy for reasoning about actions and change.The specifications handledby the system are written in the formalism proposed by RayReiter for solving the frame problem that appears when one expresses the effects on thedatabase predicates of the execution of atomic transactions. SCDBR is written in PROLOG;and can solve several reasoning tasks; among others; it is able to derive the finalspecification from effect axioms; to answerqueries to virtually updated databases; to checklegality of transactions; to prove integrity constraints from the specification; to modifythespecification in order to embed a desired integrity constraint; and to answer historical …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,1998,30
Faceted search over RDF-based knowledge graphs,Marcelo Arenas; Bernardo Cuenca Grau; Evgeny Kharlamov; Šarūnas Marciuška; Dmitriy Zheleznyakov,Abstract Knowledge graphs such as Yago and Freebase have become a powerful asset forenhancing search; and are being intensively used in both academia and industry. Manyexisting knowledge graphs are either available as Linked Open Data; or they can beexported as RDF datasets enhanced with background knowledge in the form of an OWL 2ontology. Faceted search is the de facto approach for exploratory search in many onlineapplications; and has been recently proposed as a suitable paradigm for querying RDFrepositories. In this paper; we provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings for faceted searchin the context of RDF-based knowledge graphs enhanced with OWL 2 ontologies. Weidentify well-defined fragments of SPARQL that can be naturally captured using facetedsearch as a query paradigm; and establish the computational complexity of answering …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2016,26
Exchanging description logic knowledge bases,Marcelo Arenas; Elena Botoeva; Diego Calvanese; Vladislav Ryzhikov; Evgeny Sherkhonov,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of exchanging knowledge between a sourceand a target knowledge base (KB); connected through mappings. Differently from thetraditional database exchange setting; which considers only the exchange of data; we areinterested in exchanging implicit knowledge. As representation formalism we useDescription Logics (DLs); thus assuming that the source and target KBs are given as a DLTBox+ ABox; while the mappings have the form of DL TBox assertions. We study theproblem of translating the knowledge in the source KB according to these mappings. Wedefine a general framework of KB exchange; and address the problems of representingimplicit source information in the target; and of computing different kinds of solutions; ie;target KBs with specified properties; given a source KB and a mapping.

OBDA: query rewriting or materialization? In practice; both!,Juan F Sequeda; Marcelo Arenas; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract Given a source relational database; a target OWL ontology and a mapping from thesource database to the target ontology; Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) concernsanswering queries over the target ontology using these three components. This paperpresents the development of Ultrawrap OBDA; an OBDA system comprising bidirectionalevaluation; that is; a hybridization of query rewriting and materialization. We observe that bycompiling the ontological entailments as mappings; implementing the mappings as SQLviews and materializing a subset of the views; the underlying SQL optimizer is able toreduce the execution time of a SPARQL query by rewriting the query in terms of the viewsspecified by the mappings. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first OBDA systemsupporting ontologies with transitivity by using SQL recursion. Our contributions include …,International Semantic Web Conference,2014,20
Regular languages of nested words: Fixed points; automata; and synchronization,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Nested words are a restriction of the class of visibly pushdown languages thatprovide a natural model of runs of programs with recursive procedure calls. The usualconnection between monadic second-order logic (MSO) and automata extends from wordsto nested words and gives us a natural notion of regular languages of nested words. In thispaper we look at some well-known aspects of regular languages–their characterization viafixed points; deterministic and alternating automata for them; and synchronization fordefining regular relations–and extend them to nested words. We show that mu-calculus is asexpressive as MSO over finite and infinite nested words; and the equivalence holds; moregenerally; for mu-calculus with past modalities evaluated in arbitrary positions in a word; notonly in the first position. We introduce the notion of alternating automata for nested words …,*,2007,20

Foundations of modern graph query languages,Renzo Angles; Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Aidan Hogan; Juan Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoc,Abstract: We survey foundational features underlying modern graph query languages. Wefirst discuss two popular graph data models: edge-labelled graphs; where nodes areconnected to other nodes by directed; labelled edges; and property graphs; where nodesand edges can have attributes. Next we discuss the two most basic graph queryingfunctionalities: graph patterns and navigational expressions. We start with graph patterns; inwhich a graph-structured query is matched against the data. Thereafter we discussnavigational expressions; in which patterns can be matched recursively against the graph tonavigate paths of arbitrary length; we give an overview of what kinds of expressions havebeen proposed; and how such expressions can be combined with graph patterns.

Querying semantic data on the web?,Marcelo Arenas; Claudio Gutierrez; Daniel P Miranker; Jorge Pérez; Juan F Sequeda,The Semantic Web is the initiative of the W3C to make information on the Web readable notonly by humans but also by machines. RDF is the data model for Semantic Web data; andSPARQL is the standard query language for this data model. In recent years; we havewitnessed a constant growth in the amount of RDF data available on the Web; which hasmotivated the theoretical study of fundamental aspects of RDF and SPARQL. The goal of thispaper is two-fold: to introduce SPARQL; which is a fundamental technology for thedevelopment of the Semantic Web; and to present some interesting and non-trivial problemson RDF data management at a Web scale; that we think the database community shouldaddress.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2013,18
Combining temporal logics for querying XML documents,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Close relationships between XML navigation and temporal logics have beendiscovered recently; in particular between logics LTL and CTL* and XPath navigation; andbetween the μ-calculus and navigation based on regular expressions. This opened up thepossibility of bringing model-checking techniques into the field of XML; as documents arenaturally represented as labeled transition systems. Most known results of this kind;however; are limited to Boolean or unary queries; which are not always sufficient forcomplex querying tasks. Here we present a technique for combining temporal logics tocapture n-ary XML queries expressible in two yardstick languages: FO and MSO. We showthat by adding simple terms to the language; and combining a temporal logic for wordstogether with a temporal logic for unary tree queries; one obtains logics that select …,International Conference on Database Theory,2007,18

The language of plain SO-tgds: Composition; inversion and structural properties,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter; Cristian Riveros,Abstract The problems of composing and inverting schema mappings specified by source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies (st-tgds) have attracted a lot of attention; as they are offundamental importance for the development of Bernsteinʼs metadata managementframework. In the case of the composition operator; a natural semantics has been proposedand the language of second-order tuple generating dependencies (SO-tgds) has beenidentified as the right language to express it. In the case of the inverse operator; severalsemantics have been proposed; most notably the maximum recovery; the only inversenotion that guarantees that every mapping specified by st-tgds is invertible. Unfortunately;less attention has been paid to combining both operators; which is the motivation of thispaper. More precisely; we start our investigation by showing that SO-tgds are not good for …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2013,15
An Extension of SPARQL for RDFS,Marcelo Arenas; Claudio Gutierrez; Jorge Pérez,Abstract RDF Schema (RDFS) extends RDF with a schema vocabulary with a predefinedsemantics. Evaluating queries which involve this vocabulary is challenging; and there is notyet consensus in the Semantic Web community on how to define a query language forRDFS. In this paper; we introduce a language for querying RDFS data. This language isobtained by extending SPARQL with nested regular expressions that allow to navigatethrough an RDF graph with RDFS vocabulary. This language is expressive enough toanswer SPARQL queries involving RDFS vocabulary; by directly traversing the input graph.,*,2008,15
Discovering XSD keys from XML data,Marcelo Arenas; Jonny Daenen; Frank Neven; Martin Ugarte; Jan Van Den Bussche; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract A great deal of research into the learning of schemas from XML data has beenconducted in recent years to enable the automatic discovery of XML schemas from XMLdocuments when no schema or only a low-quality one is available. Unfortunately; and instrong contrast to; for instance; the relational model; the automatic discovery of even thesimplest of XML constraints; namely XML keys; has been left largely unexplored in thiscontext. A major obstacle here is the unavailability of a theory on reasoning about XML keysin the presence of XML schemas; which is needed to validate the quality of candidate keys.The present article embarks on a fundamental study of such a theory and classifies thecomplexity of several crucial properties concerning XML keys in the presence of an XSD;like; for instance; testing for consistency; boundedness; satisfiability; universality; and …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,14
A principled approach to bridging the gap between graph data and their schemas,Marcelo Arenas; Gonzalo Díaz; Achille Fokoue; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Kavitha Srinivas,Abstract Although RDF graph data often come with an associated schema; recent studieshave proven that real RDF data rarely conform to their perceived schemas. Since a numberof data management decisions; including storage layouts; indexing; and efficient queryprocessing; use schemas to guide the decision making; it is imperative to have an accuratedescription of the structuredness of the data at hand (how well the data conform to theschema). In this paper; we have approached the study of the structuredness of an RDFgraph in a principled way: we propose a framework for specifying structuredness functions;which gauge the degree to which an RDF graph conforms to a schema. In particular; we firstdefine a formal language for specifying structuredness functions with expressions we callrules.

Hypothetical temporal queries in databases,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossi,Abstract This paper considers the problem of posing and answering hypothetical temporalqueries to databases. The queries are hypothetical in the sense that we pose a query to avirtually updated database; and the query is answered on the basis of the initial; physicaldatabase and the list of transactions that virtually update the database. The queries aretemporal in the sense that they refer to possibly all the states along which the databaseevolves from the initial database and the nal virtual state. The possibility of answering suchqueries relies on a speci cation of the dynamics of the database augmented with a specication of the dynamics of auxiliary tables that have their origin in the temporal subformulas ofthe query and encode the history of the database. Queries are posed in rst order pasttemporal logic. These functionalities are implemented in SCDBR; an automated reasoner …,Proceedings “ACM SIGMOD/PODS 5th International Workshop on Knowledge Representation meets Databases (KRDB’98): Innovative Application Programming and Query Interfaces,1998,13

Asrepresentation formalism we use Description Logics (DL) that exhibit a reasonable tradeoffbetween expressive power and complexity of reasoning. Thus; we assume that the sourceand target KBs are given as a DL TBox+ ABox; while the mappings have the form of DLTBox assertions.

On directly mapping relational databases to rdf and owl (extended version),Juan F Sequeda; Marcelo Arenas; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract: Mapping relational databases to RDF is a fundamental problem for thedevelopment of the Semantic Web. We present a solution; inspired by draft methods definedby the W3C where relational databases are directly mapped to RDF and OWL. Given arelational database schema and its integrity constraints; this direct mapping produces anOWL ontology; which; provides the basis for generating RDF instances. The semantics ofthis mapping is defined using Datalog. Two fundamental properties are informationpreservation and query preservation. We prove that our mapping satisfies both conditions;even for relational databases that contain null values. We also consider two desirableproperties: monotonicity and semantics preservation. We prove that our mapping ismonotone and also prove that no monotone mapping; including ours; is semantic …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.3667,2012,10
Representability in DL-Liter knowledge base exchange,Marcelo Arenas; Elena Botoeva; Diego Calvanese; Vladislav Ryzhikov; Evgeny Sherkhonov,Knowledge base exchange can be considered as a generalization of data exchange inwhich the aim is to exchange between a source and a target connected through mappings;not only explicit knowledge; ie; data; but also implicit knowledge in the form of axioms. Suchproblem has been investigated recently using Description Logics (DLs) as representationformalism; thus assuming that the source and target KBs are given as a DL TBox+ ABox;while the mappings have the form of DL TBox assertions. In this paper we are interested inthe problem of representing a given source TBox by means of a target TBox that captures atbest the intensional information in the source.

Enabling Faceted Search over OWL 2 with SemFacet.,Marcelo Arenas; Bernardo Cuenca Grau; Evgeny Kharlamov; Sarunas Marciuska; Dmitriy Zheleznyakov,Abstract. Lots of applications nowadays rely on RDF; OWL 2; and SPARQL 1.1 for storing;publishing and querying data. However; SPARQL 1.1 is not targeted towards end-users; andsuitable query interfaces are needed. Faceted search is a prominent approach to facilitateend-users query formulation which is widely used in information systems. This approachwas recently adapted to the context of RDF; however; the proposed solutions lack rigoroustheoretical underpinning and essentially ignore OWL 2 axioms. We develop a cleantheoretical framework for faceted search that accounts for both RDF data and OWL 2 axioms.We implemented and tested some of our solutions in the SemFacet platform.,OWLED,2014,8

Sparqlbye: Querying rdf data by example,Gonzalo Diaz; Marcelo Arenas; Michael Benedikt,Abstract Semantic Web technologies such as RDF and its query language; SPARQL; offerthe possibility of opening up the use of public datasets to a great variety of ordinary users.But a key obstacle to the use of open data is the unfamiliarity of users with the structure ofdata or with SPARQL. To deal with these issues; we introduce a system for querying RDFdata by example. At its core is a technique for reverse-engineering SPARQL queries byexample. We demonstrate how reverse engineering along with other techniques; such asquery relaxation; enables our system; SPARQLByE; to guide users who are unfamiliar withboth the dataset and with SPARQL to the desired query and result set.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,7
Reverse engineering SPARQL queries,Marcelo Arenas; Gonzalo I Diaz; Egor V Kostylev,Abstract Semantic Web systems provide open interfaces for end-users to access data via apowerful high-level query language; SPARQL. But users unfamiliar with either the details ofSPARQL or properties of the target dataset may find it easier to query by example--giveexamples of the information they want (or examples of both what they want and what they donot want) and let the system reverse engineer the desired query from the examples. Thisapproach has been heavily used in the setting of relational databases. We provide here aninvestigation of the reverse engineering problem in the context of SPARQL. We first providea theoretical study; formalising variants of the reverse engineering problem and giving tightbounds on its complexity. We next explain an implementation of a reverse engineering toolfor positive examples. An experimental analysis of the tool shows that it scales well in the …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web,2016,7
Query language-based inverses of schema mappings: semantics; computation; and closure properties,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter; Cristian Riveros,Abstract The inversion of schema mappings has been identified as one of the fundamentaloperators for the development of a general framework for metadata management. During thelast few years; three alternative notions of inversion for schema mappings have beenproposed (Fagin-inverse (Fagin; TODS 32 (4); 25: 1–25: 53; 2007); quasi-inverse (Fagin etal.; TODS 33 (2); 11: 1–11: 52; 2008); and maximum recovery (Arenas et al.; TODS 34 (4);22: 1–22: 48; 2009)). However; these notions lack some fundamental properties that limittheir practical applicability: most of them are expressed in languages including features thatare difficult to use in practice; some of these inverses are not guaranteed to exist formappings specified with source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies (st-tgds); and it hasbeen futile to search for a meaningful mapping language that is closed under any of these …,The VLDB Journal,2012,7

A framework for annotating CSV-like data,Marcelo Arenas; Francisco Maturana; Cristian Riveros; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract In this paper; we propose a simple and expressive framework for adding metadatato CSV documents and their noisy variants. The framework is based on annotating parts ofthe document that can be later used to read; query; or exchange the data. The core of ourframework is a language based on extended regular expressions that are used for selectingdata. These expressions are then combined using a set of rules in order to annotate thedata. We study the computational complexity of implementing our framework and present anefficient evaluation algorithm that runs in time proportional to its output and linear in its input.As a proof of concept; we test an implementation of our framework against a large number ofreal world datasets and show that it can be efficiently used in practice.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,6
On Faceted Search over Knowledge Bases.,Bernardo Cuenca Grau; Evgeny Kharlamov; Dmitriy Zheleznyakov; Marcelo Arenas; Sarunas Marciuska,Motivation An increasing number of applications rely on RDF [2] and SPARQL 1.1 [3] forstoring; publishing; and querying semistructured data. The functionality of many suchapplications is enhanced with OWL 2 ontologies [1]; which are used to provide a conceptuallayer on top of data and enrich query answers with implicit information. Although the growingpopularity of RDF; OWL 2; and SPARQL 1.1 has been accompanied by the development ofbetter and better query answering engines; writing SPARQL 1.1 queries is not well-suited forthe majority of users. Thus; an important challenge is the development of simple yet powerfulquery interfaces that capture welldefined fragments of SPARQL 1.1.

Foundations of Modern Query Languages for Graph Databases,Renzo Angles; Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Aidan Hogan; Juan Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract We survey foundational features underlying modern graph query languages. Wefirst discuss two popular graph data models: edge-labelled graphs; where nodes areconnected by directed; labelled edges; and property graphs; where nodes and edges canfurther have attributes. Next we discuss the two most fundamental graph queryingfunctionalities: graph patterns and navigational expressions. We start with graph patterns; inwhich a graph-structured query is matched against the data. Thereafter; we discussnavigational expressions; in which patterns can be matched recursively against the graph tonavigate paths of arbitrary length; we give an overview of what kinds of expressions havebeen proposed and how they can be combined with graph patterns. We also discuss severalsemantics under which queries using the previous features can be evaluated; what …,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),2017,5
A completely automatic direct mapping of relational databases to RDF and OWL,Juan F Sequeda; Marcelo Arenas; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract. Integrating relational databases with the Semantic Web can be accomplish bymeans of two primary approaches: automatic direct mapping or developers detailingapplication specific mappings. Both approaches are the subject of the W3C RelationalDatabase to RDF (RDB2RDF) Working Group. Intuitively; a direct mapping is a default andautomatic way to translate a relational database schema and its content to OWL and RDF. Inthis poster; we present a specification; expressed in Datalog; of a direct mapping inspired bythe current Direct Mapping draft of the W3C RDB2RDF Working Group. We are currentlystudying four fundamental properties: monotonicity; information preservation; querypreservation and semantics preservation. In particular; we observe that the combination ofthese properties needs to be addressed very carefully.,International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).–2012.

Query evaluation in almost consistent databases using residues,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossi; Jan Chomicki,The authors consider the problem of logical characterization of the notion of correct answersin a relational database that may violate given integrity constraints. This notion is captured interms of the possible repaired versions of the database. A computational counterpart of thesemantic notion is provided in terms of the reconstruction of the database as a deductivedatabase to which concepts and techniques from semantic query optimization are appliedwith the purpose of computing correct answers.,Computer Science; 1998.

Knowledge base exchange: The case of OWL 2 QL,Marcelo Arenas; Elena Botoeva; Diego Calvanese; Vladislav Ryzhikov,Abstract In this article; we define and study the problem of exchanging knowledge betweena source and a target knowledge base (KB); connected through mappings. Differently fromthe traditional database exchange setting; which considers only the exchange of data; weare interested in exchanging implicit knowledge. As representation formalism we useDescription Logics (DLs); thus assuming that the source and target KBs are given as a DLTBox+ ABox; while the mappings have the form of DL TBox assertions. We define a generalframework of KB exchange; and study the problem of translating the knowledge in thesource KB according to the mappings expressed in OWL 2 QL; the profile of the standardWeb Ontology Language OWL 2 based on the description logic DL-Lite R.

Ontology-based data access using views,Juan F Sequeda; Marcelo Arenas; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract The OWL 2 QL profile; which is based on DL-LiteR; has been designed so thatquery answering is possible using relational database technology via query rewriting.Unfortunately; given a query Q posed in terms of an OWL 2 QL ontology O; the size of therewritten query; Q o; which can be evaluated directly on the relational database; is worstcase exponential wrt the size of Q and O [1]. This means that the computation and evaluationof Q o can be costly. Recent research focuses on creating rewriting algorithms thatgenerates Q o with a smaller size [3].,International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems,2012,4

Datalog as a query language for data exchange systems,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Juan Reutter,Abstract The class of unions of conjunctive queries (UCQ) has been shown to be particularlywell-behaved for data exchange; its certain answers can be computed in polynomial time (interms of data complexity). However; this is not the only class with this property; the certainanswers to any Datalog program can also can be computed in polynomial time. The problemis that both UCQ and Datalog do not allow for negated atoms; while most database querylanguages are equipped with negation. Unfortunately; adding an unrestricted form ofnegation to these languages yields to intractability of the problem of computing certainanswers. In order to face this challenge; we have recently proposed a language; calledDatalog C (≠)[5]; that extends Datalog with a restricted form of negation while keeping thegood properties of Datalog; and UCQ; for data exchange.

Game-based notions of locality over finite models,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Locality notions in logic say that the truth value of a formula can be determinedlocally; by looking at the isomorphism type of a small neighborhood of its free variables.Such notions have proved to be useful in many applications. They all; however; refer toisomorphism of neighborhoods; which most local logics cannot test for. A more relaxednotion of locality says that the truth value of a formula is determined by what the logic itselfcan say about that small neighborhood. Or; since most logics are characterized by games;the truth value of a formula is determined by the type; with respect to a game; of that smallneighborhood. Such game-based notions of locality can often be applied when traditionalisomorphism-based locality cannot. Our goal is to study game-based notions of locality.

The dynamics of database views,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossi,Abstract The dynamics of relational database can be specified by means of Reiter'sformalism based on the situation calculus. The specification of transaction based databaseupdates is given in terms of Successor State Axioms (SSAs) for the base tables of thedatabase. These axioms completely describe the contents of the tables at an arbitrary stateof the database that is generated by the execution of a legal primitive transaction; and thussolve the frame problem for databases. In this paper we show how to derive action-effectbased SSAs for views from the SSAs for the base tables. We prove consistency propertiesfor those axioms. In addition; we establish the relationship between the derived SSA and theview definition as a static integrity constraint of the database. We give applications of thederived SSAs to the problems of view maintenance; and checking; proving; and …,Workshop on (Trans) Actions and Change in Logic Programming and Deductive Databases,1997,4

Designing a query language for RDF: marrying open and closed worlds,Marcelo Arenas; Martín Ugarte,Abstract When querying an Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph; a prominentfeature is the possibility of extending the answer to a query with optional information.However; the definition of this feature in SPARQL—the standard RDF query language—hasraised some important issues. Most notably; the use of this feature increases the complexityof the evaluation problem; and its closed-world semantics is in conflict with the underlyingopen-world semantics of RDF. Many approaches for fixing such problems have beenproposed; the most prominent being the introduction of the semantic notion of weaklymonotone SPARQL query. Weakly monotone SPARQL queries have shaped the class ofqueries that conform to the open-world semantics of RDF. Unfortunately; finding an effectiveway of restricting SPARQL to the fragment of weakly monotone queries has proven to be …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2017,3
A preliminary investigation into SPARQL query complexity and federation in Bio2RDF,Carlos Buil-Aranda; Martın Ugarte; Marcelo Arenas; Michel Dumontier,Abstract When users query a SPARQL endpoint; they normally face an empty text box inwhich they have to write the desired queries. This obstructs the process of obtaining the datathey want; since users rarely have any assistance in querying a (possibly huge) RDFdatabase. In this paper we report a deep analysis of the server log files that record thequeries that users send to the SPARQL endpoints; focusing in the Bio2RDF cluster. This loganalysis reveals the large number of repeated queries that users submit; and how theypursue a trial and error process by adding and removing operations from the submittedqueries to obtain the desired results. We also show how users try to connect to other RDFdatasets in the Linked Open Data cloud. Our results offer insight into the interaction betweenusers and a schema-light RDF dataset; and secondly; suggest improvements to SPARQL …,Alberto Mendelzon International Workshop on Foundations of Data Management,2015,3
Regular languages of nested words: Fixed points; automata; and synchronization,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Nested words provide a natural model of runs of programs with recursive procedurecalls. The usual connection between monadic second-order logic (MSO) and automataextends from words to nested words and gives us a natural notion of regular languages ofnested words. In this paper we look at some well-known aspects of regular languages—theircharacterization via fixed points; deterministic and alternating automata for them; andsynchronization for defining regular relations—and extend them to nested words. We showthat mu-calculus is as expressive as MSO over finite and infinite nested words; and theequivalence holds; more generally; for mu-calculus with past modalities evaluated inarbitrary positions in a word; not only in the first position. We introduce the notion ofalternating automata for nested words; show that they are as expressive as the usual …,Theory of Computing Systems,2011,3

A Datalog-Based Language for Querying RDF Graphs.,Marcelo Arenas; Georg Gottlob; Andreas Pieris,RDF is the W3C recommendation data model to represent information about World WideWeb resources; while SPARQL is the standard language for querying RDF data; since itsstandardization in 2008. One of the distinctive features of Semantic Web data is theexistence of vocabularies with predefined semantics: the RDF Schema (RDFS) and the WebOntology Language (OWL); which can be used to derive logical conclusions from RDFgraphs; hence; an RDF query language equipped with reasoning capabilities to deal withthese vocabularies is desirable. In addition; navigational capabilities are vital for datamodels with an explicit graph structure such as RDF [1; 3; 9; 15]; while recursive definitionsare a key feature for graph query languages [5; 14].

Bidirectional Constraints for Exchanging Data: Beyond Monotone Queries.,Marcelo Arenas; Gabriel Diéguez; Jorge Pérez,Abstract In this paper; we propose to use the language of bidirectional constraints to specifyschema mappings in the context of data exchange. These constraints impose restrictionsover both the source and the target data; and have the potential to minimize the ambiguity inthe description of the target data to be materialized. We start by making a case for theusefulness of bidirectional constraints to give a meaningful closed-world semantics for st-tgds; which is motivated by Clark's predicate completion and Reiter's formalization of theclosed-world assumption of a logical theory. We then formally study the use of bidirectionalconstraints in data exchange. In particular; we pinpoint the complexity of the existence-of-solutions and the query evaluation problems in several different scenarios; including in thelatter case both monotone and nonmonotone queries.,IJCAI,2015,2

Solutions and query rewriting in data exchange,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Ronald Fagin; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Data exchange is the problem of taking data structured under a source schema andcreating an instance of a target schema. Given a source instance; there may be manysolutions–target instances that satisfy the constraints of the data exchange problem.Previous work has identified two classes of desirable solutions: canonical universalsolutions; and their cores. Query answering in data exchange amounts to rewriting a queryover the target schema to another query that; over a materialized target instance; gives theresult that is semantically consistent with the source (specifically; the “certain answers”).Basic questions are then:(1) how do these solutions compare in terms of query rewriting?and (2) how can we determine whether a query is rewritable over a particular solution? Ourgoal is to answer these questions. Our first main result is that; in terms of rewritability by …,Information and Computation,2013,2

The exact complexity of the first-order logic definability problem,Marcelo Arenas; Gonzalo I Díaz,Abstract We study the definability problem for first-order logic; denoted by FO-D ef. The inputof FO-D ef is a relational database instance I and a relation R; the question to answer iswhether there exists a first-order query Q (or; equivalently; a relational algebra expressionQ) such that Q evaluated on I gives R as an answer. Although the study of FO-D ef datesback to 1978; when the decidability of this problem was shown; the exact complexity of FO-Def remains as a fundamental open problem. In this article; we provide a polynomial-timealgorithm for solving FO-D ef that uses calls to a graph-isomorphism subroutine (or oracle).As a consequence; the first-order definability problem is found to be complete for the classGI of all problems that are polynomial-time Turing reducible to the graph isomorphismproblem; thus closing the open question about the exact complexity of this problem.

The goal then is to materialize a targetdatabase instance that corresponds to the source instance and the mapping. In this settingsource data is explicitly given; that is; every fact that is true in it is explicitly mentioned in thesource database instance.

G-CORE: A Core for Future Graph Query Languages,Renzo Angles; Marcelo Arenas; George HL Fletcher; Claudio Gutierrez; Tobias Lindaaker; Marcus Paradies; Stefan Plantikow; Juan Sequeda; Oskar van Rest; Hannes Voigt,Abstract: We report on a community effort between industry and academia to shape thefuture of graph query languages. We argue that existing graph database managementsystems should consider supporting a query language with two key characteristics. First; itshould be composable; meaning; that graphs are the input and the output of queries.Second; the graph query language should treat paths as first-class citizens. Our result is G-CORE; a powerful graph query language design that fulfills these goals; and strikes a carefulbalance between path query expressivity and evaluation complexity. Subjects: Databases(cs.

A note on computing certain answers to queries over incomplete databases,Marcelo Arenas; Elena Botoeva; E Kostylev; Vladislav Ryzhikov,The ability to handle incomplete information is fundamental in many areas; including dataintegration; data exchange; inconsistent databases; and the Semantic Web. In such areas; itis often impossible to describe the domain of interest in a full; comprehensive way; so theaim of an incomplete database is to concisely represent a (potentially infinite) number ofcompletions. Incomplete information is usually represented by allowing placeholders forunknown values; which are called “nulls”. An incomplete database I with such nulls thenrepresents a set of databases with complete information; called representations of I; each ofwhich is obtained by replacing nulls by actual values. One of the most important problemsassociated to databases is query answering.

An original schema is identified for the dataset. Thisoriginal schema comprises an organizational structure. An initial fit between the dataset andthe original schema is determined. The initial fit quantifying a conformity of the data in thedataset to the organizational structure of the original schema. A plurality of additionalschemas are identified. Each additional schema is a distinct organizational schema. Thedataset is partitioned into a plurality of subsets. Each subset comprises a modified fitquantifying a modified conformity of subset data in each subset to one of the original schemaand the additional schemas. The modified fit is greater than the original fit.,*,2017,*

Designing a Query Language for RDF,Marcelo Arenas; Martin Ugarte,Resumen When querying an Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph; a prominentfeature is the possibility of extending the answer to a query with optional information.However; the definition of this feature in SPARQL—the standard RDF query language—hasraised some important issues. Most notably; the use of this feature increases the complexityof the evaluation problem; and its closed-world semantics is in conflict with the underlyingopen-world semantics of RDF. Many approaches for fixing such problems have beenproposed; the most prominent being the introduction of the semantic notion of weaklymonotone SPARQL query. Weakly monotone SPARQL queries have shaped the class ofqueries that conform to the open-world semantics of RDF. Unfortunately; finding an effectiveway of restricting SPARQL to the fragment of weakly monotone queries has proven to be …,ACM transactions on database systems,2017,*

Incomplete Causal Laws in the Situation Calculus Using Free Fluents.,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge A Baier; Juan S Navarro; Sebastian Sardina,Abstract We propose a simple relaxation of Reiter's basic action theories; based on fluentswithout successor state axioms; that accommodates incompleteness beyond the initialdatabase. We prove that fundamental results about basic action theories can be fullyrecovered and that the generalized framework allows for natural specifications of variousforms of incomplete causal laws. We illustrate this by showing how the evolution ofincomplete databases; guarded action theories; and non-deterministic actions can beconveniently specified.,IJCAI,2016,*

Faceted search over RDF− based knowledge graphs,Bernardo Cuenca Grau; Evgeny Kharlamov; Dmitriy Zheleznyakov,Abstract Knowledge graphs such as Yago and Freebase have become a powerful asset forenhancing search; and are being intensively used in both academia and industry. Manyexisting knowledge graphs are either available as Linked Open Data; or they can beexported as RDF datasets enhanced with background knowledge in the form of an OWL 2ontology. Faceted search is the de facto approach for exploratory search in many onlineapplications; and has been recently proposed as a suitable paradigm for querying RDFrepositories. In this paper; we provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings for faceted searchin the context of RDF-based knowledge graphs enhanced with OWL 2 ontologies. Weidentify well-defined fragments of SPARQL that can be naturally captured using facetedsearch as a query paradigm; and establish the computational complexity of answering …,Journal of Web Semantics,2016,*

Two of the most notableare an increase in evaluation complexity and the possibility of creating negative queries(queries for which there can be a loss of answers when adding new data to a dataset). Manyapproaches for settling these issues have been presented; being that of restricting SPARQLto well-designed graph patterns [2] the most widely adopted.

Representability in DL-Lite 모 Knowledge Base Exchange,M Arenas; E Botoeva; D Calvanese; V Ryzhikov; E Sherkhonov,Abstract. Knowledge base exchange can be considered as a generalization of dataexchange in which the aim is to exchange between a source and a target connected throughmappings; not only explicit knowledge; ie; data; but also implicit knowledge in the form ofaxioms. Such problem has been investigated recently using Description Logics (DLs) asrepresentation formalism; thus assuming that the source and target KBs are given as a DLTBox+ ABox; while the mappings have the form of DL TBox assertions. In this paper we areinterested in the problem of representing a given source TBox by means of a target TBoxthat captures at best the intensional information in the source. In previous work; results onrepresentability have been obtained for DL-LiteRDFS; a DL corresponding to the FOLfragment of RDFS. We extend these results to the positive fragment of DL-LiteR; in which …,25th International Workshop on Description Logics,2012,*

Composition with Target Constraints,Alan Nash; Ronald Fagin; Marcelo Arenas,It is known that the composition of schema mappings; each specified by source-to-targettgds (st-tgds); can be specified by a second-order tgd (SO tgd). We consider the question ofwhat happens when target constraints are allowed. Specifically; we consider the question ofspecifying the composition of standard schema mappings (those specified by st-tgds; targetegds; and a weakly acyclic set of target tgds). We show that SO tgds; even with theassistance of arbitrary source constraints and target constraints; cannot specify in generalthe composition of two standard schema mappings. Therefore; we introduce source-to-targetsecond-order dependencies (st-SO dependencies); which are similar to SO tgds; but allowequations in the conclusion. We show that st-SO dependencies (along with target egds andtarget tgds) are sufficient to express the composition of every finite sequence of standard …,Logical Methods in Computer Science,2011,*

Boyce-Codd Normal Form,Marcelo Arenas,The B+-tree is a disk-based; paginated; dynamically updateable; balanced; and tree-likeindex structure. It supports the exact match query as well as insertion/deletion operations inO (logpn) I/Os; where n is the number of records in the tree and p is the page capacity innumber of records. It also supports the range searches in O (logpn+ t∕ p) I/Os; where t is thenumber of records in the query result.,*,2009,*
Second Normal Form (2NF),Marcelo Arenas,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,*
Normal Forms and Normalization,Marcelo Arenas,The simplest way to incorporate unknown values into the relational model; is to allowvariables; in addition to constants; as entries in the columns of relations. Such constructs arecalled tables; instead of relations. A table is an incomplete database; and represents a set ofcomplete databases; each obtained by substituting all variables with constants. Differentoccurrences of the same variable (marked null) are substituted with the same constant. Thesubstitution is thus a function from the variables and constants; to the constants; such thatthe function is identity on the constants. A table T then represents the set of relations;denoted rep (T); defined as {v (T): v is a valuation}. Then the certain answer to a query q on atable T; denoted sure (q; T) is the set of tuples that occur in every answer obtained byapplying the query to every database in rep (T). In other words; the certain answer to q on …,*,2009,*
Third Normal Form,Marcelo Arenas,There are two kinds of tables: frequency tables that display the count of respondents at thecrossing of the categorical attributes (in N) and magnitude tables that display information ona numerical attribute at the crossing of the categorical attributes (in R). For example; givensome census microdata containing attributes “Job” and “Town;” one can generate afrequency table displaying the count of respondents doing each job type in each town. If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,*
Fourth Normal Form,Marcelo Arenas,Definition The term facet means ''little face'' and is often used to describe one side of amany-sided object; especially a cut gemstone. In the context of information science; where theitem being described is an information ob- ject; facets could refer to the object's author; date;topic; etc. Facets are used to describe both the organi- zation of information (facetedclassification); and to interface techniques that provide flexible access to that information (facetedsearch). The motivation for fac- eted classification and search is that any single organi- zationalstructure is too limiting to accommodate access to complex domains. Multiple independent facetsprovide alternative ways of getting to the same information; thus supporting a wider range ofend-user tasks and knowledge. The fields of faceted classification; information architecture; anddata modeling provide theory and methods for identifying and organizing facets. The …,*,2009,*
First-Order and Temporal Logics for Nested Words,Leonid Libkin; Neil Immerman; Kousha Etessami; Pablo Barcelo; Marcelo Arenas; Rajeev Alur,Nested words are a structured model of execution paths in procedural programs; reflectingtheir call and return nesting structure. Finite nested words also capture the structure of parsetrees and other tree-structured data; such as XML. We provide new temporal logics for finiteand infinite nested words; which are natural extensions of LTL; and prove that these logicsare first-order expressively-complete. One of them is based on adding a" within" modality;evaluating a formula on a subword; to a logic CaRet previously studied in the context ofverifying properties of recursive state machines (RSMs). The other logic; NWTL; is based onthe notion of a summary path that uses both the linear and nesting structures. For NWTL weshow that satisfiability is EXPTIME-complete; and that model-checking can be done in timepolynomial in the size of the RSM model and exponential in the size of the NWTL formula …,Logical Methods in Computer Science,2008,*
Game-based notions of locality over finite models,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Locality notions in logic say that the truth value of a formula can be determinedlocally; by looking at the isomorphism type of a small neighbourhood of its free variables.Such notions have proved to be useful in many applications. They all; however; refer toisomorphisms of neighbourhoods; which most local logics cannot test. A stronger notion oflocality says that the truth value of a formula is determined by what the logic itself can sayabout that small neighbourhood. Since the expressiveness of many logics can becharacterized by games; one can also say that the truth value of a formula is determined bythe type; with respect to a game; of that small neighbourhood. Such game-based notions oflocality can often be applied when traditional isomorphism-based notions of locality cannot.Our goal is to study game-based notions of locality.

Game-based Notions of Locality,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceléo; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Locality is a very useful tool in finite model theory; that allows one to proveinexpressibility results by avoiding complicated combinatorial reasoning typically associatedwith proofs involving Ehrenfeucht-Fra؟ iss e games. It is applicable to first-order logic (FO)and some of its rather powerful counting extensions. In this short report on an on-goingresearch project; we present a more general-and perhaps a more natural-notion of locality;and give a few examples of its applicability.,null,2003,*

Hypothetical Database Temporal Reasoning with History Encoding,Marcelo Arenas; Leopoldo Bertossiy,Abstract In this paper we integrate a history {encoding based methodology developed byChomicki for checking dynamic database integrity constraints into a situationcalculus basedspeci cation of relational database updates as proposed by Reiter. By doing this; we areable to:(1) Answer queries about a whole hypothetical evolution of a database; withouthaving to update the entire database and keep all the information associated to thegenerated states;(2) State and prove dynamic integrity constraints as static integrityconstraints;(3) Transform non markovian preconditions for updates into markovianpreconditions. All these results; although motivated by problems in database theory; can beapplied to theories of action and change in general.

Revisiting Blank Nodes in RDF,Marcelo Arenas; Mariano Consens,Jointly with the release of RDF in 1999 as recommendation of the W3C; the natural problemof querying RDF data was raised. Since then; several designs and implementations of RDFquery languages have been proposed (see [9] and [7] for detailed comparisons of RDFquery languages). In 2004; the RDF Data Access Working Group released a first publicworking draft of a query language for RDF; called SPARQL [13]. Since then; SPARQL hasbeen rapidly adopted as the standard for querying Semantic Web data. In fact; SPARQLbecame a W3C Recommendation in January 2008 by http://www. bobsseo. com. In spite ofbeing the standard query language for RDF; the design of SPARQL was made to keep theefficiency of the language considering the current database,*,*,*
SemFacet: Faceted Search over Ontology Enhanced Knowledge Graphs⋆,B Cuenca Grau1 E Kharlamov; Š Marciuška2 D Zheleznyakov1 M Arenas,Abstract. In this demo we present the SemFacet system for faceted search over ontologyenhanced Knowledge Graphs (KGs) stored in RDF. SemFacet allows users to query KGswith relatively complex SPARQL queries via an intuitive Amazon-like interface. SemFacetcan compute faceted interfaces over large scale RDF datasets by relying on incrementalalgorithms and over large ontologies by exploiting ontology projection techniques.SemFacet relies on an in-memory triple store and current implementation bundles JRDFox;Sesame; Stardog; and PAGOdA. During the demonstration the attendees can try SemFacetby exploring Yago KG.,*,*,*

What's Hard about XML Schema Constraints?,Marcelo Arenas½; Wenfei Fan¾; Leonid Libkin½,Abstract. Data description for XML usually comes in the form of a type specification (eg; aDTD) together with integrity constraints. XML Schema allows one to mix DTD features withsemantic information; such as keys and foreign keys. It was shown recently [2; 7] that theinteraction of DTDs with constraints may be rather nontrivial. In particular; testing if a generalspecification is consistent is undecidable; but for the most common case of single-attributeconstraints it is NP-complete; and linear time if no foreign keys are present. However; XMLSchema design did not adopt the form of constraints prevalent in the database literature; andslightly changed the semantics of keys; foreign keys; and unique constraints. In this paperwe demonstrate the very costly effect of this slight change on the feasibility of consistencychecking. In particular; all the known hardness results extend to the XML Schema case …,*,*,*

Computing Solutions in OWL 2 QL Knowledge Base Exchange,Marcelo Arenas; Elena Botoeva; Diego Calvanese; Vladislav Ryzhikov,Abstract. The problem of exchanging knowledge bases from a source signature to a targetsignature connected through a mapping has recently attracted attention in knowledgerepresentation. In this paper; we study this problem for knowledge bases and mappingsexpressed in OWL 2 QL; one of the profiles of the standard Web Ontology Language OWL2.More specifically; we consider the membership and non-emptiness problems associatedwith computing universal solutions; which have been identified as one of the most desirabletranslations to be materialized. We study two settings: when ABoxes are in OWL 2 QL andwhen null values are allowed in the ABox language. For the former case; we provide a noveltechnique based on reachability games on graphs to show that the non-emptiness andmembership problems are in PTime. For the latter case; we report a range of complexity …,*,*,*

2nd International Workshop on Logical Aspects and Applications of Integrity Constraints,Henning Christiansen; Davide Martinenghi; Marcelo Arenas; Andrea Calì; Stefano Ceri,Integrity constraints are commonly recognized as the tool for characterizing data semanticsand well-formedness in databases and information systems in general. As such; integrityconstraints apply to different contexts; such as relational and deductive databases; activedatabase systems; and XML document collections; and are relevant for several applications;including integrity control; data integration and semantic query optimization. LAAIC'06 is the2nd International Workshop on Logical Aspects and Applications of Integrity Constraints;and its goal is to gather experts in the field and to stimulate a constructive dialogue amongresearchers.

Efficient evaluation of SPARQL over RDFS graphs,Jorge Pérez; Marcelo Arenas; Claudio Gutierrez,ABSTRACT Evaluating queries over RDFS is currently done by computing the closure;which is quadratic in the worst case. In this paper; we show how to evaluate SPARQL overRDFS graphs by using a navigational language grounded in standard relational algebrawith operators for navigating triples with regular constraints. In particular; we show that thereis a fragment of this language with linear time data-complexity which is enough to performRDFS evaluation of standard SPARQL queries.,*,*,*
