Computing consistent query answers using conflict hypergraphs,Jan Chomicki; Jerzy Marcinkowski; Slawomir Staworko,Abstract A consistent query answer in a possibly inconsistent database is an answer whichis true in every (minimal) repair of the database. We present here a practical framework forcomputing consistent query answers for large; possibly inconsistent relational databases.We consider relational algebra queries without projection; and denial constraints. Becauseour framework handles union queries; we can effectively (and efficiently) extract indefinitedisjunctive information from an inconsistent database. We describe a number of noveloptimization techniques applicable in this context and summarize experimental results thatvalidate our approach.,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2004,102
Prioritized repairing and consistent query answering in relational databases,Sławek Staworko; Jan Chomicki; Jerzy Marcinkowski,Abstract A consistent query answer in an inconsistent database is an answer obtained inevery (minimal) repair. The repairs are obtained by resolving all conflicts in all possibleways. Often; however; the user is able to provide a preference on how conflicts should beresolved. We investigate here the framework of preferred consistent query answers; in whichuser preferences are used to narrow down the set of repairs to a set of preferred repairs. Weaxiomatize desirable properties of preferred repairs. We present three different families ofpreferred repairs and study their mutual relationships. Finally; we investigate the complexityof preferred repairing and computing preferred consistent query answers.,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2012,54
Hippo: A system for computing consistent answers to a class of SQL queries,Jan Chomicki; Jerzy Marcinkowski; Slawomir Staworko,Abstract Integrity constraints express important properties of data; but the task of preservingdata consistency is becoming increasingly problematic with new database applications. Forexample; in the case of integration of several data sources; even if the sources areseparately consistent; the integrated data can violate the integrity constraints. The traditionalapproach; removing the conflicting data; is not a good option because the sources can beautonomous. Another scenario is a long-running activity where consistency can be violatedonly temporarily and future updates will restore it. Finally; data consistency may beneglected because of efficiency or other reasons.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,50
Validity-sensitive querying of XML databases,Slawomir Staworko; Jan Chomicki,Abstract We consider the problem of querying XML documents which are not valid withrespect to given DTDs. We propose a framework for measuring the invalidity of XMLdocuments and compactly representing minimal repairing scenarios. Furthermore; wepresent a validity-sensitive method of querying XML documents; which extracts moreinformation from invalid XML documents than does the standard query evaluation. Finally;we provide experimental results which validate our approach.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,49
Learning twig and path queries,Sławek Staworko; Piotr Wieczorek,Abstract We investigate the problem of learning XML queries; path queries and twig queries;from examples given by the user. A learning algorithm takes on the input a set of XMLdocuments with nodes annotated by the user and returns a query that selects the nodes in amanner consistent with the annotation. We study two learning settings that differ with thetypes of annotations. In the first setting the user may only indicate required nodes that thequery must select (ie; positive examples). In the second; more general; setting; the user mayalso indicate forbidden nodes that the query must not select (ie; negative examples). Thequery may or may not select any node with no annotation. We formalize what it means for aclass of queries to be learnable. One requirement is the existence of a learning algorithmthat is sound ie; always returning a query consistent with the examples given by the user …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Database Theory,2012,34
Consistent query answers in the presence of universal constraints,Sławomir Staworko; Jan Chomicki,Abstract The framework of consistent query answers and repairs has been introduced toalleviate the impact of inconsistent data on the answers to a query. A repair is a minimallydifferent consistent instance and an answer is consistent if it is present in every repair. In thisarticle we study the complexity of consistent query answers and repair checking in thepresence of universal constraints. We propose an extended version of the conflicthypergraph which allows to capture all repairs wrt a set of universal constraints. We showthat repair checking is in PTIME for the class of full tuple-generating dependencies anddenial constraints; and we present a polynomial repair algorithm. This algorithm is sound; iealways produces a repair; but also complete; ie every repair can be constructed. Next; wepresent a polynomial-time algorithm computing consistent answers to ground quantifier …,Information Systems,2010,34
Preference-driven querying of inconsistent relational databases,Slawomir Staworko; Jan Chomicki; Jerzy Marcinkowski,Abstract One of the goals of cleaning an inconsistent database is to remove conflictsbetween tuples. Typically; the user specifies how the conflicts should be resolved.Sometimes this specification is incomplete; and the cleaned database may still beinconsistent. At the same time; data cleaning is a rather drastic approach to conflictresolution: It removes tuples from the database; which may lead to information loss andinaccurate query answers. We investigate an approach which constitutes an alternative todata cleaning. The approach incorporates preference-driven conflict resolution into queryanswering. The database is not changed. These goals are achieved by augmenting theframework of consistent query answers through various notions of preferred repair. Weaxiomatize desirable properties of preferred repair families and propose different notions …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,33
gMark: schema-driven generation of graphs and queries,Guillaume Bagan; Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; George HL Fletcher; Aurélien Lemay; Nicky Advokaat,Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains. Hence; graphdatabase systems are becoming increasingly important. In the experimental study of thesesystems; it is vital that the research community has shared solutions for the generation ofdatabase instances and query workloads having predictable and controllable properties. Inthis paper; we present the design and engineering principles of gMark; a domainand querylanguage-independent graph instance and query workload generator. A core contribution ofgMark is its ability to target and control the diversity of properties of both the generatedinstances and the generated workloads coupled to these instances. Further noveltiesinclude support for regular path queries; a fundamental graph query paradigm; and schema-driven selectivity estimation of queries; a key feature in controlling workload chokepoints …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,25
Equivalence of deterministic nested word to word transducers,Sławomir Staworko; Grégoire Laurence; Aurélien Lemay; Joachim Niehren,Abstract We study the equivalence problem of deterministic nested word to word transducersand show it to be surprisingly robust. Modulo polynomial time reductions; it can be identifiedwith 4 equivalence problems for diverse classes of deterministic non-copying order-preserving transducers. In particular; we present polynomial time back and fourth reductionsto the morphism equivalence problem on context free languages; which is known to besolvable in polynomial time.,International Symposium on Fundamentals of Computation Theory,2009,24
Complexity and Expressiveness of ShEx for RDF,Slawek Staworko; Iovka Boneva; Jose E Labra Gayo; Samuel Hym; Eric G Prud'hommeaux; Harold Solbrig,Abstract We study the expressiveness and complexity of Shape Expression Schema (ShEx);a novel schema formalism for RDF currently under development by W3C. A ShEx assignstypes to the nodes of an RDF graph and allows to constrain the admissible neighborhoodsof nodes of a given type with regular bag expressions (RBEs). We formalize and investigatetwo alternative semantics; multi-and single-type; depending on whether or not a node mayhave more than one type. We study the expressive power of ShEx and study the complexityof the validation problem. We show that the single-type semantics is strictly more expressivethan the multi-type semantics; single-type validation is generally intractable and multi-typevalidation is feasible for a small (yet practical) subclass of RBEs. To curb the highcomputational complexity of validation; we propose a natural notion of determinism and …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2015,21
Interactive inference of join queries,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Slawomir Staworko,We investigate the problem of inferring join queries from user interactions. The user ispresented with a set of candidate tuples and is asked to label them as positive or negativedepending on whether or not she would like the tuples as part of the join result. The goal isto quickly infer an arbitrary n-ary join predicate across two relations by keeping the numberof user interactions as minimal as possible. We assume no prior knowledge of the integrityconstraints between the involved relations. This kind of scenario occurs in severalapplication settings; such as data integration; reverse engineering of database queries; andconstraint inference. In such scenarios; the database instances may be too big to beskimmed. We explore the search space by using a set of strategies that let us prune what wecall" uninformative" tuples; and directly present to the user the informative ones ie; those …,Gestion de Données-Principes; Technologies et Applications (BDA),2014,20
Interactive join query inference with JIM,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Sławek Staworko,Abstract Specifying join predicates may become a cumbersome task in many situations eg;when the relations to be joined come from disparate data sources; when the values of theattributes carry little or no knowledge of metadata; or simply when the user is unfamiliar withquerying formalisms. Such task is recurrent in many traditional data managementapplications; such as data integration; constraint inference; and database denormalization;but it is also becoming pivotal in novel crowdsourcing applications. We present Jim (JoinInference Machine); a system for interactive join specification tasks; where the user infers ann-ary join predicate by selecting tuples that are part of the join result via Booleanmembership queries. The user can label tuples as positive or negative; while the systemallows to identify and gray out the uninformative tuples ie; those that do not add any …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,20
Deterministic regular expressions in linear time,Benotît Groz; Sebastian Maneth; Slawek Staworko,Abstract Deterministic regular expressions are widely used in XML processing. For instance;all regular expressions in DTDs and XML Schemas are required to be deterministic. In thispaper we show that determinism of a regular expression e can be tested in linear time. Thebest known algorithms; based on the Glushkov automaton; require O (σ| e|) time; where σ isthe number of distinct symbols in e. We further show that matching a word w against anexpression e can be achieved in combined linear time O (| e|+| w|); for a wide range ofdeterministic regular expressions:(i) star-free (for multiple input words);(ii) bounded-occurrence; ie; expressions in which each symbol appears a bounded number of times; and(iii) bounded plus-depth; ie; expressions in which the nesting depth of alternating plus(union) and concatenation symbols is bounded.

XML security views revisited,Benoît Groz; Sławomir Staworko; Anne-Cecile Caron; Yves Roos; Sophie Tison,Abstract In this paper; we revisit the view based security framework for XML withoutimposing any of the previously considered restrictions on the class of queries; the class ofDTDs; and the type of annotations used to define the view. First; we show that the full classof Regular XPath queries is closed under query rewriting. Next; we address the problem ofconstructing a DTD that describes the view schema; which in general needs not be regular.We propose three different methods of approximating the view schema and we show that theproduced DTDs are indistinguishable from the exact schema (with queries from a classspecific for each method). Finally; we investigate problems of static analysis of securityaccess specifications.,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,2009,18
Learning join queries from user examples,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Sławek Staworko,Abstract We investigate the problem of learning join queries from user examples.

Inferring the joinpredicate across multiple relations when the referential constraints are unknown may occurin several applications; such as data integration; reverse engineering of database queries;and schema inference. In such scenarios; the number of tuples involved in the join istypically large.

Normalization of sequential top-down tree-to-word transducers,Grégoire Laurence; Aurélien Lemay; Joachim Niehren; Sławek Staworko; Marc Tommasi,Abstract We study normalization of deterministic sequential top-down tree-to-wordtransducers (st Ws); that capture the class of deterministic top-down nested-word to wordtransducers. We identify the subclass of earliest st Ws (e st Ws) that yield unique normalforms when minimized. The main result of this paper is an effective normalization procedurefor st Ws. It consists of two stages: we first convert a given st W to an equivalent e st W; andthen; we minimize the e st W.,International Conference on Language and Automata Theory and Applications,2011,16
Validating RDF with shape expressions,Iovka Boneva; Jose Emilio Labra Gayo; Samuel Hym; Eric G Prud’hommeau; Harold R Solbrig; Slawek Staworko,Abstract We propose shape expression schema (ShEx); a novel schema formalism fordescribing the topology of an RDF graph that uses regular bag expressions (RBEs) to defineconstraints on the admissible neighborhood for the nodes of a given type. We provide twoalternative semantics; multi-and single-type; depending on whether or not a node may havemore than one type. We study the expressive power of ShEx and study the complexity of thevalidation problem.

Simple schemas for unordered XML,Iovka Boneva; Radu Ciucanu; Slawek Staworko,Abstract: We consider unordered XML; where the relative order among siblings is ignored;and propose two simple yet practical schema formalisms: disjunctive multiplicity schemas(DMS); and its restriction; disjunction-free multiplicity schemas (MS). We investigate theircomputational properties and characterize the complexity of the following static analysisproblems: schema satisfiability; membership of a tree to the language of a schema; schemacontainment; twig query satisfiability; implication; and containment in the presence ofschema. Our research indicates that the proposed formalisms retain much of theexpressiveness of DTDs without an increase in computational complexity.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1303.4277,2013,12
Querying regular sets of XML documents,Slawomir Staworko; Emmanuel Filiot; Jan Chomicki,We investigate the problem of querying (regular) sets of XML documents represented withtree automata and we consider $ n $-ary tree automata queries whose expressive powercaptures MSO on trees. Because finite automata can represent infinite sets of documents;we propose the notions of {\em universal} and {\em existential} query answers; answers thatare present resp. in all and some documents. We study complexity of query answering andshow that computing existential query answers is in PTIME if we assume the arity of thequery to be a fixed parameter. On the other hand; computing universal query answers isEXPTIME-complete; but we show that it is in PTIME if we assume that the query is fixed (datacomplexity). Finally; we argue that the framework captures problems central to many novelXML applications like querying inconsistent XML documents. In particular; we …,International Workshop on Logic in Databases (LiD),2008,12
A paradigm for learning queries on big data,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Aurélien Lemay; Sławek Staworko,Abstract Specifying a database query using a formal query language is typically achallenging task for non-expert users. In the context of big data; this problem becomes evenharder as it requires the users to deal with database instances of big sizes and hencedifficult to visualize. Such instances usually lack a schema to help the users specify theirqueries; or have an incomplete schema as they come from disparate data sources. In thispaper; we propose a novel paradigm for interactive learning of queries on big data; withoutassuming any knowledge of the database schema. The paradigm can be applied to differentdatabase models and a class of queries adequate to the database model. In particular; inthis paper we present two instantiations that validated the proposed paradigm for learningrelational join queries and for learning path queries on graph databases. Finally; we …,Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Bringing the Value of Big Data to Users (Data4U 2014),2014,10
Learning schemas for unordered XML,Radu Ciucanu; Slawek Staworko,Abstract: We consider unordered XML; where the relative order among siblings is ignored;and we investigate the problem of learning schemas from examples given by the user. Wefocus on the schema formalisms proposed in [10]: disjunctive multiplicity schemas (DMS)and its restriction; disjunction-free multiplicity schemas (MS). A learning algorithm takes asinput a set of XML documents which must satisfy the schema (ie; positive examples) and aset of XML documents which must not satisfy the schema (ie; negative examples); andreturns a schema consistent with the examples. We investigate a learning frameworkinspired by Gold [18]; where a learning algorithm should be sound ie; always return aschema consistent with the examples given by the user; and complete ie; able to produceevery schema with a sufficiently rich set of examples.

Declarative inconsistency handling in relational and semi-structured databases,Slawomir Staworko,Abstract In many novel database applications inconsistency becomes an important issuethat cannot be addressed with simple techniques like data cleaning. For instance; dataconflicts can arise during the integration of independent data sources; and the user may nothave privileges to resolve the inconsistencies. The framework of consistent query answers(CQA) aims to alleviate the impact of inconsistencies on query evaluation by considering allpossible (minimal) repairs of the original database. The consistent answers are the answerspresent in every repair. Because the repairs are not materialized; this approach does notmodify the state of the database ie; no information is physically removed from the database.In this thesis we advance the research on consistent query answers in several directions.,*,2007,10
View update translation for XML,Iovka Boneva; Anne-Cécile Caron; Benoît Groz; Yves Roos; Sophie Tison; Sławek Staworko,Abstract We study the problem of update translation for views on XML documents. Moreprecisely; given an XML view definition and a user defined view update program; find asource update program that translates the view update without side effects on the view.Additionally; we require the translation to be defined on all possible source documents; thiscorresponds to Hegner's notion of uniform translation. The existence of such translationwould allow to update XML views without the need of materialization. The class of views weconsider can remove parts of the document and rename nodes. Our update programs definethe simultaneous application of a collection of atomic update operations amonginsertion/deletion of a subtree and node renaming. Such update programs are compatiblewith the XQuery Update Facility (XQUF) snapshot semantics. Both views and update …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Database Theory,2011,9
The view update problem for XML,Sławek Staworko; Iovka Boneva; Benoît Groz,Abstract We study the problem of update propagation across views in the setting where boththe view and the source database are XML documents. We consider a simple class of XMLviews that remove selected parts of the source document. The considered update operationspermit to insert and delete subtrees of the document. We focus on constructing propagationsthat are 1) schema compliant ie; when applied to the source document they give a documentthat satisfies the document schema; 2) side-effect free ie; the view of the new sourcedocument is exactly as the result of applying the user update to the old view. We present aspecial structure allowing to capture all such propagations. We also show how to use thisstructure to capture only those propagations that affect minimally the parts of the documentwhich are not visible in the view. Finally; we present a general outline of a polynomial …,Proceedings of the 2010 EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2010,9
Bounded repairability for regular tree languages,Gabriele Puppis; Cristian Riveros; Sławek Staworko,Abstract We consider the problem of repairing unranked trees (eg; XML documents)satisfying a given restriction specification R (eg; a DTD) into unranked trees satisfying agiven target specification T. Specifically; we focus on the question of whether one can getfrom any tree in a regular language R to some tree in another regular language T with afinite; uniformly bounded; number of edit operations (ie; deletions and insertions of nodes).We give effective characterizations of the pairs of specifications R and T for which such auniform bound exists; and we study the complexity of the problem under differentrepresentations of the regular tree languages (eg; non-deterministic stepwise automata;deterministic stepwise automata; DTDs). Finally; we point out some connections with theanalogous problem for regular languages of words; which was previously studied in [6].,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Database Theory,2012,8
Towards an RDF Validation Language Based on Regular Expression Derivatives.,Jose Emilio Labra Gayo; Eric Prud'hommeaux; Iovka Boneva; Slawek Staworko; Harold R Solbrig; Samuel Hym,ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in the validation of RDF based solutions where onecan express the topology of an RDF graph using some schema language that can check ifRDF documents comply with it. Shape Expressions have been proposed as a simple;intuitive language that can be used to describe expected graph patterns and to validate RDFgraphs against those patterns.

Characterizing XML twig queries with examples,Slawomir Staworko; Piotr Wieczorek,Typically; a (Boolean) query is a finite formula that defines a possibly infinite set of databaseinstances that satisfy it (positive examples); and implicitly; the set of instances that do notsatisfy the query (negative examples). We investigate the following natural question: for agiven class of queries; is it possible to characterize every query with a finite set of positiveand negative examples that no other query is consistent with. We study this question for twigqueries and XML databases. We show that while twig queries are characterizable; theygenerally require exponential sets of examples. Consequently; we focus on a practicalsubclass of anchored twig queries and show that not only are they characterizable but alsowith polynomially-sized sets of examples. This result is obtained with the use ofgeneralization operations on twig queries; whose application to an anchored twig query …,International Conference on Database Theory,2015,7
Schemas for unordered XML on a DIME,Iovka Boneva; Radu Ciucanu; Sławek Staworko,Abstract We investigate schema languages for unordered XML having no relative orderamong siblings. First; we propose unordered regular expressions (UREs); essentiallyregular expressions with unordered concatenation instead of standard concatenation; thatdefine languages of unordered words to model the allowed content of a node (ie; collectionsof the labels of children). However; unrestricted UREs are computationally too expensive aswe show the intractability of two fundamental decision problems for UREs: membership ofan unordered word to the language of a URE and containment of two UREs. Consequently;we propose a practical and tractable restriction of UREs; disjunctive interval multiplicityexpressions (DIMEs). Next; we employ DIMEs to define languages of unordered trees andpropose two schema languages: disjunctive interval multiplicity schema (DIMS); and its …,Theory of Computing Systems,2015,6
Modeling musical structure with parametric grammars,Mathieu Giraud; Sławek Staworko,Abstract Finding high-level structure in scores is one of the main challenges in musicinformation retrieval. Searching for a formalization enabling variety through fixed musicalconcepts; we use parametric grammars; an extension of context-free grammars withpredicates that take parameters. Parameters are here small patterns of music that will beused with different roles in the piece. We investigate their potential use in defining anddiscovering the structure of a musical piece; taking example on Bach inventions. A measureof conformance of a score with a given parametric grammar based on the classical notion ofedit distance is investigated. Initial analysis of computational properties of the proposedformalism is carried out.,Mathematics and Computation in Music,2015,6
Static analysis of XML security views and query rewriting,Benoit Groz; Sławomir Staworko; Anne-Cécile Caron; Yves Roos; Sophie Tison,Abstract In this paper; we revisit the view based security framework for XML withoutimposing any of the previously considered restrictions on the class of queries; the class ofDTDs; and the type of annotations used to define the view. First; we study query rewritingwith views when the classes used to define queries and views are Regular XPath and MSO.Next; we investigate problems of static analysis of security access specifications (SAS): weintroduce the novel class of interval-bounded SAS and we define three different manners tocompare views (ie queries) from a security point of view. We provide a systematic study ofthe complexity for deciding these three comparisons; when the depth of the XML documentsis bounded; when the document may have an arbitrary depth but the queries defining theviews are restricted to guarantee the interval-bounded property; and in the general setting …,Information and Computation,2014,5
Management of inconsistencies in data integration,Ekaterini Ioannou; Slawek Staworko,Abstract Data integration aims at providing a unified view over data coming from varioussources. One of the most challenging tasks for data integration is handling theinconsistencies that appear in the integrated data in an efficient and effective manner. In thischapter; we provide a survey on techniques introduced for handling inconsistencies in dataintegration; focusing on two groups. The first group contains techniques for computingconsistent query answers; and includes mechanisms for the compact representation ofrepairs; query rewriting; and logic programs. The second group contains techniquesfocusing on the resolution of inconsistencies. This includes methodologies for computingsimilarity between atomic values as well as similarity between groups of data; collectivetechniques; scaling to large datasets; and dealing with uncertainty that is related to …,Dagstuhl Follow-Ups,2013,4
A Supervised Approach for Rhythm Transcription Based on Tree Series Enumeration,Adrien Ycart; Florent Jacquemard; Jean Bresson; Slawomir Staworko,We present a rhythm transcription system integrated in the computer-assisted compositionenvironment OpenMusic. Rhythm transcription consists in translating a series of datedevents into traditional music notation's pulsed and structured representation. As transcriptionis equivocal; our system favors interactions with the user to reach a satisfactory compromisebetween various criteria; in particular the precision of the transcription and the readability ofthe output score. It is based on a uniform approach; using a hierarchical representation ofduration notation in the form of rhythm trees; and an efficient dynamic-programmingalgorithm that lazily evaluates the transcription solutions. It is run through a dedicated userinterface allowing to interactively explore the solution set; visualize the solutions and locallyedit them.,International Computer Music Conference (ICMC),2016,3
Shape expressions schemas,Iovka Boneva; Jose E Labra Gayo; Eric G Prud'hommeaux; Sławek Staworko,Abstract: We present Shape Expressions (ShEx); an expressive schema language for RDFdesigned to provide a high-level; user friendly syntax with intuitive semantics. ShEx allows todescribe the vocabulary and the structure of an RDF graph; and to constrain the allowedvalues for the properties of a node. It includes an algebraic grouping operator; a choiceoperator; cardinalitiy constraints for the number of allowed occurrences of a property; andnegation. We define the semantics of the language and illustrate it with examples. We thenpresent a validation algorithm that; given a node in an RDF graph and a constraint definedby the ShEx schema; allows to check whether the node satisfies that constraint. Thealgorithm outputs a proof that contains trivially verifiable associations of nodes and theconstraints that they satisfy. The structure can be used for complex post-processing tasks …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1510.05555,2015,3

Automata for unordered trees,Adrien Boiret; Vincent Hugot; Joachim Niehren; Ralf Treinen,Abstract We present a framework for defining automata for unordered data trees that isparametrised by the way in which multisets of children nodes are described. Presburger treeautomata and alternating Presburger tree automata are particular instances. We establishthe usual equivalence in expressiveness of tree automata and MSO for our framework. Wethen investigate subclasses of automata for unordered trees for which testing languageequivalence is in P-time. Starting from automata in our framework that describe multisets ofchildren by finite automata; we propose two approaches to do this deterministically. Weshow that confluent horizontal evaluation leads to polynomial-time emptiness anduniversality; but coNP-complete emptiness and intersection. Finally; efficient algorithms canbe obtained by imposing an order of horizontal evaluation globally for all automata in the …,Information and Computation,2017,2
RDF graph alignment with bisimulation,Peter Buneman; Sławek Staworko,Abstract We investigate the problem of aligning two RDF databases; an essential problem inunderstanding the evolution of ontologies. Our approaches address three fundamentalchallenges: 1) the use of" blank"(null) names; 2) ontology changes in which different namesare used to identify the same entity; and 3) small changes in the data values as well as smallchanges in the graph structure of the RDF database. We propose approaches inspired bythe classical notion of graph bisimulation and extend them to capture the natural metrics ofedit distance on the data values and the graph structure. We evaluate our methods on threeevolving curated data sets. Overall; our results show that the proposed methods perform welland are scalable.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,2
On injective embeddings of tree patterns,Jakub Michaliszyn; Anca Muscholl; Sławek Staworko; Piotr Wieczorek; Zhilin Wu,Abstract: We study three different kinds of embeddings of tree patterns: weakly-injective;ancestor-preserving; and lca-preserving. While each of them is often referred to as injectiveembedding; they form a proper hierarchy and their computational properties vary (from P toNP-complete). We present a thorough study of the complexity of the model checkingproblem ie; is there an embedding of a given tree pattern in a given tree; and we investigatethe impact of various restrictions imposed on the tree pattern: bound on the degree of anode; bound on the height; and type of allowed labels and edges.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1204.4948,2012,1
Learning XML twig queries,Sławomir Staworko; Piotr Wieczorek,Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning XML queries; path queries and tree patternqueries; from examples given by the user. A learning algorithm takes on the input a set ofXML documents with nodes annotated by the user and returns a query that selects thenodes in a manner consistent with the annotation. We study two learning settings that differwith the types of annotations. In the first setting the user may only indicate required nodesthat the query must return. In the second; more general; setting; the user may also indicateforbidden nodes that the query must not return. The query may or may not return any nodewith no annotation. We formalize what it means for a class of queries to be\emph {learnable}.One requirement is the existence of a learning algorithm that is sound ie; always returns aquery consistent with the examples given by the user.

We present a Myhill-Nerode theorem for the class of linear deterministic topdowntree-to-word transducers (ltops); which shows that every ltop is equivalent to a uniqueearliest ltop (eltop) with a minimal number of states. The proof of this theorem is based on anew semantic characterization of transformations definable by ltops that we present. We alsoshow that minimization of eltops is in Ptime as opposed to NP-hardness for general ltops.Our results imply that equivalence testing is in Ptime for eltops and in Exptime for generalltops.,RTA (to appear 2010) Google Scholar,2010,1
Priority-based conflict resolution in inconsistent relational databases,Slawomir Staworko; Jan Chomicki,Abstract: We study here the impact of priorities on conflict resolution in inconsistent relationaldatabases. We extend the framework of repairs and consistent query answers. We proposea set of postulates that an extended framework should satisfy and consider two instantiationsof the framework:(locally preferred) l-repairs and (globally preferred) g-repairs. We study therelationships between them and the impact each notion of repair has on the computationalcomplexity of repair checking and consistent query answers. Subjects: Databases (cs.

Bounded Repairability for Regular Tree Languages,Pierre Bourhis; Gabriele Puppis; Cristian Riveros; Sławek Staworko,Abstract We study the problem of bounded repairability of a given restriction tree language Rinto a target tree language T. More precisely; we say that R is bounded repairable withrespect to T if there exists a bound on the number of standard tree editing operationsnecessary to apply to any tree in R to obtain a tree in T. We consider a number of possiblespecifications for tree languages: bottom-up tree automata (on curry encoding of unrankedtrees) that capture the class of XML schemas and document type definitions (DTDs). We alsoconsider a special case when the restriction language R is universal (ie; contains all treesover a given alphabet). We give an effective characterization of bounded repairabilitybetween pairs of tree languages represented with automata. This characterizationintroduces two tools—synopsis trees and a coverage relation between them—allowing …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,*

La transcription rythmique consiste àtraduire une suite d'événements datés vers une représentation pulsée et structurée liée à lanotation musicale traditionnelle. Notre système privilégie les interactions avec l'utilisateurafin de trouver un équilibre satisfaisant entre différents critères; en particulier la précision dela transcription et la lisibilité des partitions produites. Ce système s' appuie sur uneapproche uniforme; utilisant des représentations hiérarchiques de la notation de duréessous forme d'arbres de rythmes; et des algorithmes efficaces pour l'énumération paresseusede solutions de transcription.

Symbolic Inference Methods for Databases,Slawomir Staworko,This dissertation is a summary of a line of research; that I was actively involved in; onlearning in databases from examples. This research focused on traditional as well as noveldatabase models and languages for querying; transforming; and describing the schema of adatabase. In case of schemas our contributions involve proposing an original languages forthe emerging data models of Unordered XML and RDF. We have studied learning fromexamples of schemas for Unordered XML; schemas for RDF; twig queries for XML; joinqueries for relational databases; and XML transformations defined with a novel model of tree-to-word transducers. Investigating learnability of the proposed languages required us toexamine closely a number of their fundamental properties; often of independent interest;including normal forms; minimization; containment and equivalence; consistency of a set …,*,2015,*
Sequential Tree-to-Word Transducers: Normalization; Minimization; and Learning,Grégoire Laurencea; Aurélien Lemaya; Joachim Niehrena,Abstract We introduce a class of deterministic sequential top-down tree-to-word transducers(stws) and investigate a number of its fundamental properties and related problems. First; weinvestigate the problem of normalization of stws: we identify a subclass of earliest stws(estws) that is as expressive as stws and present an effective procedure for converting anarbitrary stw into an equivalent estw. We then present a Myhill-Nerode characterization ofthe class of the transformations definable with stws which also shows that everytransformation defined with an stw has a unique canonical representative estw. Thiscanonical estw is the minimal estw defining the same transformation; and consequently; wepresent a polynomial minimization procedure for estws; thus giving an effective procedurefor constructing the canonical representative of any transformation definable with stws …,*,2015,*
To cite this version,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Slawomir Staworko,ABSTRACT Specifying join predicates may become a cumbersome task in many situationseg; when the relations to be joined come from disparate data sources; when the values ofthe attributes carry little or no knowledge of metadata; or simply when the user is unfamiliarwith querying formalisms. Such task is recurrent in many traditional data managementapplications; such as data integration; constraint inference; and database denormalization;but it is also becoming pivotal in novel crowdsourcing applications. We present Jim (JoinInference Machine); a system for interactive join specification tasks; where the user infers ann-ary join predicate by selecting tuples that are part of the join result via Booleanmembership queries. The user can label tuples as positive or negative; while the systemallows to identify and gray out the uninformative tuples ie; those that do not add any …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,*
Bounded repairability for regular tree languages,Cristian Riveros; Sławek Staworko,Abstract We consider the problem of repairing unranked trees (eg; XML documents)satisfying a given restriction specification R (eg; a DTD) into unranked trees satisfying agiven tar-get specification T. Specifically; we focus on the question of whether one can getfrom any tree in a regular language R to some tree in another regular language T with afinite; uniformly bounded; number of edit operations (ie; dele-tions and insertions of nodes).We give effective characteri-zations of the pairs of specifications R and T for which such auniform bound exists; and we study the complexity of the problem under differentrepresentations of the regular tree languages (eg; non-deterministic stepwise automata;deter-ministic stepwise automata; DTDs). Finally; we point out some connections with theanalogous problem for regular languages of words; which was previously studied in [6].,in" International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT,2012,*

Consistent Query Answers in the Presence of Universal Constraints,Jan Chomicki; Slawomir Staworko,Abstract The framework of consistent query answers and repairs has been introduced toalleviate the impact of inconsistent data on the answers to a query. A repair is a minimallydifferent consistent instance and an answer is consistent if it is present in every repair. In thisarticle we study the complexity of consistent query answers and repair checking in thepresence of universal constraints. We propose an extended version of the conflicthypergraph which allows to capture all repairs wrt a set of universal constraints. We showthat repair checking is in PTIME for the class of full tuple-generating dependencies anddenial constraints; and we present a polynomial repair algorithm. This algorithm is sound; iealways produces a repair; but also complete; ie every repair can be constructed. Next; wepresent a polynomial-time algorithm computing consistent answers to ground quantifier …,*,2008,*

XML Security Views Revisited∆,Benoıt Groz123; S lawomir Staworko; Anne-Cecile Caron12; Yves Roos12; Sophie Tison12,Abstract. In this paper; we revisit the view based security framework for XML withoutimposing any of the previously considered restrictions on the class of queries; the class ofDTDs; and the type of annotations used to define the view. First; we show that the full classof Regular XPath queries is closed under query rewriting. Next; we address the problem ofconstructing a DTD that describes the view schema; which in general needs not be regular.We propose three different methods of approximating the view schema and we show that theproduced DTDs are indistinguishable from the exact schema (with queries from a classspecific for each method). Finally; we investigate problems of static analysis of securityaccess specifications.,*,*,*
