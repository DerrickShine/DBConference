Efficient progressive skyline computation,Kian-Lee Tan; Pin-Kwang Eng; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract In this paper; we focus on the retrieval of a set of interesting answers called theskyline from a database. Given a set of points; the skyline comprises the points that are notdominated by other points. A point dominates another point if it is as good or better in alldimensions and better in at least one dimension. We present two novel algorithms; Bitmapand Index; to compute the skyline of a set of points. Unlike most existing algorithms thatrequire at least one pass over the dataset to return the first interesting point; our algorithmsprogressively return interesting points as they are identified. Our performance study furthershows that the proposed algorithms provide quick initial response time with Index beingsuperior in most cases.,Proceedings of the International Conference on Very Large Data Bases,2001,854
iDistance: An adaptive B+-tree based indexing method for nearest neighbor search,Hosagrahar V Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Cui Yu; Rui Zhang,Abstract In this article; we present an efficient B &plus;-tree based indexing method; callediDistance; for K-nearest neighbor (KNN) search in a high-dimensional metric space.iDistance partitions the data based on a space-or data-partitioning strategy; and selects areference point for each partition. The data points in each partition are transformed into asingle dimensional value based on their similarity with respect to the reference point. Thisallows the points to be indexed using a B &plus;-tree structure and KNN search to beperformed using one-dimensional range search. The choice of partition and reference pointsadapts the index structure to the data distribution. We conducted extensive experiments toevaluate the iDistance technique; and report results demonstrating its effectiveness. We alsopresent a cost model for iDistance KNN search; which can be exploited in query …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2005,565

Baton: A balanced tree structure for peer-to-peer networks,Hosagrahar V Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Quang Hieu Vu,Abstract We propose a balanced tree structure overlay on a peer-to-peer network capable ofsupporting both exact queries and range queries efficiently. In spite of the tree structurecausing distinctions to be made between nodes at different levels in the tree; we show thatthe load at each node is approximately equal. In spite of the tree structure providingprecisely one path between any pair of nodes; we show that sideways routing tablesmaintained at each node provide sufficient fault tolerance to permit efficient repair.Specifically; in a network with N nodes; we guarantee that both exact queries and rangequeries can be answered in O (log N) steps and also that update operations (to both dataand network) have an amortized cost of O (log N). An experimental assessment validates thepracticality of our proposal.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,491
The performance of mapreduce: An in-depth study,Dawei Jiang; Beng Chin Ooi; Lei Shi; Sai Wu,Abstract MapReduce has been widely used for large-scale data analysis in the Cloud. Thesystem is well recognized for its elastic scalability and fine-grained fault tolerance althoughits performance has been noted to be suboptimal in the database context. According to arecent study [19]; Hadoop; an open source implementation of MapReduce; is slower thantwo state-of-the-art parallel database systems in performing a variety of analytical tasks by afactor of 3.1 to 6.5. MapReduce can achieve better performance with the allocation of morecompute nodes from the cloud to speed up computation; however; this approach of" rentingmore nodes" is not cost effective in a pay-as-you-go environment. Users desire aneconomical elastically scalable data processing system; and therefore; are interested inwhether MapReduce can offer both elastic scalability and efficiency.

EASE: an effective 3-in-1 keyword search method for unstructured; semi-structured and structured data,Guoliang Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Jianhua Feng; Jianyong Wang; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract Conventional keyword search engines are restricted to a given data model andcannot easily adapt to unstructured; semi-structured or structured data. In this paper; wepropose an efficient and adaptive keyword search method; called EASE; for indexing andquerying large collections of heterogenous data. To achieve high efficiency in processingkeyword queries; we first model unstructured; semi-structured and structured data as graphs;and then summarize the graphs and construct graph indices instead of using traditionalinverted indices. We propose an extended inverted index to facilitate keyword-based search;and present a novel ranking mechanism for enhancing search effectiveness. We haveconducted an extensive experimental study using real datasets; and the results show thatEASE achieves both high search efficiency and high accuracy; and outperforms the …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,460
PeerDB: A P2P-based system for distributed data sharing,Wee Siong Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; K-L Tan; Aoying Zhou,We present the design and evaluation of PeerDB; a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed datasharing system. PeerDB distinguishes itself from existing P2P systems in several ways. First;it is a full-fledge data management system that supports fine-grain content-based searching.Second; it facilitates sharing of data without shared schema. Third; it combines the power ofmobile agents into P2P systems to perform operations at peers' sites. Fourth; PeerDBnetwork is self-configurable; ie; a node can dynamically optimize the set of peers that it cancommunicate directly with based on some optimization criterion. By keeping peers thatprovide most information or services in close proximity (ie; direct communication); thenetwork bandwidth can be better utilized and system performance can be optimized. Weimplemented and evaluated PeerDB on a cluster of 32 Pentium II PCs. Our experimental …,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,452
Query and update efficient B+-tree based indexing of moving objects,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract A number of emerging applications of data management technology involve themonitoring and querying of large quantities of continuous variables; eg; the positions ofmobile service users; termed moving objects. In such applications; large quantities of statesamples obtained via sensors are streamed to a database. Indexes for moving objects mustsupport queries efficiently; but must also support frequent updates. Indexes based onminimum bounding regions (MBRs) such as the R-tree exhibit high concurrency overheadsduring node splitting; and each individual update is known to be quite costly. This motivatesthe design of a solution that enables the B+-tree to manage moving objects. We representmoving-object locations as vectors that are timestamped based on their update time.

Indexing the distance: An efficient method to knn processing,Cui Yu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; HV Jagadish,Abstract In this paper; we present an efficient method; called iDistance; for K-nearestneighbor (KNN) search in a high-dimensional space. iDistance partitions the data andselects a reference point for each partition. The data in each cluster are transformed into asingle dimensional space based on their similarity with respect to a reference point. Thisallows the points to be indexed using a B·-tree structure and KNN search be performedusing onedimensional range search. The choice of partition and reference point providesthe iDistance technique with degrees of freedom most other techniques do not have. Wedescribe how appropriate choices here can effectively adapt the index structure to the datadistribution. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the iDistance technique; andreport results demonstrating its effectiveness.,Proceedings of the international conference on very large data bases,2001,375
XR-Tree: Indexing XML data for efficient structural joins,Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Wei Wang; Beng Chin Ooi,XML documents are typically queried with a combination of value search and structuresearch. While querying by values can leverage traditional database technologies;evaluating structural relationship; specifically parent-child or ancestor-descendantrelationship; between XML element sets has imposed a great challenge on efficient XMLquery processing. We propose XR-tree; namely; XML region tree; which is a dynamicexternal memory index structure specially designed for strictly nested XML data. The uniquefeature of XR-tree is that; for a given element; all its ancestors (or descendants) in anelement set indexed by an XR-tree can be identified with optimal worst case I/O cost. Wethen propose a new structural join algorithm that can evaluate the structural relationshipbetween two XR-tree indexed element sets by effectively skipping ancestors and …,Data Engineering; 2003.

Collective spatial keyword querying,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging; spatial web objects thatpossess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining in prevalence;and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual description are gaining inprominence. However; the queries studied so far generally focus on finding individualobjects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where the objects in agroup collectively satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group of spatial webobjects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and such that objects arenearest to the query location and have the lowest inter-object distances. Specifically; westudy two variants of this problem; both of which are NP-complete.

In thispaper; we investigate knowledge discovery in spatial databases and develop ageneralization-based knowledge discovery mechanism which integrates attribute-orientedinduction on nonspatial data and spatial merge and generalization on spatial data.

Efficient processing of k nearest neighbor joins using MapReduce,Wei Lu; Yanyan Shen; Su Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract k nearest neighbor join (kNN join); designed to find k nearest neighbors from adataset S for every object in another dataset R; is a primitive operation widely adopted bymany data mining applications. As a combination of the k nearest neighbor query and thejoin operation; kNN join is an expensive operation. Given the increasing volume of data; it isdifficult to perform a kNN join on a centralized machine efficiently. In this paper; weinvestigate how to perform kNN join using MapReduce which is a well-accepted frameworkfor data-intensive applications over clusters of computers. In brief; the mappers clusterobjects into groups; the reducers perform the kNN join on each group of objects separately.We design an effective mapping mechanism that exploits pruning rules for distance filtering;and hence reduces both the shuffling and computational costs.

Skyline Queries Against Mobile Lightweight Devices in MANETs,Zhiyong Huang; Christian Jensen; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,Skyline queries are well suited when retrieving data according to multiple criteria. Whilemost previous work has assumed a centralized setting this paper considers skyline queryingin a mobile and distributed setting; where each mobile device is capable of holding only aportion of the whole dataset; where devices communicate through mobile ad hoc networks;and where a query issued by a mobile user is interested only in the user's local area;although a query generally involves data stored on many mobile devices due to the storagelimitations. We present techniques that aim to reduce the costs of communication amongmobile devices and reduce the execution time on each single mobile device. For the former;skyline query requests are forwarded among mobile devices in a deliberate way; such thatthe amount of data to be transferred is reduced. For the latter; specific optimization …,The IEEE 22nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2006),2006,215

Giving meanings to WWW images,Heng Tao Shen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Images are increasingly being embedded in HTML documents on the WWW. Suchdocuments over the WWW essentially provides a rich source of image collection from whichuser can query. Interestingly; the semantics of these images are typically described by theirsurrounding text. Unfortunately; most WWW image search engines fail to exploit these imagesemantics and give rise to poor recall and precision performance. In this paper; we proposea novel image representation model called Weight ChainNet. Weight ChainNet is based onlexical chain that represents the semantics of an image from its nearby text. A new formula;called list space model; for computing semantic similarities is also introduced. To furtherimprove the retrieval effectiveness; we also propose two relevance feedback mechanisms.We conducted an extensive performance study on a collection of 5000 images obtained …,Proceedings of the eighth ACM international conference on Multimedia,2000,190

Supporting multi-dimensional range queries in peer-to-peer systems,Yanfeng Shu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Aoying Zhou,Today's peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are unable to cope well with range queries on multi-dimensional data. To extend existing P2P systems and thus support multidimensional rangequeries; one needs to consider such issues as space partitioning and mapping; efficientquery processing; and load balancing. In this paper; the authors describe a scheme calledZNet; which addresses all these issues. Moreover; an extensive performance study whichevaluates ZNet against several recent proposals was conducted; and results show that ZNetpossesses nearly all desirable properties; while others typically fail in one or another.,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2005.

An adaptive peer-to-peer network for distributed caching of olap results,Panos Kalnis; Wee Siong Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Dimitris Papadias; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are becoming increasingly popular as they enableusers to exchange digital information by participating in complex networks. Such systemsare inexpensive; easy to use; highly scalable and do not require central administration.Despite their advantages; however; limited work has been done on employing databasesystems on top of P2P networks. Here we propose the PeerOLAP architecture for supportingOn-Line Analytical Processing queries. A large number low-end clients; each containing acache with the most useful results; are connected through an arbitrary P2P network. If aquery cannot be answered locally (ie by using the cache contents of the computer where it isissued); it is propagated through the network until a peer that has cached the answer isfound. An answer may also be constructed by partial results from many peers. Thus …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,162

Spade: On shape-based pattern detection in streaming time series,Yueguo Chen; Mario A Nascimento; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Monitoring predefined patterns in streaming time series is useful to applications such astrend-related analysis; sensor networks and video surveillance. Most current studies on suchmonitoring employ Euclidean distance to calculate the similarities between given querypatterns and subsequences of streaming time series. Euclidean distance has been shown tobe ineffective in measuring distances of time series in which shifting and scaling usuallyexist. Consequently; warping distances such as dynamic time warping (DTW); longestcommon subsequence (LCSS); have been proposed to handle warps in temporaldimension. However; they are inadequate in handling shifting and scaling in amplitudedimension.

To fully harness the power of the Cloud; efficient data management is needed tohandle huge volumes of data and support a large number of concurrent end users. Toachieve that; a scalable and high-throughput indexing scheme is generally required.

Continuous clustering of moving objects,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi,This paper considers the problem of efficiently maintaining a clustering of a dynamic set ofdata points that move continuously in two-dimensional Euclidean space. This problem hasreceived little attention and introduces new challenges to clustering. The paper proposes anew scheme that is capable of incrementally clustering moving objects. This proposalemploys a notion of object dissimilarity that considers object movement across a period oftime; and it employs clustering features that can be maintained efficiently in incrementalfashion. In the proposed scheme; a quality measure for incremental clusters is used foridentifying clusters that are not compact enough after certain insertions and deletions. Anextensive experimental study shows that the new scheme performs significantly faster thantraditional ones that frequently rebuild clusters.

Privacy and ownership preserving of outsourced medical data,Elisa Bertino; Beng Chin Ooi; Yanjiang Yang; Robert H Deng,The demand for the secondary use of medical data is increasing steadily to allow for theprovision of better quality health care. Two important issues pertaining to this sharing of datahave to be addressed: one is the privacy protection for individuals referred to in the data; theother is copyright protection over the data. In this paper; we present a unified framework thatseamlessly combines techniques of binning and digital watermarking to attain the dual goalsof privacy and copyright protection. Our binning method is built upon an earlier approach ofgeneralization and suppression by allowing a broader concept of generalization. To ensuredata usefulness; we propose constraining binning by usage metrics that define maximalallowable information loss; and the metrics can be enforced off-line.

Gorder: an efficient method for KNN join processing,Chenyi Xia; Hongjun Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Jing Hu,Abstract An important but very expensive primitive operation of high-dimensional databasesis the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) similarity join. The operation combines each point of onedataset with its KNNs in the other dataset and it provides more meaningful query results thanthe range similarity join. Such an operation is useful for data mining and similarity search. Inthis paper; we propose a novel KNN-join algorithm; called the Gorder (or the G-orderingKNN) join method. Gorder is a block nested loop join method that exploits sorting; joinscheduling and distance computation filtering and reduction to reduce both I/O and CPUcosts. It sorts input datasets into the G-order and applied the scheduled block nested loopjoin on the G-ordered data. The distance computation reduction is employed to furtherreduce CPU cost.

Locating mapped resources in web 2.0,Dongxiang Zhang; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Mapping mashups are emerging Web 2.0 applications in which data objects such as blogs;photos and videos from different sources are combined and marked in a map using APIs thatare released by online mapping solutions such as Google and Yahoo Maps. These objectsare typically associated with a set of tags capturing the embedded semantic and a set ofcoordinates indicating their geographical locations. Traditional web resource searchingstrategies are not effective in such an environment due to the lack of the gazetteer context inthe tags. Instead; a better alternative approach is to locate an object by tag matching.However; the number of tags associated with each object is typically small; making it difficultfor an object to capture the complete semantics in the query objects. In this paper; we focuson the fundamental application of locating geographical resources and propose an …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,124
TI: an efficient indexing mechanism for real-time search on tweets,Chun Chen; Feng Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Sai Wu,Abstract Real-time search dictates that new contents be made available for searchimmediately following their creation. From the database perspective; this requirement maybe quite easily met by creating an up-to-date index for the contents and measuring searchquality by the time gap between insertion time and availability of the index. This approach;however; poses new challenges for micro-blogging systems where thousands of concurrentusers may upload their micro-blogs or tweets simultaneously. Due to the high update andquery loads; conventional approaches would either fail to index the huge amount of newlycreated contents in real time or fall short of providing a scalable indexing service. In thispaper; we propose a tweet index called the TI (Tweet Index); an adaptive indexing schemefor microblogging systems such as Twitter. The intuition of the TI is to index the tweets that …,Proceedings of the 2011 international conference on Management of data,2011,123
Speeding up search in peer-to-peer networks with a multi-way tree structure,HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Quang Hieu Vu; Rong Zhang,Abstract Peer-to-Peer systems have recently become a popular means to share resources.Effective search is a critical requirement in such systems; and a number of distributed searchstructures have been proposed in the literature. Most of these structures provide" log timesearch" capability; where the logarithm is taken base 2. That is; in a system with N nodes;the cost of the search is O (log 2 N). In database systems; the importance of large fanoutindex structures has been well recognized. In P2P search too; the cost could be reducedconsiderably if this logarithm were taken to a larger base. In this paper; we propose a multi-way tree search structure; which reduces the cost of search to O (log m N); where m is thefanout. The penalty paid is a larger update cost; but we show how to keep this penalty to beno worse than linear in m. We experimentally explore this tradeoff between search and …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,121
ST 2 B-tree: a self-tunable spatio-temporal b+-tree index for moving objects,Su Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract In a moving objects database (MOD) the dataset and the workload changefrequently. As the locations of objects change in space and time; the data distribution alsochanges and the answer for a same query over the same region may vary widely over time.As a result; traditional static indexes are not able to perform well and it is critical to developself-tuning indexes that can be reconfigured automatically based on the state of the system.Towards this goal we propose the ST 2 B-tree; a Self-Tunable Spatio-Temporal B+-Treeindex for MODs; which is amenable to tuning. Frequent updates to its subtrees allowsrebuilding (tuning) a subtree using a different set of reference points and different grid sizewithout significant overhead. We also present an online tuning framework for the ST 2 B-tree; where the tuning is conducted online and automatically without human intervention …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,118
Bed-tree: an all-purpose index structure for string similarity search based on edit distance,Zhenjie Zhang; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Beng Chin Ooi; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Strings are ubiquitous in computer systems and hence string processing hasattracted extensive research effort from computer scientists in diverse areas. One of the mostimportant problems in string processing is to efficiently evaluate the similarity between twostrings based on a specified similarity measure. String similarity search is a fundamentalproblem in information retrieval; database cleaning; biological sequence analysis; andmore. While a large number of dissimilarity measures on strings have been proposed; editdistance is the most popular choice in a wide spectrum of applications. Existing indexingtechniques for similarity search queries based on edit distance; eg; approximate selectionand join queries; rely mostly on n-gram signatures coupled with inverted list structures.These techniques are tailored for specific query types only; and their performance …,Proceedings of the 2010 international conference on Management of data,2010,117
Towards elastic transactional cloud storage with range query support,Hoang Tam Vo; Chun Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Cloud storage is an emerging infrastructure that offers Platforms as a Service(PaaS). On such platforms; storage and compute power are adjusted dynamically; andtherefore it is important to build a highly scalable and reliable storage that can elasticallyscale on-demand with minimal startup cost. In this paper; we propose ecStore--an elasticcloud storage system that supports automated data partitioning and replication; loadbalancing; efficient range query; and transactional access. In ecStore; data objects aredistributed and replicated in a cluster of commodity computer nodes located in the cloud.Users can access data via transactions which bundle read and write operations on multipledata items stored on possibly different cluster nodes.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,113

Inparticular; we focus on reputation-based schemes. We look at some design considerationsin implementing distributed reputation-based systems; namely storage; integrity; metrics andchanging of identity. We provide a survey of related work on the storage and integrity issues;and present our solution to address these issues.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2003,112
Effective density queries on continuouslymoving objects,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Rui Zhang,This paper assumes a setting where a population of objects move continuously in theEuclidean plane. The position of each object; modeled as a linear function from time topoints; is assumed known. In this setting; the paper studies the querying for dense regions.In particular; the paper defines a particular type of density query with desirable propertiesand then proceeds to propose an algorithm for the efficient computation of density queries.While the algorithm may exploit any existing index for the current and near-future positionsof moving objects; the Bx-tree is used. The paper reports on an extensive empirical study;which elicits the performance properties of the algorithm.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Multiple aggregations over data streams,Rui Zhang; Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Monitoring aggregates on IP traffic data streams is a compelling application for datastream management systems. The need for exploratory IP traffic data analysis naturallyleads to posing related aggregation queries on data streams; that differ only in the choice ofgrouping attributes. In this paper; we address this problem of efficiently computing multipleaggregations over high speed data streams; based on a two-level LFTA/HFTA DSMSarchitecture; inspired by Gigascope. Our first contribution is the insight that in such ascenario; additionally computing and maintaining fine-granularity aggregation queries(phantoms) at the LFTA has the benefit of supporting shared computation. Our secondcontribution is an investigation into the problem of identifying beneficial LFTA configurationsof phantoms and user-queries. We formulate this problem as a cost optimization problem …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,108
Fast signature-based color-spatial image retrieval,Tat Seng Chua; Kian-Lee Tan; Beng Chin Ooi,This paper presents a novel method of retrieving images based on color-spatial information.For each image; its color-spatial information is compactly captured by a set of colorsignatures and an image signature. During the image retrieval process; the color and imagesignatures of the query image and those of the database images are compared to determinethe set of candidate images to be retrieved. In particular our similarity measure takes intoaccount contributions of colors that are perceptually similar and the weightage on the objectcolors. To speed up the retrieval process; we also propose a filtering mechanism thatemploys a simple similarity measure to prune away irrelevant images quickly; beforecomputing the more complex similarity measure on potential candidate images.

BORDER: efficient computation of boundary points,Chenyi Xia; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Beng Chin Ooi,This work addresses the problem of finding boundary points in multidimensional data sets.Boundary points are data points that are located at the margin of densely distributed datasuch as a cluster. We describe a novel approach called BORDER (a BOundaRy pointsDEtectoR) to detect such points. BORDER employs the state-of-the-art database technique-the Gorder kNN join and makes use of the special property of the reverse k nearest neighbor(RkNN). Experimental studies on data sets with varying characteristics indicate thatBORDER is able to detect the boundary points effectively and efficiently.,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2006,107

Efficient image retrieval by color contents,Hongjun Lu; Beng-Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Images are becoming an important asset and managing them for efficient retrievalposes challenges to the database community. In this paper; we proposed a novel three-tiercolor index that supports efficient image retrieval by color contents which is important tocertain applications; especially when shapes and semantic objects cannot be easilyrecognized. A prototype painting database system is designed and implemented todemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed indexing technique. Besides the color index;two other indexes; B+-trees for structured attributes and a signature file for free-textdescriptions; were also implemented. As a result; a wide range of queries; both text-basedand content-based can be processed efficiently. We also look at existing image databasesystems based on their query retrieval capabilities.,International Conference on Applications of Databases,1994,104
Indexing the edges—a simple and yet efficient approach to high-dimensional indexing,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Cui Yu; Stephane Bressan,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new tunable index scheme; called iMinMax (&Ogr;); thatmaps points in high dimensional spaces to single dimension values determined by theirmaximum or minimum values among all dimensions. By varying the tuning “knob” &Ogr;; wecan obtain different family of iMinMax structures that are optimized for different distributionsof data sets. For a d-dimensional space; a range query need to be transformed into dsubqueries. However; some of these subqueries can be pruned away without evaluation;further enhancing the efficiency of the scheme. Experimental results show that iMinMax(&Ogr;) can outperform the more complex Pyramid technique by a wide margin.,Proceedings of the nineteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2000,102
Relational data sharing in peer-based data management systems,Beng Chin Ooi; Yanfeng Shu; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Data sharing in current P2P systems is very much restricted to file-system-likecapabilities. In this paper; we present the strategies that we have adopted in our BestPeerproject to support more fine-grained data sharing; especially; relational data sharing; in aP2P context. First; we look at some of the issues in designing a peer-based datamanagement system; and discuss some possible solutions to address these issues. Second;we present the design of our first prototype system; PeerDB; and report our experience withit. Finally; we discuss our current extensions to PeerDB to support keyword-based queries.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2003,101

Es 2: A cloud data storage system for supporting both oltp and olap,Yu Cao; Chun Chen; Fei Guo; Dawei Jiang; Yuting Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Hoang Tam Vo; Sai Wu; Quanqing Xu,Cloud computing represents a paradigm shift driven by the increasing demand of Webbased applications for elastic; scalable and efficient system architectures that can efficientlysupport their ever-growing data volume and large-scale data analysis. A typical datamanagement system has to deal with real-time updates by individual users; and as well asperiodical large scale analytical processing; indexing; and data extraction. While suchoperations may take place in the same domain; the design and development of the systemshave somehow evolved independently for transactional and periodical analyticalprocessing. Such a system-level separation has resulted in problems such as datafreshness as well as serious data storage redundancy. Ideally; it would be more efficient toapply ad-hoc analytical processing on the same data directly.

Efficient indexing of the historical; present; and future positions of moving objects,Dan Lin; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi; Simonas Šaltenis,Abstract Although significant effort has been put into the development of efficient spatio-temporal indexing techniques for moving objects; little attention has been given to thedevelopment of techniques that efficiently support queries about the past; present; and futurepositions of objects. The provisioning of such techniques is challenging; both because of thenature of the data; which reflects continuous movement; and because of the types of queriesto be supported. This paper proposes the BB x-index structure; which indexes the positionsof moving objects; given as linear functions of time; at any time. The index stores linearizedmoving-object locations in a forest of B+-trees. The index supports queries that selectobjects based on temporal and spatial constraints; such as queries that retrieve all objectswhose positions fall within a spatial range during a set of time intervals.

Approximate NN queries on streams with guaranteed error/performance bounds,Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Rui Zhang,Abstract In data stream applications; data arrive continuously and can only be scanned onceas the query processor has very limited memory (relative to the size of the stream) to workwith. Hence; queries on data streams do not have access to the entire data set and queryanswers are typically approximate. While there have been many studies on the k NearestNeighbors (kNN) problem in conventional multi-dimensional databases; the solutionscannot be directly applied to data streams for the above reasons. In this paper; weinvestigate the kNN problem over data streams. We first introduce the e-approximate kNN(ekNN) problem that finds the approximate kNN answers of a query point Q such that theabsolute error of the k-th nearest neighbor distance is bounded by e. To support ekNNqueries over streams; we propose a technique called DISC (aDaptive Indexing on …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,90

Distributed online aggregations,Sai Wu; Shouxu Jiang; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In many decision making applications; users typically issue aggregate queries. Toevaluate these computationally expensive queries; online aggregation has been developedto provide approximate answers (with their respective confidence intervals) quickly; and tocontinuously refine the answers. In this paper; we extend the online aggregation techniqueto a distributed context where sites are maintained in a DHT (Distributed Hash Table)network. Our Distributed Online Aggregation (DoA) scheme iteratively and progressivelyproduces approximate aggregate answers as follows: in each iteration; a small set ofrandom samples are retrieved from the data sites and distributed to the processing sites; ateach processing site; a local aggregate is computed based on the allocated samples; at acoordinator site; these local aggregates are combined into a global aggregate.

Towards self-tuning data placement in parallel database systems,Mong Li Lee; Masaru Kitsuregawa; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Anirban Mondal,Abstract Parallel database systems are increasingly being deployed to support theperformance demands of end-users. While declustering data across multiple nodesfacilitates parallelism; initial data placement may not be optimal due to skewed workloadsand changing access patterns. To prevent performance degradation; the placement of datamust be reorganized; and this must be done on-line to minimize disruption to the system. Inthis paper; we consider a dynamic self-tuning approach to reorganization in a sharednothing system. We introduce a new index-based method that faciliates fast and efficientmigration of data. Our solution incorporates a globally height-balanced structure and loadtracking at different levels of granularity. We conducted an extensive performance study; andimplemented the methods on the Fujitsu AP3000 machine. Both the simulation and …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2000,84
Effective multi-modal retrieval based on stacked auto-encoders,Wei Wang; Beng Chin Ooi; Xiaoyan Yang; Dongxiang Zhang; Yueting Zhuang,Abstract Multi-modal retrieval is emerging as a new search paradigm that enables seamlessinformation retrieval from various types of media. For example; users can simply snap amovie poster to search relevant reviews and trailers. To solve the problem; a set of mappingfunctions are learned to project high-dimensional features extracted from data of differentmedia types into a common low-dimensional space so that metric distance measures can beapplied. In this paper; we propose an effective mapping mechanism based on deep learning(ie; stacked auto-encoders) for multi-modal retrieval. Mapping functions are learned byoptimizing a new objective function; which captures both intra-modal and inter-modalsemantic relationships of data from heterogeneous sources effectively.

Fast image retrieval using color-spatial information,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Tat Seng Chua; Wynne Hsu,Abstract. In this paper; we present an image retrieval system that employs both the color andspatial information of images to facilitate the retrieval process. The basic unit used in ourtechnique is a single-colored cluster; which bounds a homogeneous region of that color inan image. Two clusters from two images are similar if they are of the same color and overlapin the image space. The number of clusters that can be extracted from an image can be verylarge; and it affects the accuracy of retrieval. We study the effect of the number of clusters onretrieval effectiveness to determine an appropriate value for “optimal''performance. Tofacilitate efficient retrieval; we also propose a multi-tier indexing mechanism called theSequenced Multi-Attribute Tree (SMAT). We implemented a two-tier SMAT; where the firstlayer is used to prune away clusters that are of different colors; while the second layer …,The VLDB Journal,1998,81
Skyframe: a framework for skyline query processing in peer-to-peer systems,Shiyuan Wang; Quang Hieu Vu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony K Tung; Lizhen Xu,Abstract This paper looks at the processing of skyline queries on peer-to-peer (P2P)networks. We propose Skyframe; a framework for efficient skyline query processing in P2Psystems; which addresses the challenges of quick response time; low networkcommunication cost and query load balancing among peers. Skyframe consists of twoquerying methods: one is optimized for network communication while the other focuses onquery response time. These methods are different in the way in which the query searchspace is defined. In particular; the first method uses a high dominating point that has a largedominating region to prune the search space to achieve a low cost in networkcommunication. On the other hand; the second method relaxes the search space in order toallow parallel query processing to speed up query response.

Answering similarity queries in peer-to-peer networks,Panos Kalnis; Wee Siong Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract A variety of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems for sharing digital information are currentlyavailable and most of them perform searching by exact key matching. In this paper we focuson similarity searching and describe FuzzyPeer; a generic broadcast-based P2P systemwhich supports a wide range of fuzzy queries. As a case study we present an image retrievalapplication implemented on top of FuzzyPeer. Users provide sample images whose sets offeatures are propagated through the peers. The answer consists of the top-k most similarimages within the query horizon. In our system the participation of peers is ad hoc anddynamic; their functionality is symmetric and there is no centralized index. In order to avoidflooding the network with messages; we develop a technique that takes advantage of thefuzzy nature of the queries. Specifically; some queries are “frozen” inside the network …,Information Systems,2006,79
H-trees: a dynamic associative search index for OODB,Chee Chin Low; Beng Chin Ooi; Hongjun Lu,Abstract The support of the superclass-subclass concept in object-oriented databases(OODB) makes an instance of a subclass also an instance of its superclass. As a result; theaccess scope of a query against a class in general includes the access scope of all itssubclasses; unless specified otherwise. To support the superclass-subclass relationshipefficiently; the index must achieve two objectives. First; the index must support efficientretrieval of instances from a single class. Second; it must also support efficient retrieval ofinstances from classes in a hierarchy of classes. In this paper; we propose a new indexcalled the H-tree that supports efficient retrieval of instances of a single class as well asretrieval of instances of a class and its subclasses. The unique feature of H-trees is that theycapture the superclass-subclass relationships. A performance analysis is conducted and …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1992,79
Curler: finding and visualizing nonlinear correlation clusters,Anthony KH Tung; Xin Xu; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract While much work has been done in finding linear correlation among subsets offeatures in high-dimensional data; work on detecting nonlinear correlation has been leftlargely untouched. In this paper; we present an algorithm for finding and visualizingnonlinear correlation clusters in the subspace of high-dimensional databases. Unlike thedetection of linear correlation in which clusters are of unique orientations; finding nonlinearcorrelation clusters of varying orientations requires merging clusters of possibly verydifferent orientations. Combined with the fact that spatial proximity must be judged based ona subset of features that are not originally known; deciding which clusters to be mergedduring the clustering process becomes a challenge. To avoid this problem; we propose anovel concept called co-sharing level which captures both spatial proximity and cluster …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,78
Making the pyramid technique robust to query types and workloads,Rui Zhang; Beng Chin Ooi; K-L Tan,The effectiveness of many existing high-dimensional indexing structures is limited to specifictypes of queries and workloads. For example; while the Pyramid technique and the iMinMaxare efficient for window queries; the iDistance is superior for kNN queries. We present a newstructure; called the P/sup+/-tree; that supports both window queries and kNN queries underdifferent workloads efficiently. In the P/sup+/-tree; a B/sup+/-tree is employed to index thedata points as follows. The data space is partitioned into subspaces based on clustering;and points in each subspace are mapped onto a single dimensional space using thePyramid technique; and stored in the B/sup+/-tree. The crux of the scheme lies in thetransformation of the data which has two crucial properties. First; it maps each subspace intoa hypercube so that the Pyramid technique can be applied. Second; it shifts the cluster …,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,78
Tailored reversible watermarking schemes for authentication of electronic clinical atlas,Feng Bao; Robert H Deng; Beng Chin Ooi; Yanjiang Yang,It is accepted that digital watermarking is quite relevant in medical imaging. However; due tothe special nature of clinical practice; it is often required that watermarking not introduceirreversible distortions to medical images.

We have implemented the schemesand our experimental results look very promising.,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,2005,77
LogBase: a scalable log-structured database system in the cloud,Hoang Tam Vo; Sheng Wang; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Numerous applications such as financial transactions (eg; stock trading) are write-heavy in nature. The shift from reads to writes in web applications has also beenaccelerating in recent years. Write-ahead-logging is a common approach for providingrecovery capability while improving performance in most storage systems. However; theseparation of log and application data incurs write overheads observed in write-heavyenvironments and hence adversely affects the write throughput and recovery time in thesystem. In this paper; we introduce LogBase--a scalable log-structured database system thatadopts log-only storage for removing the write bottleneck and supporting fast systemrecovery.

A graph method for keyword-based selection of the top-k databases,Quang Hieu Vu; Beng Chin Ooi; Dimitris Papadias; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract While database management systems offer a comprehensive solution to datastorage; they require deep knowledge of the schema; as well as the data manipulationlanguage; in order to perform effective retrieval. Since these requirements pose a problem tolay or occasional users; several methods incorporate keyword search (KS) into relationaldatabases. However; most of the existing techniques focus on querying a single DBMS. Onthe other hand; the proliferation of distributed databases in several conventional andemerging applications necessitates the support for keyword-based data sharing andquerying over multiple DMBSs. In order to avoid the high cost of searching in numerous;potentially irrelevant; databases in such systems; we propose G-KS; a novel method forselecting the top-K candidates based on their potential to contain results for a given query …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,74
Effectively indexing uncertain moving objects for predictive queries,Meihui Zhang; Su Chen; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract Moving object indexing and query processing is a well studied research topic; withapplications in areas such as intelligent transport systems and location-based services.While much existing work explicitly or implicitly assumes a deterministic object movementmodel; real-world objects often move in more complex and stochastic ways. This paperinvestigates the possibility of a marriage between moving-object indexing and probabilisticobject modeling. Given the distributions of the current locations and velocities of movingobjects; we devise an efficient inference method for the prediction of future locations. Wedemonstrate that such prediction can be seamlessly integrated into existing index structuresdesigned for moving objects; thus improving the meaningfulness of range and nearestneighbor query results in highly dynamic and uncertain environments.

Mining deterministic biclusters in gene expression data,Zonghong Zhang; Alvin Teo; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,A bicluster of a gene expression dataset captures the coherence of a subset of genes and asubset of conditions. Biclustering algorithms are used to discover biclusters whose subset ofgenes are co-regulated under subset of conditions. In this paper; we present a novelapproach; called DBF (deterministic biclustering with frequent pattern mining) to findingbiclusters. Our scheme comprises two phases. In the first phase; we generate a set of goodquality biclusters based on frequent pattern mining. In the second phase; the biclusters arefurther iteratively refined (enlarged) by adding more genes and/or conditions. We evaluatedour scheme against FLOC and our results show that DBF can generate larger and betterbiclusters.,Bioinformatics and Bioengineering; 2004. BIBE 2004. Proceedings.

The TP-Index: A dynamic and efficient indexing mechanism for temporal databases,Han Shen; Beng Chin Ooi; Hongjun Lu,To support temporal operators efficiently; indexing based on temporal attributes must besupported. The authors propose a dynamic and efficient index scheme called the timepolygon (TP-index) for temporal databases. In the scheme; temporal data are mapped into atwo-dimensional temporal space; where the data can be clustered based on time. The datespace is then partitioned into time polygons where each polygon corresponds to a datapage. The time polygon directory can be organized as a hierarchical index. The indexhandles long duration temporal data elegantly and efficiently. The performance analysisindicates that the time polygon index is efficient both in storage utilization and query search.,Data Engineering; 1994. Proceedings. 10th International Conference,1994,70
Explore the `Small World Phenomena' in Pure P2P Information Sharing Systems,Yi Ren; Chaofeng Sha; Weining Qian; Aoying Zhou; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Pure Peer-to-peer architecture is becoming an important model for information sharingamong dynamic groups of users with its low cost of entry and its natural model for resourcescaling with the community size. Recent studies on several pure P2P information-sharingsystems have posed new questions and challenges in this area. By identifying two keyfactors in such an environment; we propose a new heuristic search algorithm to make betteruse of the" small world phenomena" among the peers in order to find the" six degrees ofseparation" more efficiently. We show by experiment that our heuristic algorithm out-performs the traditional BFS algorithm with an over 10% performance-increase whenquerying related information; and a 20% increase when a shift of interest lakes place.

An adaptive and efficient dimensionality reduction algorithm for high-dimensional indexing,Hui Jin; Beng Chin Ooi; Heng Tao Shen; Cui Yu; Ao Ying Zhou,The notorious" dimensionality curse" is a well-known phenomenon for any multidimensionalindexes attempting to scale up to high dimensions. One well known approach to overcomingdegradation in performance with respect to increasing dimensions is to reduce thedimensionality of the original dataset before constructing the index. However; identifying thecorrelation among the dimensions and effectively reducing them is a challenging task. Wepresent an adaptive multilevel mahalanobis-based dimensionality reduction (MMDR)technique for high-dimensional indexing. Our MMDR technique has three notable featurescompared to existing methods. First; it discovers elliptical clusters using only the low-dimensional subspaces. Second; data points in the different axis systems are indexed usinga single B/sup+/-tree.

In this paper;we propose a phase-based striping method which has the desirable characteristics that itguarantees the maximum waiting time. We also develop a data replication scheme to furtherreduce the average waiting time of the phase-based method. These two schemes; togetherwith the conventional sequential striping scheme; are then employed to optimize the waitingtime of videos based on their access pattern. Simulations were conducted using a videoserver containing 36 videos under different loading and hardware configurations. Theresults show that such optimization can reduce the waiting time significantly. The use ofreplication method could further improve the server performance by over 25%.

A hybrid machine-crowdsourcing system for matching web tables,Ju Fan; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Wang-Chiew Tan; Meihui Zhang,The Web is teeming with rich structured information in the form of HTML tables; whichprovides us with the opportunity to build a knowledge repository by integrating these tables.An essential problem of web data integration is to discover semantic correspondencesbetween web table columns; and schema matching is a popular means to determine thesemantic correspondences. However; conventional schema matching techniques are notalways effective for web table matching due to the incompleteness in web tables. In thispaper; we propose a two-pronged approach for web table matching that effectivelyaddresses the above difficulties. First; we propose a concept-based approach that mapseach column of a web table to the best concept; in a well-developed knowledge base; thatrepresents it. This approach overcomes the problem that sometimes values of two web …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,67
Contorting high dimensional data for efficient main memory KNN processing,Bin Cui; Beng Chin Ooi; Jianwen Su; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel index structure; called Δ-tree; to speed upprocessing of high-dimensional K-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries in main memoryenvironment. The Δ-tree is a multi-level structure where each level represents the dataspace at different dimensionalities: the number of dimensions increases towards the leaflevel which contains the data at their full dimensions. The remaining dimensions areobtained using Principal Component Analysis; which has the desirable property that the firstfew dimensions capture most of the information in the dataset. Each level of the tree servesto prune the search space more efficiently as the reduced dimensions can better exploit thesmall cache line size. Moreover; the distance computation on lower dimensionality is lessexpensive. We also propose an extension; called Δ+-tree; that globally clusters the data …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,66

In this paper; we look at yet another application-that of collaborative web caching. Unlike existing web caching techniques that are typicallymanaged at the proxies; we look at how to exploit local caches of nodes (or rather PCs)within an enterprise network.,International Conference on Research in Networking,2002,66
Spatial join strategies in distributed spatial DBMS,David J Abel; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Robert Power; X Yu Jeffrey,Abstract In a distributed spatial database system; a user may issue a query that relates twospatial relations that are stored at different sites. Because of the sheer volume andcomplexity of spatial data; spatial joins between two spatial relations at different sites areexpensive in terms of computation and transmission cost. In this paper; we examine theproblems of spatial joins between sites; and present spatial join processing strategies usedin a heterogeneous spatial database system. Preliminary experimental results are reported.,*,1995,66
An evaluation of color-spatial retrieval techniques for large image databases,Kian-Lee Tan; Beng Chin Ooi; Chia Yeow Yee,Abstract In a color-spatial retrieval technique; the color information is integrated with theknowledge of the colors' spatial distribution to facilitate content-based image retrieval.Several techniques have been proposed in the literature; but these works have beendeveloped independently without much comparison. In this paper; we present anexperimental evaluation of three color-spatial retrieval techniques—the signature-basedtechnique; the partition-based algorithm and the cluster-based method. We implementedthese techniques and compare them on their retrieval effectiveness and retrieval efficiency.The experimental study is performed on an image database consisting of 12;000 images.With the proliferation of image retrieval mechanisms and the lack of extensive performancestudy; the experimental results can serve as guidelines in selecting a suitable technique …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2001,63
On incremental cache coherency schemes in mobile computing environments,Jun Cai; Kian-Lee Tan; Beng Chin Ooi,Re-examines the cache coherency problem in a mobile computing environment in thecontext of relational operations (ie selection; projection and join). We propose a taxonomy ofcache coherency schemes; and as case studies; we pick several schemes for further study.These schemes are novel in several ways. First; they are incremental. Second; they are anintegration of (and built on) techniques in view maintenance in centralized systems andcache invalidation in client-server computing environments. We conducted extensive studiesbased on a simulation model. Our study shows the effectiveness of these algorithms inreducing uplink transmission and average access times. Moreover; the class of algorithmsthat exploit collaboration between the client and server performs best in most cases. We alsostudy extended versions of this class of algorithms to further cut down on the work …,Data Engineering; 1997. Proceedings. 13th International Conference on,1997,62
icrowd: An adaptive crowdsourcing framework,Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-lee Tan; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Crowdsourcing is widely accepted as a means for resolving tasks that machines arenot good at. Unfortunately; Crowdsourcing may yield relatively low-quality results if there isno proper quality control. Although previous studies attempt to eliminate" bad" workers byusing qualification tests; the accuracies estimated from qualifications may not be accurate;because workers have diverse accuracies across tasks. Thus; the quality of the results couldbe further improved by selectively assigning tasks to the workers who are well acquaintedwith the tasks. To this end; we propose an adaptive crowdsourcing framework; callediCrowd. iCrowd on-the-fly estimates accuracies of a worker by evaluating her performanceon the completed tasks; and predicts which tasks the worker is well acquainted with. When aworker requests for a task; iCrowd assigns her a task; to which the worker has the highest …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,60
Hierarchical indexing structure for efficient similarity search in video retrieval,Hong Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Heng Tao Shen; Xiangyang Xue,With the rapid increase in both centralized video archives and distributed WWW videoresources; content-based video retrieval is gaining its importance. To support suchapplications efficiently; content-based video indexing must be addressed. Typically; eachvideo is represented by a sequence of frames. Due to the high dimensionality of framerepresentation and the large number of frames; video indexing introduces an additionaldegree of complexity. In this paper; we address the problem of content-based video indexingand propose an efficient solution; called the ordered VA-file (OVA-file) based on the VA-file.OVA-file is a hierarchical structure and has two novel features: 1) partitioning the whole fileinto slices such that only a small number of slices are accessed and checked during knearest neighbor (kNN) search and 2) efficient handling of insertions of new vectors into …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and data engineering,2006,60
On multi-column foreign key discovery,Meihui Zhang; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Beng Chin Ooi; Cecilia M Procopiuc; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract A foreign/primary key relationship between relational tables is one of the mostimportant constraints in a database. From a data analysis perspective; discovering foreignkeys is a crucial step in understanding and working with the data. Nevertheless; more oftenthan not; foreign key constraints are not specified in the data; for various reasons; eg; someassociations are not known to designers but are inherent in the data; while others becomeinvalid due to data inconsistencies. This work proposes a robust algorithm for discoveringsingle-column and multi-column foreign keys. Previous work concentrated mostly ondiscovering single-column foreign keys using a variety of rules; like inclusion dependencies;column names; and minimum/maximum values. We first propose a general rule; termedRandomness; that subsumes a variety of other rules. We then develop efficient …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,59
Mining term association rules for automatic global query expansion: methodology and preliminary results,Jie Wei; Stéphane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi,The authors are looking at the mining of association between terms for the automaticexpansion of queries. The technique used for the discovery of the associations isassociation rule mining (R. Agrawal et al.; 1996). The technique proposed is more flexiblethan previous techniques based on term co-occurrence since it takes into account not onlythe co-occurrence frequency but also the confidence and direction of the association rules.We have been able to consistently improve the effectiveness of the retrieval over the set of48 test queries on the Associated Press 1990 news wires corpus of the TREC4 benchmarkby query expansion using term association rules.,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2000.

Global optimization of histograms,HV Jagadish; Hui Jin; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Histograms are frequently used to represent the distribution of data values in anattribute of a relation. Most previous work has focused on identifying the optimal histogram(given a limited number of buckets) for a single attribute independent of otherattributes/histograms. In this paper; we propose the idea of global optimization ofhistograms; ie; single-attribute histograms for a set of attributes are optimized collectively soas to minimize the overall error in using the histograms. The idea is to allocate more bucketsto histograms whose attributes are more frequently used and/or distributions are highlyskewed. While the accuracy of some histograms is penalized (being assigned fewerbuckets); we expect the global error to be low compared to the traditional method (ofallocating equal number of buckets to each histogram). We propose two algorithms to …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,57
Multidatabase query optimization: Issues and solutions,Hongjun Lu; Beng-Chin Ooi; Cheng-Hian Goh,Despite the interest in multidatabase systems; research in multidatabase query optimization(MQO) has been scarce. Many researchers perceive the difficulty to be the lack of reliablecost estimates for autonomous component databases. Consequently; some have suggestedthat this problem degenerates to a distributed query optimization (DQO) problem once costmodel coefficients for component databases are found. The authors argue that autonomyand heterogeneity of component databases give rise to a number of issues which makeMQO a distinct problem from DQO. Consequently; existing solutions for DQO need to be re-evaluated in the light of these issues. The design of a multidatabase query optimizer; whichaccounts for the issues highlighted; is discussed. This provides a framework within whichfurther research in MQO can be carried out.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1993: Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems; 1993.

Rule-assisted prefetching in web-server caching,Bin Lan; Stephane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,ABSTRACT Web servers manage large number of documents of widely variable sizes.Moreover; the access patterns on the documents may also changeover time. While somedocuments are highly popular over a prolonged period of time; we expect newly addeddocuments to increase in popularity while demand for most older documents decreases. It istherefore important to design e ective caching strategy at the web server. In this paper; wepresent our approach to the problem. Our main contribution lies in the design of a novelprefetching strategy; called RAP. RAP identi es a set of association rules from the Webserver's access log. Unlike existing mining strategy; RAP's miner values recently added logrecords more than earlier log records. Based on the rules; RAP predicts and prefetchesdocuments from users initial requests. We conducted extensive study to evaluate RAP …,Proceedings of the ninth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2000,52
Efficient dynamic operator placement in a locally distributed continuous query system,Yongluan Zhou; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Ji Wu,Abstract In a distributed processing environment; the static placement of query operatorsmay result in unsatisfactory system performance due to unpredictable factors such aschanges of servers' load; data arrival rates; etc. The problem is exacerbated for continuous(and long running) monitoring queries over data streams as any suboptimal placement willaffect the system for a very long time. In this paper; we formalize and analyze the operatorplacement problem in the context of a locally distributed continuous query system. We alsopropose a solution; that is asynchronous and local; to dynamically manage the load acrossthe system nodes. Essentially; during runtime; we migrate query operators/fragments fromoverloaded nodes to lightly loaded ones to achieve better performance. Heuristics are alsoproposed to maintain good data flow locality.

Itcompress: An iterative semantic compression algorithm,HV Jagadish; Raymond T Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Real datasets are often large enough to necessitate data compression. Traditional'syntactic'data compression methods treat the table as a large byte string and operate at the byte level.The tradeoff in such cases is usually between the ease of retrieval (the ease with which onecan retrieve a single tuple or attribute value without decompressing a much larger unit) andthe effectiveness of the compression. In this regard; the use of semantic compression hasgenerated considerable interest and motivated certain recent works. We propose a semanticcompression algorithm called ItCompress ITerative Compression; which achieves goodcompression while permitting access even at attribute level without requiring thedecompression of a larger unit. ItCompress iteratively improves the compression ratio of thecompressed output during each scan of the table. The amount of compression can be …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Ldc: Enabling search by partial distance in a hyper-dimensional space,Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi; Heng Tao Shen; Anthony KH Tung,Recent advances in research fields like multimedia and bioinformatics have brought about anew generation of hyper-dimensional databases which can contain hundreds or eventhousands of dimensions. Such hyper-dimensional databases pose significant problems toexisting high-dimensional indexing techniques which have been developed for indexingdatabases with (commonly) less than a hundred dimensions. To support efficient queryingand retrieval on hyper-dimensional databases; we propose a methodology called localdigital coding (LDC) which can support k-nearest neighbors (KNN) queries on hyper-dimensional databases and yet co-exist with ubiquitous indices; such as B+-trees. LDCextracts a simple bitmap representation called digital code (DC) for each point in thedatabase. Pruning during KNN search is performed by dynamically selecting only a …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Making web servers pushier,Bin Lan; Stéphane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi; YC Tay,Abstract The success of the World Wide Web measured in terms of the number of its usersand of the resulting traffic increase is only commensurate to the patience required whensitting in front of one's computer; waiting for a document to be down-loaded. If one couldidentify the typical access patterns for a set of documents on a Web server; the server coulduse or extend the existing protocols to accordingly pre-fetch or push documents to thebrowsers and proxy servers. In this paper; we present and evaluate a strategy for makingWeb servers “pushier”. Which document is to be pushed is determined by a set ofassociation rules mined from a sample of the access log of the Web server. Once a rule ofthe form “Document A→ Document B” has been identified and selected; the Web serverdecides to push “Document2” if “Document1” is requested. The strategy is individual user …,*,2000,50
On global multidatabase query optimization,Hongjun Lu; Beng-Chin Ooi; Cheng-Hian Goh,Multidatabase management systems (MDBMS)[6] enable data sharing amongheterogeneous local databases (called component databases) and thus provideinteroperability required by diverse applications. Among the research topics inmultidatabase systems; few work has been reported on global query optimization [3; 4]compared to other topics such as schema integration. We suggest that there are severalreasons why this is so. First; global query optimization in multidatabase systems is acomplex problem. Second; the potential returns; in terms of both academic value of thisresearch as well as possible performance gain from optimization; are not clear.

Online data fusion,Xuan Liu; Xin Luna Dong; Beng Chin Ooi; Divesh Srivastava,ABSTRACT The Web contains a significant volume of structured data in various domains;but a lot of data are dirty and erroneous; and they can be propagated through copying. Whiledata integration techniques allow querying structured data on the Web; they take the unionof the answers retrieved from different sources and can thus return conflicting information.Data fusion techniques; on the other hand; aim to find the true values; but are designed foroffline data aggregation and can take a long time. This paper proposes SOLARIS; the firstonline data fusion system. It starts with returning answers from the first probed source; andrefreshes the answers as it probes more sources and applies fusion techniques on theretrieved data. For each returned answer; it shows the likelihood that the answer is correct;and stops retrieving data for it after gaining enough confidence that data from the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,49
Continuous sampling for online aggregation over multiple queries,Sai Wu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this paper; we propose an online aggregation system called COSMOS(Continuous Sampling for Multiple queries in an Online aggregation System); to processmultiple aggregate queries efficiently. In COSMOS; a dataset is first scrambled so thatsequentially scanning the dataset gives rise to a stream of random samples for all queries.Moreover; COSMOS organizes queries into a dissemination graph to exploit thedependencies across queries. In this way; aggregates of queries closer to the root (source ofdata flow) can potentially be used to compute the aggregates of descendent/dependentqueries. COSMOS applies some statistical approach to combine answers from ancestornodes to generate the online aggregates for a node. COSMOS also offers a partitioningstrategy to further salvage intermediate answers. We have implemented COSMOS and …,Proceedings of the 2010 international conference on Management of data,2010,49
Similarity search: A matching based approach,Anthony KH Tung; Rui Zhang; Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Similarity search is a crucial task in multimedia retrieval and data mining. Mostexisting work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem; whichconsiders the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set offeatures. Such an approach has two drawbacks: 1) it leaves many partial similaritiesuncovered; 2) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. Toovercome these drawbacks; we propose the kn-match problem in this paper. The kn-matchproblem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the dataobjects in n dimensions; where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and thesen dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objectsreturned in the answer set match best. The kn-match query is expected to be superior to …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,49
A Framework for Supporting DBMS-like Indexes in the Cloud,Gang Chen; Hoang Tam Vo; Sai Wu; Beng Chin Ooi; M Tamer Özsu,ABSTRACT To support “Database as a service”(DaaS) in the cloud; the database system isexpected to provide similar functionalities as in centralized DBMS such as efficientprocessing of ad hoc queries. The system must therefore support DBMS-like indexes;possibly a few indexes for each table to provide fast location of data distributed over thenetwork. In such a distributed environment; the indexes have to be distributed over thenetwork to achieve scalability and reliability. Each cluster node maintains a subset of theindex data. As in conventional DBMS; indexes incur maintenance overhead and theproblem is more complex in the distributed environment since the data are typicallypartitioned and distributed based on a subset of attributes. Further; the distribution ofindexes is not straight forward; and there is therefore always the question of scalability; in …,Proc. VLDB Endow,2011,48

An online cost sensitive decision-making method in crowdsourcing systems,Jinyang Gao; Xuan Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Haixun Wang; Gang Chen,Abstract Crowdsourcing has created a variety of opportunities for many challengingproblems by leveraging human intelligence. For example; applications such as imagetagging; natural language processing; and semantic-based information retrieval can exploitcrowd-based human computation to supplement existing computational algorithms.Naturally; human workers in crowdsourcing solve problems based on their knowledge;experience; and perception. It is therefore not clear which problems can be better solved bycrowdsourcing than solving solely using traditional machine-based methods. Therefore; acost sensitive quantitative analysis method is needed. In this paper; we design andimplement a cost sensitive method for crowdsourcing.

Efficiently processing continuous k-nn queries on data streams,Christian Bohm; Beng Chin Ooi; Claudia Plant; Ying Yan,Efficiently processing continuous k-nearest neighbor queries on data streams is important inmany application domains; eg for network intrusion detection. Usually not all valid dataobjects from the stream can be kept in main memory. Therefore; most existing solutions areapproximative. In this paper; we propose an efficient method for exact k-NN monitoring. Ourmethod is based on three ideas;(1) selecting exactly those objects from the stream which areable to become the nearest neighbor of one or more continuous queries and storing them ina skyline data structure;(2) delaying to process those objects which are not immediatelynearest neighbors of any query; and (3) indexing the queries rather than the streamingobjects. In an extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate that our method isapplicable on high throughput data streams requiring only very limited storage.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Retrieving similar shapes effectively and efficiently,Kian-Lee Tan; Beng Chin Ooi; Lay Foo Thiang,Abstract In this paper; we address the following problem: given a large collection of shapesand a query shape; retrieve all shapes (from the shape database) that are similar to thequery shape. A generalized centroid-radii model is used to model all forms of shapes—convex shapes; concave shapes and shapes with “holes”. Under the model; a shape isrepresented by a set of vectors; each obtained from the radii emanating from the centroid ofa virtual concentric ring. The model can also facilitate multi-resolution and similarityretrievals. Furthermore; using the model; the shape of an object can be transformed into apoint in a high dimensional data space. To speed up the retrieval of similar shapes; we alsopropose a multi-level R-tree index; called the Nested R-trees (NR-trees). Unlike traditionalhigh-dimensional index structures that index a high-dimensional point as it is (with its full …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2003,46
Indexing temporal data using existing B+-trees,Cheng Hian Goh; Hongjun Lu; Beng-Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Research in temporal databases has largely focused on extensions of existing datamodels for the proper handling of temporal information. One approach is to store temporaldata on existing DBMS and build some new indexes to provide support for the efficientretrieval of temporal data. This paper describes mapping strategies to linearize the datasuch that existing B+-trees can be used directly. With such an implementation; a temporalrelation is mapped to points in a multi-dimensional space; with each time interval beingtranslated to a two-dimensional coordinate; and a temporal selection operation isconstructed as a spatial search operation. The proposed approach has two advantages.First; mapping a temporal relation to a multi-dimensional space provides a uniformframework for dealing with temporal queries involving transaction and valid time; as well …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1996,46

Histogram-based global load balancing in structured peer-to-peer systems,Quang Hieu Vu; Beng Chin Ooi; Martin Rinard; Kian-Lee Tan,Over the past few years; peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have rapidly grown in popularity andhave become a dominant means for sharing resources. In these systems; load balancing isa key challenge because nodes are often heterogeneous. While several load-balancingschemes have been proposed in the literature; these solutions are typically ad hoc; heuristicbased; and localized. In this paper; we present a general framework; HiGLOB; for globalload balancing in structured P2P systems. Each node in HiGLOB has two key components:1) a histogram manager maintains a histogram that reflects a global view of the distributionof the load in the system; and 2) a load-balancing manager that redistributes the loadwhenever the node becomes overloaded or underloaded. We exploit the routing metadatato partition the P2P network into nonoverlapping regions corresponding to the histogram …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,45
epiC: an extensible and scalable system for processing big data,Dawei Jiang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Sai Wu,Abstract The Big Data problem is characterized by the so called 3V features: Volume-a hugeamount of data; Velocity-a high data ingestion rate; and Variety-a mix of structured data;semi-structured data; and unstructured data. The state-of-the-art solutions to the Big Dataproblem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open sourceimplementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challengesuccessfully; it does not deal with the data variety well since the programming interfaces andits associated data processing model is inconvenient and inefficient for handling structureddata and graph data.

Continuous content-based copy detection over streaming videos,Ying Yan; Beng Chin Ooi; Aoying Zhou,Digital videos are increasingly adopted in various multimedia applications where they areusually broadcasted or transmitted as video streams. Continuously monitoring copies on thefast and long streaming videos is gaining attention due to its importance in content andrights management. The problem of video copies detection on video streams is complicatedby two issues. First; original videos may be edited; with their frames being reordered; toavoid detection. Second; there are many concurrent video streams and for each stream;there could be many continuous video copy monitoring queries. Efficient data streamalgorithms are therefore essential for processing a large number of continuous queries onvideo streams.

Indexing high-dimensional data for efficient in-memory similarity search,Bin Cui; Beng Chin Coi; Jianwen Su; K-L Tan,In main memory systems; the L2 cache typically employs cache line sizes of 32-128 bytes.These values are relatively small compared to high-dimensional data; eg;> 32D. Theconsequence is that existing techniques (on low-dimensional data) that minimize cachemisses are no longer effective. We present a novel index structure; called/spl Delta/-tree; tospeed up the high-dimensional query in main memory environment. The/spl Delta/-tree is amultilevel structure where each level represents the data space at different dimensionalities:the number of dimensions increases toward the leaf level. The remaining dimensions areobtained using principal component analysis. Each level of the tree serves to prune thesearch space more efficiently as the lower dimensions can reduce the distance computationand better exploit the small cache line size. Additionally; the top-down clustering scheme …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2005,44

Similarity search on bregman divergence: Towards non-metric indexing,Zhenjie Zhang; Beng Chin Ooi; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract In this paper; we examine the problem of indexing over non-metric distancefunctions. In particular; we focus on a general class of distance functions; namely BregmanDivergence [6]; to support nearest neighbor and range queries. Distance functions such asKL-divergence and Itakura-Saito distance; are special cases of Bregman divergence; withwide applications in statistics; speech recognition and time series analysis among others.Unlike in metric spaces; key properties such as triangle inequality and distance symmetry donot hold for such distance functions. A direct adaptation of existing indexing infrastructuredeveloped for metric spaces is thus not possible. We devise a novel solution to handle thisclass of distance measures by expanding and mapping points in the original space to a newextended space. Subsequently; we show how state-of-the-art tree-based indexing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,43
Exploiting spatial indexes for semijoin-based join processing in distributed spatial databases,Kian-Lee Tan; Beng Chin Ooi; David J.  Abel,In a distributed spatial database system; a user may issue a query that relates two spatialrelations not stored at the same site. Because of the sheer volume and complexity of spatialdata; spatial joins between two spatial relations at different sites are expensive in terms ofcomputational and transmission costs. In this paper; we address the problems of processingspatial joins in a distributed environment. We propose a semijoin-like operator; called thespatial semijoin; to prune away objects that do not contribute to the join result. This operatoralso reduces both the transmission and local processing costs for a later join operation.However; the cost of the elimination process must be taken into account; and we considerapproaches to minimize these overheads. We also study and compare two families ofdistributed join algorithms that are based on the spatial semijoin operator. The first is …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2000,43
Generalized multidimensional data mapping and query processing,Rui Zhang; Panos Kalnis; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Multidimensional data points can be mapped to one-dimensional space to exploitsingle dimensional indexing structures such as the B &plus;-tree. In this article we present aGeneralized structure for data Mapping and query Processing (GiMP); which supportsextensible mapping methods and query processing. GiMP can be easily customized tobehave like many competent indexing mechanisms for multi-dimensional indexing; such asthe UB-Tree; the Pyramid technique; the iMinMax; and the iDistance. Besides being anextendible indexing structure; GiMP also serves as a framework to study the characteristicsof the mapping and hence the efficiency of the indexing scheme. Specifically; we introduce ametric called mapping redundancy to characterize the efficiency of a mapping method interms of disk page accesses and analyze its behavior for point; range and kNN queries …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2005,42
An adaptable distributed query processing architecture,Yongluan Zhou; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Wee Hyong Tok,Abstract Traditionally; distributed query optimization techniques generate static query plansat compile time. However; the optimality of these plans depends on many parameters (suchas the selectivities of operations; the transmission speeds and workloads of servers) that arenot only difficult to estimate but are also often unpredictable and fluctuant at runtime. As thequery processor cannot dynamically adjust the plans at runtime; the system performance isoften less than satisfactory. In this paper; we introduce a new highly adaptive distributedquery processing architecture. Our architecture can quickly detect fluctuations in selectivitiesof operations; as well as transmission speeds and workloads of servers; and accordinglychange the operation order of a distributed query plan during execution. We haveimplemented a prototype based on the Telegraph system [Telegragraph project …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2005,42
Effective deep learning-based multi-modal retrieval,Wei Wang; Xiaoyan Yang; Beng Chin Ooi; Dongxiang Zhang; Yueting Zhuang,Abstract Multi-modal retrieval is emerging as a new search paradigm that enables seamlessinformation retrieval from various types of media. For example; users can simply snap amovie poster to search for relevant reviews and trailers. The mainstream solution to theproblem is to learn a set of mapping functions that project data from different modalities intoa common metric space in which conventional indexing schemes for high-dimensionalspace can be applied. Since the effectiveness of the mapping functions plays an essentialrole in improving search quality; in this paper; we exploit deep learning techniques to learneffective mapping functions. In particular; we first propose a general learning objective thateffectively captures both intramodal and intermodal semantic relationships of data fromheterogeneous sources. Given the general objective; we propose two learning algorithms …,The VLDB Journal,2016,41
Frequent update and efficient retrieval: An oxymoron on moving object indexes?,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian Lee Tan; Cui Yu,Abstract Traditionally; indexes have been designed to facilitatefast retrieval of static objects.Moreover; updates are assumedto be infrequent and hence slow update speed canbetolerated. However; this assumption does not hold fornew applications fueled by theadvancement of GPS; wirelesstechnologies and small but powerful digital devices. Intheseapplications; objects are mobile and to track these objectstheir locations have to be updatedfrequently. Existingindexes no longer can keep up with the high update rateswhile providingspeedy retrieval at the same time. There isa need for novel indexes to be designed formoving objects. In this paper; we examine various design issues that need tobe addressedto support efficient retrieval of moving objectswith frequent updates.,Second International Workshop on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems (W2GIS 2002),2002,40
R-tree-based data migration and self-tuning strategies in shared-nothing spatial databases,Anirban Mondal; Masaru Kitsuregawa; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian Lee Tan,Abstract In order to provide fast and timely answers to queries in the context of spatialdatabases and GIS; we present our solution for effective data migration and tuning strategiesin shared-nothing parallel spatial databases. Our purpose is to improve the performance ofthe indexes. Our approach has the following features. First; our scheme is self-tuning;dynamic as well as query-centric and it can adapt to dynamically changing user accesspatterns. Second; a global distributed R-tree-based indexing method is employed tofacilitate effective data migration. Third; unlike traditional partitioning strategies where eachprocessing element (PE) contains data from a single region of space; we allow each PE tostore data from multiple and disjoint regions. This minimizes overlap in regions as well ascoverage. We implemented the proposed scheme and conducted an extensive …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2001,40
Indexing shapes in image databases using the centroid–radii model,Kian-Lee Tan; Beng Chin Ooi; Lay Foo Thiang,Abstract In content-based image retrieval systems; the content of an image such as color;shapes and textures are used to retrieve images that are similar to a query image. Most ofthe existing work focus on the retrieval effectiveness of using content for retrieval; ie; studythe accuracy (in terms of recall and precision) of using different representations of content. Inthis paper; we address the issue of retrieval efficiency; ie; study the speed of retrieval; sincea slow system is not useful for large image databases. In particular; we look at using theshape feature as the content of an image; and employ the centroid–radii model to representthe shape feature of objects in an image. This facilitates multi-resolution and similarityretrievals. Furthermore; using the model; the shape of an object can be transformed into apoint in a high-dimensional data space. We can thus employ any existing high …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2000,38

Disseminating streaming data in a dynamic environment: an adaptive and cost-based approach,Yongluan Zhou; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In a distributed stream processing system; streaming data are continuouslydisseminated from the sources to the distributed processing servers. To enhance thedissemination efficiency; these servers are typically organized into one or moredissemination trees. In this paper; we focus on the problem of constructing disseminationtrees to minimize the average loss of fidelity of the system. We observe that existing heuristic-based approaches can only explore a limited solution space and hence may lead to sub-optimal solutions. On the contrary; we propose an adaptive and cost-based approach. Ourcost model takes into account both the processing cost and the communication cost.Furthermore; as a distributed stream processing system is vulnerable to inaccurate statistics;runtime fluctuations of data characteristics; server workloads; and network conditions; we …,The VLDB Journal,2008,37
On spatially partitioned temporal join,Hongjun Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract This paper presents an innovative partitionbased time join strategy for temporaldatabases where time is represented by time intervals. The proposed method maps timeintervals to points in a two dimensional space and partitions the space into subspaces.Tupies of a temporal relation are clustered into partitions based on the mapping in thespace. As a result; when two temporal relations are to be joined over the time attribute; apartition in one relation only needs to be compared with a predetermined set of partitions ofthe other relation. The mapping scheme and the join algorithms are described. The use ofspatial indexing techniques to support direct access to the stored partitions is discussed. Theresults of a preliminary performance study indicate the efficiency of the proposed method.,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VERY LARGE DATA BASES,1994,37
Indexing in spatial databases,Beng Chin Ooi; Ron Sacks-Davis; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatial information processing has been a focus of research in the past decade. Inspatial databases; data are associated with spatial coordinates and extents; and areretrieved based on spatial proximity. A formidable number of spatial indexes have beenproposed to facilitate spatial data retrieval. In this paper; we examine various spatial indexesproposed in the literature and present a taxonomy on them. Each class of indexingstructures is reviewed in two steps: first; the index structure is described; second; thestrengths and weaknesses are identified. The paper may be used as a guideline indesigning new indexing structures and serves as a basis in determining the suitability of aparticular class of indexes for specific applications.,Unpublished/Technical Papers,1993,37

Just-in-time query retrieval over partially indexed data on structured p2p overlays,Sai Wu; Jianzhong Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays have been successfully employed in manyapplications to locate content. However; they have been less effective in handling massiveamounts of data because of the high overhead of maintaining indexes. In this paper; wepropose PISCES; a Peer-based system that Indexes Selected Content for Efficient Search.Unlike traditional approaches that index all data; PISCES identifies a subset of tuples toindex based on some criteria (such as query frequency; update frequency; index cost; etc.).In addition; a coarse-grained range index is built to facilitate the processing of queries thatcannot be fully answered by the tuple-level index. More importantly; PISCES can adaptivelyself-tune to optimize the subset of tuples to be indexed. That is; the (partial) index in PISCESis built in a Just-In-Time (JIT) manner.

In principle; the Cloud provides unlimited compute resources;enabling deployed services to scale seamlessly. Moreover; the pay-as-you-go model in theCloud reduces the maintenance overhead of the applications. Given the advantages of theCloud; it is attractive to migrate existing software to this new platform. However; challengesremain as most software applications need to be redesigned to embrace the Cloud. In thispaper; we present an overview of our current on-going work in developing epiC–an elasticand efficient power-aware data-intensive Cloud system.

Transformation-based method for indexing high-dimensional data for nearest neighbour queries,*,We disclose a transformation-based method for indexing high-dimensional data to supportsimilarity search. The method; iDistance; partitions the data into clusters either based onsome clustering strategies or simple data space partitioning strategies. The data in eachcluster can be described based on their similarity with respect to a reference point; andhence they can be transformed into a single dimensional space based on such relativesimilarity. This allows us to index the data points using a B+-tree structure and performsimilarity search using range search strategy. As such; the method is well suited forintegration into existing DBMSs. We also study two data partitioning strategies; and severalmethods on selection of reference points. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluateiDistance; and our results demonstrate its effectiveness.,*,2004,35

A fast convergence technique for online heatbalancing of btree indexed database over shared-nothing parallel systems,Hisham Feelifl; Masaru Kitsuregawa; Beng-Chin Ooi,Abstract In shared-nothing environments; data is typically declustered and indexed acrossthe system processing elements (PEs) to achieve efficient processing. However accesspatterns are inherently dynamic and skewed; thus; data reorganization based on the dataaccess history (heat) is essential and should be done online. While the data is beingreorganized; indexes need to be modified too; therefore; reorganization should additionallydeal with the index modification. Based on minimization of index modification; we propose adata reorganization technique over a shared-nothing parallel system. By finding the exactwork that should be done; the technique can smoothly balance a given heat across the PEsas fast as possible; if it is required. By tuning its parameters; it can cover a wide range ofbalancing requirements. We evaluate its performance through simulation studies.

Fast failure recovery in distributed graph processing systems,Yanyan Shen; Gang Chen; HV Jagadish; Wei Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Bogdan Marius Tudor,Abstract Distributed graph processing systems increasingly require many compute nodes tocope with the requirements imposed by contemporary graph-based Big Data applications.However; increasing the number of compute nodes increases the chance of node failures.Therefore; provisioning an efficient failure recovery strategy is critical for distributed graphprocessing systems. This paper proposes a novel recovery mechanism for distributed graphprocessing systems that parallelizes the recovery process. The key idea is to partition thepart of the graph that is lost during a failure among a subset of the remaining nodes. To doso; we augment the existing checkpoint-based and log-based recovery schemes with apartitioning mechanism that is sensitive to the total computation and communication cost ofthe recovery process.

Efficient scheduling of page access in index-based join processing,Chee Yong Chan; Beng Chin Ooi,The paper examines the issue of scheduling page accesses in join processing; andproposes new heuristics for the following scheduling problems: 1) an optimal page accesssequence for a join such that there are no page reaccesses using the minimum number ofbuffer pages; and 2) an optimal page access sequence for a join such that the number ofpage reaccesses for a given number of buffer pages is minimum. The experimentalperformance results show that the new heuristics perform better than existing heuristics forthe first problem and also perform better for the second problem; provided that the number ofavailable buffer pages is not much less than the optimal buffer size.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,32
An efficient semantic query optimization algorithm,Hwee Hwa Pang; Hang Jun Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,An efficient semantic query optimization algorithm is proposed; in which all possibletransformations are tentatively applied to the query. Instead of physically modifying thequery; the transformation process classifies the predicates into imperative; optional orredundant. At the end of the transformation process; all the imperative predicates areretained while the redundant predicates are eliminated. Optional predicates are retrained ordiscarded based on the estimated cost/benefit of retaining them. The issue of the grouping ofsemantic constraints to reduce the overhead of retrieving constraints and checking whethereach constraint is relevant to the current query is also addressed. Based on the proposedalgorithm; a prototype semantic query optimizer has been built and preliminary experimentsshow that the optimizer performs well for large databases.,Data Engineering; 1991.

Westudy techniques for ensuring privacypreserving computation in the popular MapReduceframework. In this paper; we first show that protecting only individual units of distributedcomputation (eg map and reduce units); as proposed in recent works; leaves severalimportant channels of information leakage exposed to the adversary. Next; we analyze avariety of design choices in achieving a stronger notion of private execution that is theanalogue of using a distributed oblivious-RAM (ORAM) across the platform. We develop asimple solution which avoids using the expensive ORAM construction; and incurs only anadditive logarithmic factor of overhead to the latency.

DSH: Data Sensitive Hashing for High-Dimensional k-NN Search,Jinyang Gao; HV Jagadish; Wei Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract The need to locate the k-nearest data points with respect to a given query point in amulti-and high-dimensional space is common in many applications. Therefore; it is essentialto provide efficient support for such a search. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) has beenwidely accepted as an effective hash method for high-dimensional similarity search.However; data sets are typically not distributed uniformly over the space; and as a result; thebuckets of LSH are unbalanced; causing the performance of LSH to degrade. In this paper;we propose a new and efficient method called Data Sensitive Hashing (DSH) to address thisdrawback. DSH improves the hashing functions and hashing family; and is orthogonal tomost of the recent state-of-the-art approaches which mainly focus on indexing and queryingstrategies.

The ed-tree: an index for large dna sequence databases,Zhenqiang Tan; Xia Cao; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,The growing interest in genomic research has caused an explosive growth in the size ofDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) databases making it increasingly challenging to performsearches on them. In this paper; we proposed an index structure called the ed-tree forsupporting fast and effective homology searches on DNA databases. The ed-tree isdeveloped to enable probe-based homology search algorithms like Blastn which generateshort probe strings from the query sequence and then match them against the sequencedatabase in order to identify potential regions of high similarity to the query sequence.Unlike Blastn however; the homology search algorithm we developed for ed-tree supportsmore flexible probe model with longer probes and more relaxed matching. As aconsequence; the ed-tree is not only more effective and efficient than the latest Blastn …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2003. 15th International Conference on,2003,31
Fast high-dimensional data search in incomplete databases,Beng Chin Ooi; Cheng Hian Goh; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract We propose and evaluate two indexing schemes for improving the e ciency of dataretrieval in high-dimensional databases that are incomplete. These schemes are novel inthat the search keys may contain missing attribute values. The rst is a multi-dimensionalindex structure; called the Bitstring-augmented R-tree (BR-tree); whereas the secondcomprises a family of multiple one-dimensional one-attribute (MOSAIC) indexes. Our resultsshow that both schemes can be superior over exhaustive search. Experimental resultssuggest that BR-trees have lower update and storage costs and are able to support rangequeries more eciently under most circumstances; when compared to the MOSAIC indexingscheme. However; contrary to conventional wisdom; the MOSAIC structure outperforms theBR-tree in retrieval time for point queries; as well as in range queries over incomplete …,Proceedings of the 24rd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases,1998,30

Lazy XML updates: laziness as a virtue; of update and structural join efficiency,Barbara Catania; Beng Chin Ooi; Wenqiang Wang; Xiaoling Wang,Abstract XML documents are normally stored as plain text files. Hence; the natural and mostconvenient way to update XML documents is to simply edit the text files. But efficient queryevaluation algorithms require XML documents to be indexed. Every element is given aunique identifier based on its location in the document or its preorder-traversal order; andthis identifier is later used as (part of) the key in the index. Reassigning orders of possibly alarge number of elements is therefore necessary when the original XML documents areupdated. Immutable dynamic labeling schemes have been proposed to solve this problem;that; however; require very long labels and may decrease query performance. If we considera real-world scenario; we note that many relatively small ad-hoc XML segments areinserted/deleted into/from an existing XML database.

Scalable distributed stream join processing,Qian Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Zhengkui Wang; Cui Yu,Abstract Efficient and scalable stream joins play an important role in performing real-timeanalytics for many cloud applications. However; like in conventional database processing;online theta-joins over data streams are computationally expensive and moreover; beingmemory-based processing; they impose high memory requirement on the system. In thispaper; we propose a novel stream join model; called join-biclique; which organizes a largecluster as a complete bipartite graph. Join-biclique has several strengths over state-of-the-art techniques; including memory-efficiency; elasticity and scalability. These features areessential for building efficient and scalable streaming systems.

Querying high-dimensional data in single-dimensional space,Cui Yu; Stéphane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new tunable index scheme; called iMinMax ($\theta $);that maps points in high-dimensional spaces to single-dimensional values determined bytheir maximum or minimum values among all dimensions. By varying the tuning “knob”;$\theta $; we can obtain different families of iMinMax structures that are optimized fordifferent distributions of data sets. The transformed data can then be indexed using existingsingle-dimensional indexing structures such as the B+-trees. Queries in the high-dimensional space have to be transformed into queries in the single-dimensional space andevaluated there. We present efficient algorithms for evaluating window queries as rangequeries on the single-dimensional space. We conducted an extensive performance study toevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Our results show that iMinMax …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2004,26
B-trees: bearing fruits of all kinds,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Index structures are often used to support search operations in large databases.Many advanced database application domains such as spatial databases; multimediadatabases; temporal databases; and object-oriented databases; call for index structures thatare specially designed and tailored for the domains. Interestingly; in each of these domains;we find methods that are based on one distinct structure---the B-tree. Invented some thirtyyears ago; the B-tree has been challenged repeatedly; but has retained its competitiveness.In this paper; we first give a quick review of B-trees. We then present its adaptations tovarious domains. For each domain; we present representative B-tree-based structures andtheir search operations. We conclude that the B-tree is truly an ubiquitous structure that hasstood the test of times with wide acceptance in many domains.,Australian Computer Science Communications,2002,26
On selective tuning in unreliable wireless channels,Kian-Lee Tan; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract In a wireless computing environment; the server disseminates information byperiodically broadcasting data on 'air'; while clients 'catch'their desired data on the fly. Tominimize energy consumption; these data are usually multiplexed with indexes to facilitateselective tuning. However; most of the existing mechanisms are designed with an inherentassumption that the wireless channel is reliable. But; the signals transmitted are prone topath loss; fading; interference and time dispersion. Because of these impairments; clientsmay receivecorrupted'data or miss their data. The resultant effect is that clients may have towait for the next and even subsequent broadcast cycles to receive their data correctly. Thisincreases the access time and tuning time of data retrieval significantly. In this paper; wepropose three selective tuning mechanisms for unreliable wireless channels that can …,Data & knowledge engineering,1998,26

In cases where a bottleneck operator is stateless; it isobvious that parallelization by splitting the incoming stream among multiple paralleloperators deployed on different nodes can help improve performance. However; it is not soobvious when the bottleneck operator is stateful. In such a case; parallelization is muchmore challenging as it often requires a state sharing mechanism for the parallel operators.Moreover; it incurs additional overheads of required accesses by the parallel operators toshared state and synchronization constructs. In this paper; we propose a parallelization …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2012,23
Understanding the meaning of a shifted sky: a general framework on extending skyline query,Zhenjie Zhang; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony K Tung,Abstract Skyline queries are often used on data sets in multi-dimensional space for manydecision-making applications. Traditionally; an object p is said to dominate another object qif; for all dimensions; it is no worse than q and is better on at least one dimension. Therefore;the skyline of a data set consists of all objects not dominated by any other object. To bettercater to application requirements such as controlling the size of the skyline or handling datasets that are not well-structured; various works have been proposed to extend the definitionof skyline based on variants of the dominance relationship. In view of the proliferation ofvariants; in this paper; a generalized framework is proposed to guide the extension ofskyline query from conventional definition to different variants. Our framework explicitly andcarefully examines the various properties that should be preserved in a variant of the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,23
Main memory indexing: the case for BD-tree,Bin Cui; Beng Chin Ooi; Jianwen Su; K-L Tan,We adapt and optimize the BD-tree for main memory data processing. We compare thememory-based BD-tree against the B/sup+/-tree and CSB/sup+/-tree. We present costmodels for exact match query for these indexes; including L2 cache and translationlookahead buffer (TLB) miss model and execution time model. We also implemented thesestructures and conducted experimental study. Our analytical and experimental results showthat a well-tuned BD-tree is superior in most cases.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,23
Indexing for progressive skyline computation,Pin-Kwang Eng; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Many decision support applications are characterized by several features:(1) thequery is typically based on multiple criteria;(2) there is no single optimal answer (or answerset);(3) because of (2); users are typically looking for satisficing answers;(4) for the samequery; different users; dictated by their personal preferences; may find different answersmeeting their needs. As such; it is important for the DBMS to present all interesting answersthat may fulfill a user's need. In this paper; we focus on the set of interesting answers calledthe skyline. Given a set of points; the skyline comprises the points that are not dominated byother points. A point dominates another point if it is as good or better in all dimensions andbetter in at least one dimension. We present two novel indexing schemes to compute theskyline of a set of points progressively. Unlike most existing algorithms that require at …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2003,23
A content-based resource location mechanism in PeerIS,Bo Ling; Zhiguo Lu; Wee Siong Ng; Bengchin Ooil; Kian-Lee Tan; Aoying Zhou,With the flurry of research on P2P computing; many P2P technical challenges haveemerged; one of which is how to efficiently locate desired resources. Advances have beenmade in this hot research field; where the pioneers are Pastry; CAN; Chord; and Tapestry.By using the functionality of a distributed hash table; they have achieved fair effectiveness.However they have many common limitations; such as ignoring the autonomous nature ofpeers; and just supporting weakly semantic functions. According to reality in the distributednetwork; we propose a content-based location mechanism; which not only keeps theautonomy of peers; but also supports approximate query and finer granularity of contentsharing. Furthermore; this mechanism also facilitates P2P system to evolve dynamically. Wehave also used PeerIS; a P2P based information system used to verify it and obtained …,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2002. WISE 2002.

Index nesting–an efficient approach to indexing in object-oriented databases,Beng Chin Ooi; Jiawei Han; Hongjun Lu; Kian Lee Tan,Abstract. In object-oriented database systems where the concept of the superclass-subclassis supported; an instance of a subclass is also an instance of its superclass. Consequently;the access scope of a query against a class in general includes the access scope of all itssubclasses; unless specified otherwise. An index to support superclass-subclassrelationship efficiently must provide efficient associative retrievals of objects from a singleclass or from several classes in a class hierarchy. This paper presents an efficient indexcalled the hierarchical tree (the H-tree). For each class; an H-tree is maintained; allowingefficient search on a single class. These H-trees are appropriately linked to capture thesuperclass-subclass relationships; thus allowing efficient retrievals of instances from a classhierarchy. Both experimental and analytical results indicate that the H-tree is an efficient …,The VLDB Journal,1996,23
Spatial kd-tree: A data structure for geographic database,Beng C Ooi,Abstract Geographic objects in two dimensional space are usually represented as points;lines; and regions. To retrieve these data objects from the database efficiently according totheir spatial locations and spatial relationships; an efficient indexing mechanism isnecessary. The kd-trees proposed in the literature are either unsuitable for indexing non-zero size objects such as line and region or require duplication of indexes. In this paper analternative index structure called spatial kd-tree is proposed to facilitate the processing ofqueries concerning geographic information. The spatial kd-tree partitions a set of records ontwo dimensional space into small groups based on their spatial proximity. The structure notonly provides efficient retrieval of objects but also maintains high storage efficiency.,*,1987,23
Blockbench: A framework for analyzing private blockchains,Tien Tuan Anh Dinh; Ji Wang; Gang Chen; Rui Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains; such asBitcoin and Ethereum; enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smartcontracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recentprivate blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption andperformance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which haveso far been implemented on top of database systems; for example banking; finance andtrading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developedand fine tuned. However; there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which differentsystems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be usedto assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform; while …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,22
SINGA: Putting deep learning in the hands of multimedia users,Wei Wang; Gang Chen; Anh Tien Tuan Dinh; Jinyang Gao; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Sheng Wang,Abstract Recently; deep learning techniques have enjoyed success in various multimediaapplications; such as image classification and multi-modal data analysis. Two key factorsbehind deep learning's remarkable achievement are the immense computing power and theavailability of massive training datasets; which enable us to train large models to capturecomplex regularities of the data. There are two challenges to overcome before deeplearning can be widely adopted in multimedia and other applications. One is usability;namely the implementation of different models and training algorithms must be done by non-experts without much effort. The other is scalability; that is the deep learning system must beable to provision for a huge demand of computing resources for training large models withmassive datasets. To address these two challenges; in this paper; we design a distributed …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia,2015,22
Efficient processing of spatial group keyword queries,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Tao Guo; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging techniques; spatio-textualobjects that possess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining inprevalence; and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual descriptionare gaining in prominence. However; the queries studied so far generally focus on findingindividual objects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where theobjects in a group together satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group ofspatio-textual objects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and suchthat the objects are nearest to the query location and have the smallest inter-objectdistances. Specifically; we study three instantiations of this problem; all of which are NP-hard. We devise exact solutions as well as approximate solutions with provable …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,22
Efficient in-memory data management: An analysis,Hao Zhang; Bogdan Marius Tudor; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract This paper analyzes the performance of three systems for in-memory datamanagement: Memcached; Redis and the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD)implemented by Spark. By performing a thorough performance analysis of both analyticsoperations and fine-grained object operations such as set/get; we show that neither systemhandles efficiently both types of workloads. For Memcached and Redis the CPU and I/Operformance of the TCP stack are the bottlenecks--even when serving in-memory objectswithin a single server node. RDD does not support efficient get operation for random objects;due to a large startup cost of the get job. Our analysis reveals a set of features that a systemmust support in order to achieve efficient in-memory data management.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,22
Automatic discovery of attributes in relational databases,Meihui Zhang; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Beng Chin Ooi; Cecilia M Procopiuc; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In this work we design algorithms for clustering relational columns into attributes; ie;for identifying strong relationships between columns based on the common properties andcharacteristics of the values they contain. For example; identifying whether a certain set ofcolumns refers to telephone numbers versus social security numbers; or names ofcustomers versus names of nations. Traditional relational database schema languages usevery limited primitive data types and simple foreign key constraints to express relationshipsbetween columns. Object oriented schema languages allow the definition of custom datatypes; still; certain relationships between columns might be unknown at design time or theymight appear only in a particular database instance. Nevertheless; these relationships arean invaluable tool for schema matching; and generally for better understanding and …,Proceedings of the 2011 international conference on Management of data,2011,22
Efficient access methods in deductive and object-oriented databases,Chee Chin Low; Hongjun Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recently; a new access method; the Hierarchical-Tree (H-tree) was proposed as anefficient access method for object-oriented database that supports superclass-subclassrelationship. We show that; the H-tree indexing scheme is indeed a general access methodfor the new generation DBMS that most probably will support the object-oriented conceptand have the deductive capability. The simplest form of the H-tree; like the widely used B+-tree; can be used to index simple objects for efficient associative search. Its nestingcapability provides efficient support to different types of queries that reference objects insuperclass-subclass hierarchy. Furthermore; by dynamically nesting the indexes to theobjects generated iteratively during recursive query processing; it also supports the leastfixed point computation in object-oriented database with deductive capability.

In-memory databases: Challenges and opportunities from software and hardware perspectives,Kian-Lee Tan; Qingchao Cai; Beng Chin Ooi; Weng-Fai Wong; Chang Yao; Hao Zhang,Abstract The increase in the capacity of main memory coupled with the decrease in cost hasfueled research in and development of in-memory databases. In recent years; theemergence of new hardware has further given rise to new challenges which have attracted alot of attention from the research community. In particular; it is widely accepted that hardwaresolutions can provide promising alternatives for realizing the full potential of in-memorysystems. Here; we argue that naive adoption of hardware solutions does not guaranteesuperior performance over software solutions; and identify problems in such hardwaresolutions that limit their performance. We also highlight the primary challenges faced by in-memory databases; and summarize their potential solutions; from both software andhardware perspectives,ACM SIGMOD Record,2015,21
CrowdOp: Query Optimization for Declarative Crowdsourcing Systems,Ju Fan; Meihui Zhang; Stanley Kok; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,We study the query optimization problem in declarative crowdsourcing systems. Declarativecrowdsourcing is designed to hide the complexities and relieve the user of the burden ofdealing with the crowd. The user is only required to submit an SQL-like query and thesystem takes the responsibility of compiling the query; generating the execution plan andevaluating in the crowdsourcing marketplace. A given query can have many alternativeexecution plans and the difference in crowdsourcing cost between the best and the worstplans may be several orders of magnitude. Therefore; as in relational database systems;query optimization is important to crowdsourcing systems that provide declarative queryinterfaces. In this paper; we propose CROWDOP; a cost-based query optimization approachfor declarative crowdsourcing systems. CROWDOP considers both cost and latency in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,21
An adaptive updating protocol for reducing moving object database workload,Su Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract In the last decade; spatio-temporal database research focuses on the design ofeffective and efficient indexing structures in support of location-based queries such aspredictive range queries and nearest neighbor queries. While a variety of indexingtechniques have been proposed to accelerate the processing of updates and queries; notmuch attention has been paid to the updating protocol; which is another important factoraffecting system performance. In this paper; we propose a generic and adaptive updatingprotocol for moving object databases with less number of updating messages between theobjects and database server; thereby reducing the overall workload of the system. Incontrast to the approach adopted by most conventional moving object database systemswhere the exact locations and velocities last disclosed are used to predict their motions …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,21

Blast++: A tool for blasting queries in batches,Hao Wang; Twee-Hee Ong; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract BLAST is the standard tool that molecular biologists use to search for sequencesimilarity in genomic (and protein) databases. It employs a brute force approach ofcomparing a query sequence against every database sequence-for each pair of thesequences to be matched; BLAST searches for short fixed-length word pairs (seeds) in thesequences and then extends them to higher-scoring regions. To search multiple queries; thebasic approach is to run BLAST on each of the queries one at a time. This is clearlyinefficient and fails to exploit common subsequences that the collection of queries mayshare. In this paper; we propose a new genome search tool; BLAST++; that allows multiple;say K; queries to be searched against a database concurrently. The design of BLAST++ isbased on our observation that the seed searching step of BLAST is a bottleneck that …,Proceedings of the First Asia-Pacific bioinformatics conference on Bioinformatics 2003-Volume 19,2003,21
Efficient spatial keyword search in trajectory databases,Gao Cong; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Dongxiang Zhang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: An increasing amount of trajectory data is being annotated with text descriptions tobetter capture the semantics associated with locations. The fusion of spatial locations andtext descriptions in trajectories engenders a new type of top-$ k $ queries that take intoaccount both aspects. Each trajectory in consideration consists of a sequence of geo-spatiallocations associated with text descriptions. Given a user location $\lambda $ and a keywordset $\psi $; a top-$ k $ query returns $ k $ trajectories whose text descriptions cover thekeywords $\psi $ and that have the shortest match distance. To the best of our knowledge;previous research on querying trajectory databases has focused on trajectory data withoutany text description; and no existing work has studied such kind of top-$ k $ queries ontrajectories. This paper proposes one novel method for efficiently computing top-$ k …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1205.2880,2012,20

An empirical study of color-spatial retrieval techniques for large image databases,Chia Yeow Yee; Kian-Lee Tan; Tat Seng Chua; Beng Chin Ooi,We present an experimental evaluation of three color-spatial retrieval techniques-thesignature-based technique; the partition-based algorithm and the cluster-based method. Theexperimental study is performed on an image database consisting of 12000 images.

Indexing OODB instances based on access proximity,Chee Yong Chan; Cheng Hian Goh; Beng Chin Ooi,Queries in object-oriented databases (OODBs) may be asked with respect to different classscopes: a query may either request for object-instances which belong exclusively to a givenclass c; or those which belong to any class in the hierarchy rooted at c. To facilitate retrievalof objects both from a single class as well as from multiple classes in a class hierarchy; wepropose a multi-dimensional class-hierarchy index called the/spl chi/-tree. The/spl chi/-treedynamically partitions the data space using both the class and indexed attribute dimensionsby taking into account the semantics of the class dimension as well as access patterns ofqueries. Experimental results show that it is an efficient index.,Data Engineering; 1997. Proceedings. 13th International Conference on,1997,20
Streaming multiple aggregations using phantoms,Rui Zhang; Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi; Divesh Srivastava; Pu Zhou,Abstract Data streams characterize the high speed and large volume input of a new class ofapplications such as network monitoring; web content analysis and sensor networks. Amongthese applications; network monitoring may be the most compelling one--the backbone of alarge internet service provider can generate 1 petabyte of data per day. For many networkmonitoring tasks such as traffic analysis and statistics collection; aggregation is a primitiveoperation. Various analytical and statistical needs naturally lead to related aggregatequeries. In this article; we address the problem of efficiently computing multiple aggregationsover high-speed data streams based on the two-level query processing architecture of GS; areal data stream management system deployed in AT & T.

Piers: an efficient model for similarity search in DNA sequence databases,Xia Cao; Shuai Cheng Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Growing interest in genomic research has resulted in the creation of huge biologicalsequence databases. In this paper; we present a hash-based pier model for efficienthomology search in large DNA sequence databases. In our model; only certain segments inthe databases called'piers' need to be accessed during searches as opposite to otherapproaches which require a full scan on the biological sequence database. To furtherimprove the search efficiency; the piers are stored in a specially designed hash table whichhelps to avoid expensive alignment operation. The has table is small enough to reside inmain memory; hence avoiding I/O in the search steps. We show theoretically and empiricallythat the proposed approach can efficiently detect biological sequences that are similar to aquery sequence with very high sensitivity.,ACM Sigmod Record,2004,19
Using domain knowledge in querying image databases,Tat-Seng Chua; Kah-choo Teo; Beng-chin Ooi; Kian-lee Tan,Abstract Introduction The advances in computer technology enable us to store andmanipulate a massive amount of color images on the computer. Databases containing largeon-line image collections are becoming common. Current and potential applications forimaging and other media include: medicine; photo-journalism; marketing and promotion;education and training; and entertainment. The emergence of large and complex imagedatabases has led to the demand for tools that can manage; organize and retrieve imageseffectively. Most early image retrieval systems use keywords or free-text descriptionssupplied by the authors as the basis for retrieval [1; 14]. The problem with text-basedretrieval systems is that the text descriptions must be entered manually by the authors; andhence the descriptions tend to be incomplete and inconsistent. Because of this problem …,In International Conference on Multimedia Modeling,1996,19
Adaptive logging: Optimizing logging and recovery costs in distributed in-memory databases,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Sai Wu,Abstract By maintaining the data in main memory; in-memory databases dramatically reducethe I/O cost of transaction processing. However; for recovery purposes; in-memory systemsstill need to flush the log to disk; which incurs a substantial number of I/Os. Recently;command logging has been proposed to replace the traditional data log (eg; ARIES logging)in in-memory databases. Instead of recording how the tuples are updated; command loggingonly tracks the transactions that are being executed; thereby effectively reducing the size ofthe log and improving the performance. However; when a failure occurs; all the transactionsin the log after the last checkpoint must be redone sequentially and this significantlyincreases the cost of recovery. In this paper; we first extend the command logging techniqueto a distributed system; where all the nodes can perform their recovery in parallel.

Federation in Cloud Data Management: Challenges and Opportunities,Gang Chen; HV Jagadish; Dawei Jiang; David Maier; Kian-Lee Tan; Wang-Chiew Tan,Companies are increasingly moving their data processing to the cloud; for reasons of cost;scalability; and convenience; among others. However; hosting multiple applications andstorage systems on the same cloud introduces resource sharing and heterogeneous dataprocessing challenges due to the variety of resource usage patterns employed; the variety ofdata types stored; and the variety of query interfaces presented by those systems.Furthermore; real clouds are never perfectly symmetric-there often are differences betweenindividual processors in their capabilities and connectivity. In this paper; we introduce afederation framework to manage such heterogeneous clouds. We then use this framework todiscuss several challenges and their potential solutions.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,18
Paths to stardom: calibrating the potential of a peer-based data management system,Mihai Lupu; Beng Chin Ooi; YC Tay,Abstract As peer-to-peer (P2P) networks become more familiar to the database community;intense interest has built up in using their scalability and resilience properties to scaledatabase applications. Indexing methods are adapted on top of P2P networks and queryingmethods are developed to handle the data distribution on different nodes. These procedureslargely depend on how nodes are connected to each other. So far; limited attempts havebeen made to compare all these systems in a generalized framework. This is because thesystems are quite different from each other; and there are so many of them that brute forcecomparison is practically impossible. Fortunately; it has recently been observed that a largesubset of the most important P2P networks share a common algebraic and combinatorialbase; in the form of Cayley graphs.

Efficient indexing structures for mining frequent patterns,Bin Lan; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,In this paper; we propose a variant of the signature file; called bit-sliced bloom-filteredsignature file (BBS); as the basis for implementing filter-and-refine strategies for miningfrequent patterns. In the filtering step; the candidate patterns are obtained by scanning BBSinstead of the database. The resultant candidate set contains a superset of the frequentpatterns. In the refinement phase; each algorithm refines the candidate set to prune awaythe false drops. Based on this indexing structure; we study two filtering (single and dual filter)and two refinement (sequential scan and probe) mechanisms; thus giving rise to fourdifferent strategies. We conducted an extensive performance study to study the effectivenessof BBS; and compared the four proposed processing schemes with the traditional a priorialgorithm and the recently proposed FP-tree scheme. Our results show that BBS; as a …,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,18
On getting some answers quickly; and perhaps more later,Kian-Lee Tan; Cheng Hian Goh; Beng Chin Ooi,Traditionally; the answer to a database query is construed to be the set of all tuples that meetthe criteria stated. Strict adherence to this notion in query evaluation is; however;increasingly unsatisfactory; because decision makers are more prone to adopting anexploratory strategy for information searching; which we call" getting some answers quickly;and perhaps more later". In this paper; we propose a progressive query processing strategythat exploits this behavior to conserve system resources and to minimize query responsetime. This is accomplished by the heuristic decomposition of user queries into subqueriesthat can be evaluated on demand. We also describe the architecture of a prototype systemthat provides a non-intrusive implementation of our approach. Finally; we presentexperimental results that demonstrate the benefits of the progressive query processing …,Data Engineering; 1999. Proceedings.; 15th International Conference on,1999,18
Adaptive reorganization of coherency-preserving dissemination tree for streaming data,Yongluan Zhou; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Feng Yu,In many recent applications; data are continuously being disseminated from a source to aset of servers. In this paper; we propose a cost-based approach to construct disseminationtrees to minimize the average loss of fidelity of the system. Our cost model takes into accountboth the processing cost and the communication cost. To adapt to inaccurate statistics;runtime fluctuations of data characteristics; server workloads; and network conditions etc.;we propose a runtime adaptive scheme to incrementally transform a dissemination tree to amore cost-effective one. Given apriori statistics of the system; we propose two staticalgorithms to construct a dissemination tree for relatively static environments.

Go green: recycle and reuse frequent patterns,Gao Cong; Beng Chin Ooi; K-L Tan; Anthony KH Tung,In constrained data mining; users can specify constraints to prune the search space to avoidmining uninteresting knowledge. This is typically done by specifying some initial values ofthe constraints that are subsequently refined iteratively until satisfactory results are obtained.Existing mining schemes treat each iteration as a distinct mining process; and fail to exploitthe information generated between iterations. We propose to salvage knowledge that isdiscovered from an earlier iteration of mining to enhance subsequent rounds of mining. Inparticular; we look at how frequent patterns can be recycled. Our proposed strategy operatesin two phases. In the first phase; frequent patterns obtained from an early iteration are usedto compress a database. In the second phase; subsequent mining processes operate on thecompressed database. We propose two compression strategies and adapt three existing …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Spatial indexing in binary decomposition and spatial bounding,Beng Chin Ooi; Ron Sacks-Davis; Ken J McDonell,Abstract In spatial database systems; data objects are of non-zero size and are associatedwith space coordinates. Efficient query retrieval on spatial relationships relies upon auxiliarydata structures to support spatial indexing of these objects. The underlying indexingstructures must support efficient spatial operations; such as locating the neighbors of anobject. In Proc. IEEE Comput. Software & Applic. Conf; pp. 433–438 [1]; we proposed anindexing structure called the skd-tree. This paper is a follow-up study of this initial design. Inthis paper; we describe the structure and related algorithms; the deletion algorithm inparticular. Extensive experiments are presented. Performance study shows that the skd-treeis an efficient indexing mixture.,Information Systems,1991,17
Efficiently Supporting Edit Distance based String Similarity Search Using B+-trees,Wei Lu; Xiaoyong Du; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Beng Chin Ooi,Edit distance is widely used for measuring the similarity between two strings. As a primitiveoperation; edit distance based string similarity search is to find strings in a collection that aresimilar to a given query string using edit distance. Existing approaches for answering suchstring similarity queries follow the filter-and-verify framework by using various indexes.Typically; most approaches assume that indexes and data sets are maintained in mainmemory. To overcome this limitation; in this paper; we propose B+-tree based approaches toanswer edit distance based string similarity queries; and hence; our approaches can beeasily integrated into existing RDBMSs. In general; we answer string similarity search usingpruning techniques employed in the metric space in that edit distance is a metric.

Rapid identification of column heterogeneity,Bing Tian Dai; Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi; Divesh Srivastava; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,Data quality is a serious concern in every data management application; and a variety ofquality measures have been proposed; eg; accuracy; freshness and completeness; tocapture common sources of data quality degradation. We identify and focus attention on anovel measure; column heterogeneity; that seeks to quantify the data quality problems thatcan arise when merging data from different sources. We identify desiderata that a columnheterogeneity measure should intuitively satisfy; and describe our technique to quantifydatabase column heterogeneity based on using a novel combination of cluster entropy andsoft clustering. Finally; we present detailed experimental results; using diverse data sets ofdifferent types; to demonstrate that our approach provides a robust mechanism foridentifying and quantifying database column heterogeneity.,Data Mining; 2006.

Cache-on-demand: Recycling with certainty,Kian-Lee Tan; Shen-Tat Goh; Beng Chin Ooi,Queries posed to a database usually access some common relations; or share somecommon sub-expressions. We examine the issue of caching using a novel framework; calledcache-on-demand (CoD). CoD views intermediate/final answers of existing running queriesas virtual caches that an incoming query can exploit. Those caches that are beneficial maythen be materialized for the incoming query. Such an approach is essentiallynonspeculative: the exact cost of investment and the return on investment are known; andthe cache is certain to be reused. We address several issues for CoD to be realized. We alsopropose two optimizing strategies; Conform-CoD and Scramble-CoD; and evaluate theirperformance. Our results show that CoD-based schemes can provide substantialperformance improvement.,Data Engineering; 2001. Proceedings. 17th International Conference on,2001,16
Efficient indexing of high-dimensional data through dimensionality reduction,Cheng Hian Goh; Agnes Lim; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract The performance of the R-tree indexing method is known to deteriorate rapidlywhen the dimensionality of data increases. In this paper; we present a technique fordimensionality reduction by grouping d distinct attributes into k disjoint clusters and mappingeach cluster to a linear space. The resulting k-dimensional space (which may be muchsmaller than d) can then be indexed using an R-tree efficiently. We present algorithms fordecomposing a query region on the native d-dimensional space to corresponding queryregions in the k-dimensional space; as well as search and update operations for the“dimensionally-reduced” R-tree.

Global atlas: Calibrating and indexing documents from the internet in the cartographic paradigm,Fiona Lee; Stéphane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi,Global Atlas is a geographical search engine. It indexes maps; satellite and aerial pictures;as well as HTML documents available on the World Wide Web. The Global Atlas leverageson the cartographic paradigm to provide a very natural support for indexing; searching andsharing information. It allows the design of intuitive user interfaces and the use of naturalvisual feedback. HTML documents are best indexed according to the geographical regionsto which they are topically associated; and maps in the form of GIF and JPEG images areindexed to create a huge patchwork of maps. However; maps come in a variety ofunspecified coordinate systems and projections. This entails calibrating different maps to asingle reference coordinate system. We discuss the design issues in building ageographical search engine; and focus on the calibration of maps.,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2000.

“Anti-Caching”-based elastic memory management for Big Data,Hao Zhang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Weng-Fai Wong; Shensen Wu; Yubin Xia,The increase in the capacity of main memory coupled with the decrease in cost has fueledthe development of in-memory database systems that manage data entirely in memory;thereby eliminating the disk I/O bottleneck. However; as we shall explain; in the Big Dataera; maintaining all data in memory is impossible; and even unnecessary. Ideally we wouldlike to have the high access speed of memory; with the large capacity and low price of disk.This hinges on the ability to effectively utilize both the main memory and disk. In this paper;we analyze state-of-the-art approaches to achieving this goal for in-memory databases;which is called as “Anti-Caching” to distinguish it from traditional caching mechanisms. Weconduct extensive experiments to study the effect of each fine-grained component of theentire process of “Anti-Caching” on both performance and prediction accuracy.

E3: an elastic execution engine for scalable data processing,Gang Chen; Ke Chen; Dawei Jiang; Beng Chin Ooi; Lei Shi; Hoang Tam Vo; Sai Wu,抄録 With the unprecedented growth of data generated by mankind nowadays; it hasbecome critical to develop efficient techniques for processing these massive data sets. Totackle such challenges; analytical data processing systems must be extremely efficient;scalable; and flexible as well as economically effective. Recently; Hadoop; an open-sourceimplementation of MapReduce; has gained interests as a promising big data processingsystem. Although Hadoop offers the desired flexibility and scalability; its performance hasbeen noted to be suboptimal when it is used to process complex analytical tasks. This paperpresents E 3; an elastic and efficient execution engine for scalable data processing. E 3adopts a “middle” approach between MapReduce and Dryad in that E 3 has a simplercommunication model than Dryad yet it can support multi-stages job better than …,Journal of Information Processing,2012,15
Efficient RFID data imputation by analyzing the correlations of monitored objects,Yu Gu; Ge Yu; Yueguo Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract As a promising technology for tracing the product and human flows; RadioFrequency Identification (RFID) has received much attention within database community.However; the problem of missing readings restricts the application of RFID. Some RFID datacleaning algorithms have therefore been proposed to address this problem. Nevertheless;most of them fill up missing readings simply based on the historical readings of independentmonitored objects. While; the correlations (spatio-temporal closeness) among the monitoredobjects are ignored. We observe that the spatio-temporal correlations of monitored objectsare very useful for imputing the missing RFID readings. In this paper; we propose a dataimputation model for RFID by efficiently maintaining and analyzing the correlations of themonitored objects. Optimized data structures and imputation strategies are developed …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,15
Efficient processing of warping time series join of motion capture data,Yueguo Chen; Gang Chen; Ke Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Discovering non-trivial matching subsequences from two time series is very useful insynthesizing novel time series. This can be applied to applications such as motion synthesiswhere smooth and natural motion sequences are often required to be generated fromexisting motion sequences. We first address this problem by defining it as a problem of le-join over two time series. Given two time series; the goal of le-join is to find those non-trivialmatching subsequences by detecting maximal l-connections from the e-matching matrix ofthe two time series. Given a querying motion sequence; the le-join can be applied to retrieveall connectable motion sequences from a database of motion sequences. To supportefficient le-join of time series; we propose a two-step filter-and-refine algorithm; calledWarping Time Series Join (WTSJ) algorithm. The filtering step serves to prune those …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,15
R-store: a scalable distributed system for supporting real-time analytics,Feng Li; M Tamer Ozsu; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,It is widely recognized that OLTP and OLAP queries have different data access patterns;processing needs and requirements. Hence; the OLTP queries and OLAP queries aretypically handled by two different systems; and the data are periodically extracted from theOLTP system; transformed and loaded into the OLAP system for data analysis. With theawareness of the ability of big data in providing enterprises useful insights from vastamounts of data; effective and timely decisions derived from real-time analytics areimportant. It is therefore desirable to provide real-time OLAP querying support; where OLAPqueries read the latest data while OLTP queries create the new versions. In this paper; wepropose R-Store; a scalable distributed system for supporting real-time OLAP by extendingthe MapReduce framework. We extend an open source distributed key/value system …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,14
Compacting music signatures for efficient music retrieval,Bin Cui; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Music information retrieval is becoming very important with the ever-increasinggrowth of music content in digital libraries; peer-to-peer systems and the internet. While it iseasy to quantize music into a discrete string representation; retrieval by content requires(approximate) sub-string matching; which is hard. In this paper; we present a novel system;called MUSIG; that uses compact MUsic SIGnatures for efficient contentbased musicretrieval. The signature is computed as follows:(a) each music file is split into a set of(overlapping) segments;(b) similar segments are clustered together; the number of clusterscorresponds to the number of dimensions;(c) for each music file; the number of its segmentsthat fall into a cluster determines the key value in that dimension.,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,14

SWORS: a system for the efficient retrieval of relevant spatial web objects,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Jun Jie Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Nhan-Tue Phan; Dingming Wu,Abstract Spatial web objects that possess both a geographical location and a textualdescription are gaining in prevalence. This gives prominence to spatial keyword queries thatexploit both location and textual arguments. Such queries are used in many web servicessuch as yellow pages and maps services. We present SWORS; the Spatial Web ObjectRetrieval System; that is capable of efficiently retrieving spatial web objects that satisfyspatial keyword queries. Specifically; SWORS supports two types of queries: a) the location-aware top-k text retrieval (LkT) query that retrieves k individual spatial web objects takinginto account query location proximity and text relevancy; b) the spatial keyword group (SKG)query that retrieves a group of objects that cover the query keywords and are nearest to thequery location and have the shortest inter-object distances.

An effective 3-in-1 keyword search method over heterogeneous data sources,Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Beng Chin Ooi; Jianyong Wang; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract Conventional keyword search engines are restricted to a given data model andcannot easily adapt to unstructured; semi-structured or structured data. In this paper; wepropose an efficient and adaptive keyword search method; called EASE; for indexing andquerying large collections of heterogeneous data. To achieve high efficiency in processingkeyword queries; we first model unstructured; semi-structured and structured data as graphs;and then summarize the graphs and construct graph indices instead of using traditionalinverted indices. We propose an extended inverted index to facilitate keyword-based search;and present a novel ranking mechanism for enhancing search effectiveness. We haveconducted an extensive experimental study using real datasets; and the results show thatEASE achieves both high search efficiency and high accuracy; and outperforms the …,Information Systems,2011,12
Sense the physical; walkthrough the virtual; manage the co (existing) spaces: a database perspective,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian Lee Tan; Anthony Tung,Abstract In a co-space environment; the physical space and the virtual space co-exist; andinteract simultaneously. While the physical space is virtually enhanced with information; thevirtual space is continuously refreshed with real-time; real-world information. To allow usersto process and manipulate information seamlessly between the real and digital spaces;novel technologies must be developed. These include smart interfaces; new augmentedrealities; efficient storage and data management and dissemination techniques. In thispaper; we first discuss some promising co-space applications. These applications offerexperiences and opportunities that neither of the spaces can realize on its own. We thenargue that the database community has much to offer to this field. Finally; we present severalchallenges that we; as a community; can contribute towards managing the co-space.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2010,12

Marcopolo: a community system for sharing and integrating travel information on maps,Yueguo Chen; Su Chen; Yu Gu; Mei Hui; Feng Li; Chen Liu; Liangxu Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Xiaoyan Yang; Dongxiang Zhang; Yuan Zhou,Abstract The tagging technique has been widely applied in existing Web 2.0 systems; whereusers label resources with tags for effective classification and efficient retrieval of resources.Location-aware geographical tags (geo-tags) are required if users want to mark location-sensitive resources to digital maps. Large volumes of different kinds of user-created tagspose challenges to the effective organization of community resources using tags. Issuessuch as guaranteeing the quality of tags and supporting various tag-based queries emerge.In this demo; we present MarcoPolo; a Web 2.0 community system that allows users todefine the hierarchical textual geo-tags and mark resources to a map using geo-tags.Statistical and feedback mechanisms are applied to guarantee the quality of tags (includinggeo-tags).

Clustering wavelets to speed-up data dissemination in structured p2p manets,M Lupur; Jianzliong Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Shensfei Shi,This paper introduces a fast data dissemination method for structured peer-to-peer networks.The work is motivated on one side by the increase in non-volatile memory available onmobile devices and; on the other side; by observed behavioral patterns of the users. Weenvision a scenario where users come together for short periods of time (eg public transport;conference sessions) and wish to be able to share large collections of data.

Relaxed space bounding for moving objects: A case for the buddy tree,Shuqiao Guo; Zhiyong Huang; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract Rapid advancements in positioning systems and wireless communications enableaccurate tracking of continuously moving objects. This development poses new challengesto database technology since maintaining up-to-date information regarding the location ofmoving objects incurs an enormous amount of updates. There have been many efforts toaddress these challenges; most of which depend on the use of a minimum boundingrectangle (MBR) in a multi-dimensional index structure such as R-tree. The maintenance ofMBRs causes lock contention and association of moving speeds with the MBRs cause largeoverlap between them. This problem becomes more severe as the number of concurrentoperations increases. In this paper; we propose a" new" simple variant of the Buddy-tree; inwhich we enlarge the query rectangle to account for object movement rather than use an …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2006,11
Toward efficient multifeature query processing,HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Heng Tao Shen; K-L Tan,In many advanced applications; data are described by multiple high-dimensional features.Moreover; different queries may weight these features differently; some may not even specifyall the features. In this paper; we propose our solution to support efficient query processingin these applications. We devise a novel representation that compactly captures f featuresinto two components. The first component is a 2D vector that reflects a distance range(minimum and maximum values) of the f features with respect to a reference point (the centerof the space) in a metric space and the second component is a bit signature; with two bitsper dimension; obtained by analyzing each feature's descending energy histogram. Thisrepresentation enables two levels of filtering: the first component prunes away points that donot share similar distance ranges; while the bit signature filters away points based on the …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2006,11

Collaborative spatial data sharing among mobile lightweight devices,Zhiyong Huang; Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Mobile devices are increasingly being equipped with wireless peer-to-peer (P2P)networking interfaces; rendering the sharing of data among mobile devices feasible andbeneficial. In comparison to the traditional client/server wireless channel; the P2P channelshave considerably higher bandwidth. Motivated by these observations; we propose acollaborative spatial data sharing scheme that exploits the P2P capabilities of mobiledevices. Using carefully maintained routing tables; this scheme enables mobile devices notonly to use their local storage for query processing; but also to collaborate with nearbymobile peers to exploit their data. This scheme is capable of reducing the cost of thecommunication between mobile clients and the server as well as the query response time.The paper details the design of the data sharing scheme; including its routing table …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,10
DSIM: A distance-based indexing method for genomic sequences,Xia Cao; Beng Chin Ooi; AKH Tung; Hwee Hwa Pang,In this paper; we propose a Distance-based Sequence Indexing Method (DSIM) for indexingand searching genome databases. Borrowing the idea of video compression; we compressthe genomic sequence database around a set of automatically selected reference words;formed from high-frequency data substrings and substrings in past queries. Thecompression captures the distance of each non-reference word in the database to somereference word. At runtime; a query is processed by comparing its substrings with thecompressed data strings; through their distances to the reference words. We also proposean efficient scheme to incrementally update the reference words and the compressed datasequences as more data sequences are added and new queries come along.

Semantic mining and analysis of gene expression data,Xin Xu; Gao Cong; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Association rules can reveal biological relevant relationship between genes andenvironments/categories. However; most existing association rule mining algorithms arerendered impractical on gene expression data; which typically contains thousands or tens ofthousands of columns (gene expression levels); but only tens of rows (samples). The mainproblem is that these algorithms have an exponential dependence on the number ofcolumns. Another shortcoming is evident that too many associations are generated fromsuch kind of data. To this end; we have developed a novel depth-first row-wise algorithmFARMER [2] that is specially designed to efficiently discover and cluster association rulesinto interesting rule groups (IRGs) that satisfy user-specified minimum support; confidenceand chi-square value thresholds on biological datasets as opposed to finding association …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,10
Query optimization in an extended DBMS,Beng Chin Ooi; Ron Sacks-Davis,Abstract Conventional Data Base Management Systems (DBMSs) are not generally effectivefor applications such as geographic data processing where data have spatial characteristicsand queries involve on spatial relationships. These DBMSs can however be extended bysupplementing them with special processing subsystems and new indexing structures andby augmenting the query interface language. DBMSs supporting an SQL interface are nowwidely used. The GEOgraphic Query Language (GEOQL)[18] is an extension of SQLproposed for geographic applications and supports both spatial and aspatial operations. Inthis paper; we propose a global optimization strategy for the hybrid queries so that a generalquery involving both spatial and aspatial selection can be executed efficiently. We show thatthe method is feasible.,*,1989,10
Online aggregation,Sai Wu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this chapter; we introduce a new promising technique for query processing;online aggregation. Online aggregation is proposed based on the assumption that for someapplications; the precise results are not always required. Instead; the approximate resultscan provide a good enough estimation. Compared to the precise results; computing theapproximate ones are more cost effective; especially for large-scale datasets. To generatethe approximate result; online aggregation retrieves samples continuously from thedatabase. The samples are streamed to the query engine for processing the query. Theaccuracy of the approximate result is described by a statistical model. Normally; the result isrefined as more samples are obtained. The user can terminate the processing at any time;when he/she is satisfied with the quality of the result. The performance of online …,*,2013,9

Dynamic buffer management with extensible replacement policies,Chong Leng Goh; Yanfeng Shu; Zhiyong Huang; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract The objective of extensible DBMSs is to ease the construction of specializedDBMSs for nontraditional applications. Although much work has been done in providingvarious levels of extensibility (eg; extensibility of data types and operators; query languageextensibility; and query optimizer extensibility); there has been very limited research inproviding extensibility at the buffer management level. Supporting extensibility at the buffermanagement level is important as it can contribute significantly to overall systemperformance. This paper addresses the problem of supporting extensibility of bufferreplacement policies. The main contribution is the proposal of a framework for modelingbuffer replacement policies.

DB-enabled peers for managing distributed data,Beng Chin Ooi; Yanfeng Shu; Kian Lee Tan,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing is the sharing of computer resources; services andinformation by direct negotiation and exchange between autonomous and heterogeneoussystems. An alternative approach to distributed and parallel computing; known as GridComputing; has also emerged; with a similar intent of scaling the system performance andavailability by sharing resources. Like P2P computing; Grid Computing has beenpopularized by the need for resource sharing and consequently; it rides on existingunderlying organizational structure. In this paper; we compare P2P and Grid computing tohighlight some of their differences. We then examine the issues of P2P distributed datasharing systems; and how database applications can ride on P2P technology.

Large deeplearning models are developed for learning rich representations of complex data. There aretwo challenges to overcome before deep learning can be widely adopted in multimedia andother applications. One is usability; namely the implementation of different models andtraining algorithms must be done by nonexperts without much effort; especially when themodel is large and complex. The other is scalability; namely the deep learning system mustbe able to provision for a huge demand of computing resources for training large modelswith massive datasets.

Exploiting Single-Threaded Model in Multi-Core In-memory Systems,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Qian Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Weng-Fai Wong; Meihui Zhang,The widely adopted single-threaded OLTP model assigns a single thread to each staticpartition of the database for processing transactions in a partition. This simplifiesconcurrency control while retaining parallelism. However; it suffers performance loss arisingfrom skewed workloads as well as transactions that span multiple partitions. In this paper;we present a dynamic single-threaded in-memory OLTP system; called LADS; that extendsthe simplicity of the single-threaded model. The key innovation in LADS is the separation ofdependency resolution and execution into two non-overlapping phases for batches oftransactions. After the first phase of dependency resolution; the record actions of thetransactions are partitioned and ordered. Each independent partition is then executedsequentially by a single thread; avoiding the need for locking. By careful mapping of the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,8
Towards a non-2pc transaction management in distributed database systems,Qian Lin; Pengfei Chang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Zhengkui Wang,Abstract Shared-nothing architecture has been widely used in distributed databases toachieve good scalability. While it offers superior performance for local transactions; theoverhead of processing distributed transactions can degrade the system performancesignificantly. The key contributor to the degradation is the expensive two-phase commit(2PC) protocol used to ensure atomic commitment of distributed transactions. In this paper;we propose a transaction management scheme called LEAP to avoid the 2PC protocolwithin distributed transaction processing. Instead of processing a distributed transactionacross multiple nodes; LEAP converts the distributed transaction into a local transaction.This benefits the processing locality and facilitates adaptive data repartitioning when there isa change in data access pattern. Based on LEAP; we develop an online transaction …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,8

Continuous online index tuning in moving object databases,Su Chen; Mario A Nascimento; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In a Moving Object Database (MOD); the dataset; for example; the location ofobjects and their distribution; and the workload change frequently. Traditional static indexesare not able to cope well with such changes; that is; their effectiveness and efficiency areseriously affected.

In this article; we design and present the ST2 B-tree; a Self-Tunable Spatio-Temporal B+-tree index for MODs. In ST 2 B-tree; the dataspace is partitioned into regions of different density with respect to a set of reference points.Based on the density; objects in a region are managed using a grid of appropriategranularity; intuitively; a dense region employs a grid with fine granularity; while a sparseregion uses a grid with coarse granularity.

Thesedata are typically modelled as time series of high dimensional vectors which incur expensivestorage and retrieval cost as a result of the high dimensionality. In this paper; we abstractsuch complex spatio-temporal data as a set of frames which are then represented as highdimensional categorical feature vectors. New distance measures and queries for highdimensional categorical time series are then proposed and efficient query processingtechniques for answering these queries are developed.

iSearch: mining retrieval history for content-based image retrieval,Hongyu Wang; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Relevance feedback is a powerful technique to bridge the gap between high-level conceptsand low-level features; and has been successfully applied to the field of Content-BasedImage Retrieval (CBIR) to improve the query accuracy in recent years. In this paper; wepropose a novel model (iSearch) which predicts user's information need based on pastretrieval history. Based on the prediction; we then transform the feature space based on theuser's feedback and employ an Expectation Maximization (EM) approach to simulate thenew space by a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The experimental results show that theproposed method is effective and captures the user's information need more precisely.,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2003.(DASFAA 2003).

A novel peer-to-peer system based on self-configuration,W Ng; BC Ooi; KL Tan; XY Wang; B Ling; AY Zhou,One of the most important features for a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system is to shareinformation and services among nodes with equivalent capabilities and responsibilities bypooling their resources together. Nowadays; most of the existing P2P systems such asNapster and Gnutella only provide some kinds of coarse granularity information sharingwithout taking account of the content of the file. And; typically nodes (peers) are definedstatically. In addition; there is no mechanism to support the join of nodes with temporarynetwork addresses. In this paper; a prototyping P2P system; BestPeer is presented. TheBestPeer is unique in several ways. Firstly; it combines the power of mobile agents into P2Psystems to perform operations at peers' sites. Secondly; it is self-configurable. A node candynamically select the set of peers with which it can communicate directly based on some …,Journal of Software,2003,8
Batch scheduling for demand-driven servers in wireless environments,Kian-Lee Tan; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract In a demand-driven information/database server; the server transmits data to clientsthat explicitly request for them. Because of the low bandwidth of wireless networks; thenumber of clients that can be effectively supported is often limited. Caching has been shownto be effective in reducing the contention on the narrow bandwidth of the wireless channel.However; it cannot handle contention due to multiple clients requesting the same dataobjects. In the latter case; the server should “intelligently” transmit only one copy of the dataobjects to satisfy multiple requests that arrive within a short duration of time. In this paper; weexamine the effectiveness of batching in increasing the number of clients that wirelessnetworks can support. Under a batching scheme; data objects may not be transmittedimmediately even if the channel is available; instead; they may be delayed so that …,Information Sciences,1998,8
Database Meets Deep Learning: Challenges and Opportunities,Wei Wang; Meihui Zhang; Gang Chen; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Deep learning has recently become very popular on account of its incrediblesuccess in many complex datadriven applications; including image classification andspeech recognition. The database community has worked on data-driven applications formany years; and therefore should be playing a lead role in supporting this new wave.However; databases and deep learning are different in terms of both techniques andapplications. In this paper; we discuss research problems at the intersection of the two fields.In particular; we discuss possible improvements for deep learning systems from a databaseperspective; and analyze database applications that may benefit from deep learningtechniques.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2016,7
Lightweight indexing of observational data in log-structured storage,Sheng Wang; David Maier; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Huge amounts of data are being generated by sensing devices every day;recording the status of objects and the environment. Such observational data is widely usedin scientific research. As the capabilities of sensors keep improving; the data produced aredrastically expanding in precision and quantity; making it a write-intensive domain. Log-structured storage is capable of providing high write throughput; and hence is a naturalchoice for managing large-scale observational data. In this paper; we propose an approachto indexing and querying observational data in log-structured storage. Based on key traits ofobservational data; we design a novel index approach called the CR-index (ContinuousRange Index); which provides fast query performance without compromising writethroughput. It is a lightweight structure that is fast to construct and often small enough to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,7
Towards Unified Ad-hoc Data Processing,Xiaogang Shi; Bin Cui; Gillian Dobbie; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract It is important to provide efficient execution for ad-hoc data processing programs. Incontrast to constructing complex declarative queries; many users prefer to write theirprograms using procedural code with simple queries. As many users are not expertprogrammers; their programs usually exhibit poor performance in practice and it is achallenge to automatically optimize these programs and efficiently execute the programs. Inthis paper; we present UniAD; a system designed to simplify the programming of dataprocessing tasks and provide efficient execution for user programs. We propose a novelintermediate representation named UniQL which utilizes HOQs to describe the operationsperformed in programs. By combining both procedural and declarative logics; we canperform various optimizations across the boundary between procedural and declarative …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,7
Keyword join: Realizing keyword search for information integration,Bei Yu; Ling Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian Lee Tan,Information integration has been widely addressed over the last several decades. However;it is far from solved due to the complexity of resolving schema and data heterogeneities. Inthis paper; we propose out attempt to alleviate such difficulty by realizing keyword searchfunctionality for integrating information from heterogeneous databases. Our solution doesnot require predefined global schema or any mappings between databases. Rather; it relieson an operator called keyword join to take a set of lists of partial answers from different datasources as input; and output a list of results that are joined by the tuples from input listsbased on predefined similarity measures as integrated results. Our system allows sourcedatabases remain autonomous and the system to be dynamic and extensible. We havetested our system with real dataset and benchmark; which shows that our proposed …,*,2006,7
A statistical approach for XML query size estimation,Mong Li Lee; Hanyu Li; Wynne Hsu; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract The increasing number of XML repositories has intensified research activities in theoptimization of XML queries. The success of any optimization approach hinges on anaccurate query size estimation. This paper presents a statistical method for estimating theresult size of XML queries. Our estimation system extracts two summarized information;namely; node ratio and node factor; from every distinct parent-child path in the XML files.Experiment results indicate that our approach requires small memory footprint; and yetproves to be sufficient in estimating the result size of queries under the data-independentassumption.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,7
Fast filter-and-refine algorithms for subsequence selection,Beng Chin Ooi; Hwee Hwa Pang; Hao Wang; Limsoon Wong; Cui Yu,Large sequence databases; such as protein; DNA and gene sequences in biology; arebecoming increasingly common. An important operation on a sequence database isapproximate subsequence matching; where all subsequences that are within some distancefrom a given query string are retrieved. This paper proposes a filter-and-refine algorithm thatenables efficient approximate subsequence matching in large DNA sequence databases. Itemploys a bitmap indexing structure to condense and encode each data sequence into ashorter index sequence. During query processing; the bitmap index is used to filter out mostof the irrelevant subsequences; and false positives are removed in the final refinement step.Analytical and experimental studies show that the proposed strategy is capable of reducingresponse time substantially while incurring only a small space overhead.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2002.

Query rewriting for SWIFT (first) answers,Kian-Lee Tan; Cheng Hian Goh; Beng Chin Ooi,Traditionally; the answer to a database query is construed as the set of all tuples that meetthe criteria stated. Strict adherence to this notion in query evaluation is; however;increasingly unsatisfactory because decision makers are more prone to adopting anexploratory strategy for information search which we call" getting some answers quickly; andperhaps more later". From a decision-maker's perspective; such a strategy is optimal forcoping with information overload and makes economic sense (when used in conjunctionwith a micropayment mechanism). These new requirements present new opportunities fordatabase query optimization. In this paper; we propose a progressive query processingstrategy that exploits this behavior to conserve system resources and to minimize queryresponse time and user waiting time. This is accomplished by the heuristic decomposition …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2000,7
Semantic-based query formulation in PAS,Suliman Al-Hawamdeh; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract PAS is a picture archival system developed for archiving image documents. Thesystem is based on the probabilistic retrieval model which involves ranking the retrievedimages in order of descending similarity with the query; where the similarity for each imageis determined by the number of terms the description of the image has in common with thequery. A semantic-based query formulation is used to enhance the retrieval model andalleviate problems associated with vague and incomplete queries. The system is testedusing a sports database and the results show that it can be used by a wide audience withdiverse information needs and that the retrieval performance is improved using theknowledge-base.,Intelligent Text and Image Handling-Volume 2,1991,7
Fast and adaptive indexing of multi-dimensional observational data,Sheng Wang; David Maier; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Sensing devices generate tremendous amounts of data each day; which includelarge quantities of multi-dimensional measurements. These data are expected to beimmediately available for real-time analytics as they are streamed into storage. Suchscenarios pose challenges to state-of-the-art indexing methods; as they must not onlysupport efficient queries but also frequent updates. We propose here a novel indexingmethod that ingests multi-dimensional observational data in real time. This method primarilyguarantees extremely high throughput for data ingestion; while it can be continuouslyrefined in the background to improve query efficiency. Instead of representing collections ofpoints using Minimal Bounding Boxes as in conventional indexes; we model sets ofsuccessive points as line segments in hyperspaces; by exploiting the intrinsic value …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,6
Selective hashing: Closing the gap between radius search and k-nn search,Jinyang Gao; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Sheng Wang,Abstract Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its variants; are generally believed to be themost effective radius search methods in high-dimensional spaces. However; manyapplications involve finding the k nearest neighbors (k-NN); where the k-NN distances ofdifferent query points may differ greatly and the performance of LSH suffers. We propose anovel indexing scheme called Selective Hashing; where a disjoint set of indices are builtwith different granularities and each point is only stored in the most effective index.Theoretically; we show that k-NN search using selective hashing can achieve the samerecall as a fixed radius LSH search; using a radius equal to the distance of the c 1 k thnearest neighbor; with at most c 2 times overhead; where c 1 and c 2 are small constants.Selective hashing is also easy to build and update; and outperforms all the state-of-the-art …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,6
Dgcc: A new dependency graph based concurrency control protocol for multicore database systems,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Pengfei Chang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Weng-Fai Wong; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: Multicore CPUs and large memories are increasingly becoming the norm inmodern computer systems. However; current database management systems (DBMSs) aregenerally ineffective in exploiting the parallelism of such systems. In particular; contentioncan lead to a dramatic fall in performance. In this paper; we propose a new concurrencycontrol protocol called DGCC (Dependency Graph based Concurrency Control) thatseparates concurrency control from execution. DGCC builds dependency graphs forbatched transactions before executing them. Using these graphs; contentions within thesame batch of transactions are resolved before execution. As a result; the execution of thetransactions does not need to deal with contention while maintaining full equivalence to thatof serialized execution. This better exploits multicore hardware and achieves higher level …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.03642,2015,6

Demand-driven caching in multiuser environment,Shen-Tat Goh; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,We propose a novel demand-driven caching framework; called cache-on-demand (CoD). InCoD; intermediate/final answers of existing running queries are viewed as virtual cachesthat can be materialized if they are beneficial to incoming queries. Such an approach isessentially nonspeculative: the exact cost of investment and the return on investment areknown; and the cache is certain to be reused! We address several issues for CoD to berealized. We also propose three optimizing strategies: Conform-CoD; Scramble-CoD; andIntegrated-CoD. Conform-CoD and Scramble-CoD are based on a two-phase optimizationframework; while Integrated-CoD operates in a single-phase framework. We conductedextensive performance study to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms.

Object-oriented databases,Elisa Bertino; Beng Chin Ooi; Ron Sacks-Davis; Kian-Lee Tan; Justin Zobel; Boris Shidlovsky; Barbara Catania,Abstract There has been a growing acceptance of the object-oriented data model as thebasis of next generation database management systems (DBMSs). Both pure object-oriented DBMS (OODBMSs) and object-relational DBMS (ORDBMSs) have been developedbased on object-oriented concepts. Object-relational DBMS; in particular; extend the SQLlanguage by incorporating all the concepts of the object-oriented data model. A largenumber of products for both categories of DBMS is today available. In particular; all majorvendors of relational DBMSs are turning their products into ORDBMSs [Nori; 1996].,*,1997,6
S-Hash: An indexing scheme for approximate subsequence matching in large sequence databases,HweeHwa Pang; BengChin Ooi; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Large sequence databases are becoming increasingly common.

Animportant operation on a sequence database is approximate subsequence matching; whereall subsequences that are within some distance from a given query string are retrieved. Thispaper introduces S-Hash; a scheme that enables e cient approximate subsequencematching in large sequence databases.

The proposed security control mechanism provides thedatabase administrators or security control officials of the MDBS and its component DBSwith richer facilities for defining security constraints on the data items to be shared by themultidatabase system users. Furthermore; the security control mechanism can beimplemented as a stand-alone front-end of component database systems so that it can beeasily integrated into or decoupled from the MDBS.,Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems; 1991.

Adaptive logging for distributed in-memory databases,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Sai Wu,Abstract: A new type of logs; the command log; is being employed to replace the traditionaldata log (eg; ARIES log) in the in-memory databases. Instead of recording how the tuplesare updated; a command log only tracks the transactions being executed; thereby effectivelyreducing the size of the log and improving the performance. Command logging on the otherhand increases the cost of recovery; because all the transactions in the log after the lastcheckpoint must be completely redone in case of a failure. In this paper; we first extend thecommand logging technique to a distributed environment; where all the nodes can performrecovery in parallel. We then propose an adaptive logging approach by combining datalogging and command logging. The percentage of data logging versus command loggingbecomes an optimization between the performance of transaction processing and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.03653,2015,5

Crew: cross-modal resource searching by exploiting wikipedia,Chen Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung; Dongxiang Zhang,Abstract In Web 2.0; users have generated and shared massive amounts of resources invarious media formats; such as news; blogs; audios; photos and videos. The abundanceand diversity of the resources call for better integration to improve the accessibility. Astraightforward approach is to link the resources via tags so that resources from differentmodals sharing the same tag can be connected as a graph structure. This naturallymotivates a new kind of information retrieval system; named cross-modal resource search; inwhich given a query object from any modal; all the related resources from other modals canbe retrieved in a convenient manner. However; due to the tag homonym and synonym; suchan approach returns results of low quality because resources with the same tag but notsemantically related will be directly connected as well.

A replication strategy for reducing wait time in video-on-demand systems,Tat Seng Chua; Cheng Hian Goh; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract User wait time—the amount of time a user spends in waiting for a video tocommence—is an important service parameter in many video-on-demand (VOD) systems. Ina companion paper (TS Chua; J.

In this paper; we extend the Phase-based Striping Method with areplication strategy aimed at reducing the average user wait time. To provide evidence forthe effectiveness of the proposed srategy; we conducted extensive simulations of a videoserver under different loading and hardware configurations.

Mining term association rules for global query expansion: A case study with topic 202 from TREC4,Jie Wie; Zhenxing Qin; Stephane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract The sudden growth of the World Wide Web and its unprecedented popularity as ade facto global digital library exemplified both the strengths and weaknesses of theInformation Retrieval techniques used by popular search engines. Most queries are shortand incomplete attempts to describe or characterize the possible documents relevant to thequery. It seems then natural to try and expand the queries with additional terms; which aresemantically and/or statistically associated with the original query terms. In this paper we arelooking at the mining of associations between terms for the exploration of the terminology ofa corpus as well as for the automatic expansion of queries. The technique we use for thediscovery of the associations is association rules mining [Agrawal 96].

Hence; a spatial accessmethod can be employed to facilitate speedy retrieval of the database. In this paper; we re-examine the issue of designing efficient access methods for bitemporal databases. Inparticular; we transform a record into a point in a multi-dimensional space; where the validtime and transaction time are each mapped to a 2-dimensional coordinate. A temporalselection operation can then be implemented as a region search operation. This allows us totap into the many point access methods that are commercially available without modification.We implemented and evaluated three R-tree based methods on key-range time-slice …,Information and software technology,1998,5
Efficient scheduling of page access in join processing,Chee Yong Chan; Beng Chin Ooi,This paper examines the issue of scheduling page access in join processing. Two relatedproblems are addressed: the determination of an optimal page access sequence such thatthe join can be computed without any page reaccesses using the minimum number of bufferpages; and the determination of an optimal page access sequence such that the join can becomputed with the minimum number of page reaccesses given a limited number of bufferpages. The first problem is believed to be NP-hard while the second problem has beenshown to be NP-complete. Efficient heuristics for both problems can optimize bufferutilization as well as disk I/O cost. By modeling a page access sequence as a concatenationof segments; we derived two desirable properties of a\PAS; which serve as the basis of ournew heuristics for solving both problems.

Untangling Blockchain: A Data Processing View of Blockchain Systems,Tien Tuan Anh Dinh; Rui Liu; Meihui Zhang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Ji Wang,Abstract: Blockchain technologies are gaining massive momentum in the last few years.Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not fully trust each other tomaintain a set of global states. The parties agree on the existence; values and histories ofthe states.

UStore: a distributed storage with rich semantics,Anh Dinh; Ji Wang; Sheng Wang; Gang Chen; Wei-Ngan Chin; Qian Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Pingcheng Ruan; Kian-Lee Tan; Zhongle Xie; Hao Zhang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: Today's storage systems expose abstractions which are either too low-level (eg;key-value store; raw-block store) that they require developers to re-invent the wheels; or toohigh-level (eg; relational databases; Git) that they lack generality to support many classes ofapplications. In this work; we propose and implement a general distributed data storagesystem; called UStore; which has rich semantics.

Cohort query processing,Dawei Jiang; Qingchao Cai; Gang Chen; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Modern Internet applications often produce a large volume of user activity records.Data analysts are interested in cohort analysis; or finding unusual user behavioral trends; inthese large tables of activity records. In a traditional database system; cohort analysisqueries are both painful to specify and expensive to evaluate. We propose to extenddatabase systems to support cohort analysis. We do so by extending SQL with three newoperators. We devise three different evaluation schemes for cohort query processing. Two ofthem adopt a non-intrusive approach. The third approach employs a columnar basedevaluation scheme with optimizations specifically designed for cohort query processing. Ourexperimental results confirm the performance benefits of our proposed columnar databasesystem; compared against the two non-intrusive approaches that implement cohort …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,4
epiC: an extensible and scalable system for processing Big Data,Dawei Jiang; Sai Wu; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Jun Xu,Abstract The Big Data problem is characterized by the so-called 3V features: volume—ahuge amount of data; velocity—a high data ingestion rate; and variety—a mix of structureddata; semi-structured data; and unstructured data. The state-of-the-art solutions to the BigData problem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open sourceimplementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challengesuccessfully; it does not deal with the data variety well since the programming interfaces andits associated data processing model are inconvenient and inefficient for handling structureddata and graph data. This paper presents epiC; an extensible system to tackle the Big Data'sdata variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model;independent of the data processing models; for specifying parallel computations.

Join and multi-join processing in data integration systems,Kian-Lee Tan; Pin Kwang Eng; Beng Chin Ooi; Ming Zhang,Abstract Query processing in a data integration system is complicated by a lack of qualitystatistics about the data; unpredictable and bursty data transfer rates; and slow orunavailable data sources. Conventional query processing algorithms; which are based on ablocking execution model; are no longer attractive because of their long initial responsetime. Moreover; the execution engine may be stalled by slow data delivery rates orunavailable data sources. In this paper; we adopt a non-blocking execution model forevaluating queries. We propose a symmetric partition-based join algorithm; called AJoin;that can operate with small memory requirement; produce first few answer tuples quickly;and blocks only when all available data have been examined. We also examine heuristics tomanage the partitions and address the memory management issues of AJoin. To …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2002,4

In this paper; we study twoaspects that should be considered in designing a video storage server with hierarchicalstorage. First; we propose a new admission control policy to determine when a requestshould be admitted to the tertiary storage component. A novel feature of the proposedalgorithm is that it is adaptive and robust to the system load. Requests may be admittedwithout sacrificing the quality of service even when their bandwidth requirements are notmet. Second; we study several disk management algorithms for managing the disk spacethat is assigned as cache for the videos stored in the tertiary storage.

Privacy-preserving computation with trusted computing via Scramble-then-Compute,Hung Dang; Tien Tuan Anh Dinh; Ee-Chien Chang; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract We consider privacy-preserving computation of big data using trusted computingprimitives with limited private memory. Simply ensuring that the data remains encryptedoutside the trusted computing environment is insufficient to preserve data privacy; for datamovement observed during computation could leak information. While it is possible to thwartsuch leakage using generic solution such as ORAM [42]; designing efficient privacy-preserving algorithms is challenging. Besides computation efficiency; it is critical to keeptrusted code bases lean; for large ones are unwieldy to vet and verify. In this paper; weadvocate a simple approach wherein many basic algorithms (eg; sorting) can be madeprivacy-preserving by adding a step that securely scrambles the data before feeding it to theoriginal algorithms. We call this approach Scramble-then-Compute (StC); and give a …,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2017,3

Active Sampler: Light-weight Accelerator for Complex Data Analytics at Scale,Jinyang Gao; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract: Recent years have witnessed amazing outcomes from" Big Models" trained by" BigData". Most popular algorithms for model training are iterative. Due to the surging volumes ofdata; we can usually afford to process only a fraction of the training data in each iteration.Typically; the data are either uniformly sampled or sequentially accessed. In this paper; westudy how the data access pattern can affect model training. We propose an Active Sampleralgorithm; where training data with more" learning value" to the model are sampled morefrequently. The goal is to focus training effort on valuable instances near the classificationboundaries; rather than evident cases; noisy data or outliers. We show the correctness andoptimality of Active Sampler in theory; and then develop a light-weight vectorizedimplementation.

In our SpADE system; non-static entities like vehiclesand pedestrians are abstracted as moving objects. They obtain positioning information withGPS (Global Positioning System) receivers installed; and are able to communicate viawireless network with the server; sending queries to and receiving results from it. The serveris responsible for managing moving object information and processing queries from mobileusers.

Phrase-based statistical machine translation: A level of detail approach,Hendra Setiawan; Haizhou Li; Min Zhang; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract The merit of phrase-based statistical machine translation is often reduced by thecomplexity to construct it. In this paper; we address some issues in phrase-based statisticalmachine translation; namely: the size of the phrase translation table; the use of underlyingtranslation model probability and the length of the phrase unit. We present Level-Of-Detail(LOD) approach; an agglomerative approach for learning phrase-level alignment. Ourexperiments show that LOD approach significantly improves the performance of the word-based approach. LOD demonstrates a clear advantage that the phrase translation tablegrows only sub-linearly over the maximum phrase length; while having a performancecomparable to those of other phrase-based approaches.,International Conference on Natural Language Processing,2005,3
Progressive evaluation of nested aggregate queries,Kian-Lee Tan; Cheng Hian Goh; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract In many decision-making scenarios; decision makers require rapid feedback to theirqueries; which typically involve aggregates. The traditional blocking execution model can nolonger meet the demands of these users. One promising approach in the literature; calledonline aggregation; evaluates an aggregation query progressively as follows: as soon ascertain data have been evaluated; approximate answers are produced with their respectiverunning confidence intervals; as more data are examined; the answers and theircorresponding running confidence intervals are refined. In this paper; we extend thisapproach to handle nested queries with aggregates (ie; at least one inner query block is anaggregate query) by providing users with (approximate) answers progressively as the inneraggregation query blocks are evaluated.

An adaptive updating protocol for reducing moving object database workload,Su Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract In the last decade; spatio-temporal database research focuses on the design ofeffective and efficient indexing structures in support of location-based queries such aspredictive range queries and nearest neighbor queries. While a variety of indexingtechniques have been proposed to accelerate the processing of updates and queries; notmuch attention has been paid to the updating protocol; which is another important factoraffecting the system performance. In this paper; we propose a generic and adaptiveupdating protocol for moving object databases with less number of updates between objectsand the database server; thereby reducing the overall workload of the system. In contrast tothe approach adopted by most conventional moving object database systems where theexact locations and velocities last disclosed are used to predict their motions; we propose …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,2

The kNN query is one of thehardest problems on multi-dimensional data. It has been shown analytically andexperimentally that any algorithm using hierarchical index structure based on either space-or data-partitioning is less efficient than the naive method of sequentially checking everydata record (called the sequential scan) in high-dimensional spaces [4]. Some datadistributions including the uniform distribution are particularly hard cases [1]. The iDistanceis designed to process kNN queries in high-dimensional spaces efficiently and it isespecially good for skewed data distributions; which usually occur in real-life data sets. Foruniform data; the iDistance beats the sequential scan up to 30 dimensions as reported in …,*,2008,2
Optimizing continuous multijoin queries over distributed streams,Yongluan Zhou; Ying Yan; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Aoying Zhou,Many recently emerging applications; such as network management; financial monitoring;sensor networks; stock tickers etc; fueled the development of continuous query processingtechniques over data streams. In these applications; the data sources are typicallydistributed; eg the network hosts or routers in network management. Collecting all the datato a centralized server may not be cost-effective due to the high communication cost. Clearly;a distributed stream processing system is inevitable. Unlike traditional DBMS; where theprocessing in each node involves expensive I/O operations; stream processing systemsoften perform main memory operations. These operations are relatively inexpensive incomparison to the communication cost.

Compressing the index-a simple and yet efficient approximation approach to high-dimensional indexing,Shuguang Wang; Cui Yu; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract An efficient tunable high-dimensional indexing scheme called the iMinMax (θ) wasproposed to map high-dimensional data points into single dimension value based on theminimum or maximum values among all dimensions [7]. Unfortunately; the number of leafnodes needs to be scanned remains large. To reduce the number of leaf nodes; we proposeto use the compression technique proposed in the Vector Approximation File (VA-file)[10] torepresent vectors. We call the hybrid method; the iMinMax (θ)*. While the marriage is straightforward; the gain in performance is significant. In our extensive performance study; theresults clearly indicate that iMinMax (θ)* outperforms the original iMinMax (θ) index schemeand the VA-file. iMinMax (θ)* is also attractive from a practical view point for itsimplementation cost is only slightly higher than that of the original iMinMax (θ).

Resolving the bias in electronic medical records,Kaiping Zheng; Jinyang Gao; Kee Yuan Ngiam; Beng Chin Ooi; Wei Luen James Yip,Abstract Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are the most fundamental resources used inhealthcare data analytics. Since people visit hospital more frequently when they feel sickand doctors prescribe lab examinations when they feel necessary; we argue that there couldbe a strong bias in EMR observations compared with the hidden conditions of patients.Directly using such EMR for analytical tasks without considering the bias may lead tomisinterpretation. To this end; we propose a general method to resolve the bias bytransforming EMR to regular patient hidden condition series using a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) variant. Compared with the biased EMR series with irregular time stamps; theunbiased regular time series is much easier to be processed by most analytical models andyields better results.

We begin by classifying the shared schema ofeach peer into a taxonomy of relation categories and attribute categories. We then proposeour adaptive schema mapping by selectively probing the shared schema with query probes;which are generated by the classification rules. To improve the accuracy of schemamapping; we introduce the notion of confusion matrix and prior-knowledge.

Saverf: Towards efficient relevance feedback search,Heng Tao Shen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,In multimedia retrieval; a query is typically interactively refined towards the 'optimal'answersby exploiting user feedback. However; in existing work; in each iteration; the refined query isre-evaluated. This is not only inefficient but fails to exploit the answers that may be commonbetween iterations. In this paper; we introduce a new approach called SaveRF (Saverandom accesses in Relevance Feedback) for iterative relevance feedback search. SaveRFpredicts the potential candidates for the next iteration and maintains this small set forefficient sequential scan. By doing so; repeated candidate accesses can be saved; hencereducing the number of random accesses. In addition; efficient scan on the overlap beforethe search starts also tightens the search space with smaller pruning radius.

An efficient method for queries execution in a multi-user environment,Shen-Tat Goh; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,In a multi-user environment; multiple queries co-exist together in the system. Further; weobserve that these queries usually share common sub-queries or reference commonrelations. By using cached results from earlier queries; better performance as well as fasterevaluation of subsequent queries can be achieved. One promising concept that has beenrecently proposed is the cache-on-demand (CoD) schemes. CoD considersintermediate/final results of existing running queries as virtual caches; of which only thebeneficial ones are materialized for incoming queries. In this paper; we propose a novelCoD-based strategy called Integrated-CoD. Unlike existing CoD-based schemes thatoperate in two phases; Integrated-CoD integrates the two phases into one.

Efficient join processing using partial precomputation,Kian-Lee Tan; Cheng Hian Goh; Mong Li Lee; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract In this paper; we generalize conventional join indexes to a cluster-based join index;in which objects are grouped into clusters based on proximity. Each record of our join indexrepresents a pair of clusters in which the join condition is satisfied by some members of thecluster. This strategy is especially useful for spatial and high-dimensional databasesbecause of their typically large data volume and complex operations. Our approachleverages on the structure of R-trees by exploiting the internal nodes of an R-tree ineffectively determining the precomputed clusters which can be used in our join index. Byvarying the size of the cluster; we are able to fine-tune the join index to achieve a balancebetween update cost and retrieval cost to suit individual applications.

Scaling Distributed Transaction Processing and Recovery based on Dependency Logging,Chang Yao; Meihui Zhang; Qian Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Jiatao Xu,Abstract: DGCC protocol has been shown to achieve good performance on multi-core in-memory system. However; distributed transactions complicate the dependency resolution;and therefore; an effective transaction partitioning strategy is essential to reduce expensivemulti-node distributed transactions. During failure recovery; log must be examined from thelast checkpoint onwards and the affected transactions are re-executed based on the waythey are partitioned and executed.

UniAD: A Unified Ad Hoc Data Processing System,Xiaogang Shi; Bin Cui; Gillian Dobbie; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Instead of constructing complex declarative queries; many users prefer to write theirprograms using procedural code embedded with simple queries. Since many users are notexpert programmers or the programs are written in a rush; these programs usually exhibitpoor performance in practice and it is a challenge to automatically and efficiently optimizethese programs. In this article; we present UniAD; which stands for Unified execution for Adhoc Data processing; a system designed to simplify the programming of data processingtasks and provide efficient execution for user programs. We provide the background ofprogram semantics and propose a novel intermediate representation; called UnifiedIntermediate Representation (UniIR); which utilizes a simple and expressive mechanismHOQ to describe the operations performed in programs.

DTNC: A New Server-side Data Cleansing Framework for Cellular Trajectory Services,Jian Dai; Fei He; Wang-Chien Lee; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract: It is essential for the cellular network operators to provide cellular location servicesto meet the needs of their users and mobile applications. However; cellular locations;estimated by network-based methods at the server-side; bear with {\it high spatial errors}and {\it arbitrary missing locations}. Moreover; auxiliary sensor data at the client-side are notavailable to the operators. In this paper; we study the {\em cellular trajectory cleansingproblem} and propose an innovative data cleansing framework; namely\underline {D}ynamic\underline {T} ransportation\underline {N} etwork based\underline {C} leansing(DTNC) to improve the quality of cellular locations delivered in online cellular trajectoryservices.

Towards A Unified Graph Model for Supporting Data Management and Usable Machine Learning,Guoliang Li; Meihui Zhang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Data management and machine learning are two important tasks in data science.However; they have been independently studied so far. We argue that they should becomplementary to each other. On the one hand; machine learning requires datamanagement techniques to extract; integrate; clean the data; to support scalable and usablemachine learning; making it user-friendly and easily deployable. On the other hand; datamanagement relies on machine learning techniques to curate data and improve its quality.This requires database systems to treat machine learning algorithms as their basicoperators; or at the very least; optimizable stored procedures. It poses new challenges asmachine learning tasks tend be iterative and recursive in nature; and some models have tobe tweaked and retrained. This calls for a reexamination of database design to make it …,*,2017,*

PRAMOD: A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Supporting Efficient and Secure Database-as-a-Service.,Hung Dang; Tien Tuan Anh Dinh; Ee-Chien Chang; Beng Chin Ooi; Shruti Tople; Prateek Saxena,ABSTRACT Cloud providers are realizing the outsourced database model in the form ofdatabase-as-a-service offerings. However; security in terms of data privacy remains anobstacle because data storage and processing are performed on an untrusted cloud.Achieving strong security under additional constraints of functionality and performance iseven more challenging; for which advanced encryption and recent trusted computingprimitives alone prove insufficient. In this paper; we propose PRAMOD–a novel frameworkfor enabling efficient and secure database-as-a-service. We consider a setting in which datais stored encrypted on the untrusted cloud and data-dependent computations are performedinside a trusted environment. The proposed framework protects against leakage caused byobservable data movement between different components (due to limited secure memory …,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2015,*

CW2I: community data indexing for complex query processing,Mei Hui; Panagiotis Karras; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract The increasing popularity of Community Web Management Systems (CWMSs) callsfor tailor-made data management approaches for them. Still; existing CWMSs have mostlyfocused on simple similarity-based queries; they do not provide a framework for the efficientprocessing of more complex queries over community web data. In this paper; we propose atwo-way indexing scheme that facilitates efficient and scalable retrieval and complex queryprocessing with community data. A thorough experimental comparison; based on real-worlddata and practical queries; illustrates the advantages of our scheme compared to otherapproaches for community web data management. Besides; our double-indexing schemeprovides an attractive solution to the storage problem as well.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2010,*

GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION APPLICATIONS OVER THE NET,Fiona Lee; Cui Yu; Beng Chin Ooi,Summary The catalytic boost of critical mass usage of the World Wide Web (WWW) hasbrought about the shift in the traditional geographic information systems (GIS) paradigm andengendered new challenges and opportunities. The traditional GIS paradigm involves theuse of huge databases and large expensive GIS software packages confined to local disks.The new paradigm; however; enables geospatial data to be shared and accessible in theworld's information system; the Internet. Current states of the art for Web GIS applications areclient-side applications and server-side applications. Server-side applications create GISpages based on a user's query and request through a data form; while the client-side webGIS allows GIS analysis and data processing to be executed on the web browsers of theuser's local machine. In client-side applications; GIS data and analysis tools are sent as …,ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS-Volume I,2009,*

Data Engineering,Eui-Hong Han; George Karypis; Vipin Kumar; Bamshad Mobasher; Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) are rapidly evolving areas ofresearch that are at the intersection of several disciplines; including statistics; databases;pattern recognition/AI; optimization; visualization; and high-performance and parallelcomputing. The increased recent attention is primarily because many more people nowhave “databases”. This is turn is driven by two factors: the ever decreasing cost of computersand storage media; and the success of database systems in becoming a mainstay of manyactivities in business; science; and government. With the widespread use of databases andthe explosive growth in their sizes; individuals and organizations are faced with the problemof making use of this data.

A model using classes as a basic organization tool,Thong Wei Koh; Beng Chin Ooi; Yin Seong Ho,Abstract In this paper; we present a framework based on the notion of classes as anorganizational tool to model some common concepts in Database. The creation of a simpleand representational model helps to reconcile the seemingly different organization intraditional relational databases in the form of relations and classes in the newer objectoriented database. The paper also discusses the various issues of complex type structuresfaced in such a theoretical model including the idea of composite objects. The maincontribution of the paper is the introduction of the concept of α abstraction andapproximations of databases. This development of the mathematical model accommodatesthe idea of schemas; creation of views and retrieval.,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1993,*

Query optimization,Beng Chin Ooi,The query optimizer is an important component of a relational database managementsystem. Its main task is to produce an efficient query evaluation plan for a given query.However; most optimizers in existing systems have been designed for conventional datamodels which are not capable of supporting applications like CAD/CAM or geographic dataanalysis. This has led to the current trend of designing extensible DBMSs [BaM86; Fre87b;GrD87; LMP87; Loh87]. Although; it has been shown that this approach works for simplecases [GrD87] it remains to be proven that the optimizers produced by these extensibleDBMS provide efficient query evaluation for complex applications such as geographicinformation processing. In this chapter; we investigate an alternate method in which anexisting DBMS is supplemented by new indexing structures and evaluation subsystems in …,*,1990,*
Performance analysis and case studies,Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract The comparison between the skd-tree and the R-tree showed that the skd-tree is aneffective data structur for supporting both containment and intersection searches. For theimplementation of the skd-tree suggested in Section 4.4. 3; the dynamic skd-tree has similarstorage overhead; more efficient intersection search and for more effective containmentsearch. For the static implementation of the skd-trees and the R-trees; the containmentsearch of the skd-tree was more efficient and the other performance measurements weresimilar. Other extensions of the kd-tree proposed in the literature based on object duplicationand object mapping appear to be less effective than the skd-tree.,*,1990,*
The spatial kd-tree,Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Although kd-trees can be used to efficiently index point data; none of the previousproposed extensions; such as 4d-trees [BaK86] or mkd-trees [MHN84]; have proved to be anefficient spatial structure for non-zero sized objects. The major contribution of this chapter isthe proposal of a new kd-tree structure called the skd-tree. The algorithms for inserting;updating and searching the skd-tree have been presented. The skd-tree provides two typesof search; one of which is not directly supported by other existing structures. To do acontainment search using for for example R-trees [Gut84] or R+-trees [SRF87]; anintersection search is performed on the directory and containment testing is performed onlyon the leaf nodes.,*,1990,*

The data in each cluster are transformed into asingle dimensional space based on their similarity with respect to a reference point. Thisallows the points to be indexed using a BЗ-tree structure and KNN search be performedusing onedimensional range search. The choice of partition and reference point providesthe iDistance technique with degrees of freedom most other techniques do not have. Wedescribe how appropriate choices here can effectively adapt the index structure to the datadistribution. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the iDistance technique; andreport results demonstrating its effectiveness. l Introduction Many emerging database …,*,*,*
