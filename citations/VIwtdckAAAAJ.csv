Location privacy in mobile systems: A personalized anonymization model,Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,This paper describes a personalized k-anonymity model for protecting location privacyagainst various privacy threats through location information sharing. Our model has twounique features. First; we provide a unified privacy personalization framework to supportlocation k-anonymity for a wide range of users with context-sensitive personalized privacyrequirements. This framework enables each mobile node to specify the minimum level ofanonymity it desires as well as the maximum temporal and spatial resolutions it is willing totolerate when requesting for k-anonymity preserving location-based services (LBSs).Second; we devise an efficient message perturbation engine which runs by the locationprotection broker on a trusted server and performs location anonymization on mobile users'LBS request messages; such as identity removal and spatio-temporal cloaking of location …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2005.

XWRAP: An XML-enabled wrapper construction system for web information sources,Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Wei Han,The paper describes the methodology and the software development of XWRAP; an XML-enabled wrapper construction system for semi-automatic generation of wrapper programs.By XML-enabled we mean that the metadata about information content that are implicit in theoriginal Web pages will be extracted and encoded explicitly as XML tags in the wrappeddocuments. In addition; the query based content filtering process is performed against theXML documents. The XWRAP wrapper generation framework has three distinct features.First; it explicitly separates tasks of building wrappers that are specific to a Web source fromthe tasks that are repetitive for any source; and uses a component library to provide basicbuilding blocks for wrapper programs. Second; it provides a user friendly interface programto allow wrapper developers to generate their wrapper code with a few mouse clicks …,Data Engineering; 2000.

Continual queries for internet scale event-driven information delivery,Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Wei Tang,We introduce the concept of continual queries; describe the design of a distributed event-driven continual query system-OpenCQ; and outline the initial implementation of OpenCQon top of the distributed interoperable information mediation system DIOM. Continualqueries are standing queries that monitor update of interest and return results whenever theupdate reaches specified thresholds. In OpenCQ; users may specify to the system theinformation they would like to monitor (such as the events or the update thresholds they areinterested in). Whenever the information of interest becomes available; the systemimmediately delivers it to the relevant users; otherwise; the system continually monitors thearrival of the desired information and pushes it to the relevant users as it meets the specifiedupdate thresholds.

Supporting anonymous location queries in mobile environments with privacygrid,Bhuvan Bamba; Ling Liu; Peter Pesti; Ting Wang,Abstract This paper presents PrivacyGrid-a framework for supporting anonymous location-based queries in mobile information delivery systems. The PrivacyGrid framework offersthree unique capabilities. First; it provides a location privacy protection preference profilemodel; called location P3P; which allows mobile users to explicitly define their preferredlocation privacy requirements in terms of both location hiding measures (eg; location k-anonymity and location l-diversity) and location service quality measures (eg; maximumspatial resolution and maximum temporal resolution). Second; it provides fast and effectivelocation cloaking algorithms for location k-anonymity and location l-diversity in a mobileenvironment.

TrustMe: anonymous management of trust relationships in decentralized P2P systems,Aameek Singh; Ling Liu,Decentralized peer to peer (P2P) networks offer both opportunities and threats. Its open anddecentralized nature makes it extremely susceptible to malicious users spreading harmfulcontent like viruses; trojans or; even just wasting valuable resources of the network. In orderto minimize such threats; the use of community-based reputations as trust measurements isfast becoming a de-facto standard. The idea is to dynamically assign each peer a trust ratingbased on its performance in the network and store it at a suitable place. Any peer wishing tointeract with another peer can make an informed decision based on such a rating. Animportant challenge in managing such trust relationships are to design a protocol to securethe placement and access of these trust ratings. Surprisingly; all the related work in this areaeither support very limited anonymity or assume anonymity to be an undesired feature …,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2003.(P2P 2003). Proceedings.

TrustGuard: countering vulnerabilities in reputation management for decentralized overlay networks,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Li Xiong; Ling Liu,Abstract Reputation systems have been popular in estimating the trustworthiness andpredicting the future behavior of nodes in a large-scale distributed system where nodes maytransact with one another without prior knowledge or experience. One of the fundamentalchallenges in distributed reputation management is to understand vulnerabilities anddevelop mechanisms that can minimize the potential damages to a system by maliciousnodes. In this paper; we identify three vulnerabilities that are detrimental to decentralizedreputation management and propose TrustGuard-a safeguard framework for providing ahighly dependable and yet efficient reputation system.

Privacy preserving data classification with rotation perturbation,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Data perturbation techniques are one of the most popular models for privacy preserving datamining (Agrawal and Srikant; 2000; Aggarwal and Yu; 2004). It is especially convenient forapplications where the data owners need to export/publish the privacy-sensitive data. A dataperturbation procedure can be simply described as follows. Before the data owner publishesthe data; they randomly change the data in certain way to disguise the sensitive informationwhile preserving the particular data property that is critical for building the data models.Several perturbation techniques have been proposed recently; among which the mosttypical ones are randomization approach (Agrawal and Srikant; 2000) and condensationapproach (Aggarwal and Yu; 2004).,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,287

Purlieus: locality-aware resource allocation for MapReduce in a cloud,Balaji Palanisamy; Aameek Singh; Ling Liu; Bhushan Jain,We present Purlieus; a MapReduce resource allocation system aimed at enhancing theperformance of MapReduce jobs in the cloud. Purlieus provisions virtual MapReduceclusters in a locality-aware manner enabling MapReduce virtual machines (VMs) access toinput data and importantly; intermediate data from local or close-by physical machines. Wedemonstrate how this locality-awareness during both map and reduce phases of the job notonly improves runtime performance of individual jobs but also has an additional advantageof reducing network traffic generated in the cloud data center. This is accomplished using anovel coupling of; otherwise independent; data and VM placement steps. We conduct adetailed evaluation of Purlieus and demonstrate significant savings in network traffic andalmost 50% reduction in job execution times for a variety of workloads.,High Performance Computing; Networking; Storage and Analysis (SC); 2011 International Conference for,2011,227

ASAP: An adaptive sampling approach to data collection in sensor networks,Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu; S Yu Philip,One of the most prominent and comprehensive ways of data collection in sensor networks isto periodically extract raw sensor readings. This way of data collection enables complexanalysis of data; which may not be possible with in-network aggregation or queryprocessing. However; this flexibility in data analysis comes at the cost of powerconsumption. In this paper; we develop ASAP; which is an adaptive sampling approach toenergy-efficient periodic data collection in sensor networks. The main idea behind ASAP isto use a dynamically changing subset of the nodes as samplers such that the sensorreadings of the sampler nodes are directly collected; whereas the values of the nonsamplernodes are predicted through the use of probabilistic models that are locally and periodicallyconstructed.

Mobimix: Protecting location privacy with mix-zones over road networks,Balaji Palanisamy; Ling Liu,This paper presents MobiMix; a road network based mix-zone framework to protect locationprivacy of mobile users traveling on road networks. In contrast to spatial cloaking basedlocation privacy protection; the approach in MobiMix is to break the continuity of locationexposure by using mix-zones; where no applications can trace user movement. This papermakes two original contributions. First; we provide the formal analysis on the vulnerabilitiesof directly applying theoretical rectangle mix-zones to road networks in terms ofanonymization effectiveness and attack resilience. We argue that effective mix-zones shouldbe constructed and placed by carefully taking into consideration of multiple factors; such asthe geometry of the zones; the statistical behavior of the user population; the spatialconstraints on movement patterns of the users; and the temporal and spatial resolution of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,191
Free riding: A new challenge to peer-to-peer file sharing systems,Lakshmish Ramaswamy; Ling Liu,Most of the research in the field of peer-to-peer file sharing systems has concentrated onperformance issues such as efficient file lookup; replicating files to improve file downloadspeeds etc. However there is a new challenge that questions the very existence andusefulness of such systems in the form of" free riding". This paper studies the seriousness ofthe negative impact that free riding can have in a P2P file sharing system. We introduce theconcept of utility function to measure the usefulness of peers to the system as a whole; anddescribe a scheme based on this concept to control free riding. A simple utility function isdescribed to illustrate the scheme. We design and develop a simulation model to studyvarious patterns of sharing behaviors among the peers in a file sharing community and theirimpact on the system.

Hooking into object-oriented application frameworks,Gary Froehlich; H James Hoover; Ling Liu; Paul Sorenson,ABSTRACT An object-oriented application framework provides a generic design within agiven domain and a reusable implementation of that design. Frameworks have greatpotential for reuse; but that potential can only be achieved if the framework can beunderstood and used effectively by application developers. The complexity of the designand implementation of a framework can make understanding the framework difficult; and sogood documentation and guidance to the framework user is needed. Several methods existfor documenting the design of the framework; but less work has been done on documentingthe purpose of the framework and how it is intended to be used. In this paper; we introducethe concept of hooks as a means of documenting and providing guidance on the intendeduse of a framework.

Nanoscale fluid transport: size and rate effects,Xi Chen; Guoxin Cao; Aijie Han; Venkata K Punyamurtula; Ling Liu; Patricia J Culligan; Taewan Kim; Yu Qiao,The transport behavior of water molecules inside a model carbon nanotube is investigatedby using nonequilibrium molecular dynamcis (NMED) simulations. The shearing stressbetween the nanotube wall and the water molecules is identified as a key factor indetermining the nanofluidic properties. Due to the effect of nanoscale confinement; theeffective shearing stress is not only size sensitive but also strongly dependent on the fluidflow rate. Consequently; the nominal viscosity of the confined water decreases rapidly as thetube radius is reduced or when a faster flow rate is maintained. An infiltration experiment ona nanoporous carbon is performed to qualitatively validate these findings.,Nano letters,2008,180
Building trust in decentralized peer-to-peer electronic communities,Li Xiong; Ling Liu,Abstract Many players in electronic markets have to cope with much higher amount ofuncertainty as to quality and reliability of the products they buy and the information theyobtain from other peers in the respective online business communities. One way to addressthis uncertainty problem is to use information such as feedbacks about past experiences tohelp making recommendation and judgment on product quality and information reliability.This paper presents PeerTrust; a simple yet effective reputation-based trust mechanism forquantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of peers in a decentralized peer-to-peerelectronic marketplace. There are three main contributions in this paper. First; we argue thatthe trust models based solely on feedbacks from other peers in the community is inaccurateand ineffective.

Privacy-aware mobile services over road networks,Ting Wang; Ling Liu,Abstract Consider a mobile client who travels over roads and wishes to receive location-based services (LBS) from untrusted service providers. How might the user obtain suchservices without exposing her private position information? Meanwhile; how could theprivacy protection mechanism incur no disincentive; eg; excessive computation orcommunication cost; for any service provider or mobile user to participate in such a scheme?We detail this problem and present a general model for privacy-aware mobile services. Aseries of key features distinguish our solution from existing ones: a) it adopts the network-constrained mobility model (instead of the conventional random-waypoint model) to capturethe privacy vulnerability of mobile users; b) it regards the attack resilience (for mobile users)and the query-processing cost (for service providers) as two critical measures for …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,165
Vulnerabilities and security threats in structured overlay networks: A quantitative analysis,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,A number of recent applications have been built on distributed hash tables (DHTs) basedoverlay networks. Almost all DHT-based schemes employ a tight deterministic dataplacement and ID mapping schemes. This feature on one hand provides assurance onlocation of data if it exists; within a bounded number of hops; and on the other hand; opensdoors for malicious nodes to lodge attacks that can potentially thwart the functionality of theoverlay network. This paper studies several serious security threats in DHT-based systemsthrough two targeted attacks at the overlay network's protocol layer. The first attack exploresthe routing anomalies that can be caused by malicious nodes returning incorrect lookuproutes. The second attack targets the ID mapping scheme.

A distributed approach to node clustering in decentralized peer-to-peer networks,Lakshmish Ramaswamy; Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,Connectivity-based node clustering has wide-ranging applications in decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) networks such as P2P file sharing systems; mobile ad-hoc networks; P2P sensornetworks; and so forth. This paper describes a connectivity-based distributed nodeclustering scheme (CDC). This scheme presents a scalable and efficient solution fordiscovering connectivity-based clusters in peer networks. In contrast to centralized graphclustering algorithms; the CDC scheme is completely decentralized and it only assumes theknowledge of neighbor nodes instead of requiring a global knowledge of the network(graph) to be available. An important feature of the CDC scheme is its ability to cluster theentire network automatically or to discover clusters around a given set of nodes. To copewith the typical dynamics of P2P networks; we provide mechanisms to allow new nodes to …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2005,137

PINCO reduces redundancy in the datacollected from sensors; thereby decreasing the wireless communication among the sensornodes and saving energy. Sensor data is buffered in the network and combined through apipelined compression scheme into groups of data; while satisfying a user-specified end-to-end latency bound. We introduce a PINCO scheme for single-valued sensor readings. In thisscheme; each group of data is a highly flexible structure so that compressed data can berecompressed without decompressing; in order to reduce newly available redundancy at adifferent stage of the network.

Automatic detection of fragments in dynamically generated web pages,Lakshmish Ramaswamy; Arun Iyengar; Ling Liu; Fred Douglis,Abstract Dividing web pages into fragments has been shown to provide significant benefitsfor both content generation and caching. In order for a web site to use fragment-basedcontent generation; however; good methods are needed for dividing web pages intofragments. Manual fragmentation of web pages is expensive; error prone; and unscalable.This paper proposes a novel scheme to automatically detect and flag fragments that are cost-effective cache units in web sites serving dynamic content. We consider the fragments to beinteresting if they are shared among multiple documents or they have different lifetime orpersonalization characteristics. Our approach has three unique features. First; we propose ahierarchical and fragment-aware model of the dynamic web pages and a data structure thatis compact and effective for fragment detection. Second; we present an efficient algorithm …,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on World Wide Web,2004,117

We propose that selectivelypreserving only the task/model specific information in perturbation would improve thebalance. Geometric data perturbation; consisting of random rotation perturbation; randomtranslation perturbation; and noise addition; aims at preserving the important geometricproperties of a multidimensional dataset; while providing better privacy guarantee for dataclassification modeling.

TripleBit: a fast and compact system for large scale RDF data,Pingpeng Yuan; Pu Liu; Buwen Wu; Hai Jin; Wenya Zhang; Ling Liu,Abstract The volume of RDF data continues to grow over the past decade and many knownRDF datasets have billions of triples. A grant challenge of managing this huge RDF data ishow to access this big RDF data efficiently. A popular approach to addressing the problem isto build a full set of permutations of (S; P; O) indexes. Although this approach has shown toaccelerate joins by orders of magnitude; the large space overhead limits the scalability ofthis approach and makes it heavyweight. In this paper; we present TripleBit; a fast andcompact system for storing and accessing RDF data. The design of TripleBit has threesalient features.

RLM: A general model for trust representation and aggregation,Xiaofeng Wang; Ling Liu; Jinshu Su,Reputation-based trust systems provide important capability in open and service-orientedcomputing environments. Most existing trust models fail to assess the variance of areputation prediction. Moreover; the summation method; widely used for reputation feedbackaggregation; is vulnerable to malicious feedbacks. This paper presents a general trustmodel; called RLM; for a more comprehensive and robust reputation evaluation. Concretely;we define a comprehensive reputation evaluation method based on two attributes:reputation value and reputation prediction variance. The reputation predication varianceserves as a quality measure of the reputation value computed based on aggregation offeedbacks. For feedback aggregation; we propose the novel Kalman aggregation method;which can inherently support robust trust evaluation.

In this paper we present a novel semantic hashpartitioning approach and implement a Semantic HAsh Partitioning-Enabled distributed RDFdata management system; called Shape. This paper makes three original contributions.First; the semantic hash partitioning approach we propose extends the simple hashpartitioning method through direction-based triple groups and direction-based triplereplications. The latter enhances the former by controlled data replication through intelligentutilization of data access locality; such that queries over big RDF graphs can be …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,86
Differential evaluation of continual queries,Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Roger Barga; Tong Zhou,We define continual queries as a useful tool for monitoring of updated information. Continualqueries are standing queries that monitor the source data and notify the users whenevernew data matches the query. In addition to periodic refresh; continual queries includeEpsilon Transaction concepts to allow users to specify query refresh based on themagnitude of updates. To support efficient processing of continual queries; we propose adifferential re-evaluation algorithm (DRA); which exploits the structure and informationcontained in both the query expressions and the database update operations. The DRAdesign can be seen as a synthesis of previous research on differential files; incrementalview maintenance; and active databases.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1996.; Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on,1996,85
Pressurized liquid in nanopores: A modified Laplace-Young equation,Yu Qiao; Ling Liu; Xi Chen,In the current study; we analyze the motion of pressurized water molecules in nanopores ofa well-crystallized; hydrophobic zeolite using both experiment and molecular dynamicssimulation. It is discovered that; contradictory to the prediction of the classic Laplace-Youngequation; the required infiltration pressure is highly dependent on the infiltration volume. Amodified Laplace-Young equation is developed to take into consideration the effectivesolid− liquid interfacial tension; the thermal energy exchange; as well as the variation inconfiguration of confined liquid molecules. The last two factors are significant only when thenanopore diameter is comparable with the liquid molecule size. It is also remarkable that theinfiltrated liquid molecules; when confined in the nanoenvironment; could transform from asingle-chain conformation to a double-helical structure as the pressure increases …,Nano letters,2009,83
Mitigating application-level denial of service attacks on Web servers: A client-transparent approach,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Arun Iyengar; Jian Yin; Ling Liu,Abstract Recently; we have seen increasing numbers of denial of service (DoS) attacksagainst online services and Web applications either for extortion reasons or for impairingand even disabling the competition. These DoS attacks have increasingly targeted theapplication level. Application-level DoS attacks emulate the same request syntax andnetwork-level traffic characteristics as those of legitimate clients; thereby making the attacksmuch harder to detect and counter. Moreover; such attacks often target bottleneck resourcessuch as disk bandwidth; database bandwidth; and CPU resources. In this article; wepropose handling DoS attacks by using a twofold mechanism. First; we perform admissioncontrol to limit the number of concurrent clients served by the online service. Admissioncontrol is based on port hiding that renders the online service invisible to unauthorized …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2008,81
Guest editors' introduction: sensor-network applications,Johannes Gehrke; Ling Liu,Moore's law indicates that the num- ber of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every 18months. In a 1997 interview; Gordon Moore illus- trated this law with a real-world compar-ison: EO Wilson; an expert on ants; estimated that the global ant population is roughly 1017 —approximately the same as the number of transistors produced in that year alone (seewww.intel.com/press room/archive/speeches/gem93097.htm). This analogy demonstrates thegrowing pervasiveness of small-scale computing devices throughout the physical world; andthe wireless sensor network commu- nity is a driving force behind this. Novel instruments oftenmotivate new scientific discoveries; for example; using the Arecibo Telescope — the world's largestaperture telescope (the dish is 1;000 feet in diameter) — Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor discoveredthe first pulsar in a binary system; confirming the existence of gravitational radiation in …,IEEE Internet Computing,2006,81
Apoidea: A decentralized peer-to-peer architecture for crawling the world wide web,Aameek Singh; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu; Todd Miller,Abstract This paper describes a decentralized peer-to-peer model for building a Webcrawler. Most of the current systems use a centralized client-server model; in which the crawlis done by one or more tightly coupled machines; but the distribution of the crawling jobsand the collection of crawled results are managed in a centralized system using acentralized URL repository. Centralized solutions are known to have problems like linkcongestion; being a single point of failure; and expensive administration. It requires bothhorizontal and vertical scalability solutions to manage Network File Systems (NFS) and loadbalancing DNS and HTTP requests. In this paper; we present an architecture of a completelydistributed and decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) crawler called Apoidea; which is self-managing and uses geographical proximity of the web resources to the peers for a better …,Workshop on Distributed Information Retrieval,2003,81
Socialtrust: tamper-resilient trust establishment in online communities,James Caverlee; Ling Liu; Steve Webb,Abstract Web 2.0 promises rich opportunities for information sharing; electronic commerce;and new modes of social interaction; all centered around the" social Web" of user-contributed content; social annotations; and person-to-person social connections. But theincreasing reliance on this" social Web" also places individuals and their computer systemsat risk; creating opportunities for malicious participants to exploit the tight social fabric ofthese networks. With these problems in mind; we propose the SocialTrust framework fortamper-resilient trust establishment in online communities. SocialTrust provides communityusers with dynamic trust values by (i) distinguishing relationship quality from trust;(ii)incorporating a personalized feedback mechanism for adapting as the community evolves;and (iii) tracking user behavior. We experimentally evaluate the SocialTrust framework …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries,2008,80
What where wi: An analysis of millions of wi-fi access points,Kipp Jones; Ling Liu,With the growing demand for wireless Internet access and increasing maturity of IEEE802.11 technologies; wireless networks have sprung up by the millions throughout the worldas a popular means for Internet access. An increasingly popular use of Wi-Fi networkingequipment is to provide wireless' hotspots' as the wireless access points (APs) to theInternet. These APs are installed and managed by individuals and businesses in anunregulated manner-allowing anyone to install and operate one of these devices usingunlicensed radio spectrum. This has allowed literally millions of these APs to becomeavailable and'visible'to any interested party who happens to be within range of the radiowaves emitted from the device. As the density of these APs increases; these'beacons' can beput into multiple uses. From home networking to wireless positioning to mesh networks …,Portable Information Devices; 2007. PORTABLE07.

Enhanced monitoring-as-a-service for effective cloud management,Shicong Meng; Ling Liu,This paper introduces the concept of monitoring-as-a-service (MaaS); its main components;and a suite of key functional requirements of MaaS in cloud. We argue that MaaS shouldsupport not only the conventional state monitoring capabilities; such as instantaneousviolation detection; periodical state monitoring; and single tenant monitoring; but alsoperformance-enhanced functionalities that can optimize on monitoring cost; scalability; andthe effectiveness of monitoring service consolidation and isolation. In this paper; we presentthree enhanced MaaS capabilities and show that window-based state monitoring is not onlymore resilient to noises and outliers; but also saves considerable communication cost.Similarly; violation-likelihood-based state monitoring can dynamically adjust monitoringintensity based on the likelihood of detecting important events; leading to significant gain …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2013,77
Infiltration of electrolytes in molecular-sized nanopores,Ling Liu; Xi Chen; Weiyi Lu; Aijie Han; Yu Qiao,Abstract In both experiment and molecular simulation; it is found that a higher pressure isrequired to sustain the infiltration of smaller ions in a molecular-sized nanochannel.Simulations indicate that the effective ion solubility of the infiltrated liquid is reduced tonearly zero. Because of the strong interactions between the ion couples and the solid orliquid phases; an external force is required to continuously advance the confined liquidsegment. The competition between the probability of ion entry and ion-couple formationcauses the observed ion-size-dependent characteristics.,Physical review letters,2009,77
An adaptive approach to query mediation across heterogeneous information sources,Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Yooshin Lee,The authors propose a query mediation framework to support customizable informationgathering across heterogeneous and autonomous information sources. Instead of anintegrated (and static) global schema; they propose an adaptive approach to interoperabilitywhich allows information consumers to represent their queries based on the customizedpersonal view rather than at system-defined integrated view. The query mediationframework consists of five steps: query routing; query decomposition; parallel access plangeneration; subquery translation and execution; and query result assembly. Concreteexamples illustrate the challenges arising from heterogeneity in these five steps and how theframework scales up as the number of information sources grow and evolve.,Cooperative Information Systems; 1996.

Geometric data perturbation for privacy preserving outsourced data mining,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Abstract Data perturbation is a popular technique in privacy-preserving data mining. A majorchallenge in data perturbation is to balance privacy protection and data utility; which arenormally considered as a pair of conflicting factors. We argue that selectively preserving thetask/model specific information in perturbation will help achieve better privacy guaranteeand better data utility. One type of such information is the multidimensional geometricinformation; which is implicitly utilized by many data-mining models. To preserve thisinformation in data perturbation; we propose the Geometric Data Perturbation (GDP)method. In this paper; we describe several aspects of the GDP method. First; we show thatseveral types of well-known data-mining models will deliver a comparable level of modelquality over the geometrically perturbed data set as over the original data set. Second; we …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2011,75
POESIA: An ontological workflow approach for composing Web services in agriculture,Renato Fileto; Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Eduardo Delgado Assad; Claudia Bauzer Medeiros,Abstract. This paper describes the POESIA approach to systematic composition of Webservices. This pragmatic approach is strongly centered in the use of domain-specificmultidimensional ontologies. Inspired by applications needs and founded on ontologies;workflows; and activity models; POESIA provides well-defined operations (aggregation;specialization; and instantiation) to support the composition of Web services. POESIAcomplements current proposals for Web services definition and composition by providing ahigher degree of abstraction with verifiable consistency properties. We illustrate the POESIAapproach using a concrete application scenario in agroenvironmental planning.,The VLDB Journal,2003,73
Automatic fragment detection in dynamic web pages and its impact on caching,Lakshmish Ramaswamy; Ling Liu; F Douglis,Constructing Web pages from fragments has been shown to provide significant benefits forboth content generation and caching. In order for a Web site to use fragment-based contentgeneration; however; good methods are needed for fragmenting the Web pages. Manualfragmentation of Web pages is expensive; error prone; and unscalable. This paper proposesa novel scheme to automatically detect and flag fragments that are cost-effective cache unitsin Web sites serving dynamic content. Our approach analyzes Web pages with respect totheir information sharing behavior; personalization characteristics; and change patterns. Weidentify fragments which are shared among multiple documents or have different lifetime orpersonalization characteristics. Our approach has three unique features. First; we propose aframework for fragment detection; which includes a hierarchical and fragment-aware …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data engineering,2005,72
Probe; cluster; and discover: Focused extraction of qa-pagelets from the deep web,James Caverlee; Ling Liu; David Buttler,We introduce the concept of a QA-Pagelet to refer to the content region in a dynamic pagethat contains query matches. We present THOR; a scalable and efficient mining system fordiscovering and extracting QA-Pagelets from the deep Web. A unique feature of THOR is itstwo-phase extraction framework. In the first phase; pages from a deep Web site are groupedinto distinct clusters of structurally-similar pages. In the second phase; pages from eachpage cluster are examined through a subtree filtering algorithm that exploits the structuraland content similarity at subtree level to identify the QA-Pagelets.,Data Engineering; 2004.

VISTA: Validating and refining clusters via visualization,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Clustering is an important technique for understanding of large multidimensional datasets.Most of clustering research to date has been focused on developing automatic clusteringalgorithms and cluster validation methods. The automatic algorithms are known to work wellin dealing with clusters of regular shapes; for example; compact spherical shapes; but mayincur higher error rates when dealing with arbitrarily shaped clusters. Although some effortshave been devoted to addressing the problem of skewed datasets; the problem of handlingclusters with irregular shapes is still in its infancy; especially in terms of dimensionality of thedatasets and the precision of the clustering results considered. Not surprisingly; thestatistical indices works ineffective in validating clusters of irregular shapes; too. In thispaper; we address the problem of clustering and validating arbitrarily shaped clusters …,Information Visualization,2004,71
Who is your neighbor: Net i/o performance interference in virtualized clouds,Xing Pu; Ling Liu; Yiduo Mei; Sankaran Sivathanu; Younggyun Koh; Calton Pu; Yuanda Cao,User-perceived performance continues to be the most important QoS indicator in cloud-based data centers today. Effective allocation of virtual machines (VMs) to handle both CPUintensive and I/O intensive workloads is a crucial performance management capability invirtualized clouds. Although a fair amount of researches have dedicated to measuring andscheduling jobs among VMs; there still lacks of in-depth understanding of performancefactors that impact the efficiency and effectiveness of resource multiplexing and schedulingamong VMs. In this paper; we present the experimental research on performanceinterference in parallel processing of CPU-intensive and network-intensive workloads onXen virtual machine monitor (VMM). Based on our study; we conclude with five key findingswhich are critical for effective performance management and tuning in virtualized clouds …,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,2013,68
Processing moving queries over moving objects using motion-adaptive indexes,Bugra Gedik; Kun-Lung Wu; Philip S Yu; Ling Liu,This paper describes a motion-adaptive indexing scheme for efficient evaluation of movingcontinual queries (MCQs) over moving objects. It uses the concept of motion-sensitivebounding boxes (MSBs) to model moving objects and moving queries. These boundingboxes automatically adapt their sizes to the dynamic motion behaviors of individual objects.Instead of indexing frequently changing object positions; we index less frequently changingobject and query MSBs; where updates to the bounding boxes are needed only whenobjects and queries move across the boundaries of their boxes. This helps decrease thenumber of updates to the indexes. More importantly; we use predictive query results tooptimistically precalculate query results; decreasing the number of searches on the indexes.Motion-sensitive bounding boxes are used to incrementally update the predictive query …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,68

We show how our system is used by a geneticist for solvingthe problem of discovering the so-called" co-regulated" genes by interlinking data andcomputation from several Web sites; local computations; as well as local and remotedatabases. The main distinctive features of our system (compared; eg; to the ZOOenvironment (Ioannidis et al.; 1996)) include:(i) executable workflows run as Webservices;(ii) abstract workflows employ concept names and semantic types that are higher-level (and thus more" scientist friendly") than executable workflows; and (iii) our systemsupports automatic translation of the latter into the former.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2003. 15th International Conference on,2003,68
Adaptive load shedding for windowed stream joins,Buğgra Gedik; Kun-Lung Wu; Philip S Yu; Ling Liu,Abstract We present an adaptive load shedding approach for windowed stream joins. Incontrast to the conventional approach of dropping tuples from the input streams; we explorethe concept of selective processing for load shedding. We allow stream tuples to be stored inthe windows and shed excessive CPU load by performing the join operations; not on theentire set of tuples within the windows; but on a dynamically changing subset of tuples thatare learned to be highly beneficial. We support such dynamic selective processing throughthree forms of runtime adaptations: adaptation to input stream rates; adaptation to timecorrelation between the streams and adaptation to join directions. Indexes are used tofurther speed up the execution of stream joins. Experiments are conducted to evaluate ouradaptive load shedding in terms of output rate. The results show that our selective …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,67

Preserving data privacy in outsourcing data aggregation services,Li Xiong; Subramanyam Chitti; Ling Liu,Abstract Advances in distributed service-oriented computing and Internet technology haveformed a strong technology push for outsourcing and information sharing. There is anincreasing need for organizations to share their data across organization boundaries bothwithin the country and with countries that may have lesser privacy and security standards.Ideally; we wish to share certain statistical data and extract the knowledge from the privatedatabases without revealing any additional information of each individual database apartfrom the aggregate result that is permitted. In this article; we describe two scenarios foroutsourcing data aggregation services and present a set of decentralized peer-to-peerprotocols for supporting data sharing across multiple private databases while minimizing thedata disclosure among individual parties.

However; nding the right information in the midst of thismountain of data has been likened to nding the proverbial needle in a haystack. Commonlyused search engines (eg; AltaVista) and directory services (eg; Yahoo) have practical butlimited success. The exponential growth of the Web is increasing the haystack rapidly.Instead of pull-based browsing; update monitoring is a promising area of research where thesystem brings the right information to the right user at the right time.

A random rotation perturbation approach to privacy preserving data classification,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Abstract This paper presents a random rotation perturbation approach for privacy preservingdata classification. Concretely; we identify the importance of classification-specificinformation with respect to the loss of information factor; and present a random rotationperturbation framework for privacy preserving data classification. Our approach has twounique characteristics. First; we identify that many classification models utilize the geometricproperties of datasets; which can be preserved by geometric rotation. We prove that thethree types of classifiers will deliver the same performance over the rotation perturbeddataset as over the original dataset. Second; we propose a multi-column privacy model toaddress the problems of evaluating privacy quality for multidimensional perturbation. Withthis metric; we develop a local optimal algorithm to find the good rotation perturbation in …,*,2005,63

In this paper; we arguethat it is important for both cloud consumers and cloud providers to understand the variousfactors that may have significant impact on the performance of applications running in avirtualized cloud. This paper presents an extensive performance study of network I/Oworkloads in a virtualized cloud environment. We first show that current implementation ofvirtual machine monitor (VMM) does not provide sufficient performance isolation toguarantee the effectiveness of resource sharing across multiple virtual machine instances(VMs) running on a single physical host machine; especially when applications running onneighboring VMs are competing for computing and communication resources.

Sharoes: A data sharing platform for outsourced enterprise storage environments,Aameek Singh; Ling Liu,With fast paced growth of digital data and exploding storage management costs; enterprisesare looking for new ways to effectively manage their data. One such cost-effective paradigmis the Storage-as-a-Service model; in which enterprises outsource their storage to a storageservice provider (SSP) by storing data at a remote SSP-managed site and accessing it overa high speed network. Often for a variety of reasons; enterprises find it unacceptable to fullytrust the SSP and prefer to store data in an encrypted form. This typically limits collaborationand data sharing among enterprise users due to complex key management and accesscontrol challenges. In this paper; we propose a platform called SHAROES that provides datasharing capability over such outsourced storage environments.

Secure event dissemination in publish-subscribe networks,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Secure event dissemination in a pub-sub network refers to secure distribution of events toclients subscribing to those events without revealing the secret attributes in the event to theunauthorized subscribers and the routing nodes in a pub-sub network. A common solution toprovide confidentiality guarantees for the secret attributes in an event is to encrypt so thatonly authorized subscribers can read them. The key challenge here is to build a secure andscalable content-based event dissemination infrastructure that can handle complex andflexible subscription models while preserving the efficiency and scalability of keymanagement algorithms.

Efficient and high-quality clustering of large datasets continues to beone of the most important problems in large-scale data analysis. A commonly usedmethodology for cluster analysis on large datasets is the three-phase framework ofsampling/summarization; iterative cluster analysis; and disk-labeling. There are three knownproblems with this framework which demand effective solutions.

Mechanical performance of laminated composites incorporated with nanofibrous membranes,L Liu; Z-M Huang; CL He; XJ Han,Abstract The effect of non-woven nanofibrous membranes as interlaminar interfaces on themechanical performance of laminated composites was investigated experimentally. Thenanofibrous membranes are porous; thin and lightweight; and exhibit toughness andstrength to some extent. They give little increase in weight and thickness when incorporatedinto a laminate. More important; they can be used as a functional agent carrier for thelaminate. The nanofiber membranes used in this paper were prepared by electrospinning ofNylon-6 (PA6); Epoxy 609 (EPO 1691-410) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU); with athickness ranging from 20 to 150 μm. The non-woven fabrics were attached to one side of aglass/epoxy fabric lamina prior to lamination and each fabric was arranged in between twoadjacent plies of the laminate.

Resilient trust management for web service integration,Sungkeun Park; Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Jianjun Zhang,In a distributed Web service integration environment; the selection of Web services shouldbe based on their reputation and quality-of-service (QoS). Various trust models for webservices have been proposed to evaluate the reputation of Web services/service providers.Current mechanisms are based on tracing the feedbacks to the past behaviors of Webservices. However; very few of them consider the robustness and attack-resiliency of thetrust models. In this paper; we present an attack resilient distributed trust managementsystem in a Web service management environment. The proposed attack resilient trustmodel uses two vectors to capture the behavior and the trustworthiness of a Webservice/service provider based on our analysis on the possible attacks against the trustmodels.

Using object-oriented frameworks,Garry Froehlich; H James Hoover; Ling Liu; Paul Sorenson,Often it is di cult to reuse a software component outside of its original context. Object-oriented frameworks can provide the context in which the component is meant to be reusedand thus allow for a signi cant amount of reuse. An object-oriented framework is thereusable design of a system or subsystem implemented through a collection of concrete andabstract classes and their collaborations Beck and Johnson; 1994. The concrete classesprovide the reusable components; while the design provides the context in which they areused. A framework is more than a collection of reusable components. It provides a genericsolution to a set of similar problems within an application domain. The framework itself isincomplete and provides places called hooks at which users can add their own componentsspeci c to a particular application.

Pressure-driven water infiltration into carbon nanotube: The effect of applied charges,Ling Liu; Yu Qiao; Xi Chen,Pressure-driven liquid infiltration into hydrophobic nanoporous solids has importantapplications for energy absorption. Using water infiltration into a carbon nanotube as amodel system; here we show from molecular dynamics simulation that with applied charges;the effective degree of hydrophobicity can be increased; which leads to an improvedadjustability of energy absorption efficiency. The attractions exerted by the charges canfacilitate initial water infiltration; but they may also stick the molecules and effectively blockthe pathways of subsequent water entrance. Higher pressure is thus needed to infiltratewater into the tube when external charges (or electrical fields) are applied.,Applied Physics Letters,2008,54

Human phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase produces the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate,Jing Fan; Xin Teng; Ling Liu; Katherine R Mattaini; Ryan E Looper; Matthew G Vander Heiden; Joshua D Rabinowitz,Human d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH); the first enzyme in the serinebiosynthetic pathway; is genomically amplified in tumors including breast cancer andmelanoma. In PHGDH-amplified cancer cells; knockdown of PHGDH is not fully rescued byexogenous serine; suggesting possible additional growth-promoting roles for the enzyme.Here we show that; in addition to catalyzing oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate; PHGDHcatalyzes NADH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate (AKG) to the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG). Knockdown of PHGDH decreased cellular 2HG by approximately50% in the PHGDH-amplified breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 (normal concentration93 μM) and BT-20 (normal concentration 35 μM) and overexpression of PHGDH increasedcellular 2HG by over 2-fold in non-PHGDH-amplified MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells …,ACS chemical biology,2014,53
Adaptive data migration in multi-tiered storage based cloud environment,Gong Zhang; Lawrence Chiu; Ling Liu,Multi-tiered storage systems today are integrating Solid State Disks (SSD) on top oftraditional rotational hard disks for performance enhancement due to the significant IOimprovements in SSD technology. It is widely recognized that automated data migrationbetween SSD and HDD plays a critical role in effective integration of SSD into multi-tieredstorage systems. Furthermore; effective data migration has to take into account of applicationspecific workload characteristics; deadlines; and IO profiles. An important and interestingchallenge for automated data migration in multi-tiered storage systems is how to fullyrelease the power of data migration while guaranteeing the migration deadline is critical tomaximizing the performance of SSD-enabled multi-tiered storage system.

Modeling images for content-based queries: The DISIMA approach,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu; Ling Liu; Xiaobo Li; John Z Li; Youping Niu; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract The DISIMA project aims at building a complete image database system enablingcontent-based querying. The model; the architecture and a query language have beendefined. The prototype is being implemented on top of the ObjectStore DBMS. DISIMAproposes a model for both image and spatial applications. The DISIMA model allows theuser to assign different semantics to an image component (semantic independence) and animage representation can be changed without any effect on applications using it(representation independence). The architecture involves different image sources includingWWW-servers and file systems.

State monitoring in cloud datacenters,Shicong Meng; Ling Liu; Ting Wang,Monitoring global states of a distributed cloud application is a critical functionality for clouddatacenter management. State monitoring requires meeting two demanding objectives: highlevel of correctness; which ensures zero or low error rate; and high communicationefficiency; which demands minimal communication cost in detecting state updates. Mostexisting work follows an instantaneous model which triggers state alerts whenever aconstraint is violated. This model may cause frequent and unnecessary alerts due tomomentary value bursts and outliers. Countermeasures of such alerts may further causeproblematic operations. In this paper; we present a WIndow-based StatE monitoring (WISE)framework for efficiently managing cloud applications. Window-based state monitoringreports alerts only when state violation is continuous within a time window. We show that …,IEEE transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,51
Query routing in large-scale digital library systems,Ling Liu,Modern digital libraries require user-friendly and yet responsive access to the rapidlygrowing; heterogeneous; and distributed collection of information sources. The increasingvolume and diversity of digital information available online have led to a growing problemthat conventional data management systems do not have; namely finding which informationsources out of many candidate choices are the most relevant to answer a given user query. Itrefer to this problem as the query routing problem. In this paper we introduce the notationand issues of query routing; and present a practical solution for designing a scalable queryrouting system based on multilevel progressive pruning strategies. The key idea is to createand maintain user query profiles and source capability profiles independently; and toprovide algorithms that can dynamically discover relevant information sources for a given …,Data Engineering; 1999.

An XJML-based wrapper generator for Web information extraction,Ling Liu; Wei Han; David Buttler; Calton Pu; Wei Tang,There has been tremendous interest in information integration systems that auto: maticallygather; manipulate; and integrate data from multiple information sources on a user's behalf.Unfortunately; web sites are primarily designed for human browsing rather than for use by acomputer program. Mechanically extracting their content is in general a rather difficult job ifnot impossible [4]. Software systems using such web informa. tion sources typically usehand-coded wrappers to extract information content of interest from web sources andtranslate query responses to a more structured format (eg; relational form) before unifyingthem into an integrated answer to a. user's query. The most recent generation of informationmediator systems (eg; Ariadne [3]; CQ [5; 71; Internet Softbots [4]; TSIMMIS [2]) addressesthis problem by enabling a pre-wrapped set of web sources to be accessed via database …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,48

The mainfeature of the CQ project is a “personalized update monitoring” toolkit based on continualqueries [3]. Comparing with the pure pull (such as DBMSs; various web search engines) andpure push (such as Pointcast; Marimba; Broadcast disks) technology; the CQ project can beseen as a hybrid approach that combines the pull and push technology by supportingpersonalized update monitoring through a combined client-pull and server-push paradigm.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,48
Eventguard: A system architecture for securing publish-subscribe networks,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu; Arun Iyengar,Abstract Publish-subscribe (pub-sub) is an emerging paradigm for building a large numberof distributed systems. A wide area pub-sub system is usually implemented on an overlaynetwork infrastructure to enable information dissemination from publishers to subscribers.Using an open overlay network raises several security concerns such as: confidentiality andintegrity; authentication; authorization and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In this article wepresent EventGuard; a framework for building secure wide-area pub-sub systems. TheEventGuard architecture is comprised of three key components:(1) a suite of security guardsthat can be seamlessly plugged-into a content-based pub-sub system;(2) a scalable keymanagement algorithm to enforce access control on subscribers; and (3) a resilient pub-subnetwork design that is capable of scalable routing; handling message dropping-based …,ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS),2011,47
Countering web spam with credibility-based link analysis,James Caverlee; Ling Liu,Abstract We introduce the concept of link credibility; identify the conflation of page qualityand link credibility in popular Web link analysis algorithms; and discuss how to decouple linkcredibility from page quality. Our credibility-based link analysis exhibits three distinctfeatures. First; we develop several techniques for semi-automatically assessing linkcredibility for all Web pages. Second; our link credibility assignment algorithms allow usersto assess credibility in a personalized manner. Third; we develop a novel credibility-basedWeb ranking algorithm-CredibleRank-which incorporates credibility information directly intothe quality assessment of each page on the Web. Our experimental study shows that ourapproach is significantly and consistently more spam-resilient than both PageRank andTrustRank.,Proceedings of the twenty-sixth annual ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing,2007,47
Methodical restructuring of complex workflow activities,Ling Liu; Calton Pu,We describe a family of activity-split and activity-join operations with a notion of validity. Thekey idea of introducing the set of activity-split and activity-join operations is to allow users torestructure ongoing activities in anticipation of uncertainty so that any significantperformance loss due to unexpected unavailablity or delay of shared resources can beavoided or reduced through release of early committed resources or transferring ownershipof uncommitted resources. To guarantee the correctness of new activities generated byactivity-split or activity-join operations; we define the notion of validity of activity restructuringoperations and identify the cases where the correctness is ensured and the cases whereactivity-split or activity-join are illegal due to the inconsistency incurred.,Data Engineering; 1998.

Search-as-a-service: Outsourced search over outsourced storage,Aameek Singh; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Abstract With fast-paced growth of digital data and exploding storage management costs;enterprises are looking for new ways to effectively manage their data. One such cost-effective paradigm is the cloud storage model also referred to as Storage-as-a-Service; inwhich enterprises outsource their storage to a storage service provider (SSP) by storing data(usually encrypted) at a remote SSP-managed site and accessing it over a high speednetwork. Along with storage capacity used; the SSP often charges clients on the amount ofdata that is accessed from the SSP site. Thus; it is in the interest of the client enterprise todownload only relevant content. This makes search over outsourced storage an importantcapability. Searching over encrypted outsourced storage; however; is a complex challenge.Each enterprise has different access privileges for different users and this access control …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2009,45

Information monitoring on the web: a scalable solution,Ling Liu; Wei Tang; David Buttler; Calton Pu,Abstract This paper presents WebCQ; a continual query system for large-scale Webinformation monitoring. WebCQ is designed to discover and detect changes to Web pagesefficiently; and to notify users of interesting changes with personalized messages. Users'Web page monitoring requests are modeled as continual queries on the Web and referred toas Web page sentinels. The system consists of five main components: a change detectionrobot that discovers and detects changes; a proxy cache service that reduces thecommunication traffics to the original information provider on the remote server; a triggerevaluation tool that can filter only the changes that match certain thresholds; a personalizedchange presentation tool that highlights Web page changes; and a change notificationservice that displays and delivers interesting changes and fresh information to the right …,World Wide Web,2002,44
Neat: Road network aware trajectory clustering,Binh Han; Ling Liu; Edward Omiecinski,Mining trajectory data has been gaining significant interest in recent years. However;existing approaches to trajectory clustering are mainly based on density and Euclideandistance measures. We argue that when the utility of spatial clustering of mobile objecttrajectories is targeted at road network aware location based applications; density andEuclidean distance are no longer the effective measures. This is because traffic flows in aroad network and the flow-based density characterization become important factors forfinding interesting trajectory clusters of mobile objects travelling in road networks. In thispaper; we propose NEAT-a road network aware approach for fast and effective clustering ofspatial trajectories of mobile objects travelling in road networks. Our method takes intoaccount the physical constraints of the road network; the network proximity and the traffic …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2012 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2012,43
Privacy-preserving multiparty collaborative mining with geometric data perturbation,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,In multiparty collaborative data mining; participants contribute their own data sets and hopeto collaboratively mine a comprehensive model based on the pooled data set. How toefficiently mine a quality model without breaching each party's privacy is the majorchallenge. In this paper; we propose an approach based on geometric data perturbation anddata mining service-oriented framework. The key problem of applying geometric dataperturbation in multiparty collaborative mining is to securely unify multiple geometricperturbations that are preferred by different parties; respectively. We have developed threeprotocols for perturbation unification. Our approach has three unique features compared tothe existing approaches: with geometric data perturbation; these protocols can work formany existing popular data mining algorithms; while most of other approaches are only …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2009,43
Still jumping on the balance beam: Continued use of perceptual motor programs in Australian schools,Jennifer Stephenson; Mark Carter; Kevin Wheldall,Perceptual motor programs (PMPs) are used widely in Australian schools. This study reportson an analysis of the information about the uses and the rationales for these programsdrawn from the websites of Australian schools. Wide-ranging claims are made for thebenefits of these programs for students with difficulties and for typically developing studentsbut there is evidence that they are not effective in improving academic and other skills.Although the survey is limited to 117 schools with websites that mention PMPs; the uncriticalacceptance of these programs by schools and teachers is of concern. Calls are made forprofessional bodies; teacher training institutions and government departments concernedwith education to disseminate clear guidelines on effective interventions to schools andteachers.,Australian journal of Education,2007,43
Process mining by measuring process block similarity,Joonsoo Bae; James Caverlee; Ling Liu; Hua Yan,Abstract Mining; discovering; and integrating process-oriented services has attractedgrowing attention in the recent years. Workflow precedence graph and workflow blockstructures are two important factors for comparing and mining processes based on distancesimilarity measure. Some existing work has done on comparing workflow designs based ontheir precedence graphs. However; there lacks of standard distance metrics for comparingworkflows that contain complex block structures such as parallel OR; parallel AND. In thispaper we present a quantitative approach to modeling and capturing the similarity anddissimilarity between different workflow designs; focusing on similarity and dissimilaritybetween the block structures of different workflow designs. We derive the distance-basedsimilarity measures by analyzing the workflow block structure of the participating workflow …,International Conference on Business Process Management,2006,43
Attack-resilient mix-zones over road networks: architecture and algorithms,Balaji Palanisamy; Ling Liu,Continuous exposure of location information; even with spatially cloaked resolution; maylead to breaches of location privacy due to statistics-based inference attacks. An alternativeand complementary approach to spatial cloaking based location anonymization is to breakthe continuity of location exposure by introducing techniques; such as mix-zones; where noapplication can trace user movements. Several factors impact on the effectiveness of mix-zone approach; such as user population; mix-zone geometry; location sensing rate andspatial resolution; as well as spatial and temporal constraints on user movement patterns.However; most of the existing mix-zone proposals fail to provide effective mix-zoneconstruction and placement algorithms that are resilient to timing and transition attacks.

Reliable state monitoring in cloud datacenters,Shicong Meng; Arun K Iyengar; Isabelle M Rouvellou; Ling Liu; Kisung Lee; Balaji Palanisamy; Yuzhe Tang,State monitoring is widely used for detecting critical events and abnormalities of distributedsystems. As the scale of such systems grows and the degree of workload consolidationincreases in Cloud data centers; node failures and performance interferences; especiallytransient ones; become the norm rather than the exception. Hence; distributed statemonitoring tasks are often exposed to impaired communication caused by such dynamics ondifferent nodes. Unfortunately; existing distributed state monitoring approaches are oftendesigned under the assumption of always-online distributed monitoring nodes and reliableinter-node communication. As a result; these approaches often produce misleading resultswhich in turn introduce various problems to Cloud users who rely on state monitoring resultsto perform automatic management tasks such as auto-scaling.

Hierarchical clustering of business process models,Jae-Yoon Jung; Joonsoo Bae; Ling Liu,Abstract Business process is collection of standardized and structured tasks inducing valuecreation of a company. Nowadays; it is recognized as one of significant intangible businessassets to achieve competitive advantages. We introduce a novel approach to businessprocess analysis; which has more and more significance as process-aware informationsystems are spreading widely over a lot of companies. In this paper; a methodology ofbusiness process clustering based on process similarity is proposed. The purpose ofbusiness process clustering is to analyze accumulated process models in order to assistnew process design or process reengineering. The proposed methodology exploitsstructural similarity metrics of business processes. We illustrated the methodology withexample processes in inducing the hierarchical merged models from the process clusters.,International Journal of Innovative Computing; Information and Control,2009,42
Can indentation technique measure unique elastoplastic properties?,Ling Liu; Nagahisa Ogasawara; Norimasa Chiba; Xi Chen,Abstract Indentation is widely used to extract material elastoplastic properties frommeasured force-displacement curves. Many previous studies argued or implied that such ameasurement is unique and the whole material stress-strain curve can be measured. Herewe show that first; for a given indenter geometry; the indentation test cannot effectively probematerial plastic behavior beyond a critical strain; and thus the solution of the reverseanalysis of the indentation force-displacement curve is nonunique beyond such a criticalstrain. Secondly; even within the critical strain; pairs of mystical materials can exist that haveessentially identical indentation responses (with differences below the resolution ofpublished indentation techniques) even when the indenter angle is varied over a largerange. Thus; fundamental elastoplastic behaviors; such as the yield stress and work …,Journal of Materials Research,2009,42
Large scaling unstructured peer-to-peer networks with heterogeneity-aware topology and routing,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems such as Gnutella have been widely acknowledgedas the fastest-growing Internet applications ever. The P2P model has many potentialadvantages; including high flexibility and serverless management. However; these systemssuffer from the well-known performance mismatch between the randomly constructedoverlay network topology and the underlying IP-layer topology. This paper proposes tostructure the P2P overlay topology using a heterogeneity-aware multitier topology to betterbalance the load at peers with heterogeneous capacities and to prevent low-capabilitynodes from throttling the performance of the system. An analytical model is developed toenable the construction and maintenance of heterogeneity-aware overlay topologies withgood node connectivity and better load balance.

The coreidea of the DynaBot service discovery system is to use domain-specific service classdescriptions powered by an intelligent Deep Web crawler. In contrast to current registry-based service discovery systems-like the several available UDDI registries-DynaBotpromotes focused crawling of the Deep Web of services and discovers candidate servicesthat are relevant to the domain of interest. It uses intelligent filtering algorithms to matchservices found by focused crawling with the domain-specific service class descriptions.

Morphological and structural characterizations for the composite nanofibers andthe transparent composites were realized in terms of SEM; TEM; and FTIR techniques. Thefiber reinforcement feature of the PA-6 was demonstrated by the SEM photos of a compositesample fractured in liquid nitrogen. Through TGA and DSC tests; it was observed thatthermal endurance and glass-transition temperature of the nanofiber reinforced compositesaltered in variation with the contents of the reinforcing PA-6.

Activity model: a declarative approach for capturing communication behavior in object-oriented databases,Ling Liu; Robert Meersman,Abstract Communication behaviour represents the dynamic evolution and the cooperation ofa group of objects in accomplishing a task. It is an important feature in object-orientedsystems. This paper introduces an activity model for the declarative specification of suchcommunication behaviour; including the temporal ordering of message exchanges withinthe object communications; and the behavioural relationships between activity executions.We develop two formal mechanisms: activity specialization and activity aggregation forabstract implementation of object communication in order to allow expressing complexbehaviour in terms of simpler behaviour.

Connectivity based node clustering in decentralized peer-to-peer networks,Lakshmish Ramaswamy; Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,Connectivity based node clustering has wide ranging applications in decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) networks such as P2P file sharing systems; mobile ad-hoc networks; P2P sensornetworks and so forth. We describe a connectivity-based distributed node clustering scheme(CDC). This scheme presents a scalable and an efficient solution for discoveringconnectivity based clusters in peer networks. In contrast to centralized graph clusteringalgorithms; the CDC scheme is completely decentralized and it only assumes theknowledge of neighbor nodes; instead of requiring a global knowledge of the network(graph) to be available. An important feature of the CDC scheme is its ability to cluster theentire network automatically or to discover clusters around a given set of nodes.

Quality of service semantics for multimedia database systems,Jonathan Walpole; Charles Krasic; Ling Liu; David Maier; Calton Pu; Dylan McNamee; David Steere,Abstract Quality of service (QoS) support has been a hot research topic in multimediadatabases; and multimedia systems in general; for the past several years. However; thereremains little consensus on how QoS support should be provided. At the resource-management level; systems designers are still debating the suitability of reservation-basedversus adaptive QoS management. The design of higher system layers is less clearlyunderstood; and the specification of QoS requirements in domain-specific terms is still anopen research topic. To address these issues; we propose a QoS model for multimediadatabases. The model covers the specification of user-level QoS preferences and theirrelationship to QoS control at the resource-management level; and is applicable to adaptiveand reservation-based systems.

Tide: achieving self-scaling in virtualized datacenter management middleware,Shicong Meng; Ling Liu; Vijayaraghavan Soundararajan,Abstract The increasing popularity of system virtualization in datacenters introduces theneed for self-scaling of the management layer to cope with the increasing demands of themanagement workload. This paper studies the problem of self-scaling in datacentermanagement middleware; allowing the management capacity to scale with the managementworkload. We argue that self-scaling must be fast during workload bursts to avoid taskcompletion delays; and self-scaling must minimize resource usage to avoid resourcecontention with applications. To address these two challenges; we propose the design ofTide; a self-scaling framework for virtualized datacenter management. A salient feature ofTide is its fast capacity-provisioning algorithm that supplies just-enough capacity for themanagement middleware. We evaluate the effectiveness of Tide with both synthetic and …,Proceedings of the 11th International Middleware Conference Industrial track,2010,39

Mining multiple private databases using a knn classifier,Li Xiong; Subramanyam Chitti; Ling Liu,Abstract Modern electronic communication has collapsed geographical boundaries forglobal information sharing but often at the expense of data security and privacy boundaries.Distributed privacy preserving data mining tools are increasingly becoming critical for miningmultiple databases with a minimum information disclosure. We present a frameworkincluding a general model as well as multi-round algorithms for mining horizontallypartitioned databases using a privacy preserving k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. Asalient feature of our approach is that it offers a trade-off between accuracy; efficiency andprivacy through multi-round protocols.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2007,38
The" Best K" for entropy-based categorical data clustering,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Abstract With the growing demand on cluster analysis for categorical data; a handful ofcategorical clustering algorithms have been developed. Surprisingly; to our knowledge;none has satisfactorily addressed the important problem for categorical clustering–how canwe determine the best K number of clusters for a categorical dataset? Since categorical datadoes not have the inherent distance function as the similarity measure; traditional clustervalidation techniques based on the geometry shape and density distribution cannot beapplied to answer this question. In this paper; we investigate the entropy property of thecategorical data and propose a BkPlot method for determining a set of candidate “best Ks”.This method is implemented with a hierarchical clustering algorithm ACE. The experimentalresults show that our approach can effectively identify the significant clustering structures.,*,2005,38
An object-oriented approach to multi-level association rule mining,Scott Fortin; Ling Liu,Abstract Previous studies in data mining have yielded efficient algorithms for discoveringassociation rules. To increase the expressiveness and relevance of the discovered rules;researche~ s typically augment the thresholds with domain-specific knowledge. Mostexisting proposals use the relational approach to organize and maintain these multi-levelconcept hierarchies. We argue that an object-oriented approach is better suited for focusingthe search and regulating the mining of association rules both at multi-levels within oneconcept hierarchy; and across multiple concept hierarchies. We propose an adaptiveencodhtg scheme for focusing the mining on semantically deeper and more informativeknowledge. We demonstrate that the application of an object-oriented approach provides uswith the benefits of a flexible combination of multiple multi-level concept hierarchies for …,Proceedings of the fifth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1996,38
Query-URL Bipartite Based Approach to Personalized Query Recommendation.,Lin Li; Zhenglu Yang; Ling Liu; Masaru Kitsuregawa,Abstract Query recommendation is considered an effective assistant in enhancing keywordbased queries in search engines and Web search software. Conventional approach to queryrecommendation has been focused on query-term based analysis over the user access logs.In this paper; we argue that utilizing the connectivity of a query-URL bipartite graph torecommend relevant queries can significantly improve the accuracy and effectiveness of theconventional query-term based query recommendation systems. We refer to the Query-URLBipartite based query reCommendation approach as QUBIC. The QUBIC approach has twounique characteristics. First; instead of operating on the original bipartite graph directly usingbiclique based approach or graph clustering; we extract an affinity graph of queries from theinitial query-URL bipartite graph.

A load shedding framework and optimizations for m-way windowed stream joins,Bugra Gedik; Kun-Lung Wu; S Yu Philip; Ling Liu,Tuple dropping; though commonly used for load shedding in most stream operations; isinadequate for m-way; windowed stream joins. The join output rate can be overly reducedbecause it fails to exploit the time correlations likely to exist among interrelated streams. Inthis paper; we introduce GrubJoin; an adaptive; m-way; windowed stream join that effectivelyperforms time correlation-aware CPU load shedding. GrubJoin maximizes the output rate byachieving near-optimal window harvesting; which picks only the most profitable windowsegments for the join. Due to combinatorial explosion of possible m-way join sequencesinvolving window segments; m-way; windowed stream joins pose several uniquechallenges. We focus on addressing two of them:(1) How can we quickly determine theoptimal window harvesting configuration for any m-way; windowed stream join?(2) How …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Topk queries across multiple private databases,Li Xiong; Subramanyam Chitti; Ling Liu,Advances in distributed service-oriented computing and global communications haveformed a strong technology push for large-scale data integration among organizations andenterprises. However; concerns about data privacy become increasingly important for large-scale mission-critical data integration applications. Ideally; given a database query spanningmultiple private databases; the authors wished to compute the answer to the query withoutrevealing any additional information of each individual database apart from the query result.In practice; this constraint can be relaxed to allow efficient information integration whileminimizing the information disclosure. In this paper; the authors proposed an efficientdecentralized peer-to-peer protocol for supporting aggregate queries over multiple privatedatabases while respecting the privacy constraints of participants.

Motion adaptive indexing for moving continual queries over moving objects,Bugra Gedik; Kun-Lung Wu; Philip Yu; Ling Liu,Abstract This paper describes a< i> motion adaptive</i> indexing scheme for efficientevaluation of moving continual queries (MCQs) over moving objects. It uses the concept of<i> motion-sensitive bounding boxes</i>(< i> MSB</i> s) to model moving objects andmoving queries. These bounding boxes automatically adapt their sizes to the dynamicmotion behaviors of individual objects. Instead of indexing frequently changing objectpositions; we index less frequently changing object and query< i> MSB</i> s; where updatesto the bounding boxes are needed only when objects and queries move across theboundaries of their boxes. This helps decrease the number of updates to the indexes. Moreimportantly; we use< i> predictive query results</i> to optimistically precalculate queryresults; decreasing the number of searches on the indexes. Motion-sensitive bounding …,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2004,37
Automated lookahead data migration in SSD-enabled multi-tiered storage systems,Gong Zhang; Lawrence Chiu; Clem Dickey; Ling Liu; Paul Muench; Sangeetha Seshadri,The significant IO improvements of Solid State Disks (SSD) over traditional rotational harddisks makes it an attractive approach to integrate SSDs in tiered storage systems forperformance enhancement. However; to integrate SSD into multi-tiered storage systemeffectively; automated data migration between SSD and HDD plays a critical role. In manyreal world application scenarios like banking and supermarket environments; workload andIO profile present interesting characteristics and also bear the constraint of workloaddeadline. How to fully release the power of data migration while guaranteeing the migrationdeadline is critical to maximizing the performance of SSD-enabled multi-tiered storagesystem. In this paper; we present an automated; deadline-aware; lookahead migrationscheme to address the data migration challenge. We analyze the factors that may impact …,Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST); 2010 IEEE 26th Symposium on,2010,36
The building blocks for specifying communication behavior of complex objects: an activity-driven approach,Ling Liu; Robert Meersman,Abstract Communication behavior represents dynamic evolution and cooperation of a groupof objects in accomplishing a task. It is an important feature in object-oriented systems. Wepropose the concept of activity as a basic building block for declarative specification ofcommunication behavior in object-oriented database systems; including the temporalordering of message exchanges within object communication and the behavioralrelationships between activity executions. We formally introduce two kinds of activitycomposition mechanisms: activity specialization and activity aggregation for abstractimplementation of communication behavior. The former is suited for behavioral refinement ofexisting activities into specialized activities. The latter is used for behavioral composition ofsimpler activities into complex activities; and ultimately; into the envisaged database …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1996,36
Computing infrastructure for big data processing,Ling Liu,Abstract With computing systems undergone a fundamental transformation from single-processor devices at the turn of the century to the ubiquitous and networked devices and thewarehouse-scale computing via the cloud; the parallelism has become ubiquitous at manylevels. At micro level; parallelisms are being explored from the underlying circuits; topipelining and instruction level parallelism on multi-cores or many cores on a chip as well asin a machine. From macro level; parallelisms are being promoted from multiple machines ona rack; many racks in a data center; to the globally shared infrastructure of the Internet. Withthe push of big data; we are entering a new era of parallel computing driven by novel andground breaking research innovation on elastic parallelism and scalability.

Mechanisms of water infiltration into conical hydrophobic nanopores,Ling Liu; Jianbing Zhao; Chun-Yang Yin; Patricia J Culligan; Xi Chen,Fluid channels with inclined solid walls (eg cone-and slit-shaped pores) have wide andpromising applications in micro-and nano-engineering and science. In this paper; we usemolecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the mechanisms of water infiltration(adsorption) into cone-shaped nanopores made of a hydrophobic graphene sheet. Whenthe apex angle is relatively small; an external pressure is required to initiate infiltration andthe pressure should keep increasing in order to further advance the water front inside thenanopore. By enlarging the apex angle; the pressure required for sustaining infiltration canbe effectively lowered. When the apex angle is sufficiently large; under ambient conditionwater can spontaneously infiltrate to a certain depth of the nanopore; after which an externalpressure is still required to infiltrate more water molecules.

An XML-enabled data extraction toolkit for web sources,Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Wei Han,Abstract The amount of useful semi-structured data on the web continues to grow at astunning pace. Often interesting web data are not in database systems but in HTML pages;XML pages; or text files. Data in these formats are not directly usable by standard SQL-likequery processing engines that support sophisticated querying and reporting beyondkeyword-based retrieval. Hence; the web users or applications need a smart way ofextracting data from these web sources. One of the popular approaches is to write wrappersaround the sources; either manually or with software assistance; to bring the web data withinthe reach of more sophisticated query tools and general mediator-based informationintegration systems. In this paper; we describe the methodology and the softwaredevelopment of an XML-enabled wrapper construction system—XWRAP for semi …,Information Systems,2001,35
Ranking services by service network structure and service attributes,Yang Zhou; Ling Liu; Chang-Shing Perng; Anca Sailer; Ignacio Silva-Lepe; Zhiyuan Su,Service network analysis is an essential aspect of web service discovery; search; miningand recommendation. Many popular web service networks are content-rich in terms ofheterogeneous types of entities; attributes and links. A main challenge for ranking services ishow to incorporate multiple complex and heterogeneous factors; such as service attributes;relationships between services; relationships between services and service providers orservice consumers; into the design of service ranking functions. In this paper; we modelservices; attributes; and the associated entities; such as providers; consumers; by aheterogeneous service network. We propose a unified neighborhood random walk distancemeasure; which integrates various types of links and vertex attributes by a local optimalweight assignment. Based on this unified distance measure; a reinforcement algorithm …,Web Services (ICWS); 2013 IEEE 20th International Conference on,2013,34
Cura: A cost-optimized model for mapreduce in a cloud,Balaji Palanisamy; Aameek Singh; Ling Liu; Bryan Langston,We propose a new MapReduce cloud service model; Cura; for data analytics in the cloud.We argue that performing MapReduce analytics in existing cloud service models-eitherusing a generic compute cloud or a dedicated MapReduce cloud-is inadequate andinefficient for production workloads. Existing services require users to select a number ofcomplex cluster and job parameters while simultaneously forcing the cloud provider to usethose potentially sub-optimal configurations resulting in poor resource utilization and highercost. In contrast Cura leverages MapReduce profiling to automatically create the best clusterconfiguration for the jobs so as to obtain a global resource optimization from the providerperspective. Secondly; to better serve modern MapReduce workloads which constitute alarge proportion of interactive real-time jobs; Cura uses a unique instant VM allocation …,Parallel & Distributed Processing (IPDPS); 2013 IEEE 27th International Symposium on,2013,34
PeerCast: Churn-resilient end system multicast on heterogeneous overlay networks,Jianjun Zhang; Ling Liu; Lakshmish Ramaswamy; Calton Pu,Abstract The lack of wide deployment of IP multicast in the Internet has promptedresearchers to propose end system multicast or application-level multicast as an alternateapproach. However; end system multicast; by its very nature; suffers from severalperformance limitations; including; high communication overheads due to duplicate datatransfers over same physical links; uneven load distribution caused by widely varyingresource availabilities at nodes; and highly failure-prone nature of end-hosts. This paperpresents a self-configuring; efficient and churn-resilient end-system multicast system calledPeerCast. Three unique features distinguish PeerCast from existing approaches toapplication-level multicasting. First; with the aim of exploiting network proximity of end-system nodes for efficient multicast subscription management and fast information …,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2008,34
Dynamic Query Processing in DIOM.,Ling Liu; Calton Pu,Abstract In an open environment such as the Internet; query responsiveness involves boththe capability of responding to a query within a reasonable time frame and the capability ofdynamically incorporating the new information sources and the up to date information ofexisting data sources into the answer of a query. In this paper we present the dynamicdistributed query processing framework; developed in the DIOM project; to demonstrate thefeasibility and the benefit of improving responsiveness of querying across heterogeneousinformation sources; without relying on an integrated global view schema pre-defined overall the participating information sources. Then we discuss several issues with respect toimproving query responsiveness in the context of DIOM; including how the informationconsumers' queries are dynamically processed and linked to the relevant information …,IEEE Data Eng.

The Quad Grid cloaking algorithm is fast but has lower anonymization successrate. The dynamic bottom-up or top-down grid cloaking algorithms provide much higher …,*,2007,33
Fast iterative graph computation: A path centric approach,Pingpeng Yuan; Wenya Zhang; Changfeng Xie; Hai Jin; Ling Liu; Kisung Lee,Abstract Large scale graph processing represents an interesting challenge due to the lack oflocality. This paper presents PathGraph for improving iterative graph computation on graphswith billions of edges. Our system design has three unique features: First; we model a largegraph using a collection of tree-based partitions and use an path-centric computation ratherthan vertex-centric or edge-centric computation. Our parallel computation model significantlyimproves the memory and disk locality for performing iterative computation algorithms.Second; we design a compact storage that further maximize sequential access and minimizerandom access on storage media. Third; we implement the path-centric computation modelby using a scatter/gather programming model; which parallels the iterative computation atpartition tree level and performs sequential updates for vertices in each partition tree.

Click traffic analysis of short url spam on twitter,De Wang; Shamkant B Navathe; Ling Liu; Danesh Irani; Acar Tamersoy; Calton Pu,With an average of 80% length reduction; the URL shorteners have become the norm forsharing URLs on Twitter; mainly due to the 140-character limit per message. Unfortunately;spammers have also adopted the URL shorteners to camouflage and improve the user click-through of their spam URLs. In this paper; we measure the misuse of the short URLs andanalyze the characteristics of the spam and non-spam short URLs. We utilize thesemeasurements to enable the detection of spam short URLs. To achieve this; we collectedshort URLs from Twitter and retrieved their click traffic data from Bitly; a popular URLshortening system. We first investigate the creators of over 600;000 Bitly short URLs tocharacterize short URL spammers. We then analyze the click traffic generated from variouscountries and referrers; and determine the top click sources for spam and non-spam short …,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (Collaboratecom); 2013 9th International Conference Conference on,2013,32
Organic–inorganic hybrid material for the cells immobilization: long-term viability mechanism and application in BOD sensors,Ling Liu; Li Shang; Shaojun Guo; Dan Li; Changyu Liu; Li Qi; Shaojun Dong,Abstract In this paper; organic–inorganic hybrid material; which is composed of silica andthe grafting copolymer of poly (vinyl alcohol) and 4-vinylpyridine (PVA-gP (4-VP)); wasemployed to immobilize Trichosporon cutaneum strain 2.570 cells. Cells entrapped into thehybrid material were found to keep a long-term viability. The mechanism of such a long-termviability was investigated by using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Our studiesrevealed that arthroconidia produced in the extracellular material might play an importantrole in keeping the long-term viability of the immobilized microorganism. After thearthroconidia were activated; an electrochemical biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) sensorbased on cell/hybrid material-modified supporting membrane was constructed for verifyingthe proposed mechanism.

Thermally responsive fluid behaviors in hydrophobic nanopores,Ling Liu; Jianbing Zhao; Patricia J Culligan; Yu Qiao; Xi Chen,A fundamental understanding of the thermal effects on nanofluid behaviors is critical fordeveloping and designing innovative thermally responsive nanodevices. Using moleculardynamics (MD) simulation and experiment; we investigate the temperature-dependentintrusion/adsorption of water molecules into hydrophobic nanopores (carbon nanotubes andnanoporous carbon) and the underlying mechanisms. The critical infiltration pressure isreduced for elevated temperature or increased pore size. The variation of wettability isrelated to the thermally responsive fluid characteristics; such as the surface tension andcontact angle; which arise from the variations of multiple atomic variables including theconfined water density; hydrogen bond; and dipole orientation. With thermal perturbation;most of these physical quantities are found to be more significantly influenced in the …,Langmuir,2009,32
Securing decentralized reputation management using TrustGuard,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Abstract Reputation systems have been popular in estimating the trustworthiness andpredicting the future behavior of nodes in a large-scale distributed system where nodes maytransact with one another without prior knowledge or experience. One of the fundamentalchallenges in distributed reputation management is to understand vulnerabilities anddevelop mechanisms that can minimize the potential damages to a system by maliciousnodes. In this paper; we identify three vulnerabilities that are detrimental to decentralizedreputation management and propose TrustGuard—a safeguard framework for providing ahighly dependable and yet efficient reputation system. First; we provide a dependable trustmodel and a set of formal methods to handle strategic malicious nodes that continuouslychange their behavior to gain unfair advantages in the system.

Clustermap: Labeling clusters in large datasets via visualization,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Abstract With the rapid increase of data in many areas; clustering on large datasets hasbecome an important problem in data analysis. Since cluster analysis is a highly iterativeprocess; cluster analysis on large datasets prefers short iteration on a relatively smallrepresentative set. Thus; a two-phase framework" sampling/summarization-iterative clusteranalysis" is often applied in practice. Since the clustering result only labels the smallrepresentative set; there are problems with extending the result to the entire large dataset;which are almost ignored by the traditional clustering research. This extending is oftennamed as labeling process. Labeling irregular shaped clusters; distinguishing outliers andextending cluster boundary are the main problems in this stage. We address these problemsand propose a visualization-based approach to dealing with them precisely.

Reliable peer-to-peer end system multicasting through replication,Jianjun Zhang; Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Mostafa Ammar,A key challenge in peer-to-peer computing system is to provide decentralized and yetreliable services on top of a network of loosely coupled; weakly connected and possiblyunreliable peers. This work presents an effective dynamic passive replication schemedesigned to provide reliable multicast service in peer-cast; an efficient and self-configurablepeer-to-peer end system multicast (ESM) system. We first describe the design of adistributed replication scheme; which enables reliable subscription and multicastdissemination of information in an environment of inherently unreliable peers.

A patient-centric; attribute-based; source-verifiable framework for health record sharing,Apurva Mohan; David Bauer; Douglas M Blough; Mustaque Ahamad; Bhuvan Bamba; Ramkumar Krishnan; Ling Liu; Daisuke Mashima; Balaji Palanisamy,The storage of health records in electronic format; and the wide-spread sharing of theserecords among different health care providers; have enormous potential benefits to the UShealthcare system. These benefits include both improving the quality of health caredelivered to patients and reducing the costs of delivering that care. However; maintainingthe security of electronic health record systems and the privacy of the information theycontain is paramount to ensure that patients have confidence in the use of such systems. Inthis paper; we propose a framework for electronic health record sharing that is patientcentric; ie it provides patients with substantial control over how their information is sharedand with whom; provides for verifiability of original sources of health information and theintegrity of the data; and permits fine-grained decisions about when data can be shared …,*,2009,30
Scalable SPARQL querying using path partitioning,Buwen Wu; Yongluan Zhou; Pingpeng Yuan; Ling Liu; Hai Jin,The emerging need for conducting complex analysis over big RDF datasets calls for scale-out solutions that can harness a computing cluster to process big RDF datasets. Queriesover RDF data often involve complex self-joins; which would be very expensive to run if thedata are not carefully partitioned across the cluster and hence distributed joins over massiveamount of data are necessary. Existing RDF data partitioning methods can nicely localizesimple queries but still need to resort to expensive distributed joins for more complexqueries. In this paper; we propose a new data partitioning approach that takes use of the richstructural information in RDF datasets and minimizes the amount of data that have to bejoined across different computing nodes. We conduct an extensive experimental study usingtwo popular RDF benchmark data and one real RDF dataset that contain up to billions of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,29

Exosomes and their therapeutic potentials of stem cells,Chao Han; Xuan Sun; Ling Liu; Haiyang Jiang; Yan Shen; Xiaoyun Xu; Jie Li; Guoxin Zhang; Jinsha Huang; Zhicheng Lin; Nian Xiong; Tao Wang,Exosomes; a group of vesicles originating from the multivesicular bodies (MVBs); arereleased into the extracellular space when MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane.Numerous studies indicate that exosomes play important roles in cell-to-cell communication;and exosomes from specific cell types and conditions display multiple functions such asexerting positive effects on regeneration in many tissues. It is widely accepted that thetherapeutic potential of stem cells may be mediated largely by the paracrine factors; soharnessing the paracrine effects of stem and progenitor cells without affecting these living;replicating; and potentially pluripotent cell populations is an advantage in terms of safetyand complexity.

Vulnerabilities and countermeasures in context-aware social rating services,Qinyuan Feng; Ling Liu; Yafei Dai,Abstract Social trust and recommendation services are the most popular social ratingsystems today for service providers to learn about the social opinion or popularity of aproduct; item; or service; such as a book on Amazon; a seller on eBay; a story on Digg or amovie on Netflix. Such social rating systems are very convenient and offer alternativelearning environments for decision makers; but they open the door for attackers tomanipulate the social rating systems by selfishly promoting or maliciously demoting certainitems. Although a fair amount of effort has been made to understand various risks andpossible defense mechanisms to counter such attacks; most of the existing work to date hasbeen devoted to studying specific types of attacks and their countermeasures.

An expiration age-based document placement scheme for cooperative web caching,Lakshmish Ramaswamy; Ling Liu,The sharing of caches among proxies is an important technique to reduce Web traffic;alleviate network bottlenecks; and improve response time of document requests. Mostexisting work on cooperative caching has been focused on serving misses collaboratively.Very few have studied the effect of cooperation on document placement schemes and itspotential enhancements on cache hit ratio and latency reduction. We propose a newdocument placement scheme which takes into account the contentions at individual cachesin order to limit the replication of documents within a cache group and increase document hitratio. The main idea of this new scheme is to view the aggregate disk space of the cachegroup as a global resource of the group and uses the concept of cache expiration age tomeasure the contention of individual caches.

Inthis paper; we present VB-Partitioner--a distributed data partitioning model and algorithmsfor efficient processing of graph operations over large-scale graphs in the Cloud. Our VB-Partitioner has three salient features.

Grubjoin: An adaptive; multi-way; windowed stream join with time correlation-aware cpu load shedding,Bugra Gedik; Kun-Lung Wu; S Yu Philip; Ling Liu,Tuple dropping; though commonly used for load shedding in most data stream operations; isgenerally inadequate for multiway windowed stream joins. The join output rate can beunnecessarily reduced because tuple dropping fails to exploit the time correlations that arelikely to exist among interrelated streams. In this paper; we introduce GrubJoin-an adaptivemultiway windowed stream join that effectively performs time correlation-aware CPU loadshedding. GrubJoin maximizes the output rate by achieving near-optimal windowharvesting; which picks only the most profitable segments of individual windows for the join.Due mainly to the combinatorial explosion of possible multiway join sequences involvingdifferent window segments; GrubJoin faces unique challenges that do not exist for binaryjoins; such as determining the optimal window harvesting configuration in a time-efficient …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,27
Exploring semantics in aggregation hierarchies for object-oriented databases,Ling Liu,An extended object-oriented model for exploring semantics in aggregation hierarchies ispresented. The extension is mainly based on a general distinction between aggregationreferences and association references and a support for type inheritance in bothspecialization and aggregation abstractions. The author formally describes notions ofaggregation reference and aggregation hierarchy and introduces the concept of aggregationinheritance as a type composition mechanism for sharing specifications among types. Thesimilarities and differences between aggregation inheritance and subtype inheritance areanalyzed. It is shown that a combination of these two types of inheritance provides apowerful mechanism for abstract implementation of behavior and for enhancing theextensibility of the object model.,Data Engineering; 1992.

A graph derivation based approach for measuring and comparing structural semantics of ontologies,Yinglong Ma; Ling Liu; Ke Lu; Beihong Jin; Xiangjie Liu,Ontology reuse offers great benefits by measuring and comparing ontologies. However; thestate of art approaches for measuring ontologies neglects the problems of both thepolymorphism of ontology representation and the addition of implicit semantic knowledge.One way to tackle these problems is to devise a mechanism for ontology measurement thatis stable; the basic criteria for automatic measurement. In this paper; we present a graphderivation representation based approach (GDR) for stable semantic measurement; whichcaptures structural semantics of ontologies and addresses those problems that causeunstable measurement of ontologies. This paper makes three original contributions. First; weintroduce and define the concept of semantic measurement and the concept of stablemeasurement.

Anonymizing continuous queries with delay-tolerant mix-zones over road networks,Balaji Palanisamy; Ling Liu; Kisung Lee; Shicong Meng; Yuzhe Tang; Yang Zhou,Abstract This paper presents a delay-tolerant mix-zone framework for protecting the locationprivacy of mobile users against continuous query correlation attacks. First; we describe andanalyze the continuous query correlation attacks (CQ-attacks) that perform query correlationbased inference to break the anonymity of road network-aware mix-zones. We formally studythe privacy strengths of the mix-zone anonymization under the CQ-attack model and arguethat spatial cloaking or temporal cloaking over road network mix-zones is ineffective andsusceptible to attacks that carry out inference by combining query correlation with timingcorrelation (CQ-timing attack) and transition correlation (CQ-transition attack) information.Next; we introduce three types of delay-tolerant road network mix-zones (ie; temporal;spatial and spatio-temporal) that are free from CQ-timing and CQ-transition attacks and in …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2014,26
Processing generalized k nearest neighbor queries on a wireless broadcast stream,HaRim Jung; Yon Dohn Chung; Ling Liu,Abstract In this paper; we investigate the problem of processing generalized k-nearestneighbor (GkNN) queries; which involve both spatial and non-spatial specifications for dataobjects; in a wireless broadcasting system. We present a method for processing GkNNqueries on the broadcast stream. In particular; we propose a novel R-tree variant indexstructure; called the bit-vector R-tree (bR-tree); which stores additional bit-vector informationto describe non-spatial attribute values of the data objects. In addition; each node in the bR-tree stores only one pointer to its children; which makes the bR-tree compact. We generatethe broadcast stream by multiplexing the bR-tree and the data objects in the broadcastingchannel. The corresponding search algorithm for the broadcast stream is also described.Through a series of comprehensive simulation experiments; we prove the efficiency of the …,Information Sciences,2012,25
Thermal effect on the dynamic infiltration of water into single-walled carbon nanotubes,Jianbing Zhao; Ling Liu; Patricia J Culligan; Xi Chen,Abstract Thermally induced variation in wetting ability in a confined nanoenvironment;indicated by the change in infiltration pressure as water molecules enter a model single-walled carbon nanotube submerged in aqueous environment; is investigated usingmolecular dynamics simulations. The temperature-dependent infiltration behavior isimpacted in part by the thermally excited radial oscillation of the carbon nanotube; and inpart by the variations of fundamental physical properties at the molecular level; including thehydrogen bonding interaction. The thermal effect is also closely coupled with the nanotubesize effect and loading rate effect. Manipulation of the thermally responsive infiltrationproperties could facilitate the development of a next-generation thermal energy converterbased on nanoporous materials.,Physical Review E,2009,25
“Best K”: critical clustering structures in categorical datasets,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Abstract The demand on cluster analysis for categorical data continues to grow over the lastdecade. A well-known problem in categorical clustering is to determine the best K number ofclusters. Although several categorical clustering algorithms have been developed;surprisingly; none has satisfactorily addressed the problem of best K for categoricalclustering. Since categorical data does not have an inherent distance function as thesimilarity measure; traditional cluster validation techniques based on geometric shapes anddensity distributions are not appropriate for categorical data. In this paper; we study theentropy property between the clustering results of categorical data with different K number ofclusters; and propose the BKPlot method to address the three important cluster validationproblems:(1) How can we determine whether there is significant clustering structure in a …,Knowledge and information systems,2009,25

Spatio-temporal patterns in network events,Ting Wang; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Dakshi Agrawal; Ling Liu,Abstract Operational networks typically generate massive monitoring data that consist oflocal (in both space and time) observations of the status of the networks. It is oftenhypothesized that such data exhibit both spatial and temporal correlation based on theunderlying network topology and time of occurrence; identifying such correlation patternsoffers valuable insights into global network phenomena (eg; fault cascading incommunication networks).

RoadTrack: scaling location updates for mobile clients on road networks with query awareness,Peter Pesti; Ling Liu; Bhuvan Bamba; Arun Iyengar; Matt Weber,Abstract Mobile commerce and location based services (LBS) are some of the fastestgrowing IT industries in the last five years. Location update of mobile clients is afundamental capability in mobile commerce and all types of LBS. Higher update frequencyleads to higher accuracy; but incurs unacceptably high cost of location management at thelocation servers. We propose RoadTrack--a road-network based; query-aware locationupdate framework with two unique features. First; we introduce the concept of precincts tocontrol the granularity of location update resolution for mobile clients that are not of interestto any active location query services. Second; we define query encounter points for mobileobjects that are targets of active location query services; and utilize these encounter pointsto define the adequate location update schedule for each mobile.

Monitoring continuous state violation in datacenters: Exploring the time dimension,Shicong Meng; Ting Wang; Ling Liu,Monitoring global states of an application deployed over distributed nodes becomesprevalent in today's datacenters. State monitoring requires not only correct monitoringresults but also minimum communication cost for efficiency and scalability. Most existingwork adopts an instantaneous state monitoring approach; which triggers state alertswhenever a constraint is violated. Such an approach; however; may cause frequent andunnecessary state alerts due to unpredictable monitored value bursts and momentaryoutliers that are common in large-scale Internet applications. These false alerts may furtherlead to expensive and problematic counter-measures. To address this issue; we introducewindow-based state monitoring in this paper. Window-based state monitoring evaluateswhether state violation is continuous within a time window; and thus; gains immunity to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,24
Hierarchical business process clustering,Jae-Yoon Jung; Joonsoo Bae; Ling Liu,Business process is collection of standardized and structured tasks inducing value creationof a company. Nowadays; it is recognized as one of significant intangible business assets toachieve competitive advantages. This research introduces a novel approach of businessprocess analysis; which has more and more significance as process-aware informationsystems are spreading widely over a lot of companies. In this paper; a methodology ofbusiness process clustering based on process similarity is illustrated. The purpose ofbusiness process clustering is to analyze accumulated process models in order to assistdesign of new processes and reengineering of existing ones. The proposed methodologyexploits structural similarity metrics of business processes. The methodology is illustratedwith synthetic process models of insurance processes.,Services Computing; 2008.

Scaling unstructured peer-to-peer networks with multi-tier capacity-aware overlay topologies,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,The peer to peer (P2P) file sharing systems such as Gnutella have been widelyacknowledged as the fastest growing Internet applications ever. The P2P model has manypotential advantages due to the design flexibility of overlay networks and the server-lessmanagement of cooperative sharing of information and resources. However; these systemssuffer from the well-known performance mismatch between the randomly constructedoverlay network topology and the underlying IP layer topology for packet routing. This paperproposes to structure the P2P overlay topology using a capacity-aware multi-tier topology tobetter balance load at peers with heterogeneous capacities and to prevent low capacitynodes from downgrading the performance of the system. To study the benefits and cost ofthe multi-tier capacity aware topology with respect to basic and advanced routing …,Parallel and Distributed Systems; 2004. ICPADS 2004. Proceedings.

A recursive object algebra based on aggregation abstraction for manipulating complex objects,Ling Liu,Abstract We present an object algebra for manipulating complex objects in object-orienteddatabase systems. All operators are recursively defined. Unlike most of the existing querylanguages; the design of this object algebra is based on aggregation abstraction. It allows totake complex objects collectively as a unit of high level queries and enables complexobjects to be accessed at all levels of aggregation hierarchies without resorting to any kindof path expressions. Features of aggregation abstraction; such as acyclicity of aggregationhierarchies and aggregation inheritance; have played important roles in such adevelopment. We also formally described the output type of each operator in order tosupport dynamic classification of query results in the IsA type/class semi-lattice. Thealgebraic-equivalence rewriting rules for query optimization of this algebra are developed …,Data & knowledge engineering,1993,24
Role‐based and time‐bound access and management of EHR data,Rui Zhang; Ling Liu; Rui Xue,ABSTRACT Security and privacy are widely recognized as important requirements foraccess and management of electronic health record (EHR) data. In this paper; we argue thatEHR data need to be managed with customizable access control in both spatial andtemporal dimensions. We present a role-based and time-bound access control (RBTBAC)model that provides more flexibility in both roles (spatial capability) and time (temporalcapability) dimensions to control the access of sensitive data. Through algorithmiccombination of role-based access control and time-bound key management; our RBTBACmodel has two salient features. First; we have developed a privacy-aware and dynamic keystructure for role-based privacy aware access and management of EHR data; focusing onthe consistency of access authorization (including data and time interval) with the …,Security and Communication Networks,2014,23
Stock market volatility prediction: a service-oriented multi-kernel learning approach,Feng Wang; Ling Liu; Chenxiao Dou,Stock market is an important and active part of nowadays financial markets. Stock timeseries volatility analysis is regarded as one of the most challenging time series forecastingdue to the hard-to-predict volatility observed in worldwide stock markets. In this paper weargue that the stock market state is dynamic and invisible but it will be influenced by somevisible stock market information. Existing research on financial time series analysis andstock market volatility prediction can be classified into two categories: in depth study of onemarket factor on the stock market volatility prediction or prediction by combining historicalprice fluctuations with either trading volume or news. In this paper we present a service-oriented multi-kernel based learning framework (MKL) for stock volatility analysis. Our MKLservice framework promotes a two-tier learning architecture.

Learning; indexing; and diagnosing network faults,Ting Wang; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Dakshi Agrawal; Ling Liu,Abstract Modern communication networks generate massive volume of operational eventdata; eg; alarm; alert; and metrics; which can be used by a network management system(NMS) to diagnose potential faults. In this work; we introduce a new class of indexable faultsignatures that encode temporal evolution of events generated by a network fault as well astopological relationships among the nodes where these events occur. We present anefficient learning algorithm to extract such fault signatures from noisy historical event data;and with the help of novel space-time indexing structures; we show how to perform efficient;online signature matching. We provide results from extensive experimental studies toexplore the efficacy of our approach and point out potential applications of such signaturesfor many different types of networks including social and information networks.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,23
Scalable processing of spatial alarms,Bhuvan Bamba; Ling Liu; S Yu Philip; Gong Zhang; Myungcheol Doo,Abstract Spatial alarms can be modeled as location-based triggers which are fired wheneverthe subscriber enters the spatial region around the location of interest associated with thealarm. Alarm processing requires meeting two demanding objectives: high accuracy; whichensures zero or very low alarm misses; and system scalability; which requires highly efficientprocessing of spatial alarms. Existing techniques like periodic evaluation or continuousquery-based approach; when applied to the spatial alarm processing problem; lead tounpredictable inaccuracy in alarm processing or unnecessarily high computational costs orboth. In order to deal with these weaknesses; we introduce the concept of safe period tominimize the number of unnecessary spatial alarm evaluations; increasing the throughputand scalability of the server. Further; we develop alarm grouping techniques based on …,International Conference on High-Performance Computing,2008,23
Agyaat: mutual anonymity over structured P2P networks,Aameek Singh; Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,Purpose–To provide mutual anonymity over traditionally un-anonymous Distributed HashTables (DHT) based Peer-to-Peer overlay networks; while maintaining the desiredscalability and guaranteed lookup properties of the DHTs. Design/methodology/approach–Agyaat uses a novel hybrid-overlay design; a fully decentralized topology without anytrusted proxies. It anonymizes both the querying and responding peers through the use ofunstructured topologies; called clouds; which are added onto the structured overlays. Inaddition; it regulates the cloud topologies to ensure the guaranteed location of data andscalability of routing. A unique characteristic of the design is the ability of users to tradeoffbetween desired anonymity and performance. The paper presents a thorough performanceand anonymity analysis of the system; and also analyzes few anonymity compromising …,Internet Research,2006,23
Semstore: A semantic-preserving distributed rdf triple store,Buwen Wu; Yongluan Zhou; Pingpeng Yuan; Hai Jin; Ling Liu,Abstract The flexibility of the RDF data model has attracted an increasing number oforganizations to store their data in an RDF format. With the rapid growth of RDF datasets; weenvision that it is inevitable to deploy a cluster of computing nodes to process large-scaleRDF data in order to deliver desirable query performance. In this paper; we address thechallenging problems of data partitioning and query optimization in a scale-out RDF engine.We identify that existing approaches only focus on using fine-grained structural informationfor data partitioning; and hence fail to localize many types of complex queries. We thenpropose a radically different approach; where a coarse-grained structure; namely RootedSub-Graph (RSG); is used as the partition unit. By doing so; we can capture structuralinformation at a much greater scale and hence are able to localize many complex queries …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,22
Graphene nanoribbon-guided fluid channel: a fast transporter of nanofluids,Ling Liu; Lin Zhang; Zhongguo Sun; Guang Xi,In this work; we present a conceptual design of nanofluid channels using graphene sheetsas the container and nanoribbons as flow guiders. Using molecular dynamics simulations;we demonstrate that water molecules confined in such nanochannels can be well guided bythe nanoribbons and form a regular shaped water stream. The viscosity of water transportedalong such nanochannels is found to be orders of magnitude lower than that of bulk water.Several unconventional structural and flow characteristics are revealed to be responsible forthe fast transport phenomenon comparable to that in carbon nanotubes. The proposednanoribbon-guided fluid channel is promising for use in next-generation integrated materialsystems for transporting fluids at high volumetric flow rates with considerably low drivingforces.,Nanoscale,2012,22
Mode I Interlaminar fracture of composite laminates incorporating with ultrathin fibrous sheets,L Liu; YM Liang; GY Xu; HS Zhang; ZM Huang,Attempts have been made to investigate the effect of ultrathin fibrous sheets (UFSs)arranged on the ply interface on mode I interlaminar fracture of a glass/epoxy compositelaminate. The UFSs were obtained by electrospinning of epoxy 609 polymer solution andthen incorporated into the middle interface of the laminate with various thicknesses. Mode Iinterlaminar fracture behaviors of the resulting laminates were characterized using doublecantilever beam (DCB) specimens. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was applied toanalyze the fracture characteristics of the tested specimens. Results have shown that theUFS with a reasonable thickness would have no effect on the mode I delaminationresistance of the laminate. To further investigate the effect of the sheets on the fracturetoughness; some UFSs with thinner thickness were inserted into different interfaces of the …,Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites,2008,22
Improving wireless positioning with look-ahead map-matching,Kipp Jones; Ling Liu; Farshid Alizadeh-Shabdiz,Determining the location of mobile devices is a necessary system function for a growingnumber of location based services (LBS). The most popular method for locationdetermination is GPS; however GPS has known accuracy and environmental limitations;many of which are exacerbated in dense urban areas. Wireless positioning systems (WPS)on the other hand; demonstrate location accuracy largely inverted to that of GPS-the denserthe urban setting; the more accurate the location estimation is in general. Large-scale WPSdiffers from satellite based positioning in at least two aspects; first; wireless positioningsystems typically derive their location estimates based on observed beacon locations suchas through wardriving; and second WPS lacks a mechanism to maintain highly synchronizedclocks. This results in lower accuracy and a lower confidence factor in the use of wireless …,Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking & Services; 2007. MobiQuitous 2007.

A dynamic query scheduling framework for distributed and evolving information systems,Ling Liu; Calton Pu,The rapid growth of the wide area network technology has led to an increasing number ofinformation sources available online. To ensure the query services to scale up with suchdynamic open environments; an advanced distributed information system must provideadequate support for dynamic interconnection between information consumers andinformation producers; instead of just functioning as a static data delivery system. Wedevelop a distributed query scheduling framework to demonstrate the feasibility and thebenefit for supporting interoperability and dynamic information gathering acrossheterogeneous information sources; without relying on an integrated view predefined overthe participating information sources. We outline the mechanisms developed for the maincomponents of our distributed query scheduling framework; such as query routing and …,Distributed Computing Systems; 1997.; Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on,1997,22
Hydrogen bonding-assisted thermal conduction in β-sheet crystals of spider silk protein,Lin Zhang; Teli Chen; Heng Ban; Ling Liu,Using atomistic simulations; we demonstrate that β-sheet; an essential component of spidersilk protein; has a thermal conductivity 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that of someother protein structures reported in the literature. In contrast to several other nanostructuredmaterials of similar bundled/layered structures (eg few-layer graphene and bundled carbonnanotubes); the β-sheet is found to uniquely feature enhanced thermal conductivity with anincreased number of constituting units; ie β-strands. Phonon analysis identifies inter-β-strand hydrogen bonding as the main contributor to the intriguing phenomenon; whichprominently influences the state of phonons in both low-and high-frequency regimes. Athermal resistance model further verifies the critical role of hydrogen bonding in thermalconduction through β-sheet structures.,Nanoscale,2014,21
ServiceTrust: Trust management in service provision networks,Zhiyuan Su; Ling Liu; Mingchu Li; Xinxin Fan; Yang Zhou,Service provision networks are popular platforms for decentralized service management.eBay and Amazon are two representative examples of enabling and hosting serviceprovision networks for their customers. Trust management is a critical component for scalingservice provision networks to larger set of participants. This paper presents Service Trust; aquality sensitive and attack resilient trust management facility for service provision networks.Service Trust has three unique features. First; it encapsulates quality-sensitive feedbacks bymulti-scale rating scheme and incorporates the variances of user's behaviors into the localtrust algorithm. Second; Service Trust measures the similarity of two users' feedbackbehavior and aggregate the local trust values into the global trust algorithm by exploitingpairwise feedback similarity scores to weight the contributions of local trust values …,Services Computing (SCC); 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,21
Network I/O fairness in virtual machines,Muhammad Bilal Anwer; Ankur Nayak; Nick Feamster; Ling Liu,Abstract We present a mechanism for achieving network I/O fairness in virtual machines; byapplying flexible rate limiting mechanisms directly to virtual network interfaces. Conventionalapproaches achieve this fairness by implementing rate limiting either in the virtual machinemonitor or hypervisor; which generates considerable CPU interrupt and instruction overheadfor forwarding packets. In contrast; our design pushes per-VM rate limiting as close aspossible to the physical hardware themselves; effectively implementing per-virtual interfacerate limiting in hardware. We show that this design reduces CPU overhead (both interruptsand instructions) by an order of magnitude. Our design can be applied either to virtualservers for cloud-based services; or to virtual routers,Proceedings of the second ACM SIGCOMM workshop on Virtualized infrastructure systems and architectures,2010,21
He-tree: a framework for detecting changes in clustering structure for categorical data streams,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Abstract Analyzing clustering structures in data streams can provide critical information forreal-time decision making. Most research in this area has focused on clustering algorithmsfor numerical data streams; and very few have proposed to monitor the change of clusteringstructure. Most surprisingly; to our knowledge; no work has been proposed on monitoringclustering structure for categorical data streams. In this paper; we present a framework fordetecting the change of primary clustering structure in categorical data streams; which isindicated by the change of the best number of clusters (Best K) in the data stream. Theframework uses a Hierarchical Entropy Tree structure (HE-Tree) to capture the entropycharacteristics of clusters in a data stream; and detects the change of Best K by combiningour previously developed BKPlot method. The HE-Tree can efficiently summarize the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,21
Distributed query sampling: A quality-conscious approach,James Caverlee; Ling Liu; Joonsoo Bae,Abstract We present an adaptive distributed query-sampling framework that is quality-conscious for extracting high-quality text database samples. The framework divides thequery-based sampling process into an initial seed sampling phase and a quality-awareiterative sampling phase. In the second phase the sampling process is dynamicallyscheduled based on estimated database size and quality parameters derived during theprevious sampling process. The unique characteristic of our adaptive query-based samplingframework is its self-learning and self-configuring ability based on the overall quality of alltext databases under consideration. We introduce three quality-conscious samplingschemes for estimating database quality; and our initial results show that the proposedframework supports higher-quality document sampling than existing approaches.,Proceedings of the 29th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2006,21
A systematic approach to flexible specification; composition; and restructuring of workflow activities,Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Duncan Dubugras Ruiz,Abstract We introduce the ActlvityFlow specification language for flexible specification;composition; and coordination of work/low activities. The most interesting features of theActivityFlow specification language include:(1) a collection of specification mechanisms;allowing workflow designers to use a uniform workflow specification interface to describedifferent types (ie; adhoc; administrative; or production) of workflows involved in theirorganizational processes-this feature helps to increase the flexibility of workflow processesin accommodating various types of changes;(2) a set of activity modeling facilities; enablingworkflow designers to describe the flow of work declaratively and incrementally; allowing toreason about correctness and security of complex workflow activities independently fromtheir underlying implementation mechanisms;(3) an open architecture that supports user …,Journal of Database Management,2004,21

Malic enzyme tracers reveal hypoxia-induced switch in adipocyte NADPH pathway usage,Ling Liu; Supriya Shah; Jing Fan; Junyoung O Park; Kathryn E Wellen; Joshua D Rabinowitz,Abstract The critical cellular hydride donor NADPH is produced through various means;including the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP); folate metabolism and malicenzyme. In growing cells; it is efficient to produce NADPH via the oxPPP and folatemetabolism; which also make nucleotide precursors. In nonproliferating adipocytes; ametabolic cycle involving malic enzyme holds the potential to make both NADPH and two-carbon units for fat synthesis. Recently developed deuterium (2 H) tracer methods haveenabled direct measurement of NADPH production by the oxPPP and folate metabolism.Here we enable tracking of NADPH production by malic enzyme with [2; 2; 3; 3-2 H] dimethyl-succinate and [4-2 H] glucose. Using these tracers; we show that most NADPH indifferentiating 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes is made by malic enzyme. The associated …,Nature chemical biology,2016,20
Future of nano CMOS technology,Hiroshi Iwai,Although silicon-based CMOS devices have dominated the integrated circuit applicationsover the past few decades; it is expected that the development of CMOS would reach itslimits after the next decade because of the difficulties in downsizing and also somefundamental limits of MOSFETs. However; there are no promising candidates which canreplace CMOS with better performance and high-density integration for the moment. Thus;we have to stick to the CMOS devices until its end. In order to pursue the downsizing ofCMOS for another decade; the development of new technologies is becoming extremelyimportant. Not all the companies can necessarily develop the most advanced technologytimely and the competition between the leading semiconductor manufacturing companiesbecomes very severe for their survive.

Scalable and reliable IPTV service through collaborative request dispatching,Shicong Meng; Ling Liu; Jianwei Yin,IPTV has emerged as the future standard of television and drawn enormous attention fromboth industry and research communities. Among different IPTV services; on-demandservices are the most popular ones due to their convenience and rich content. However;supporting scalable and reliable on-demand IPTV services remains to be an importantchallenge. Existing IPTV architecture dedicates a centralized regional station to servesubscribers in the respective region regardless of temporal and spatial dynamics in servicedemand. As a result; it may cause significant imbalance of resource utilization and serviceprovisioning delay at different stations; especially with increasing subscribers and videocontent. In this paper; we propose to allow IPTV stations of different regions tocollaboratively serve user requests for delivering scalable and reliable IPTV services …,Web Services (ICWS); 2010 IEEE International Conference on,2010,20
Distributed line graphs: A universal framework for building DHTs based on arbitrary constant-degree graphs,Yiming Zhang; Ling Liu; Dongsheng Li; Xicheng Lu,Most proposed DHTs have their unique maintenance mechanisms specific to the staticgraphs on which they are based. In this paper we propose distributed line graphs (DLG); auniversal framework for building DHTs based on arbitrary constant-degree graphs. Weprove that in a DLG-enabled; N-node DHT; the out-degree is d; the in-degree is between 1and 2d; and the diameter is less than 2 (logdN− logdN0+ D0+ 1); where d; D0 and N0represent the degree; diameter and number of nodes of the initial graph; respectively. Themaintenance cost of DLG-enabled DHTs is O (logdN). We show the power of DLG techniqueby applying it to Kautz graphs to propose a new DHT scheme.,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008. ICDCS'08.

Mechanisms of nanoindentation on multiwalled carbon nanotube and nanotube cluster,Ling Liu; Guoxin Cao; Xi Chen,Abstract Nanoindentation is a promising technique for deducing the elastic property ofcarbon nanotubes (CNTs). The paper presents an atomistic study on the nanoindentationmechanisms of single-walled and multiwalled CNTs and CNT clusters; through which thedeformation characteristics are linked with CNT elastic stiffness. The assembly of individualsingle-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) into multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) and CNT clusters wouldsignificantly increase the buckling resistance in terms of withstanding the indentation load.Reverse analysis algorithms are proposed to extract the CNT stiffness by utilizing theindentation force-depth data measured from the prebuckling regimes. The numerical studiescarried out in this paper may be used to guide the nanoindentation experiments; explain andextract useful data from the test; as well as stimulate new experiments.,Journal of Nanomaterials,2008,20
Qa-pagelet: Data preparation techniques for large-scale data analysis of the deep web,James Caverlee; Ling Liu,This paper presents the QA-Pagelet as a fundamental data preparation technique for large-scale data analysis of the deep Web. To support QA-Pagelet extraction; we present the Thorframework for sampling; locating; and partioning the QA-Pagelets from the deep Web. Twounique features of the Thor framework are 1) the novel page clustering for grouping pagesfrom a deep Web source into distinct clusters of control-flow dependent pages and 2) thenovel subtree filtering algorithm that exploits the structural and content similarity at subtreelevel to identify the QA-Pagelets within highly ranked page clusters. We evaluate theeffectiveness of the Thor framework through experiments using both simulation and realdata sets. We show that Thor performs well over millions of deep Web pages and over awide range of sources; including e-commerce sites; general and specialized search …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2005,20
Validating and refining clusters via visual rendering,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,The automatic clustering algorithms are known to work well in dealing with clusters ofregular shapes; eg compact spherical/elongated shapes; but may incur higher error rateswhen dealing with arbitrarily shaped clusters. Although some efforts have been devoted toaddressing the problem of skewed datasets; the problem of handling clusters with irregularshapes is still in its infancy; especially in terms of dimensionality of the datasets and theprecision of the clustering results considered. Not surprisingly; the statistical indices worksineffective in validating clusters of irregular shapes; too. We address the problem ofclustering and validating arbitrarily shaped clusters with a visual framework (VISTA). Themain idea of the VISTA approach is to capitalize on the power of visualization and interactivefeedbacks to encourage domain experts to participate in the clustering revision and …,Data Mining; 2003.

The role of polymorphic reuse mechanisms in schema evolution in an object-oriented database,Ling Liu; Roberto Zicari; W Hursch; Karl J.  Lieberherr,A seamless approach to the incremental design and reuse of object oriented methods andquery specifications is presented. We argue for avoiding or minimizing the effort required formanually reprogramming methods and queries due to schema modifications; anddemonstrate how the role of polymorphic reuse mechanisms is exploited for enhancing theadaptiveness of database programs against schema evolution in an object orienteddatabase. The salient features of our approach are the use of propagation patterns and amechanism for propagation pattern refinement. Propagation patterns are employed as aninteresting specification formalism for modeling operational requirements. They encouragethe reuse of operational specifications against the structural modification of an objectoriented schema. Propagation pattern refinement is suited for the specification of …,IEEE transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,20

Microstructure of the as obtainednanoparticles was characterized by XRD; TEM; and EDS. The particles were then dispersedinto epoxy resin to make conductive and microwave absorbing composites. Results haveshown that the expected γ-FeNi nanoparticles were uniformly deposited a on the surfaces ofCNTs with an average diameter of 16 nm. The epoxy based nanocomposites exhibited semi-conductive behavior and a maximum reflection loss of− 15.4 dB at 16.5 GHz were obtainedwith thin thickness (1.6 mm) and low particles loading (2 wt%) of specimen. With similarmicrowave absorption strength and thickness of specimen; the particles loading used in thisresearch (2 wt%) was much more lower than that reported in previous studies (∼ 30 wt%).,Composites Part B: Engineering,2016,19
Output privacy in data mining,Ting Wang; Ling Liu,Abstract Privacy has been identified as a vital requirement in designing and implementingdata mining systems. In general; privacy preservation demands protecting both input andoutput privacy: the former refers to sanitizing the raw data itself before performing mining;while the latter refers to preventing the mining output (models or patterns) from maliciousinference attacks. This article presents a systematic study on the problem of protectingoutput privacy in data mining; and particularly; stream mining:(i) we highlight the importanceof this problem by showing that even sufficient protection of input privacy does not guaranteethat of output privacy;(ii) we present a general inferencing and disclosure model that exploitsthe intrawindow and interwindow privacy breaches in stream mining output;(iii) we proposea light-weighted countermeasure that effectively eliminates these breaches without …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,19
A general proximity privacy principle,Ting Wang; Shicong Meng; Bhuvan Bamba; Ling Liu; Calton Pu,As an important privacy threat in anonymized data publication; the proximity breach isgaining increasing attention recently. Such breach occurs when an adversary concludeswith high confidence that the sensitive value of a victim individual falls in a set of proximatevalues; even though with low confidence about the exact value. Most existing researchefforts focus on the case of publishing data of specific types; eg;(1) categorical sensitive data(different values have no sense of proximity) or (2) numerical sensitive data (different valuescan be strictly ordered); while failing to address the privacy threats for a much wider range ofdata models; where the similarity of specific values is defined by arbitrary functions. In thiswork; we study the problem of protecting\texts c {general proximity privacy}; with findingsapplicable to most existing data models.

A middleware system for protecting against application level denial of service attacks,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Arun Iyengar; Jian Yin; Ling Liu,Abstract Recently; we have seen increasing numbers of denial of service (DoS) attacksagainst online services and web applications either for extortion reasons; or for impairingand even disabling the competition. These DoS attacks have increasingly targeted theapplication level. Application level DoS attacks emulate the same request syntax andnetwork level traffic characteristics as those of legitimate clients; thereby making the attacksmuch harder to be detected and countered. Moreover; such attacks usually target bottleneckresources such as disk bandwidth; database bandwidth; and CPU resources. In this paperwe propose server-side middleware to counter application level DoS attacks. The key ideabehind our technique is to adaptively vary a client's priority level; and the relative amount ofresources devoted to this client; in response to the client's past requests in a way that …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2006,19
A hybrid topology architecture for P2P systems,Aameek Singh; Ling Liu,A core area of P2P systems research is the topology of the overlay network. It has rangedfrom random unstructured networks like Gnutella to Super-Peer architectures to the recenttrend of structured overlays based on distributed hash tables (DHTs)(I. Stoica et al.;2001);(A. Rowstron et al.; 2001);(S. Ratnasamy et al.; 2001). While the unstructurednetworks have excessive lookup costs and un-guaranteed lookups; the structured systemsoffer no anonymity and delegate control over data items to unrelated peers. In this paper; wepresent an in-the-middle hybrid architecture which uses a mix of both topologies to create adecentralized P2P infrastructure. The system provides scalable and guaranteed lookups inaddition to mutual anonymity and also allows hosting content with the content-owner.

InfoFilter: supporting quality of service for fresh information delivery,Ling Liu; PU Calton; Karsten Schwan; Jonathan Walpole,Abstract With the explosive growth of the Internet and World Wide Web comes a dramaticincrease in the number of users that compete for the shared resources of distributed systemenvironments. Most implementations of application servers and distributed search softwaredo not distinguish among requests to different web pages. This has the implication that thebehavior of application servers is quite unpredictable. Applications that require timelydelivery of fresh information consequently suffer the most in such competitive environments.This paper presents a model of quality of service (QoS) and the design of a QoS-enabledinformation delivery system that implements such a QoS model. The goal of thisdevelopment is two-fold. On one hand; we want to enable users or applications to specifythe desired quality of service requirements for their requests so that application-aware …,New Generation Computing,2000,19

Road-network aware trajectory clustering: Integrating locality; flow; and density,Binh Han; Ling Liu; Edward Omiecinski,Mining trajectory data has been gaining significant interest in recent years. However;existing approaches to trajectory clustering are mainly based on density and Euclideandistance measures. We argue that when the utility of spatial clustering of mobile objecttrajectories is targeted at road-network aware location-based applications; density andEuclidean distance are no longer the effective measures. This is because traffic flows in aroad network and the flow-based density characterization become important factors forfinding interesting trajectory clusters. We propose NEAT-a road-network aware approach forfast and effective clustering of trajectories of mobile objects traveling in road networks. Ourapproach carefully considers the traffic locality characterized by the physical constraints ofthe road network; the traffic flow among consecutive road segments; and the flow-based …,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2015,18

The fastest model (TIP3P) hasa flow rate that is approximately five times faster than the slowest (TIP4P/2005). It is shownthat the flow rate is significantly influenced by the structure taken on by the water moleculesconfined in the nanotube channels. The slower models; TIP4P/2005 and SPC/E; tend tofavor stacked ring arrangements; with the molecules of a ring moving together through thenanotube; in what we term a “cluster-by-cluster” conduction mode. Confined TIP3P waterhas a much weaker tendency to form ring structures; and those that do form are fragile …,The Journal of chemical physics,2014,18

Activity-edge centric multi-label classification for mining heterogeneous information networks,Yang Zhou; Ling Liu,Abstract Multi-label classification of heterogeneous information networks has receivedrenewed attention in social network analysis. In this paper; we present an activity-edgecentric multi-label classification framework for analyzing heterogeneous informationnetworks with three unique features. First; we model a heterogeneous information network interms of a collaboration graph and multiple associated activity graphs. We introduce a novelconcept of vertex-edge homophily in terms of both vertex labels and edge labels andtransform a general collaboration graph into an activity-based collaboration multigraph byaugmenting its edges with class labels from each activity graph through activity-based edgeclassification. Second; we utilize the label vicinity to capture the pairwise vertex closenessbased on the labeling on the activity-based collaboration multigraph. We incorporate both …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,18

On map matching of wireless positioning data: a selective look-ahead approach,Matt Weber; Ling Liu; Kipp Jones; Michael J Covington; Lama Nachman; Peter Pesti,Abstract Wireless Positioning Systems (WPS) are popular alternative localization methods;especially in dense urban areas where GPS has known limitations. Map-matching (MM) hasbeen used as an approach to improve the accuracy of the estimated locations of WiFiAccess Points (APs); and thus the accuracy of a wireless positioning system. Large-scalewireless positioning differs from satellite based positioning in at least two aspects: First;wireless positioning systems typically derive the location estimates based on war-drivingaccess point (AP) data. Second; the locations of the AP beacons are not generally known atthe same precision as that of the satellite locations. This results in lower accuracy and alower confidence factor in the use of wireless positioning. This paper presents a fastselective look-ahead map-matching technique; called SLAMM.

On processing location based top-k queries in the wireless broadcasting system,Ha Rim Jung; Byung Ku Cho; Yon Dohn Chung; Ling Liu,Abstract In this paper; we explore the problem of processing a novel type of location basedqueries; named the location based top-k query; which involves both of spatial and non-spatial specifications for data objects in the wireless broadcasting system. We introduce twomethods for processing location based top-k queries on the broadcast stream. In the firstmethod; the search algorithm runs on the broadcast aggregate R-tree (aR-tree). However;the aR-tree may deteriorate the search performance; especially in terms of the tuning time.With this problem in mind; we propose a novel index structure; called the bit-vector R-tree(bR-tree); which stores additional bit-vector information to facilitate processing of locationbased top-k queries. The search algorithm on the broadcast bR-tree is also described. Oursimulation experiments demonstrate that the bR-tree method clearly outperforms the aR …,proceedings of the 2010 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2010,18
A survey of multiplicative perturbation for privacy-preserving data mining,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,The major challenge of data perturbation is to achieve the desired balance between thelevel of privacy guarantee and the level of data utility. Data privacy and data utility arecommonly considered as a pair of conflicting requirements in privacy-preserving data miningsystems and applications. Multiplicative perturbation algorithms aim at improving dataprivacy while maintaining the desired level of data utility by selectively preserving the miningtask and model specific information during the data perturbation process. By preserving thetask and model specific information; a set of “transformation-invariant data mining models”can be applied to the perturbed data directly; achieving the required model accuracy. Oftena multiplicative perturbation algorithm may find multiple data transformations that preservethe required data utility. Thus the next major challenge is to find a good transformation …,*,2008,18
Preparation and Characterization of Core—Shell Structured Nanofibers by Coaxial Electrospinning,Xiao Jian Han; Zhengming Huang; Chuanglong He; Ling Liu,Functional core—shell structured composite nanofibers were prepared by electrospinningtwo polymer solutions in a coaxial system. The core—shell structured nanofibers werecomprised of varying concentrations of polyurethane (PU; shell) and a Nylon-6 (core). Theresultant nanofibers were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy;transmission electron microscopy; fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and tensilemechanical test. Furthermore; water vapor transmission rate and pliability of cotton fabricscoated with non-woven mats of the core—shell structured nanofibers were also measured.The results indicated that it is feasible to attach composite nanofibers onto a textile substrate.,High performance polymers,2007,18
A new document placement scheme for cooperative caching on the internet,Lakshmish Ramaswamy; Ling Liu,Most existing work on cooperative caching has been-focused on serving missescollaboratively. Very few have studied the effect of cooperation on document placementschemes and its potential enhancements on cache hit ratio and latency reduction. In thispaper we propose a new document placement scheme; called the Expiration Age basedscheme (EA scheme); which takes into account the contentions at individual caches in orderto limit the replication of documents within a cache group and increase document hit ratio.The main idea of this new scheme is to view the aggregate disk space of the cache group asa global resource of the group; and uses the concept of cache expiration age to measure thecontention of individual caches. The decision of whether to cache a document at a proxy ismade collectively; among the caches that already have a copy of this document. The …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2002.

Bombarding graphene with oxygen ions: combining effects of incident angle and ion energy to control defect generation,Zhitong Bai; Lin Zhang; Ling Liu,Ion bombardment is a key physical process in the ion implantation and irradiation ofgraphene; with important implications for tuning graphene's electronic properties and forunderstanding the material's behavior in irradiative environment. Using molecular dynamicswith a reactive force field; this work systematically investigates the influence of the incidentangle on the generation of defects and vacancies during the bombardment process. It isfound that larger incident angles (between the incident line and the surface of graphene)ranging from 70° to 90° are desired for substitution and single vacancy; whereas smallerincident angles ranging from 30° to 50° are favored for forming double vacancies; multiplevacancies; and in-plane disorder. Oxygen ions with the incident angle of 70° produce thehighest probability of ion substitution; and the ions at 40–60 eV and 70° yield the highest …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,2015,17
Location privacy with road network mix-zones,Balaji Palanisamy; Ling Liu; Kisung Lee; Aameek Singh; Yuzhe Tang,Mix-zones are recognized as an alternative and complementary approach to spatialcloaking based approach to location privacy protection. Mix-zones break the continuity oflocation exposure by ensuring that users' movements cannot be traced while they reside in amix-zone. In this paper we provide an overview of various known attacks that make mix-zones on road networks vulnerable and illustrate a set of counter measures to make roadnetwork mix-zones attack resilient. Concretely; we categorize the vulnerabilities of roadnetwork mix-zones into two classes: one due to the road network characteristics and usermobility; and the other due to the temporal; spatial and semantic correlations of locationqueries. For instance; the timing information of users' entry and exit into a mix-zone providesinformation to launch a timing attack.

Harvesting energy from low-grade heat based on nanofluids,Baoxing Xu; Ling Liu; Hyuck Lim; Yu Qiao; Xi Chen,Abstract Conventional thermoelectric materials have limited capability of scavengingelectrical energy from low-grade heat (LGH). Based on the capacitive effect of liquid–solidinterface in a nanoconfinement; we investigate a novel energy harvesting mechanism whichis based on the thermally sensitive ion/charge distribution of electrolytes confined innanopores. The mechanism is elucidated using comprehensive molecular dynamics (MD)simulations. The effective thermal sensitivity; effective figure of merit; and thermal-to-electricenergy conversion efficiency of the nanofluidic system compare favorably with respect to theconventional thermoelectric materials. The result of a preliminary thermal-to-electricalenergy conversion experiment on a nanoporous carbon is presented; to qualitatively showthe feasibility of the approach.,Nano Energy,2012,17
Fine-grained access control of personal data,Ting Wang; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Abstract The immensity and variety of personal information (eg; profile; photo; andmicroblog) on social sites require access control policies tailored to individuals' privacyneeds. Today such policies are still mainly specified manually by ordinary users; which isusually coarse-grained; tedious; and error-prone. This paper presents the design;implementation; and evaluation of an automated access control policy specification tool;XACCESS; that helps non-expert users effectively specify who should have access to whichpart of their data. A series of key features distinguish XACCESS from prior work: 1) it adoptsa role-based access control model (instead of the conventional rule-based paradigm) tocapture the implicit privacy/interest preference of social site users; 2) it employs a novelhybrid mining method to extract a set of semantically interpretable; functional" social roles …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2012,17

First; we introduce the concept ofWeighted Coverage Density as a categorical similarity measure for efficient clustering oftransactional datasets. The concept of weighted coverage density is intuitive and it allowsthe weight of each item in a cluster to be changed dynamically according to the occurrencesof items. Second; we develop the weighted coverage density measure based clusteringalgorithm; a fast; memory-efficient; and scalable clustering algorithm for analyzingtransactional data. Third; we introduce two clustering validation metrics and show that thesedomain specific clustering evaluation metrics are critical to capture the transactionalsemantics in clustering analysis.

Countering feedback sparsity and manipulation in reputation systems,Li Xiong; Ling Liu; Mustaque Ahamad,Reputation systems provide a promising way for building trust through social control incollaborative communities by harnessing the community knowledge in the form of feedback.However; reputation systems also introduce vulnerabilities due to potential manipulations bydishonest or malicious players. In this paper; we focus on two closely related problems-feedback sparsity and potential feedback manipulations-and propose a feedback similaritybased inference framework. We perform extensive evaluations of various algorithmiccomponents of the framework and evaluate their effectiveness on countering feedbacksparsity in the presence of feedback manipulations.,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing; 2007.

Efficient and secure search of enterprise file systems,Aameek Singh; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,With fast paced growth of enterprise data; quickly locating relevant content has become acritical IT capability. Research has shown that nearly 85% of enterprise data lies in flatfilesystems [12] that allow multiple users and user groups with different access privileges tounderlying data. Any search tool for such large scale systems needs to be efficient and yetcognizant of the access control semantics imposed by the underlying filesystem. Currentmultiuser enterprise search techniques use two disjoint search and access-controlcomponents by creating a single system-wide index and simply filtering search results foraccess control. This approach is ineffective as the index and query statistics subtly leakprivate information. The other available approach of using separate indices for each user isundesirable as it not only increases disk consumption due to shared files; but also …,*,2007,17
A client-transparent approach to defend against denial of service attacks,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Arun Iyengar; Jian Yin; Ling Liu,Denial of service (DoS) attacks attempt to consume a server's resources (networkbandwidth; computing power; main memory; disk bandwidth etc.) to near exhaustion so thatthere are no resources left to handle requests from legitimate clients. An effective solution todefend against DoS attacks is to filter DoS attack requests at the earliest point (say; the Website's firewall); before they consume much of the server's resources. Most defenses againstDoS attacks attempt to filter requests from inauthentic clients before they consume much ofthe server's resources. Client authentication using techniques like IPSec or SSL may oftenrequire changes to the client-side software and may additionally require superuserprivileges at the client for deployment. Further; using digital signatures (as in SSL) makesverification very expensive; thereby making the verification process itself a viable DoS …,Reliable Distributed Systems; 2006.

Quality-aware dstributed data delivery for continuous query services,Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,Abstract We consider the problem of distributed continuous data delivery services in anoverlay network of heterogeneous nodes. Each node in the system can be a source for anynumber of data streams and at the same time be a consumer node that is receiving streamssourced at other nodes. A consumer node may define a filter on a source stream such thatonly the desired portion of the stream is delivered; minimizing the amount of unnecessarybandwidth consumption. By heterogeneous; we mean that nodes not only may have varyingnetwork bandwidths and computing resources but also different interests in terms of thefilters and the rates of the data streams they are interested in. Our objective is to construct anefficient stream delivery network in which nodes cooperate in forwarding data streams in thepresence of constrained resources. We formalize this distributed stream delivery problem …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,17
Tourism and the value of culture in regions,Juanita C Liu,Tourism can commoditize landscapes by dividing up space into a diversity of themedenvironments; thus creating a new sense of place. For instance; Hawaii island is called ''TheBig Island;''Oahu is ''The Gathering Place;''and Kauai is ''The Garden Island.''Maui; formerlyknown as ''The Valley Island;''has recently been renamed ''The Magic Island;''presumablyincreasing the mystique of the island that captures the highest average tourist spending inthe Hawaiian chain. Regions are also being de-differentiated by visual media and givennew place names that may have nothing to do with history or heritage. Examples ofmediatized locations are Salzburg's site of the Sound of Music; Jurassic Park on Kaua'sNapali Coast; and the Lord of the Rings site in New Zealand.

Effect of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in morphine-induced tau protein hyperphosphorylation,Minghui Cao; Funing Liu; Fengtao Ji; Jianjun Liang; Ling Liu; Qiang Wu; Tinghuai Wang,Abstract Opioids have been widely used in clinical practice as potent pain relievers forcenturies. However; opioids have many deleterious effects. It has been reported that opioidincreases tau protein phosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is also a pathologicalfeature of Alzheimer's disease and other chronic neurodegenerative disorders. However; theunderlying mechanism by which opioids enhance tau phosphorylation is not yet known. Inthis study; we treated rat embryo cortical neurons with morphine and observed its effect ontau phosphorylation. We found that morphine induced tau hyperphosphorylation andincreased levels of phospho-JNK and phospho-p38; these effects were blocked bypretreatment with naloxone.

Microscopic social influence,Ting Wang; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Dakshi Agrawal; Ling Liu,Abstract Social influences; the phenomena that one individual's actions can induce similarbehaviors among his/her friends via their social ties; have been observed prevailingly insocially networked systems. While most existing work focuses on studying general; macro-level influence (eg; diffusion); equally important is to understand social influence atmicroscopic scales (ie; at the granularity of single individuals; actions; and time-stamps);which may benefit a range of applications. We propose μSI; a microscopic social-influencemodel wherein: individuals' actions are modeled as temporary interactions between socialnetwork (formed by individuals) and object network (formed by targets of actions); oneindividual's actions influence his/her friends in a dynamic; network-wise manner (ie;dependent on both social and object networks).

Onefundamental capability of such information network is to support efficient; privacy-preserving(for both users and providers) search over the distributed; access controlled healthcaredocuments. In this paper we focus on addressing the privacy concerns of content providers;that is; the search should not reveal the specific association between contents and providers(aka content privacy). We propose SS-PPI; a novel privacy-preserving index abstraction;which; in conjunction of distributed access control-enforced search protocols; providestheoretically guaranteed protection of content privacy.

In this paper; we propose a novel method to find a set ofcandidate optimal number Ks of clusters in transactional datasets. Concretely; we proposeTransactional-cluster-modes Dissimilarity based on the concept of coverage density as anintuitive transactional inter-cluster dissimilarity measure. Based on the above measure; anagglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is developed and the Merging DissimilarityIndexes; which are generated in hierarchical cluster merging processes; are used to find thecandidate optimal number Ks of clusters of transactional data. Our experimental results onboth synthetic and real data show that the new method often effectively estimates thenumber of clusters of transactional data.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2009,16

Lira: Lightweight; region-aware load shedding in mobile CQ systems,Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu; Kun-Lung Wu; S Yu Philip,To provide high-quality results for location-based; continual queries (CQs) in a mobilesystem; the query processor usually demands receiving frequent position updates from themobile nodes. However; processing frequent updates often causes the query processor tobecome overloaded; under which updates must be dropped randomly; bringing down thequery-result accuracy and negating the benefits of frequent updates. In this paper; wedevelop LIRA-a lightweight; region-aware load-shedding technique for preventivelyreducing the position-update load of a query processor; while maintaining high-quality queryresults. Instead of receiving too many updates and then randomly dropping some of them;LIRA uses a region-aware partitioning mechanism to identify the most beneficial sheddingregions to cut down the position updates sent by the mobile nodes within those regions …,Data Engineering; 2007.

Using Domain Ontologies to Help Track Data Provenance.,Renato Fileto; Claudia Bauzer Medeiros; Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Eduardo Delgado Assad,Abstract Traditional techniques for tracking data provenance have difficulty adapting to thedynamics of the Web. This paper proposes a scheme for provenance estimation; based ondomain ontologies. This scheme is part of the POESIA approach for multi-step integration ofsemi-structured data. The ontologies used for tracking provenance also help to describe;discover; reuse and integrate data and services. In contrast to traditional techniques; thisscheme derives data provenance with fewer annotations at the extensional level and thuslower maintenance costs. Additionally; it promotes the use of ontologies to categorize andcorrelate scopes of data sets; thereby capturing the operational semantics of data integrationprocesses.,SBBD,2003,16
Multi-criteria decision making with skyline computation,Wonik Choi; Ling Liu; Boseon Yu,Multi-criteria decision making is one of the most critical and yet most challengingcomponents in modern enterprise business intelligence. It is well known that complexbusiness decisions are often made based on multi-dimensional criteria. Thecompetitiveness of optimal business decision making typically resorts to finding a good trade-off among many different and possibly contradicting criteria; eg; maximum profit; minimumprice; minimum resource consumption.

While it may be impossible to precisely quantifyinformation flows between two entities (eg; two friends in a social network); this paperpresents a first attempt towards leveraging recent advances in modeling socio-informationnetworks to develop a statistical risk estimation paradigm for quantifying such insider threats.In the context of socio-information networks; our models estimate the following likelihoods:prior flow-has a subject $ s $ acquired covert access to object o via the networks? posteriorflow-if s is granted access to o; what is its impact on information flows between subject s' andobject o'? network evolution-how will a newly created social relationship between s and s' …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2011,15
Voting systems with trust mechanisms in cyberspace: Vulnerabilities and defenses,Qinyuan Feng; Yan Lindsay Sun; Ling Liu; Yafei Yang; Yafei Dai,With the popularity of voting systems in cyberspace; there is growing evidence that currentvoting systems can be manipulated by fake votes. This problem has attracted manyresearchers working on guarding voting systems in two areas: relieving the effect ofdishonest votes by evaluating the trust of voters; and limiting the resources that can be usedby attackers; such as the number of voters and the number of votes. In this paper; we arguethat powering voting systems with trust and limiting attack resources are not enough. Wepresent a novel attack named as Reputation Trap (RepTrap). Our case study andexperiments show that this new attack needs much less resources to manipulate the votingsystems and has a much higher success rate compared with existing attacks. We furtheridentify the reasons behind this attack and propose two defense schemes accordingly. In …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,15
Butterfly: Protecting output privacy in stream mining,Ting Wang; Ling Liu,Privacy preservation in data mining demands protecting both input and output privacy. Theformer refers to sanitizing the raw data itself before performing mining. The latter refers topreventing the mining output (model/pattern) from malicious pattern-based inference attacks.The preservation of input privacy does not necessarily lead to that of output privacy. Thiswork studies the problem of protecting output privacy in the context of frequent patternmining over data streams. After exposing the privacy breaches existing in current streammining systems; we propose Butterfly; a light-weighted countermeasure that can effectivelyeliminate these breaches without explicitly detecting them; meanwhile minimizing the loss ofthe output accuracy. We further optimize the basic scheme by taking account of two types ofsemantic constraints; aiming at maximally preserving utility-related semantics while …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Countering Targeted File Attacks Using LocationGuard.,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Abstract Serverless file systems; exemplified by CFS; Farsite and OceanStore; havereceived significant attention from both the industry and the research community. These filesystems store files on a large collection of untrusted nodes that form an overlay network.They use cryptographic techniques to maintain file confidentiality and integrity frommalicious nodes. Unfortunately; cryptographic techniques cannot protect a file holder from aDenial-of-Service (DoS) or a host compromise attack. Hence; most of these distributed filesystems are vulnerable to targeted file attacks; wherein an adversary attempts to attack asmall (chosen) set of files by attacking the nodes that host them.

This defines a human involved" clustering-analysis/evaluation" iteration.

Multi-level association rule mining: an object-oriented approach based on dynamic hierarchies,Scott Fortin; Ling Liu; Randy Geobel,Abstract Previous studies in data mining have yielded e cient algorithms for discoveringassociation rules. But it is well-known problem that the two controlling measures of supportand con dence; when used as the sole de nition of relevant association rules; are tooinclusive| interesting rules are included with many uninteresting cases. A typical approach tothis problem is to augment the thresholds with domainspeci c knowledge; in the form of oneor more business-goal-driven classi cation taxonomies. Most existing proposals use therelational approach to organize and maintain the required multi-level concept hierarchiesand their domain-dependent components. We present the motivation for a necessaryextension to existing uses of such multi-level hierarchies; and describe an implementationthat is better suited than the typical relational paradigm for focusing the search and …,*,1996,15

Fault-tolerant scheduling for real-time scientific workflows with elastic resource provisioning in virtualized clouds,Xiaomin Zhu; Ji Wang; Hui Guo; Dakai Zhu; Laurence T Yang; Ling Liu,Clouds are becoming an important platform for scientific workflow applications. However;with many nodes being deployed in clouds; managing reliability of resources becomes acritical issue; especially for the real-time scientific workflow execution where deadlinesshould be satisfied. Therefore; fault tolerance in clouds is extremely essential. The PB(primary backup) based scheduling is a popular technique for fault tolerance and haseffectively been used in the cluster and grid computing. However; applying this technique forreal-time workflows in a virtualized cloud is much more complicated and has rarely beenstudied. In this paper; we address this problem. We first establish a real-time workflow fault-tolerant model that extends the traditional PB model by incorporating the cloudcharacteristics. Based on this model; we develop approaches for task allocation and …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2016,14
Volley: Violation likelihood based state monitoring for datacenters,Shicong Meng; Arun K Iyengar; Isabelle M Rouvellou; Ling Liu,Distributed state monitoring plays a critical role in Cloud datacenter management. Onefundamental problem in distributed state monitoring is to minimize the monitoring cost whilemaximizing the monitoring accuracy at the same time. In this paper; we present Volley; aviolation likelihood based approach for efficient distributed state monitoring in Clouddatacenters. Volley achieves both efficiency and accuracy with a flexible monitoringframework which uses dynamic monitoring intervals determined by the likelihood ofdetecting state violations. Volley consists of three unique techniques. It utilizes efficient node-level adaptation algorithms that minimize monitoring cost with controlled accuracy. Volleyalso employs a distributed scheme that coordinates the adaptation on multiple monitornodes of the same task for optimal task-level efficiency. Furthermore; it enables multi-task …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2013,14
Distributed line graphs: A universal technique for designing dhts based on arbitrary regular graphs,Yiming Zhang; Ling Liu,Most proposed DHTs engage certain topology maintenance mechanisms specific to thestatic graphs on which they are based. The designs of these mechanisms are complicatedand repeated with graph-relevant concerns. In this paper; we propose the “distributed linegraphs”(DLG); a universal technique for designing DHTs based on arbitrary regular graphs.Using DLG; the main features of the initial graphs are preserved; and thus people candesign a new DHT by simply choosing the graph with desirable features and applying DLGto it. We demonstrate the power of DLG by illustrating four DLG-enabled DHTs based ondifferent graphs; namely; Kautz; de Bruijn; butterfly; and hypertree graphs. The effectivenessof our proposals is demonstrated through analysis; simulation; and implementation.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,14
Preserving caller anonymity in voice-over-ip networks,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu; Arun Iyengar,Applications such as VoIP need to provide anonymity to clients while maintaining lowlatency to satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements. Existing solutions for providinganonymity such as mix networks are not well suited to applications like VoIP; SSH; andgaming which require low communication latency. This paper investigates the problem of on-demand construction of QoS sensitive routes on anonymizing networks using the VoIPapplication. We first describe triangulation based timing analysis attacks on shortest pathroute set up protocols. We show that even when a small fraction (sim1) of the network ismalicious; the adversary can infer the source (caller) with reasonably high probability.Second; we describe random walk based route set up protocols that significantly improveanonymity while satisfying latency-based QoS guarantees.

Optimizing multiple distributed stream queries using hierarchical network partitions,Sangeetha Seshadri; Vibhore Kumar; Brian F Cooper; Ling Liu,We consider the problem of query optimization in distributed data stream systems wheremultiple continuous queries may be executing simultaneously. In order to achieve the bestperformance; query planning (such as join ordering) must be considered in conjunction withdeployment planning (eg; assigning operators to physical nodes with optimal ordering).However; such a combination involves not only a large number of network nodes but alsomany query operators; resulting in an extremely large search space for optimal solutions.Our paper aims at addressing this problem by utilizing hierarchical network partitions. Wepropose two algorithms-top-down and bottom-up which utilize hierarchical network partitionsto provide scalable query optimization. Formal analysis is presented to establish the boundson the search-space and to show the sub-optimality of our algorithms. Through …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2007. IPDPS 2007.

In loose terms; the fair exchange problem is defined asatomically exchanging electronic items between two parties. All the known fair exchangeprotocols today utilize a centralized trusted third party server either actively or passively. Inthis paper; we propose a distributed protocol for exchange of electronic items usinguntrusted servers. We perform detailed security analysis and show that the protocolguarantees effectiveness and fairness with Byzantine failures of up to one third of theuntrusted servers.

Efficient and customizable data partitioning framework for distributed big RDF data processing in the cloud,Kisung Lee; Ling Liu; Yuzhe Tang; Qi Zhang; Yang Zhou,Big data business can leverage and benefit from the Clouds; the most optimized; shared;automated; and virtualized computing infrastructures. One of the important challenges inprocessing big data in the Clouds is how to effectively partition the big data to ensureefficient distributed processing of the data. In this paper we present a Scalable and yetcustomizable data PArtitioning framework; called SPA; for distributed processing of big RDFgraph data. We choose big RDF datasets as our focus of the investigation for two reasons.First; the Linking Open Data cloud has put forwards a good number of big RDF datasets withtens of billions of triples and hundreds of millions of links.

Road network mix-zones for anonymous location based services,Balaji Palanisamy; Sindhuja Ravichandran; Ling Liu; Binh Han; Kisung Lee; Calton Pu,We present MobiMix; a road network based mix-zone framework to protect location privacyof mobile users traveling on road networks. An alternative and complementary approach tospatial cloaking based location privacy protection is to break the continuity of locationexposure by introducing techniques; such as mix-zones; where no applications can traceuser movements. However; existing mixzone proposals fail to provide effective mix-zoneconstruction and placement algorithms that are resilient to timing and transition attacks. InMobiMix; mix-zones are constructed and placed by carefully taking into consideration ofmultiple factors; such as the geometry of the zones; the statistical behavior of the userpopulation; the spatial constraints on movement patterns of the users; and the temporal andspatial resolution of the location exposure.

Mode II interlaminar delamination of composite laminates incorporating with polymer ultrathin fibers,Ling Liu; Zheng‐Ming Huang; Gui‐Ying Xu; Yan‐Min Liang; Guo‐Hua Dong,Abstract This study makes use of electrospinning to produce epoxy polymer ultrathin fibers.Those fibers were collected as nonwoven sheets with various thicknesses. The collectedultrathin fibrous sheets (UFS) were incorporated into ply interfaces of a glass/epoxycomposite laminate. End-notch flexure (ENF) specimens were employed to measure themode II interlaminar fracture toughness (G IIC) of the resulting laminate. Scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) was carried out to investigate the fracture surface and fracturemechanism of tested samples. Results indicate that there were some reinforcing effects ofthe UFS on the G IIC when the thickness of the sheets was not more than 0.13 mm for asingle sheet and 0.06 mm for multi-sheets incorporated. The mechanical properties werequickly decreased and became poorer when a higher thickness of the sheets was used …,Polymer Composites,2008,13

Trigger grouping: A scalable approach to large scale information monitoring,Wei Tang; Ling Liu; Calton Pu,Information change monitoring services are becoming increasingly useful as more and moreinformation is published on the Web. A major research challenge is how to make the servicescalable to serve millions of monitoring requests. Such services usually use soft triggers tomodel users' monitoring requests. We have developed an effective trigger grouping schemeto optimize the trigger processing. The main idea behind this scheme is to reduce repeatedcomputation by grouping monitoring requests of similar structures together. In this paper; weevaluate our approach using both measurements on real systems and simulations. Thestudy shows significant performance gains using the trigger grouping approach. Moreover;the gains are critically dependent on group size and group size distribution (eg; Zipf). Wealso discuss the benefit; trade-off; and runtime characteristics of the proposed approach.,Network Computing and Applications; 2003. NCA 2003. Second IEEE International Symposium on,2003,13

miR-9 and miR-124 synergistically affect regulation of dendritic branching via the AKT/GSK3β pathway by targeting Rap2a,Qian Xue; Caiyong Yu; Yan Wang; Ling Liu; Kun Zhang; Chao Fang; Fangfang Liu; Ganlan Bian; Bing Song; Angang Yang; Gong Ju; Jian Wang,Abstract A single microRNA (miRNA) can regulate expression of multiple proteins; andexpression of an individual protein may be controlled by numerous miRNAs. This regulatorypattern strongly suggests that synergistic effects of miRNAs play critical roles in regulatingbiological processes. miR-9 and miR-124; two of the most abundant miRNAs in themammalian nervous system; have important functions in neuronal development. In thisstudy; we identified the small GTP-binding protein Rap2a as a common target of both miR-9and miR-124. miR-9 and miR-124 together; but neither miRNA alone; strongly suppressedRap2a; thereby promoting neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and dendriticbranching of differentiated neurons.

Crowd trust: A context-aware trust model for worker selection in crowdsourcing environments,Bin Ye; Yan Wang; Ling Liu,On a crowd sourcing platform consisting of task publishers and workers; it is critical for a taskpublisher to select trustworthy workers to solve human intelligence tasks (HITs). Currently;the prevalent trust evaluation mechanism employs the overall approval rate of HITs; withwhich dishonest workers can easily succeed in pursuing the maximal profit by quickly givingplausible answers or counterfeiting HITs approval rates. In crowd sourcing environments; aworker's trustworthiness varies in contexts; ie It varies in different types of tasks and differentreward amounts of tasks. Thus; we propose two classifications based on task types and taskreward amount respectively. On the basis of the classifications; we propose a trustevaluation model; which consists of two types of context-aware trust: task type based trust(TaTrust) and reward amount based trust (RaTrust). Then; we model trustworthy worker …,Web Services (ICWS); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,12

The method is called open coordination protocol(OCP); and is applied to construct many variants of commit-transaction; as well as distributedsplit-transaction and distributed join-group. OCP adopts a modular decomposition of popularcoordination protocols (eg; two-phase commit) into microprotocols; and then choosesappropriate microprotocols to build new coordination protocols or extended transactionprimitives with desired features (eg; split-transaction with read-only optimization).

To serve such data in a cost-effective manner; apopular new paradigm is to outsource it to the cloud and store it in a scalable key-valuestore while serving a large user base. Due to the limited trust in third-party cloudinfrastructures; data owners have to sign the data stream so that the data users can verify theauthenticity of query results from the cloud.

Effective mix-zone anonymization techniques for mobile travelers,Balaji Palanisamy; Ling Liu,Abstract Mix-zones are recognized as an alternative and complementary approach to spatialcloaking based location privacy protection. Unlike spatial cloaking techniques that perturbthe location resolution through location k-anonymization; mix-zones break the continuity oflocation exposure by ensuring that users' movements cannot be traced while they are insidea mix-zone. In this paper we provide an overview of some known attacks that make mix-zones on road networks vulnerable and discuss a set of counter measures to make roadnetwork mix-zones attack-resilient. Concretely; we categorize the vulnerabilities of roadnetwork mix-zones into two classes: one due to the road network characteristics and usermobility; and the other due to the temporal; spatial and semantic correlations of locationqueries. We propose efficient road network mix-zone construction techniques that are …,GeoInformatica,2014,11

Peer-to-peer VoIP (voice over IP)networks; exemplified by Skype; are becoming increasingly popular due to their significantcost advantage and richer call forwarding features than traditional public switched telephonenetworks.

Privacy in VoIP networks: A k-anonymity approach,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Arun Iyengar; Ling Liu,Peer-to-peer VoIP (voice over IP) networks; exemplified by Skype; are becomingincreasingly popular due to their significant cost advantage and richer call forwardingfeatures than traditional public switched telephone networks. One of the most importantfeatures of a VoIP network is privacy (for VoIP clients). Unfortunately; most peer-to-peer VoIPnetworks neither provide personalization nor guarantee a quantifiable privacy level. In thispaper we propose novel flow analysis attacks that demonstrate the vulnerabilities of peer-to-peer VoIP networks to privacy attacks. We present detailed experimental evaluation thatdemonstrates these attacks quantifying performance and scalability degradation.,INFOCOM 2009; IEEE,2009,11
Spam-resilient web rankings via influence throttling,James Caverlee; Steve Webb; Ling Liu,Web search is one of the most critical applications for managing the massive amount ofdistributed Web content. Due to the overwhelming reliance on Web search; there is a rise inefforts to manipulate (or spam) Web search engines. In this paper; we develop a spam-resilient ranking model that promotes a source-based view of the Web. One of the mostsalient features of our spam-resilient ranking algorithm is the concept of influence throttling.We show how to utilize influence throttling to counter Web spam that aims at manipulatinglink-based ranking systems; especially PageRank-like systems. Through formal analysisand experimental evaluation; we show the effectiveness and robustness of our spam-resilient ranking model in comparison with existing Web algorithms such as PageRank.,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2007.

Reliable peer-to-peer information monitoring through replication,Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,A key challenge in peer-to-peer computing systems is to provide a decentralized and yetreliable service on top of a network of loosely coupled; weakly connected and possiblyunreliable peers. This paper presents an effective dynamic passive replication schemedesigned to provide reliable service in PeerCQ; a decentralized and self-configurable peer-to-peer Internet information monitoring system. We first describe the design of a distributedreplication scheme; which enables reliable processing of long-running informationmonitoring requests in an environment of inherently unreliable peers. Then we present ananalytical model to discuss its fault tolerance properties. A set of initial experiments isreported; showing the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.,Reliable Distributed Systems; 2003.

Page digest for large-scale web services,Daniel Rocco; David Buttler; Ling Liu,We introduce Page Digest; a mechanism for efficient storage and processing of Webdocuments. The Page Digest design encourages a clean separation of the structuralelements of Web documents from their content. Its encoding transformation produces manyof the advantages of traditional string digest schemes yet remains invertible withoutintroducing significant additional cost or complexity. Using the Page Digest encoding canprovide at least an order of magnitude speedup when traversing a Web document ascompared to using a standard document object model implementation. Our experimentsshow that change detection using Page Digest operates in linear time; offering 75%improvement in execution performance compared with existing systems.

e-ppi: Locator service in information networks with personalized privacy preservation,Yuzhe Tang; Ling Liu; Arun Iyengar; Kisung Lee; Qi Zhang,In emerging information networks; having a privacy preserving index (or PPI) is criticallyimportant for locating information of interest for data sharing across autonomous providerswhile preserving privacy. An understudied problem for PPI techniques is how to providecontrollable privacy preservation; given the innate difference of privacy concerns regardingdifferent data owners. In this paper we present a personalized privacy preserving index;coined ε-PPI; which guarantees quantitative privacy preservation differentiated by personalidentities. We devise a new common-identity attack that breaks existing PPI's and proposean identity-mixing protocol against the attack in ε-PPI. The proposed ε-PPI constructionprotocol is the first without any trusted third party and/or trust relationships betweenproviders.

Replica-aided load balancing in overlay networks,Yuehua Wang; Zhong Zhou; Ling Liu; Wei Wu,Abstract In recent years; there have been rapid advances in network infrastructure andtechnologies for end-user communication. However; because of network dynamics andresource limitation; providing scalable end-user communication services is challengingwhen the applications are utilized on a large-scale. To address this challenge; a replica-aided load balancing scheme (RALB) is proposed for enabling the nodes in an overlaynetworks to support the communication applications for a large number of users. This papermakes three unique contributions. First; we study the existing load balancing schemes andidentify their weakness in handling time-varying workloads with frequent load fluctuations.Second; we introduce a sophisticated cost model for load balancing cost estimation; whichcaptures the dependencies between the factors (eg; the load; message number; and link …,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2013,10
Effects of anion size and concentration on electrolyte invasion into molecular-sized nanopores,Ling Liu; Xi Chen; Taewan Kim; Aijie Han; Yu Qiao,Abstract When an electrolyte solution is pressurized into a molecular-sized nanopore;oppositely charged ions are strongly inclined to aggregate; which effectively reduces the ionsolubility to zero. Inside the restrictive confinement; a unique quasi-periodic structure isformed where the paired ion couples are periodically separated by a number of watermolecules. As the anion size or ion concentration varies; the geometrical characteristics ofthe confined ion structure would change considerably; leading to a significant variation inthe transport pressure. Both experimental and simulation results indicate that; contradictoryto the prediction of conventional theory; infiltration pressure decreases as the anionsbecome larger.,New Journal of Physics,2010,10
Unified analytical models for location management costs and optimum design of location areas,Eladio Martin; Ling Liu; Matt Weber; Peter Pesti; M Woodward,Within collaborative computing; computer mediated communications are evolving rapidlythanks to the development of new technologies. The facilitation of awareness and discoveryof users in the communications networks is a key requirement for the success of thesecollaborative systems. Besides the need for location awareness; the emergence ofheterogeneous wireless environments; where users can freely roam; is making LocationManagement (LM) an increasingly important topic for network operators. In this paper; weuse a general model for LM signaling costs to obtain analytical expressions for theiroptimization.

Scalable key management algorithms for location-based services,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Arun Iyengar; Jian Yin; Ling Liu,Abstract Secure media broadcast over the Internet poses unique security challenges. Oneimportant problem for public broadcast location-based services (LBS) is to enforce accesscontrol on a large number of subscribers. In such a system; a user typically subscribes to anLBS for a time interval (a; b) and a spatial region (x bl; y bl; x tr; y tr) according to a 3-dimensional spatial-temporal authorization model. In this paper; we argue that currentapproaches to access control using key management protocols are not scalable. Ourproposal; STauth; minimizes the number of keys that needs to be distributed and is thusscalable to a large number of subscribers and the dimensionality of the authorization model.We also demonstrate applications of our algorithm to quantified-temporal access control(using∀ and∃ quantifications) and partial-order tree-based authorization models.

CPU load shedding for binary stream joins,Bugra Gedik; Kun-Lung Wu; S Yu Philip; Ling Liu,Abstract We present an adaptive load shedding approach for windowed stream joins. Incontrast to the conventional approach of dropping tuples from the input streams; we explorethe concept of selective processing for load shedding. We allow stream tuples to be stored inthe windows and shed excessive CPU load by performing the join operations; not on theentire set of tuples within the windows; but on a dynamically changing subset of tuples thatare learned to be highly beneficial. We support such dynamic selective processing throughthree forms of runtime adaptations: adaptation to input stream rates; adaptation to timecorrelation between the streams and adaptation to join directions. Our load sheddingapproach enables us to integrate utility-based load shedding with time correlation-basedload shedding. Indexes are used to further speed up the execution of stream joins …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2007,10
Agyaat: Providing Mutually Anonymous Services over Structured P2P Networks,Aameek Singh; Ling Liu,In the modern era of ubiquitous computing; privacy is one of the most critical user concerns.To prevent their privacy; users typically; try to remain anonymous to the service provider.This is especially true for decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems; where common usersact both as clients and as service providers. Preserving privacy in such cases requiresmutual anonymity; which shields the users at both ends. Most unstructured P2P systems likeGnutella; Kazaa provide a certain level of anonymity through the use of a random overlaytopology and a flooding based routing protocol; but suffer from the lack of guaranteed lookupof data. In contrast; most structured P2P systems like Chord; are Distributed Hash Table(DHT) based systems and provide guarantees that any stored data item can be found withina bounded number of hops.

Adaptation space: A design framework for adaptive Web services,Henrique Paques; Ling Liu; Calton Pu,Abstract Web service adaptation is an important feature for mission critical Web services. It iswidely recognized that thrashing and crashes occur in system saturation for many staticallyadaptive resource management algorithms; including CPU; memory; and networkcongestion. Service adaptation supports alternative responses to saturation control;maintaining service and server system stability and progress; instead of thrashing. In thisarticle; we present a design framework for developing adaptive Web services. The core ofthis framework is the adaptation space model; which is based on the concepts of adaptationspace and adaptation case. An adaptation space is defined by a reference context and apartial order of adaptation cases. Each adaptation case describes a specific adaptation of aprogram or component of a Web service. We evaluate the adaptation space approach …,*,2003,10
Ginga: A self-adaptive query processing system,Henrique Paques; Ling Liu; Calton Pu,Adaptive query processing in wide area distributed systems has received significantattention due to the dynamics of the Internet. Ginga is a project currently ongoing at GeorgiaInstitute of Technology aiming at studying the research issues in building a self-adaptivequery processing system. We identify three important failure modes for executing queries onthe Internet: network delays [1]; memory shortage; and sudden unavailability of remote dataservers. This extended abstract will give a brief overview of the design of Ginga system andillustrate the proposed adaptation framework using a network delay scenario as example. Aquery processing system is called adaptive if it has the following two characteristics.

Dynamic restructuring of transactional workflow activities: a practical implementation method,Tong Zhou; Calton Pu; Ling Liu,Abstract We describe a practical method to implement the dynamic restructuring ofdistributed transactional activities with several main advantages. First; it guarantees thecorrectness of dynamic restructuring operations as well as that of ongoing transactionalactivities. Second; it is general enough to accommodate a wide range of workflow activities'dynamic restructuring requirements. Third; it facilitates the deployment of dynamicrestructuring operations on production systems. Our method combines adaptors; microprotocols; and incremental specialization; building modularly on the system components (eg; RTF[1]; OOP [28]; MARS [4]) that we previously developed to support distributed extendedtransaction processing [19].

A transactional activity model for organizing open-ended cooperative activities,Ling Liu; Calton Pu,The authors propose a transactional activity model (TAM) for specification and managementof open-ended cooperative activities. In contrast to each of the extended transaction modelswhich focus more on a formal template for data processing patterns in an application; theactivity model contains a set of formal templates; namely activity patterns; for capturingpatterns of object interactions in an application. Using TAM; users may form new activitypatterns by combining components of different existing patterns using activity patternrefinement and activity pattern composition mechanisms that include splitting and joining ofactivities. In TAM; activity histories are used to study the correctness of activity execution andactivity restructuring through refinement; composition; split; or join.,System Sciences; 1998.; Proceedings of the Thirty-First Hawaii International Conference on,1998,10
Improving low-energy boron/nitrogen ion implantation in graphene by ion bombardment at oblique angles,Zhitong Bai; Lin Zhang; Ling Liu,Ion implantation is a widely adopted approach to structurally modify graphene and tune itselectrical properties for a variety of applications. Further development of the approachrequires a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that govern the ion bombardmentprocess as well as establishment of key relationships between the controlling parametersand the dominant physics. Here; using molecular dynamics simulations with adaptive bondorder calculations; we demonstrate that boron and nitrogen ion bombardment at obliqueangles (particularly at 70°) can improve both the productivity and quality of perfectsubstitution by over 25%. We accomplished this by systematically analyzing the effects of theincident angle and ion energy in determining the probabilities of six distinct types of physicsthat may occur in an ion bombardment event; including reflection; absorption; substitution …,Nanoscale,2016,9

Many knownRDF datasets contain billions of RDF triples (subject; predicate and object). One of the grantchallenges for managing these huge RDF data is how to execute RDF queries efficiently. Inthis paper; we address the query processing problems against the billion triple challenges.We first identify some causes for the problems of existing query optimization schemes; suchas large intermediate results; initial query cost estimation errors. Then; we present our block-oriented dynamic query plan generation approach powered with pipelining execution. Ourapproach consists of two phases. In the first phase; a near-optimal execution plan forqueries is chosen by identifying the processing blocks of queries. We group the join …,Knowledge and information systems,2014,9
Fast Ion Transport and Phase Separation in a Mechanically Driven Flow of Electrolytes through Tortuous Sub‐Nanometer Nanochannels,Ling Liu; Xi Chen,Abstract Both nanostructured materials and nanotubes hold tremendous promises forseparation and purification applications; such as water desalination. By using moleculardynamics; herein; we compare the transport of aqueous electrolyte solutions through a Y-zeolite; which features interconnected; tortuous sub-nanometer nanopores; and a modelsilica nanotube; which has the same composition but is straight and has much lower surfacecomplexity. In the Y-zeolite; ion transport is faster than the transport of water molecules; thusleading to a phenomenon of phase separation in which a gradient of salt concentration isgenerated along the flow direction. However; similar transport characteristics and phaseseparation are not found in the model silica nanotube. Detailed analysis suggests that; innanochannels with complicated geometries; such as those of the Y-zeolite; the structural …,ChemPhysChem,2013,9
Branched carbon nanotube reinforcements for improved strength of polyethylene nanocomposites,Ling Liu; Lin Zhang; Jim Lua,A bio-inspired design of polyethylene nanocomposites is presented in this letter usingbranched carbon nanotubes (BCNTs) as reinforcements. Using coarse-grained moleculardynamics simulations; we demonstrate that the pullout strength of the proposed BCNTnanofibers can be an order of magnitude higher than that of CNT reinforcements. Thedrastically improved interfacial shearing strength is found to be strongly dependent on thegeometry of nanofibers; the molecular weight of matrix polymers; and the pullout velocity. Byanalyzing the time-evolving molecular configurations of BCNT nanofibers and surroundingpolymer chains; the underlying strengthening mechanisms are discussed and strategies forfurther improvement are suggested.,Applied Physics Letters,2012,9
A scalable method for access control in location-based broadcast services,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Arun Iyengar; Jian Yin; Ling Liu,One important problem for public broadcast Location-Based Services (LBS) is to enforceaccess control on a large number of subscribers. In such a system a user typicallysubscribes to a LBS for a time interval (a; b) and a spatial region (x bl; y bl; x ir; y tr)according to a 3-dimensional spatial-temporal authorization model. In this paper; we arguethat current approaches to access control using group key management protocols are notscalable. Our proposal STauth minimizes the number of keys which needs to be distributedand is thus scalable to a much higher number of subscribers and the dimensionality of theauthorization model. We analytically and experimentally demonstrate the performance andscalability benefits of our approach against other group key management protocols.,INFOCOM 2008.

Mobiqual: Qos-aware load shedding in mobile cq systems,Bugra Gedik; Kun-Lung Wu; S Yu Philip; Ling Liu,Freshness and accuracy are two key measures of quality of service (QoS) in location-based;mobile continual queries (CQs). However; it is often difficult to provide both fresh andaccurate CQ results due to (a) limited resources in computing and communication and (b)fast-changing load conditions caused by continuous mobile node movement. Thus a keychallenge for a mobile CQ system is: How do we achieve the highest possible quality of thequery results; in both freshness and accuracy; with currently available resources underchanging load conditions? In this paper; we formulate this problem as a load shedding one;and develop MobiQual-a QoS-aware framework for performing both update load sheddingand query load shedding.

Often; considerable time is needed tounderstand the framework; including not only what the framework does; but also how to useit. Techniques for documenting the design of a framework already exist; but less work hasbeen done on documenting how to use the framework. We have developed the notion ofhooks as a means of representing knowledge about the places in a framework that can beadapted by application developers to produce an application from the framework and haveapplied the concept to the SEAF (Size Engineering Application Framework) project. Bydescribing the hooks; implicit knowledge about how to reuse the framework is made explicitand open to study; refinement or use.

Nanopore creation in graphene by ion beam irradiation: geometry; quality; and efficiency,Zhitong Bai; Lin Zhang; Hengyang Li; Ling Liu,Ion beam irradiation is a promising approach to fabricate nanoporous graphene for variousapplications; including DNA sequencing; water desalination; and phase separation. Furtheradvancement of this approach and rational design of experiments all require improvedmechanistic understanding of the physical drilling process. Here; we demonstrate that; byusing oblique ion beam irradiation; the nanopore family is significantly expanded to includemore types of nanopores of tunable geometries. With the hopping; sweeping; and shovingmechanisms; ions sputter carbon atoms even outside the ion impact zone; leading toextended damage particularly at smaller incident angles.

Guarding the next Internet frontier: countering denial of information attacks,Mustaque Ahamad; Leo Mark; Wenke Lee; Edward Omicienski; Andre dos Santos; Ling Liu; Calton Pu,Abstract As applications enabled by the Internet become information rich; ensuring access toquality information in the presence of potentially malicious entities will be a major challenge.Denial of information (DoI) attacks attempt to degrade the quality of information bydeliberately introducing noise that appears to be useful information. The mere availability ofinformation is insufficient if the user must find a needle in a haystack of noise that is createdby an adversary to hide critical information. We focus on the characterization of informationquality metrics that are relevant in the presence of DoI attacks. In particular; twocomplementary metrics are explored. Information regularity captures predictability in thepatterns of information creation and access. The second metric; information quality trust;captures the known ability of an information source to meet the needs of its clients.,Proceedings of the 2002 workshop on New security paradigms,2002,8

Induced pluripotent stem cells in Huntington’s disease: Disease modeling and the potential for cell-based therapy,Ling Liu; Jin-Sha Huang; Chao Han; Guo-Xin Zhang; Xiao-Yun Xu; Yan Shen; Jie Li; Hai-Yang Jiang; Zhi-Cheng Lin; Nian Xiong; Tao Wang,Abstract Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that ischaracterized by motor dysfunction; cognitive impairment; and behavioral abnormalities. It isan autosomal dominant disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene;resulting in progressive neuronal loss predominately in the striatum and cortex. Despite thediscovery of the causative gene in 1993; the exact mechanisms underlying HDpathogenesis have yet to be elucidated. Treatments that slow or halt the disease processare currently unavailable. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)technologies have transformed our ability to study disease in human neural cells. Here; wefirstly review the progress made to model HD in vitro using patient-derived iPSCs; whichreveal unique insights into illuminating molecular mechanisms and provide a novel …,Molecular neurobiology,2016,7
Scaling iterative graph computations with GraphMap,Kisung Lee; Ling Liu; Karsten Schwan; Calton Pu; Qi Zhang; Yang Zhou; Emre Yigitoglu; Pingpeng Yuan,In recent years; systems researchers have devoted considerable effort to the study of large-scale graph processing. Existing distributed graph processing systems such as Pregel;based solely on distributed memory for their computations; fail to provide seamlessscalability when the graph data and their intermediate computational results no longer fit intothe memory; and most distributed approaches for iterative graph computations do notconsider utilizing secondary storage a viable solution.

Graphtwist: Fast iterative graph computation with two-tier optimizations,Yang Zhou; Ling Liu; Kisung Lee; Qi Zhang,Abstract Large-scale real-world graphs are known to have highly skewed vertex degreedistribution and highly skewed edge weight distribution. Existing vertex-centric iterativegraph computation models suffer from a number of serious problems:(1) poor performanceof parallel execution due to inherent workload imbalance at vertex level;(2) inefficient CPUresource utilization due to short execution time for low-degree vertices compared to the costof in-memory or on-disk vertex access; and (3) incapability of pruning insignificant vertices oredges to improve the computational performance. In this paper; we address the abovetechnical challenges by designing and implementing a scalable; efficient; and provablycorrect two-tier graph parallel processing system; GraphTwist.

Reliable and resilient trust management in distributed service provision networks,Zhiyuan Su; Ling Liu; Mingchu Li; Xinxin Fan; Yang Zhou,Abstract Distributed service networks are popular platforms for service providers to offerservices to consumers and for service consumers to acquire services from unknown parties.eBay and Amazon are two well-known examples of enabling and hosting such servicenetworks to connect service providers to service consumers. Trust management is a criticalcomponent for scaling such distributed service networks to a large and growing number ofparticipants. In this article; we present ServiceTrust++; a feedback quality--sensitive andattack resilient trust management scheme for empowering distributed service networks witheffective trust management capability. Compared with existing trust models; ServiceTrust++has several novel features.

Fast iterative graph computation with resource aware graph parallel abstractions,Yang Zhou; Ling Liu; Kisung Lee; Calton Pu; Qi Zhang,Abstract Iterative computation on large graphs has challenged system research from twoaspects:(1) how to conduct high performance parallel processing for both in-memory and out-of-core graphs; and (2) how to handle large graphs that exceed the resource boundary oftraditional systems by resource aware graph partitioning such that it is feasible to run large-scale graph analysis on a single PC. This paper presents GraphLego; a resource adaptivegraph processing system with multi-level programmable graph parallel abstractions.GraphLego is novel in three aspects:(1) we argue that vertex-centric or edge-centric graphpartitioning are ineffective for parallel processing of large graphs and we introduce threealternative graph parallel abstractions to enable a large graph to be partitioned at thegranularity of subgraphs by slice; strip and dice based partitioning;(2) we use dice-based …,Proceedings of the 24th International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing,2015,7
Quasi-static mechanical response and corresponding analytical model of laminates incorporating with nanoweb interlayers,Ling Liu; Hongying Zhang; Yexin Zhou,Abstract Composite nanofibers of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and polyurethane (CNTs-PU) were prepared and collected on the surfaces of T700/epoxy prepregs; acted asnanoweb interlayers; and then formed unidirectional laminates. Quasi-static mechanicalresponses were examined through tensile and three-point flexure tests to evaluate thereinforcing effect of CNTs-PU nanoweb interlayers on fiber-dominated mechanicalproperties of the resulting laminates. Results showed that tensile strength and modulus ofthe laminates integrated with nanowebs increased up to 4.5–8.4% and 3.1–4.7%;respectively. Also; improvements in flexural strength and modulus were correspondingly upto 12.3–15.6% and 0.6–2.7%. Improvement of nanoweb interlayers on fiber-dominatedperformance of laminates has been achieved successfully. Furthermore; an analytical …,Composite Structures,2014,7

Measuring elastic property of single-walled carbon nanotubes by nanoindentation: A theoretical framework,Ling Liu; Manhong Zhao; Qulan Zhou; Xi Chen,Abstract Nanoindentation is an effective technique for deducing the elastic property of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Following an atomistic study of the nanoindentationmechanism; reverse analysis algorithms are proposed by utilizing the indentation force-depth data measured from the initial uniaxial compression and post-buckling regimes;respectively; which lead to stretching stiffness of 382 Pa m and 429 Pa m; that are very closeto those in the literature. Parallel finite element simulations incorporating atomic interactionsare also carried out; which closely duplicates the indentation response of SWCNTs inatomistic simulations. The numerical studies carried out in this paper may be used to guidethe nanoindentation experiments; explain and extract useful data from the test; as well asstimulate new experiments.,Mechanics Research Communications,2008,7

The current trend of clustered scale-out storage systems usesymmetric active replication based clustering middleware to provide continuous availabilityand high throughput. Such architectures provide significant gains in terms of cost; scalabilityand performance of mass storage and storage services. However; a fundamental limitationof such an architecture is its vulnerability to application-induced massive dependent failuresof the clustering middleware.

Keyword join: Realizing keyword search for information integration,Bei Yu; Ling Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian Lee Tan,Information integration has been widely addressed over the last several decades. However;it is far from solved due to the complexity of resolving schema and data heterogeneities. Inthis paper; we propose out attempt to alleviate such difficulty by realizing keyword searchfunctionality for integrating information from heterogeneous databases. Our solution doesnot require predefined global schema or any mappings between databases. Rather; it relieson an operator called keyword join to take a set of lists of partial answers from different datasources as input; and output a list of results that are joined by the tuples from input listsbased on predefined similarity measures as integrated results. Our system allows sourcedatabases remain autonomous and the system to be dynamic and extensible. We havetested our system with real dataset and benchmark; which shows that our proposed …,*,2006,7
Mining multiple private databases using a privacy preserving knn classifier,Subramanyam Chitti; Li Xiong; Ling Liu,ABSTRACT Data mining technologies are popular for identifying interesting patterns andtrends in large amounts of data. With the advent of high speed networks and easily availablestorage; many organizations are able to collect large amounts of data. On one hand; theseorganizations would like to mine their data to understand and discover interesting patterns;on the other hand; many legal and commercial reasons may prevent the organizations fromsharing their data. In such situations; privacy preserving data mining tools become critical-they allow data from many organizations to be mined securely and with a minimum ofinformation disclosure. In this paper; we present a framework for mining multiple privatedatabases using a privacy preserving k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We develop ageneral model for privacy preserving kNN classification and present algorithms for …,*,2004,7

Modern Bioinformatics data sources are widely used by molecular biologists forhomology searching and new drug discovery. User-friendly and yet responsive access isone of the most desirable properties for integrated access to the rapidly growing;heterogeneous; and distributed collection of data sources. The increasing volume anddiversity of digital information related to bioinformatics (such as genomes; proteinsequences; protein structures; etc.) have led to a growing problem that conventional datamanagement systems do not have; namely finding which information sources out of manycandidate choices are the most relevant and most accessible to answer a given user query.We refer to this problem as the query routing problem. In this paper we introduce thenotation and issues of query routing; and present a practical solution for designing a …,*,2003,7
Discovering objects in dynamically-generated web pages,James Caverlee; David Buttler; Ling Liu,ABSTRACT As the web grows; more and more content is being hidden from the reach oftraditional search engines. In this paper; we present THOR; a scalable and efficient tool tomine objects from this hidden web. With precision and recall over 90%; THOR automaticallyextracts objects of interest from dynamically-generated web pages. Then customizedobjectidentification algorithms are applied to locate the “interesting” objects in each page.We show that dynamicallygenerated pages tend to be a homogenous subset of pages foundon the Web; and that these pages may be separated into distinct clusters of structurally-similar pages. Using this homogeneity across clusters along with traditional informationretrieval techniques; we propose a two-phase clustering scheme consisting of a pageclustering algorithm and a fragment clustering algorithm. Using this scheme; we can …,*,2003,7
Building an extensible wrapper repository system: A metadata approach,Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Wei Han; David Buttler; Wei Tang,The Internet presents a large and growing number of information sources-airline schedules;online shopping Malls; retail product catalogs; stock market quotes; job listings; weatherforecasts; and many more. Such information can be gathered either by manual manipulationthrough a web browser or through automatic manipulation: the use of computer programs(rather than human) to interact with the corresponding information sources. Recently; manysystems have been built that automatically gather and manipulate such information onbehalf of information consumers' requests. One of the most popular mechanisms used bythese systems is to extract content using wrappers 4; 3; 5; 2; 10; 1; 9].

Maintaining database consistency in the presence of schema evolution,Ling Liu,Abstract With rapid advances in computer network technology and the increasing interest inglobal information sharing; grows the need for facilities that can effectively maintain thedatabase consistency and program compatibility as the schema evolves. In this paper; wepresent a general framework based on versions of schema for supporting seamless schemaevolution in large-scale object-oriented software systems. We argue that the effectiveness ofusing the schema version model to materialize schema evolution relies not only on themanagement of version derivation of schema; but also on the ability to maintain consistencyof the database instances with the new schema versions; and the flexibility of sharinginstances among versions of schema. Semantics of schema versioning is studied with theobjective to facilitate instance adaptation and program compatibility in the presence of …,*,1997,7
Scheduling for workflows with security-sensitive intermediate data by selective tasks duplication in clouds,Huangke Chen; Xiaomin Zhu; Dishan Qiu; Ling Liu; Zhihui Du,With the wide deployment of cloud computing in many business enterprises as well asscience and engineering domains; high quality security services are increasingly critical forprocessing workflow applications with sensitive intermediate data. Unfortunately; mostexisting worklfow scheduling approaches disregard the security requirements of theintermediate data produced by workflows; and overlook the performance impact ofencryption time of intermediate data on the start of subsequent workflow tasks. Furthermore;the idle time slots on resources; resulting from data dependencies among workflow tasks;have not been adequately exploited to mitigate the impact of data encryption time onworkflows' makespans and monetary cost. To address these issues; this paper presents anovel task-scheduling framework for security sensitive workflows with three novel features …,IEEE transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2017,6
Pathgraph: a path centric graph processing system,Pingpeng Yuan; Changfeng Xie; Ling Liu; Hai Jin,Large scale iterative graph computation presents an interesting systems challenge due totwo well known problems:(1) the lack of access locality and (2) the lack of storage efficiency.This paper presents PathGraph; a system for improving iterative graph computation ongraphs with billions of edges. First; we improve the memory and disk access locality foriterative computation algorithms on large graphs by modeling a large graph using acollection of tree-based partitions. This enables us to use path-centric computation ratherthan vertex-centric or edge-centric computation. For each tree partition; we re-label verticesusing DFS in order to preserve consistency between the order of vertex ids and vertex orderin the paths. Second; a compact storage that is optimized for iterative graph parallelcomputation is developed in the PathGraph system.

Uncertainty-aware real-time workflow scheduling in the cloud,Huangke Chen; Xiaomin Zhu; Dishan Qiu; Ling Liu,Scheduling real-time workflows running in the Cloud often need to deal with uncertain taskexecution time and minimize uncertainty propagation during the workflow runtime. Efficientscheduling approaches can minimize the operational cost of Cloud providers and providehigher guarantee of the quality of services (QoS) for Cloud consumers. However; most of theexisting workflow scheduling approaches are designed for the individual workflow runtimeenvironments that are deterministic. Such static workflow schedulers are inadequate formultiple and dynamic workflows; each with possibly uncertain task execution time. In thispaper; we address the problem of minimizing uncertainty propagation in real-time workflowscheduling. We first introduce an uncertainty-aware scheduling architecture to mitigate theimpact of uncertainty factors on the quality of workflow schedules.

A new approach to the diagnosis of deficits in processing faces: Potential application in autism research,RuoSi Wang; Ling Liu; Jia Liu,Abstract Deficits in social communication are one of the behavioral signatures of autismspectrum disorder (ASD). Because faces are arguably the most important social stimuli thatwe encounter in everyday life; investigating the ability of individuals with ASD to processfaces is thought to be important for understanding the nature of ASD. However; although aconsiderable body of evidence suggests that ASD individuals show specific impairments inface processing; a significant number of studies argue otherwise. Through a literaturereview; we found that this controversy is largely attributable to the different face tests usedacross different studies. Therefore; a more reliable and valid face test is needed. To this end;we performed a meta-analysis on data gleaned from a variety of face tests conducted onindividuals with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) who suffer a selective deficit in face …,Science China Life Sciences,2015,6
Genetic variants in GAPDH confer susceptibility to sporadic Parkinson’s disease in a Chinese Han population,Ling Liu; Nian Xiong; Ping Zhang; Chunnuan Chen; Jinsha Huang; Guoxin Zhang; Xiaoyun Xu; Yan Shen; Zhicheng Lin; Tao Wang,Background Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a part of Lewy body inclusions and involves the pathogenesisof Parkinson's disease (PD). However; it remains unknown whether or not genetic variationat the GAPDH locus contributes to the risk for PD. Methods A total of 302 sporadic PDpatients and 377 control subjects were recruited in our study for assessing two singlenucleotide polymorphisms (rs3741918 and rs1060619) in the GAPDH gene. Both allelicassociation and additive models were used to analyze association between GAPDHvariants and risk for PD. Results Both polymorphisms were significantly associated with riskfor PD after correction by Bonferroni multiple testing. The minor allele of rs3741918 wasassociated with decreased risk of sporadic PD (allelic contrast; OR= 0.74; 95% CI: 0.59 …,PloS one,2015,6
Deferred lightweight indexing for log-structured key-value stores,Yuzhe Tang; Arun Iyengar; Wei Tan; Liana Fong; Ling Liu; Balaji Palanisamy,The recent shift towards write-intensive workload on big data (eg; financial trading; socialuser-generated data streams) has pushed the proliferation of log-structured key-valuestores; represented by Google's BigTable [1]; Apache HBase [2] andCassandra [3]. Whileproviding key-based data access with aPut/Get interface; these key-value stores do notsupport value-based access methods; which significantly limits their applicability in modernweb and database applications.

Lightweight authentication of freshness in outsourced key-value stores,Yuzhe Tang; Ting Wang; Ling Liu; Xin Hu; Jiyong Jang,Abstract Data outsourcing offers cost-effective computing power to manage massive datastreams and reliable access to data. Data owners can forward their data to clouds; and theclouds provide data mirroring; backup; and online access services to end users. However;outsourcing data to untrusted clouds requires data authenticity and query integrity to remainin the control of the data owners and users. In this paper; we address the authenticated data-outsourcing problem specifically for multi-version key-value data that is subject tocontinuous updates under the constraints of data integrity; data authenticity; and"freshness"(ie; ensuring that the value returned for a key is the latest version). We detail thisproblem and propose IncBM-Tree; a novel construct delivering freshness and authenticity.,Proceedings of the 30th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference,2014,6
Atorvastatin inhibits CD68 expression in aortic root through a GRP78-involved pathway,Ling Li; Yu Wang; Yan Xu; Lianfeng Chen; Quan Fang; Xiaowei Yan,Abstract Purpose Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a chaperone protein in theendoplasmic reticulum (ER). Previous studies have suggested that statins favorably affectER stress by upregulating GRP78. This study was designed to investigate whether the anti-atherosclerotic effect of atorvastatin is modulated by a GRP78-involved pathway. MethodsHamsters were made diabetic and randomly divided into a diabetic control group (DMC); adiabetic group with low-dose atorvastatin (DML; 2.5 mg/kg/day); and a diabetic group withhigh-dose atorvastatin (DMH; 5 mg/kg/day). Pathological examinations of the aortic rootwere performed; and the level of GRP78 and CD68 expression in the aortic root wasdetected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis.

Experimental and analysis of the mechanical behaviors of multi-walled nanotubes/polyurethane nanoweb-reinforced epoxy composites,Ling Liu; Yexin Zhou; Shengqiang Pan,Thermoplastic polyurethan-based nanowebs with various strengths and moduli wereelectrospun by adding multi-walled nanotubes. The obtained webs were impregnated withepoxy resin to form a reinforced composite. The tensile properties of the nanoweb-reinforcedcomposites were determined to demonstrate the effect of the nanowebs on the properties ofthe epoxy resin. A significant increase in the mechanical response is observed; up to 29% intensile strength; 4% in elastic modulus and 19% in tensile strain; compared with neat epoxy;when the weight fraction of multi-walled nanotubes is 3 wt% within the webs.

Energy dissipation of nanoporous MFI zeolite under dynamic crushing,Baoxing Xu; Ling Liu; Qulan Zhou; Yu Qiao; Jun Xu; Yibing Li; Mooho Tak; Taehyo Park; Xi Chen,Nanoporous materials are emerging as a potential candidate for high-performance energydissipation. Understanding the mechanical response upon crushing is important fordesigning nanoporous material structures with maximum energy dissipation. Usingmolecular dynamics simulations; we investigate the crushing behaviors of a MFI zeoliteupon different loading rates; compression directions; and with different sample thickness.The dissipation mechanism is expected to result from the non-uniform collapse of nanoporesand the spread of the thus formed densification region through the structure. The resultsshow that the loading along the tortuous nanopore path ([001]-orientation) may maximizethe energy dissipation. Strong loading rate effect is observed which couples with orientationdependence; yet the effect of thickness is relatively minor.,Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience,2011,6

Safe region techniques for fast spatial alarm evaluation,Bhuvan Bamba; Ling Liu; Arun Iyengar; Philip S Yu,Spatial alarms are personalized location-based triggers installed by mobile users to serveas a reminder of a location of interest to be encountered in their future trips. Unlikecontinuous spatial queries; spatial alarms do not require immediate processing and periodicreevaluation upon installation. Thus; a critical challenge for efficient processing of spatialalarms is to determine when to evaluate each spatial alarm; while ensuring the demandingrequirements of high accuracy and system scalability.

A hybrid access model for storage area networks,Aameek Singh; Kaladhar Voruganti; Sandeep Gopisetty; David Pease; Ling Liu,We present HSAN & a hybrid storage area network; which uses both in-band (like NFS (R.Sandberg et al.; 1985)) and out-of-band visualization (like SAN FS (J. Menon et al.; 2003))access models. HSAN uses hybrid servers that can serve as both metadata and NASservers to intelligently decide the access model per each request; based on thecharacteristics of requested data. This is in contrast to existing efforts that merely provideconcurrent support for both models and do not exploit model appropriateness for requesteddata. The HSAN hybrid model is implemented using low overhead cache-admission andcache-replacement schemes and aims to improve overall response times for a wide varietyof workloads.

The semantic speci cation of user queries isindependent of the content and capabilities of the data sources (query-to-sourceindependence). The semantic speci cation of the content and capability of a data source isindependent of the content and capability descriptions of other sources (source-to-sourceindependence). Query processing techniques use these speci cations along with the querymodi cation and transformation routines to perform relevance reasoning and to guaranteesemantically correct query answers.

An object-centered approach for manipulating hierarchically complex objects,Ling Liu,Abstract We present an object-centered approach for manipulating hierarchically complexobjects; which covers an extended object model and an object-centered query algebra.Extensions of the object model are mainly based on a separation of structural and semanticelements in modeling complex objects; including a general distinction between aggregationreference and association reference; an introduction of type inheritance into aggregationhierarchies and a support for combination of aggregation inheritance with subtypeinheritance. Based on the extensions; we develop a query algebra as an integral part of themodel. Unlike most of existing algebra-based query languages; our object algebra takescomplex object collectively as a unit of high level queries and allows complex objects to beaccessed at all levels of aggregation hierarchies without having resort to any kind of path …,International Symposium on Object Technologies for Advanced Software,1993,6
Resistance and rupture analysis of single-and few-layer graphene nanosheets impacted by various projectiles,Sadegh Sadeghzadeh; Ling Liu,Abstract In this paper; a quasi-classical model for the collision of various nanoparticles withsingle-and few-layer graphene nanosheets was introduced as a multi-scale approach thatcouples non-equilibrium molecular dynamics with the Finite Element Method. As aresistance criterion; it was observed that the coefficient of restitution and the inducedstresses depend on the impact velocity of projectile. These parameters were evaluatedcomputationally; and it was revealed that certain resulting behaviors differ from behaviors atthe macro scale. By obtaining an out-of-plane yield stress limit of 1.0 TPa for graphene; thestress analysis of single-and multi-layer graphene sheets revealed that the limit projectilevelocity needed for the yielding of graphene sheets increases with the increase in thenumber of layers. For aluminum nanoparticles; this increase is almost linear; and for other …,Superlattices and Microstructures,2016,5
Dynamic and Efficient Private Keyword Search over Inverted Index--Based Encrypted Data,Rui Zhang; Rui Xue; Ting Yu; Ling Liu,Abstract Querying over encrypted data is gaining increasing popularity in cloud-based datahosting services. Security and efficiency are recognized as two important and yet conflictingrequirements for querying over encrypted data. In this article; we propose an efficient privatekeyword search (EPKS) scheme that supports binary search and extend it to dynamicsettings (called DEPKS) for inverted index--based encrypted data. First; we describe ourapproaches of constructing a searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) scheme that supportsbinary search. Second; we present a novel framework for EPKS and provide its formalsecurity definitions in terms of plaintext privacy and predicate privacy by modifying Shen etal.'s security notions [Shen et al. 2009].

Social influence based clustering and optimization over heterogeneous information networks,Yang Zhou; Ling Liu,Abstract Social influence analysis has shown great potential for strategic marketing decision.It is well known that people influence one another based on both their social connectionsand the social activities that they have engaged in the past. In this article; we develop aninnovative and high-performance social influence based graph clustering framework withfour unique features. First; we explicitly distinguish social connection based influence (self-influence) and social activity based influence (co-influence). We compute the self-influencesimilarity between two members based on their social connections within a singlecollaboration network; and compute the co-influence similarity by taking into account notonly the set of activities that people participate but also the semantic association betweenthese activities.

Policy-driven configuration management for NoSQL,Xianqiang Bao; Ling Liu; Nong Xiao; Yang Zhou; Qi Zhang,NoSQL systems have become the vital components to deliver big data services in the Cloud.However; existing NoSQL systems rely on experienced administrators to configure and tunethe wide range of configurable parameters in order to achieve high performance. In thispaper; we present a policy-driven configuration management system for NoSQL systems;called PCM. PCM can identify workload sensitive configuration parameters and capture thetuned parameters for different workloads as configuration policies. PCM also can be used toanalyze the range of configuration parameters that may impact on the runtime performanceof NoSQL systems in terms of read and write workloads.

Privacy-preserving data publishing in the cloud: a multi-level utility controlled approach,Balaji Palanisamy; Ling Liu,Conventional private data publication schemes are targeted at publication of sensitivedatasets with the objective of retaining as much utility as possible for statistical (aggregate)queries while ensuring the privacy of individuals' information. However; such an approach todata publishing is no longer applicable in shared multi-tenant cloud scenarios where usersoften have different levels of access to the same data. In this paper; we present a privacy-preserving data publishing framework for publishing large datasets with the goals ofproviding different levels of utility to the users based on their access privileges. We designand implement our proposed multi-level utility-controlled data anonymization schemes in thecontext of large association graphs considering three levels of user utility namely:(i) usershaving access to only the graph structure (ii) users having access to graph structure and …,Cloud Computing (CLOUD); 2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on,2015,5
Tuning thermal conductivity of crystalline polymer nanofibers by interchain hydrogen bonding,Lin Zhang; Morgan Ruesch; Xiaoliang Zhang; Zhitong Bai; Ling Liu,Polymers are widely used but they suffer from an apparent bottleneck of inefficient thermalconduction. Here; using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics; we demonstrate thathydrogen-bonded crystalline polymer nanofibers may have thermal conductivities 1–2orders of magnitude higher than that of engineering polymers. Interchain hydrogen bondsserve as “soft grips” to restrict the torsional motion of polymer chains; leading to enhancedthermal conductivities. The degree of enhancement can be tuned by changing the density ofhydrogen bonds; and the number of chains comprising the polymer nanofiber/nanosheet.Further analysis of the dihedral distribution and the phonon dispersion curves attribute suchphenomena to the unique effects of hydrogen bonds in confining structural disorder andfacilitating phonon transport.

Mitigating denial-of-service attacks on the chord overlay network: a location hiding approach,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Serverless distributed computing has received significant attention from both the industryand the research community. Among the most popular applications are the wide areanetwork file systems; exemplified by CFS; Farsite and OceanStore. These file systems storefiles on a large collection of untrusted nodes that form an overlay network. They usecryptographic techniques to maintain file confidentiality and integrity from malicious nodes.Unfortunately; cryptographic techniques cannot protect a file holder from a Denial-of-Service(DoS) or a host compromise attack. Hence; most of these distributed file systems arevulnerable to targeted file attacks; wherein an adversary attempts to attack a small (chosen)set of files by attacking the nodes that host them.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 158 polymorphism can reduce the activity of the COMT enzymethat may trigger defective differentiation of keratinocytes in psoriasis. Immunocytes candegrade and inactivate catecholamines via monamine oxidase (MAO) and COMT in thecells. We hypothesized that the COMT-158G> A polymorphism was associated with the riskof psoriasis vulgaris in Han Chinese people.

Thiswork takes a data mining approach to automatically recovering end-to-end transaction flowsfrom (potentially obscure) monitoring events produced by monitoring tools. We classify thecaller-callee relationships among monitoring events into three categories (identity; direct-invoke; and cascaded-invoke); and propose unsupervised learning algorithms to generaterules for each type of relationship. The key idea is to leverage the temporal informationavailable in the monitoring data and extract patterns that have statistical significance.

Improvement of mode Ⅰ interlaminar fracture toughness of composites reinforced by ultrathin fibers [J],Ling Liu; Zhengming Huang; Yexin Zhou; Guiying Xu,The non-woven ultrathin fibers film with a thickness about 0.1 mm was made by use ofelectrospinning. This film was incorporated into the middle interface of a composite laminate;which was cured and cut into double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. Blank DCBspecimens were prepared in the same way. The mode Ⅰ interlaminar fracture toughnesswas measured according to ASTM D5528 standard. The experimental results show that themode Ⅰ critical strain energy release rate is improved about 35% by using the non-wovenfilm compared to the blank specimens. The propagation of cracks for those two kinds ofspecimens is analyzed by use of the FE method. It shows that the numerical results are wellin agreement with the experimental results and a better understanding of the fracturemechanics is obtained by the numerical analysis.,Acta Materiae Compositae Sinica,2007,5

Link-based ranking of the web with source-centric collaboration,James Caverlee; Ling Liu; William B Rouse,Web ranking is one of the most successful and widely used collaborative computingapplications; in which Web pages collaborate in the form of varying degree of relationshipsto assess their relative quality.

Key derivation algorithms for monotone access structures in cryptographic file systems,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Abstract Advances in networking technologies have triggered the “storage as aservice”(SAS) model. The SAS model allows content providers to leverage hardware andsoftware solutions provided by the storage service providers (SSPs); without having todevelop them on their own; thereby freeing them to concentrate on their core business. TheSAS model is faced with at least two important security issues:(i) How to maintain theconfidentiality and integrity of files stored at the SSPs?(ii) How to efficiently support flexibleaccess control policies on the file system? The former problem is handled using acryptographic file system; while the later problem is largely unexplored.

Effects of interfacial epoxy nanofibrous films on the mechanical property of composite laminates [J],Ling Liu; Zhengming Huang; Guohua Dong; Guoqing Yuan; Chuanglong He; Xiaojian Han,The effects of non-woven nanofibrous membranes as interlaminar interfaces on themechanical perfor-(mance) of laminated composites were investigated. The nanofibers wereprepared by electrospinning of Epoxy 609 (E-03). Morphology and geometry of thenanofibers were analyzed by SEM and TEM; and the mechanical behavior of the non-wovens was understood through tensile testing. The non-woven fabrics were incorporatedinto the interlaminar interfaces of lamina plies before curing. The mechanical properties ofthe cured panels were measured using (three-point) flexure and short-beam tests. Theresults show that the mechanical performance of the composite laminates only has a littlevariation when a proper thickness of nanofiber nonwovens was used.

Scalable access control in content-based publish-subscribe systems,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Content-based publish-subscribe (pub-sub) systems are an emerging paradigm for buildinga large number of distributed systems. Access control in a pub-sub system refers to securedistribution of events to clients subscribing to those events without revealing its secretattributes to the unauthorized subscribers. To provide confidentiality guarantees the secretattributes in an event is encrypted so that only authorized subscribers can read them.However; in a content-based pub-sub system; every event can potentially have a differentset of authorized subscribers. In the worst case; for NS subscribers; there are 2^ NSsubgroups; and each event can potentially go to a different subgroup.

Adaptation space: Surviving non-maskable failures,Crispin Cowan; Lois Delcambre; Anne-Francoise Le Meur; Ling Liu; David Maier; Dylan McNamee; Michael Miller; Calton Pu; Perry Wagle; Jonathan Walpole,Abstract Some failures cannot be masked by redundancies; because an unanticipatedsituation occurred; because fault-tolerance measures were not adequate; or because therewas a security breach (which is not amenable to replication). Applications that wish tocontinue to offer some service despite nonmaskable failure must adapt to the loss ofresources. When numerous combinations of non-maskable failure modes are considered;the set of possible adaptations becomes complex.

Shared memory optimization in virtualized cloud,Qi Zhang; Ling Liu,Shared memory management is widely recognized as an optimization technique in thevirtualized cloud. Most current shared memory techniques allocate shared memoryresources from guest VMs based on pre-defined system configurations. Such staticmanagement of shared memory not only increases the VM memory pressure; but also limitsthe flexibility to balance shared memory resources across multiple VMs running on a singlehost. In this paper; we present a dynamic shared memory management framework thatenables multiple VMs to dynamically access shared memory resources according to theirdemands. We illustrate our system design through two case studies: One aims to improvethe performance of inter-domain communication while the other aims to improve VM memoryswapping efficiency. We demonstrate that the dynamic shared memory mechanism not …,Cloud Computing (CLOUD); 2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on,2015,4

Firm characteristics and balanced scorecard usage in Singaporean manufacturing firms,Ling Liu; Janek Ratnatunga; Lee J. Yao,Purpose–This study aims to examine the effects of balanced scorecard (BSC) usage onperformances in the context of four contingent variables in Singaporean manufacturing firms.The results show that firms are more likely to adopt BSC if they are large in size; haveproducts at an early product lifecycle (PLC) stage; operate in highly uncertain environmentsor adopt differentiation strategies. However; the adoption of BSC improves performance onlyin firms that are large or have products at an early PLC stage. The results suggest thatcontingent factors in which a firm operates can exert significant effects on the results ofadopting BSC. Design/methodology/approach–Survey data are collected; then the authorscheck data correlations; principle components analysis; run regression analysis andANOVA. Findings–BSC use is positively and significantly correlated with PLC stage …,International Journal of Accounting & Information Management,2014,4
Improving mapreduce performance in a heterogeneous cloud: A measurement study,Xu Zhao; Ling Liu; Qi Zhang; Xiaoshe Dong,Hybrid clouds; geo-distributed cloud and continuous upgrades of computing; storage andnetworking resources in the cloud have driven datacenters evolving towards heterogeneousclusters. Unfortunately; most of MapReduce implementations are designed forhomogeneous computing environments and perform poorly in heterogeneous clusters.Although a fair of research efforts have dedicated to improve MapReduce performance;there still lacks of in-depth understanding of the key factors that affect the performance ofMapReduce jobs in heterogeneous clusters.

A fast and compact indexing technique for moving objects,Yonghun Park; Ling Liu; Jaesoo Yoo,Advances in ubiquitous connectivity and location sensing technology have fuelled a richcollection of location based services (LBSs). Efficient spatial indexing techniques are one ofthe most effective optimization methods to improve the quality of services. Although a varietyof spatial index structures like R-tree family and grid variant index structures have beenproposed and deployed in real time location based service provisioning systems; they areknown to perform poorly when there is high degree of the skewedness in both densitydistribution and spatial resolution of mobile objects. First; it is hard to decide the optimalresolution of the grid structure. Second; it is equally hard to build a balanced R-Tree likeindex structure that is effective in handling highly skewed distribution of mobile objects. Withthese issues in mind; we introduce the concept of spatial order sequences and propose a …,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,4

Measurement of Aspherical Surfaces by Laser Tracker [J],WANG Xiao-kun,In order to test middle and low precision asphere and measurement of asphere duringgrinding and polishing; a new method by extending the ability of laser tracker is proposed.The testing principle is analyzed; and the testing procedure is devised. The coordinate ofseveral points on the tested asphere can be measured by the laser tracker; and the figureerror can be calculated by analyzing the testing data and CAD model of the asphere. An off-axial aspheric surface with the aperture of 420 mm? 270 mm is measured by this method;the surface map by this method is consistent to the entire surface map from the null test; andthe relative error of the PV and RMS error between null test and this method is 6.22% and3.37%; respectively.

Clustering analysis in large graphs with rich attributes,Yang Zhou; Ling Liu,Abstract Social networks; communication networks; biological networks and many otherinformation networks can be modeled as a large graph. Graph vertices represent entitiesand graph edges represent the relationships or interactions among entities. In many largegraphs; there is usually one or more attributes associated with every graph vertex todescribe its properties. The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graphinto subgraphs (clusters) based on a set of criteria; such as vertex similarity measures;adjacency-based measures; connectivity-based measures; density measures; or cut-basedmeasures. Although graph clustering has been studied extensively; the problem ofclustering analysis of large graphs with rich attributes remains a big challenge in practice. Inthis chapter we first give an overview of the set of issues and challenges for clustering …,*,2012,4

Aging of stem cells: intrinsic changes and environmental influences,Ling Liu; Thomas A Rando,Summary Adult stem cells exist in a number of organs and tissues in mammals and play anindispensable role in normal tissue homeostasis. As aging at an organismal level is oftenassociated with the deterioration of tissue structure and function; aging of stem cells hasbecome an integral aspect of aging research. The consequences of stem cell aging differamong different tissues; and it is not yet clear to what extent the mechanisms that lead to theage-related changes are shared among various stem cell compartments. Aging muscle andhematopoietic stem cells exhibit a gradual loss of functionality and altered lineageprogression. Age-related changes in intestinal stem cells may contribute to an increased riskof colon cancer; while alterations in neural stem cells during aging may be associated withsensory and memory loss. Changes that accumulate in stem cells during aging often …,*,2011,4
Execution assurance for massive computing tasks,Ting Wang; Ling Liu,抄録 Consider a client who intends to perform a massive computing task comprsing anumber of sub-tasks; while both storage and computation are outsourced by a third-partyservice provider. How could the client ensure the integrity and completeness of thecomputation result? Meanwhile; how could the assurance mechanism incur no disincentive;eg; excessive communication cost; for any service provider or client to participate in such ascheme? We detail this problem and present a general model of execution assurance formassive computing tasks.

A distributed stream query optimization framework through integrated planning and deployment,Sangeetha Seshadri; Vibhore Kumar; Brian Cooper; Ling Liu,This paper addresses the problem of optimizing multiple distributed stream queries that areexecuting simultaneously in distributed data stream systems. We argue that the static queryoptimization approach of" plan; then deployment" is inadequate for handling distributedqueries involving multiple streams and node dynamics faced in distributed data streamsystems and applications. Thus; the selection of an optimal execution plan in such dynamicand networked computing systems must consider operator ordering; reuse; networkplacement; and search space reduction. We propose to use hierarchical network partitionsto exploit various opportunities for operator-level reuse while utilizing network characteristicsto maintain a manageable search space during query planning and deployment.

For example; using a simple insider attack wewere able to access over 84 GB of private data at one organisation of 825 users; including300 000 e-mails and 579 passwords to financial and other private services websites; withoutexploiting any technical vulnerability. We present two solutions to address this problem: 1.an administrative auditing tool which can alert administrators and users when their privatedata is at risk; 2. a new View Based Access Control (VBAC) mechanism which providesstronger and yet convenient privacy support. We also describe a proof-of-concept filesystem-based implementation and performance analysis of VBAC.

Energy-aware data collection in sensor networks: A localized selective sampling approach,Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,One of the most prominent and comprehensive ways of data collection in sensor networks isto periodically extract raw sensor readings. This way of data collection enables complexanalysis of data; which may not be possible with in-network aggregation or queryprocessing. However; this flexibility in data analysis comes at the cost of powerconsumption. In this paper; we introduce selective sampling for energy-efficient periodicdata collection in sensor networks. The main idea behind selective sampling is to use adynamically changing subset of nodes as samplers such that the sensor readings of samplernodes are directly collected; whereas the values of non-sampler nodes are predictedthrough the use of probabilistic models that are locally and periodically constructed in an in-network manner. Selective sampling can be effectively used to increase the network …,*,2005,4

Countering targeted file attacks using location keys,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Serverless distributed computing has received significant attention from both the industryand research community. One of its typical applications is wide area network file systemslike CFS [1]; Farsite [2] and OceanStore [3]. A unique feature of these file systems is that theyare serverless. They store files on a large collection of untrusted nodes that form an overlaynetwork. They use cryptographic techniques to secure files from malicious nodes. However;most of these distributed file systems are vulnerable to targeted file attacks; wherein anadversary attempts to attack a small (chosen) set of files in the system. This paper presentslocation keys as a technique for countering targeted file attacks. Location keys can be usedto not only provide traditional cryptographic guarantees like file confidentiality and integrity;but also (i) mitigate Denial-of-Service (DoS) and host compromise attacks;(ii) construct an …,*,2004,4
Bioseek: Exploiting source-capability information for integrated access to multiple bioinformatics data sources,Ling Liu; David Buttler; Terence Critchlow; Wei Han; Henrique Paques; Calton Pu; Daniel Rocco,Modern Bioinformatics data sources are widely used by molecular biologists for homologysearching and new drug discovery. User-friendly and yet responsive access is one of themost desirable properties for integrated access to the rapidly growing; heterogeneous; anddistributed collection of data sources. The increasing volume and diversity of digitalinformation related to bioinformatics (such as genomes; protein sequences; proteinstructures; etc.) have led to a growing problem that conventional data management systemsdo not have; namely finding which information sources out of many candidate choices arethe most relevant and most accessible to answer a given user query.

AQR-toolkit: an adaptive query routing middleware for distributed data intensive systems,Ling Liu; Calton Pu; David Buttler; Wei Han; Henrique Paques; Wei Tang,Abstract Query routing is an intelligent service that can direct query requests to appropriateservers that are capable of answering the queries. The goal of a query routing system is toprovide efficient associative access to a large; heterogeneous; distributed collection ofinformation providers by routing a user query to the most relevant information sources thatcan provide the best answer. Effective query routing not only minimizes the query responsetime and the overall processing cost; but also eliminates a lot of unnecessarycommunication overhead over the global networks and over the individual informationsources. The AQR-Toolkit divides the query routing task into two cooperating processes:query refinement and source selection. It is well known that a broadly defined queryinevitably produces many false positives. Query refinement provides mechanisms to help …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2000,4

Technically; wedescribe a number of data delivery characteristics in terms of delivery protocols; deliverymodes; and delivery frequencies. We further use these characteristics to discuss andcompare several data delivery schemes.

Credit derivatives and stock return synchronicity,Xuelian Bai; Nan Hu; Ling Liu; Lu Zhu,Abstract The role of credit default swaps (CDS) in the 2008 financial crisis has been widelydebated among regulators; investors; and researchers. While CDS were blamed fordestabilizing the financial system; they remain effective tools for hedging credit risk;especially for major banks; and produce positive informational externalities to marketparticipants. This paper examines whether the introduction of CDS enhances the amount offirm-specific information impounded in stock prices. We use stock return synchronicity tomeasure the amount of firm-specific information reflected in stock prices; with more firm-specific information being associated with a lower level of synchronicity. We find that a firm'sstock return synchronicity decreases after the commencement of CDS trading. This finding isrobust to different model specifications; synchronicity measures; and endogeneity …,Journal of Financial Stability,2017,3
Exceptional Thermal Conductance across Hydrogen‐Bonded Graphene/Polymer Interfaces,Lin Zhang; Zhitong Bai; Ling Liu,Abstract Ineffective heat transfer between dissimilar materials of drastically differentproperties is a challenge for many areas including nanoelectronics and nanocomposites.Here; using atomistic simulations; it is demonstrated that the thermal conductance across theinterfaces between graphene and poly (methyl methacrylate)(PMMA) can be improved by273% by introducing hydrogen-bond-capable hydroxyl groups to the interfaces. Strongerthan van der Waals interactions; the hydrogen bonds are found to improve the interfacialassociation; thereby enhancing the coupling of low-frequency vibrational modes. Using theintegrated autocorrelation of interfacial heat power; it is shown directly that the hydrogenbond donors; ie; oxygen atoms in the hydroxyl groups; build the most effective thermaltransport pathways at the graphene/PMMA interfaces.

Pvsae: A public verifiable searchable encryption service framework for outsourced encrypted data,Rui Zhang; Rui Xue; Ting Yu; Ling Liu,Outsource encrypted data is a popular trend for storing sensitive data in third party clouds.Many cloud applications need privacy preserving data encryption services with twocapabilities: On one hand; they need querying over encrypted data in Web based datahosting services. On the other hand; they also need to keep the query keywords andassociated search operations private such that data hosting service providers cannot gainaccess to unauthorized content or trace and infer sensitive data stored in the third party datahosting servers. In this paper we present a novel service oriented framework for verifiablesearchable asymmetric encryption; called PVSAE.

It is widely recognized inpractice that only a proficient process designer is able to utilize process modeling toolseffectively. Furthermore; although a process modeling tool can be effective in BPMS; aconsiderable amount of effort is required from enterprises in order to reconfigure businessprocesses for convenient process modeling environments.

Enhancing personalized ranking quality through multidimensional modeling of inter-item competition,Qinyuan Feng; Ling Liu; Yan Sun; Ting Yu; Yafei Dai,This paper presents MAPS—a personalized Multi-Attribute Probabilistic Selection framework—to estimate the probability of an item being a user's best choice and rank the itemsaccordingly. The MAPS framework makes three original contributions in this paper. First; wecapture the inter-attribute tradeoff by a visual angle model which maps multi-attribute itemsinto points (stars) in a multidimensional space (sky). Second; we model the inter-itemcompetition using the dominating areas of the stars. Third; we capture the user's personalpreferences by a density function learned from his/her history.

Spatial alarms extend the very same idea tolocation-based triggers; which are fired whenever a mobile user enters the spatial region ofthe location alarms. Spatial alarms provide critical capabilities for many mobile locationbased applications ranging from personal assistants; inventory tracking to industrial safetywarning systems. In this paper we present an energy efficient framework for processingspatial alarms on mobile clients; while maintaining low computation and storage costs. Ourapproach to spatial alarms provides two systematic methods for minimizing energyconsumption on mobile clients. First; we introduce the concept of safe distance to reduce thenumber of unnecessary mobile client wakeups for spatial alarm evaluation. This mechanismnot only reduces the amount of unnecessary processing of the spatial alarms but also …,*,2008,3
Space adaptation: Privacy-preserving multiparty collaborative mining with geometric perturbation,Keke Chen; Ling Liu,The service-oriented infrastructure has become popular for collaboratively mining datadistributed over organizations [3]; where the participants are the data providers who submittheir perturbed datasets to the designated data mining service provider (the data miner) formining commonly interested models. Figure 1 shows the service-oriented framework forcollaborative multiparty data mining. Two kinds of parties are directly involved in thecomputing. The mining service provider (SP) is a party independent of the data providers;which owns abundant computing power; data mining tools and talents. SP offers their datamining services to the contracted parties through certain service provision scheme.

DSphere: A source-centric approach to crawling; indexing and searching the world wide web,Bhuvan Bamba; Ling Liu; James Caverlee; Vaibhav Padliya; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Tushar Bansal; Mahesh Palekar; Joseph Patrao; Suiyang Li; Aameek Singh,We describe DSphere-a decentralized system for crawling; indexing; searching and rankingof documents in the World Wide Web. Unlike most of the existing search technologies thatdepend heavily on a page-centric view of the Web; we advocate a source-centric view of theWeb and propose a decentralized architecture for crawling; indexing and searching the Webin a distributed source-specific fashion. A fully decentralized crawler is developed to crawlthe World Wide Web where each peer is assigned the responsibility of crawling a specificset of documents referred to as a source collection. Link analysis techniques are used forranking documents. Traditional link analysis techniques suffer from problems like slowrefresh rate and vulnerabilities to Web Spam. We propose a source-based link analysisapproach; which computes fast and accurate ranking scores for all crawled documents.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Preparation and Characterization of Polycarbonate/TiO_2 Ultrafine Fibers [J],Xiao-Jian HAN; Zheng-Ming HUANG; Chuang-Long HE; Ling LIU; Guo-Hua DONG; Qing-Sheng WU,Functional ultrafine fibers of polycarbonate (PC)/TiO2 were prepared by electrospinning ofPC solutions mixed with butyl titanate for possible anti-bacterial applications. Three differentmixture ratios; ie 9: 1; 8: 2; and 7: 3 by mass between PC and butyl titanate were applied.These fibers were then characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM); transmissionelectron microscope (TEM); Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-raydiffraction (XRD). Furthermore; anti-bacterial performance of the nonwoven fiber mats onescherichia coli was also measured. Experimental results show that when the ratio of PCand butyl titanate is 9: 1; the resulting fibers are most uniform with least beads on the fibersurfaces. When this ratio is increased to 7: 3; however; as high as 87% of the escherichiacoli bacteria are killed.

Key derivation algorithms for monotone access structures in large file systems,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Abstract. Advances in networking technologies have triggered the “storage as aservice”(SAS) model. The SAS model allows content providers to leverage hardware andsoftware solutions provided by the storage service providers (SSPs); without having todevelop them on their own; thereby freeing them to concentrate on their core business. TheSAS model is faced with at least two important security issues:(i) How to maintain theconfidentiality and integrity of files stored at the SSPs?(ii) How to efficiently support flexibleaccess control policies on the file system? The former problem is handled using acryptographic file system; while the later problem is largely unexplored. In this paper; wepropose secure; efficient and scalable key management algorithms to support monotoneaccess structures on large file systems.

Mediator join indices,Ling Ling Yan; M Tamer Ozsu; Ling Liu,A mediator join index (MJI) is proposed to speed up N-way inter-database joins by reducingthe amount of data transfer during evaluation. A family of algorithms; the query scrubbingalgorithms (QSA); are developed to maintain MJI and to evaluate queries using MJI. QSAalgorithms use query scrubbing to cope with update and query anomalies related tomaterialized views in the mediator context. Compared with existing algorithms; QSAalgorithms incur less overhead in handling the anomalies and makes MJI a promisingtechnique for efficient mediator query processing.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1997.

Adaptive schema design and evaluation in an object-oriented information system,Ling Liu,Abstract This paper develops a formal framework for characterizing “normalization” in object-oriented schema design. We introduce style rules for achieving validity; minimality; andextensibility of an object-oriented schema; and the style rules that help to eliminate updateanomalies and undesirable existence dependency loops. As a result; the adaptiveness of anobject-oriented schema against future requirement changes is increased. This set of stylerules can be used as not only a user-oriented method for designing the object-orientedschema; but also a means for validating quality of a schema and for transforming an object-oriented schema into a better style in terms of adaptiveness and robustness.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1995,3
Dynamic differential location privacy with personalized error bounds,Lei Yu; Ling Liu; Calton Pu,Abstract—Location privacy continues to attract significant attentions in recent years; fueledby the rapid growth of locationbased services (LBSs) and smart mobile devices. Locationobfuscation has been the dominating location privacy preserving approach; whichtransforms the exact location of a mobile user to a perturbed location before its publicrelease. The notion of location privacy has evolved from user-defined location kanonymity totwo statistical quantification based privacy notions: geo-indistinguishability and expectedinference error. The former promotes differential location privacy but does not protectlocation against inference attacks of Bayesian adversary with using prior information;whereas the latter promotes the background inference resilient location privacy but does notguarantee differential location privacy with respect to geo-indistinguishability.

Load shedding in mobile systems with mobiqual,Bugra Gedik; Kun-Lung Wu; Ling Liu; S Yu Philip,In location-based; mobile continual query (CQ) systems; two key measures of quality-of-service (QoS) are: freshness and accuracy. To achieve freshness; the CQ server mustperform frequent query reevaluations. To attain accuracy; the CQ server must receive andprocess frequent position updates from the mobile nodes. However; it is often difficult toobtain fresh and accurate CQ results simultaneously; due to 1) limited resources incomputing and communication and 2) fast-changing load conditions caused by continuousmobile node movement. Hence; a key challenge for a mobile CQ system is: How do weachieve the highest possible quality of the CQ results; in both freshness and accuracy; withcurrently available resources?

Scaling unstructured peer-to-peer networks with multi-tier capability aware topologies,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Ling Liu,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems such as Gnutella have been widelyacknowledged as the fastest growing Internet applications ever. The P2P model has manypotential advantages including high flexibility and server-less management. However; thesesystems suffer from the well-known performance mismatch between the randomlyconstructed overlay network topology and the underlying IP-layer topology.

Enhanced deformation of azobenzene-modified liquid crystal polymers under dual wavelength exposure: A photophysical model,Ling Liu; Patrick R Onck,Abstract Azobenzene-embedded liquid crystal polymers can undergo mechanicaldeformation in response to ultraviolet (UV) light. The natural rodlike trans state azobenzeneabsorbs UV light and isomerizes to a bentlike cis state; which disturbs the order of thepolymer network; leading to an anisotropic deformation. The current consensus is that themagnitude of the photoinduced deformation is related to the statistical building up ofmolecules in the cis state. However; a recent experimental study [Liu and Broer; Nat.Commun. 6 8334 (2015).] shows that a drastic (fourfold) increase of the photoinduceddeformation can be generated by exposing the samples simultaneously to 365 nm (UV) and455 nm (visible) light. To elucidate the physical mechanism that drives this increase; wedevelop a two-light attenuation model and an optomechanical constitutive relation that …,Physical review letters,2017,1

Multi-Client Verifiable Computation Service for Outsourced Data,Ying Wu; Rui Zhang; Rui Xue; Ling Liu,The introduction of verifiable computation came as a result of the increasingly commonphenomenon of" outsourcing" computation to untrusted servers and also to the growingdesire of weak clients to outsource computational tasks to more powerful computationservices like in cloud computing. Verifiable computation enables a computer to offload thecomputation of some function; to other perhaps untrusted cloud servers; while maintainingverifiable results. The servers evaluate the function and return the result with a proof that thecomputation of the function was carried out correctly. In the previous setting of verifiablecomputation; there is only one data provider. But in practice; there exist scenarios such as anetwork of sensors where each sensor collects data (eg air temperature in a certain area ofa city) and stores them on servers.

STARS: Startup-Time-Aware Resource Provisioning and Real-Time Task Scheduling in Clouds,Xiaomin Zhu; Huangke Chen; Guipeng Liu; Ling Liu,Green cloud computing has become a major performance measure for many infrastructureas a service (IaaS) cloud data centers. A popular way to reduce energy consumption forvirtualized clouds is to dynamically consolidate virtual machines (VMs) and turning off asmany idle hosts as possible. Upon the increase of the system's workloads; the closed hostswill be re-started to meet the scale-up demand of resources. However; the time overhead ofstarting hosts and deploying VMs can delay the start time of real-time tasks; and may causedeadline violation of some real-time tasks. This problem can be further aggravated forheterogeneous physical hosts. In this paper; we propose a novel scheduling architecturethat allocates an idle lash-up VM on each active host.

Spatial Alarm Processing and Algorithms,Myungcheol Doo; Ling Liu,One of the most challenging problems in scaling spatial alarm processing is to computealarm free regions (AFR) such that mobile objects traveling within an AFR can safelyhibernate the alarm evaluation process until approaching the nearest alarm of interest. Inthis paper we argue that maintaining an index of both spatial alarms and empty regions(AFR in the context of spatial alarm processing) is critical for scalable processing of spatialalarms. Unfortunately; conventional spatial indexing methods; such as R-tree family; kd tree;Quadtree; and Grid; are not well suited to index empty regions. We present Mondrian Tree-aregion partitioning tree for indexing both spatial alarms and alarm free regions. We firstintroduce the Mondrian tree indexing algorithms; including index construction; search; andmaintenance. Then we describe a suite of Mondrian tree optimizations to further enhance …,*,2011,1

Mondrian Tree: Efficient Indexing Structure for Scalable Spatial Triggers Processing over Mobile Environment,Myungcheol Doo; Ling Liu; Nitya Narasimhan; Venu Vasudevan,Spatial Alarms are reminders for mobile users upon their arrival of certain spatial location ofinterest. Spatial alarm processing requires meeting two demanding objectives: highaccuracy; which ensures zero or very low alarm misses; and high scalability; which requireshighly efficient and optimal processing of spatial alarms. Existing techniques for processingspatial alarms cannot solve these two problems at the same time. In this paper we presentthe design and implementation of a new indexing technique; Mondrian tree. The Mondriantree indexing method partitions the entire universe of discourse into spatial alarm monitoringregions and alarm-free regions. This enables us to reduce the number of on-demand alarm-free region computations; significant saving of both server load and client to servercommunication cost.

Recovery scopes; recovery groups; and fine-grained recovery in enterprise storage controllers with multi-core processors,Sangeetha Seshadri; Ling Liu; Lawrence Chiu,In this paper we extend a previously published approach to error recovery in enterprisestorage controllers with multi-core processors. Our approach first involves the partitioning ofthe set of tasks in the runtime of the controller software into clusters (recovery scopes) ofdependent tasks. Then; these recovery scopes are mapped into a set of recovery groups; onwhich the scheduling of tasks; both during the recovery process and normal operation; isbased. This recovery-aware scheduling (RAS) replaces the performance-based schedulingof the storage controller. Through simulation and benchmark experiments; we find that: 1)the performance of RAS appears to be critically dependent on the values of recovery-relatedparameters; and 2) our fine-grained recovery approach promises to enhance the storagesystem availability while keeping the additional overhead; and the resulting degradation …,IBM Journal of Research and Development,2009,1

Privacy-Preserving Publishing of Multilevel Utility-Controlled Graph Datasets,Balaji Palanisamy; Ling Liu; Yang Zhou; Qingyang Wang,Abstract Conventional private data publication schemes are targeted at publication ofsensitive datasets either after the k-anonymization process or through differential privacyconstraints. Typically these schemes are designed with the objective of retaining as muchutility as possible for the aggregate queries while ensuring the privacy of the individualrecords. Such an approach; though suitable for publishing aggregate information as publicdatasets; is inapplicable when users have different levels of access to the same data. Weargue that existing schemes either result in increased disclosure of private information orlead to reduced utility when some users have more access privileges than the others. In thisarticle; we present an anonymization framework for publishing large datasets with the goalsof providing different levels of utility to the users based on their access privilege levels …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2018,*
Credit default swap spreads and annual report readability,Nan Hu; Ling Liu; Lu Zhu,Abstract This paper investigates whether annual report readability matters to CDS marketparticipants and how it affects their evaluation on a firm's credit risk; as measured by CDSspreads. We find that the less readable the annual reports; the higher the CDS spreads.Furthermore; the impact of readability on CDS spreads is more concentrated on firms withhigh information asymmetry and with investment grade ratings. Our results suggest thatinvestors take into account the readability in their view of the firms' credit risk. Creditorsappear to suffer higher cost on CDS protection of the debts if the underlying firms have lessreadable annual reports.,Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting,2018,*
Towards Bandwidth Guarantee for Virtual Clusters Under Demand Uncertainty in Multi-Tenant Clouds,Lei Yu; Haiying Shen; Zhipeng Cai; Ling Liu; Calton Pu,In the cloud; multiple tenants share the resource of datacenters and their applicationscompete with each other for scarce network bandwidth. Current studies have shown that thelack of bandwidth guarantee causes unpredictable network performance; leading to poorapplication performance. To address this issue; several virtual network abstractions havebeen proposed which allow the tenants to reserve virtual clusters with specified bandwidthbetween the Virtual Machines (VMs) in the datacenters. However; all these existingproposals require the tenants to deterministically characterize the bandwidth demands in theabstractions; which can be difficult and result in inefficient bandwidth reservation due to thedemand uncertainty. In this paper; we explore a virtual cluster abstraction with stochasticbandwidth characterization to address the bandwidth demand uncertainty.

GraphA: Efficient Partitioning and Storage for Distributed Graph Computation,Yiming Zhang; Dongsheng Li; Chengfei Zhang; Jinyan Wang; Ling Liu,Distributed graph computation is central to applications ranging from language processingto social networks. However; natural graphs tend to have skewed power-law distributionswhere a small subset of the vertices have a large number of neighbors. Existing graph-parallel systems suffer from load imbalance; high communication cost; and inefficientprocessing. To address this problem; in this paper we present GraphA; an adaptive schemefor efficient large-scale graph computation. At the core of GraphA is an adaptive and uniformgraph partitioning algorithm; which partitions the datasets by using an incremental numberof mapping functions. GraphA further improves and leverages the ART index structure torealize fine-grained and low-cost graph storage. We have implemented GraphA both onSpark and on GraphLab.

Analyst Firm Coverage and Forecast Accuracy: The Effect of Regulation Fair Disclosure,Yi Dong; Nan Hu; Xu Li; Ling Liu,Abstract In this study; we revisit the relationship between analyst firm coverage and forecastaccuracy. In contrast to the proposed negative association in Clement (1999) owing to theportfolio complexity effect; we hypothesize an 'economy-of-scale effect'that is likely todominate when analysts rely mostly on public information. In support of the latter effect; wefind a positive association between firm coverage and forecast accuracy after the enactmentof Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD); which substantially reduces the flow of materialprivate information to analysts. Such a result survives a battery of robustness analyses. Wefurther show that; in the post-Reg FD period; covering more firms increases an analyst'sprobability of being selected as a star analyst in the subsequent year.

Does director interlock impact the diffusion of accounting method choice?,Jie Han; Nan Hu; Ling Liu; Gaoliang Tian,Abstract This paper examines the influence of director interlock on firms' discrete accountingmethod choices from the perspective of behavior diffusion. We argue that firm managers willimitate their interlocked-partner firm's accounting method choices when choosing their ownaccounting methods. We find that when there is an interlock relationship between two firms;their accounting method choices; including inventory and depreciation methods; are similarto each other; indicating that accounting method choices can diffuse across firms throughdirector interlock. In addition; such similarity is greater the longer the interlock relationshipbetween the two firms is and as uncertainty increases. Further; the interlock effect ondepreciation methods is larger for firms whose interlock directors have accountingbackgrounds.

Identifying Key Resources in a Social Network Using f-PageRank,Imam Mustafa Kamal; Hyerim Bae; Ling Liu; Yulim Choi,Key resources are important; influential and powerful performers in a social networkstructure. Identifying them in the social network of a business process activity is beneficialand rewarding. One of the most effective centrality measures for identification of the keynodes in a social network is to rank resources based on a selection of criteria. PageRank isa representative example of such algorithms; which was first utilized in the Google searchengine in 1998. However; the PageRank approach merely assumes a single link as a vote;which allows one originator to link or transfer his work to others more than once in ahandover work scenario. We argue that this problem can lead to inaccurate influence basedranking in the context of business processes for resources in a social network.

This type of behaviours extremely reduces the enthusiasmof honest users; which may lead a crowdsourcing platform to a failure. To defend the threatsfrom spam workers; reputation-based defense mechanisms and verification-based defensemechanisms have been proposed in crowdsourcing environments.

𝜖 -PPI: Searching Information Networks with Quantitative Privacy Guarantee,Yuzhe Tang; Ling Liu; Arun Iyengar,In information sharing networks; having a privacy preserving index (or PPI) is criticallyimportant for providing efficient search on access controlled content across distributedproviders while preserving privacy. An understudied problem for PPI techniques is how toprovide controllable privacy preservation; given the innate difference of privacy of thedifferent content and providers. In this paper we present a configurable privacy preservingindex; coined 𝜖-PPI; which allows for quantitative privacy protection levels on fine-graineddata units. We devise a new common-identity attack that breaks existing PPI's and proposean identity-mixing protocol against the attack in 𝜖-PPI. The proposed 𝜖-PPI constructionprotocol is the first without any trusted third party and/or trust relationship between providers.We have implemented our 𝜖-PPI construction protocol by using generic MPC techniques …,*,2014,*
Authentication of Freshness for OutsourcedMulti-Version Key-Value Stores,Yuzhe Tang; Ting Wang; Xin Hu; Jiyong Jang; Ling Liu; Peter Pietzuch,Data outsourcing offers cost-effective computing power to manage massive data streamsand reliable access to data. For example; data owners can forward their data to clouds; andthe clouds provide data mirroring; backup; and online access services to end users.However; outsourcing data to untrusted clouds requires data authentication and queryintegrity to remain in the control of the data owners and users. In this paper; we address thisproblem specifically for multiversion key-value data that is subject to continuous updatesunder the constraints of data integrity; data authenticity; and “freshness”(ie; ensuring that thevalue returned for a key is the latest version). We detail this problem and proposeINCBMTREE; a novel construct delivering freshness and authenticity.

CloudLEGO: scalable cross-VM-type application performance prediction,Shicong Meng; Arun K Iyengar; Ling Liu; Ting Wang; Jian Tan; Ignacio Silva-Lepe; Isabelle M Rouvellou,Abstract Understanding the performance difference of a multi-tier Cloud application betweendifferent provisioning plans and workloads is difficult to achieve. A typical IaaS provideroffers a variety of virtual server instances with different performance capacities and rentalrates. Such instances are often marked with a high level description of theirhardware/software configuration (eg 1 or 2 vC-PUs) which provides insufficient informationon the performance of the virtual server instances. Furthermore; as each tier of anapplication can be independently provisioned with different types and numbers of VMs; thenumber of possible provisioning plans grows exponentially with each additional tier.Previous work [10] proposed to perform automatic experiments to evaluate candidateprovisioning plans; which leads to high cost due to the exponential increase of candidate …,Proceedings of the 4th annual Symposium on Cloud Computing,2013,*

Major complications of TOE are reported to be rare;especially in the hands of experienced investigators. However; a TOE probe might causeminor injuries in the stomach; especially if the procedure takes several hours. We thereforehypothesized that minor injuries are a common sequel of long-time TOE during cardiacsurgery. Material and Methods: After induction of anesthesia in patients undergoing electivecardiac interventions; endoscopy of pharynx; esophagus and stomach was performed inorder to exclude any previous lesion. A TOE probe was then inserted as part of the routineprocedure and left in place until the operation was finished and the patient in stable …,European Journal of Echocardiography,2010,*

A motion-aware safe period-based framework for spatial alarm processing,Bhuvan Bamba; Ling Liu; Philip S Yu,Abstract Spatial alarms are set on a spatial location of interest which the subscribers of thealarm will travel to sometime in the future. Alarm processing requires meeting twodemanding objectives: high accuracy; which ensures zero or very low alarm misses; andhigh scalability; which requires highly efficient and optimal processing of spatial alarms. Inthis paper; we propose to use safe period optimizations to minimize the number ofunnecessary spatial alarm evaluations; increasing the throughput and scalability of thesystem. We also develop a suite of alarm grouping techniques; based on spatial locality ofthe alarms and motion behavior of the mobile users; which reduce the safe periodcomputation costs. Subscriber mobility-based optimizations are introduced to furtherenhance the performance of the system. An evaluation of our approach using a road …,Computer Systems Science and Engineering,2010,*
A Similarity Measure for Process Mining in Service Oriented Architecture,Joonsoo Bae; Ling Liu; James Caverlee; Liang-Jie Zhang; Hyerim Bae,ABSTRACT Business processes continue to play an important role in today's service-oriented enterprise computing systems. Mining; discovering; and integrating process-oriented services has attracted growing attention in the recent years. This chapter presents aquantitative approach to modeling and capturing the similarity and dissimilarity betweendifferent process designs. The authors derive the similarity measures by analyzing theprocess dependency graphs of the participating workflow processes. They first convert eachprocess dependency graph into a normalized process matrix. Then they calculate the metricspace distance between the normalized matrices. This distance measure can be used as aquantitative and qualitative tool in process mining; process merging; and process clustering;and ultimately it can reduce or minimize the costs involved in design; analysis; and …,Web Services Research for Emerging Applications: Discoveries and Trends: Discoveries and Trends,2010,*

Web services in telecommunications; part II [Guest Editorial],Sean Moore; Ling Liu,WIP uses a fully Web- and SOA-based telephony protocol design that is converged With webdata protocols and SOA services; thereby eliminating the need for multiple commu- nication protocolstacks and removing artificial differences between traditional telephony and Web dataprotocols. For example; by using WIP; a telephony endpoint appears as yet another (Web) servicein an SOA environment and may be treated as such by other services; service-consum- ingapplications; and service orchestration and composition engines. Testing of a prototype WIPendpoint shows that performance is well within the boundaries of requirements. Because convergenceand SOA are such strong business drivers; in our opinion WIP or one of its descendents will eventuallybecome the session management protocol of choice in converged telecommunications and dataenviron- ments.

I/O-Intensive Embedded Systems: The Infopipe Approach,Carlton Pu; Greg Eisenhauer; Mustaque Ahamad; Wenchang Yan; Ling Liu; Jonathan Walpole; Karsten Schwan,Abstract: Infopipes are a distributed computational and communications abstraction forinformation flow applications and I/O intensive distributed real-time embedded (DRE)systems. Infopipes are specified by the syntax; semantics; and quality of servicerequirements for information flows. Software tools generate executable code from thespecification. Building applications that process information flows on existing middlewareplatforms is difficult; because of the variety of QoS requirements; the need for application-specific protocols; and the poor match of the commonly used abstraction of remoteinvocations to streaming. The ability to query individual Infopipe elements as well ascomposite Infopipes for properties of supported flows enables QoS-aware configuration.Similar to local protocol frameworks; Infopipes provide a flexible infrastructure for …,*,2004,*

Geophysical techniques in detection to river embankments-A case study: To locate sites of potential leaks using surface-wave and electrical methods,C Chen; J Liu; S Xu; J Xia,Abstract Geophysical technologies are very effective in environmental; engineering andgroundwater applications. Parameters of delineating nature of near-surface materials suchas compressional-wave velocity; shear-wave velocity can be obtained using shallow seismicmethods. Electric methods are primary approaches for investigating groundwater anddetecting leakage. Both of methods are applied to detect embankment in hope of obtainingevidences of the strength and moisture inside the body. A technological experiment hasdone for detecting and discovering the hidden troubles in the embankment of Yangtze River;Songzi; Hubei; China in 2003. Surface-wave and DC multi-channel array resistivitysounding techniques were used to detect hidden trouble inside and under dike like pipe-seeps.

A few strain ratepeaks; which corresponds to the glass transition and multistep crystallization in thedifferential scanning calorimeter (DSC) examination; were observed in the curves of therelation between strain rate and temperature. The onset of viscous flow and the end of glasstransition are interrelated; the first and second strain rate peaks correspond with the first andsecond crystallization transition processes; respectively. The influence of stress on strainand strain rate was researched.

Processing Continuously Moving Queries on Moving Objects: The MobiEyes Approach,Bugra Gedik; Ling Liu,Abstract Location monitoring is an important issue for real time management of mobileobject positions. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to techniques for efficientprocessing of spatial continuous queries on moving objects in a centralized locationmonitoring system. Surprisingly; very few have promoted a distributed approach to real-timelocation monitoring. This paper presents a distributed and scalable solution to processingcontinuously moving queries on moving objects. We describe the design of MobiEyes; adistributed real-time location monitoring system in a mobile environment.

This has resulted in information overload on the part of thescientists; who are unable to query all of the relevant sources; even if they knew where tofind them; what they contained; how to interact with them; and how to interpret the results.Thus instead of benefiting from this information rich environment; scientists become expertson a small number of sources and use those sources almost exclusively.

Type Safety in the Context of Method Updates,Zahir Tari; Xue Li; Ling Liu,Abstract This paper presents a framework for checking and maintaining type safety in thepresence of method evolution. A method update often affects all components of the method;including the inter face and the implementation. The type safety problem is addressed astwo levels of type consistency. The first level relates to the type checking of methods in thecontext of the class inheritance hierarchy; and concerns the semantics of the polymorphismof methods. The second level considers the implementation parts of methods by capturingand preserving the semantics of the chain of calling relationships among relevant methods.A graph-based approach is used to achieve this two-level type consistency required at thelevel of class inheritance hierarchy and the level of method invocation. We demonstrate thatthe two levels of type consistency checking combined provide a better control of the run …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,1999,*

Effect of forging temperature on microstructure and tensile properties in Fe {sub 3} Al-based alloy,Y Yang; W Yan; JN Liu; S Hanada,Forging processes at two different temperatures are performed to examine the relation betweenthe microstructure and room temperature tensile properties in a Ce doped Fe{sub 3}Al-basedalloy. Results show that the microstructure and the ductility are sensitive to the forging temperaturebefore annealing treatment. Higher yield strength and ductility can be obtained through forgingat a relatively low temperature of 750 C followed by annealing at 800 C and 500 C. It is suggestedthat the formation of non-equilibrium grain boundaries and banded subgrains withincarbide-free areas along grain boundaries enhances the local plastic deformation and resultsin the improvement of ductility.

The obtained BPs were then infiltrated with epoxy via vacuum-aided resintransfer molding (VARTM) process without the use of a solvent. Some of the impregnatedcomposites were directly cured under a vacuum pressure. The others were put into a hot-press to cure under a higher pressure of 0.7 MPa. Results have shown that the tensilestrength and modulus of the vacuum cured composites were obtained as 215 MPa and 13.3GPa; whereas these two values could reach 319 MPa and 20.3 GPa; respectively; for the hot-press cured composites.

MapReduce Analysis for Cloud-archived Data,Balaji Palanisamy Aameek Singh; Nagapramod Mandagere; Gabriel Alatorre; Ling Liu,Abstract Public storage clouds have become a popular choice for archiving certain classesof enterprise data-for example; application and infrastructure logs. As such data can bevoluminous in nature; cost and manageability advantages make clouds particularlyattractive. These logs can contain sensitive information like IP addresses or user logins dueto which regulatory and security requirements often require data to be encrypted beforemoved to the cloud. In order to leverage such data for any business value; analyticsplatforms (eg Hadoop/MapReduce) first download data from these public clouds; decrypt itand then process it at the secure enterprise site. We propose VNCache: an efficient solutionfor MapReduce analysis of such cloud-archived log data without requiring an apriori datatransfer and loading into the local Hadoop cluster. VNcache dynamically integrates …,*,*,*

Side-Effect-Free View Updates,LING LIU; M TAMER ÖZSU,A view is an un-instantiated relation. The contents of its instance depend on the view queryand the instances of the base tables. For that reason; an update issued on the view cannotbe directly applied on the view instance. Instead; it has to be translated into a series ofupdates on the base tables so that when the view query is applied again on the modifiedbase table instances; the result of the view update command will be observed on the viewinstance. Unfortunately; it is not always possible to find an update translation such that thechange observed on the view instance is the one and only the one specified by the viewupdate command. When this happens for a view update translation; the translation is said tohave no side-effects. To fully exploit the updateability power of views; it is desired to be ableto find update translations that have no side-effects.,*,*,*

MANET Databases,LING LIU; M TAMER ÖZSU,A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) database is a database that is stored in the peers of aMANET. The network is composed by a finite set of mobile peers that communicate witheach other via short range wireless protocols; such as IEEE 802.11; Bluetooth; Zigbee; orUltra Wide Band (UWB). These protocols provide broadband (typically tens of Mbps) butshort-range (typically 10–100 m) wireless communication. On each mobile peer there is alocal database that stores and manages a collection of data items; or reports. A report is aset of values sensed or entered by the user at a particular time; or otherwise obtained by amobile peer. Often a report describes a physical resource such as an available parking slot.All the local databases maintained by the mobile peers form the MANET database. Thepeers communicate reports and queries to neighbors directly; and the reports and queries …,*,*,*

Poster: Searching HIE with Differentiated Privacy Preservation,Yuzhe Tang; Ling Liu,Abstract—In emerging Health Information Exchange systems (or HIE); a search facility; suchas record locator service; is critically important for data sharing across autonomoushospitals. An understudied problem for searching HIE is the privacy preservation–how toprotect the patient's private visit-history data in the search process and how to addressinnately different privacy and sensitivity for different patients and hospitals. For instance;knowing that a patient visited a specialty hospital (eg a women's health center) may leakmore privacy than knowing that the patient visited a general hospital. In this work weproposed a differentiated privacy preservation technique for searching in HIE; coined PPLS.Given hospitals with different specialties; PPLS attempts to cluster them in order to hideamong other hospitals their specialties linked to a patient; so that an attacker can not infer …,*,*,*

G-tree: GPU-aware Parallel Indexing Techniques Towards Breaking The Curse of Dimensionality,Mincheol Kim; Wonik Choi; Ling Liu,Abstract—Since the R-tree was proposed in 1984; numerous research efforts on R-treevariants have been proposed for improving query performance of the R-tree indexing;especially in higher dimensional space. Most existing techniques differ from one another inthe mechanisms they use to divide high-dimensional data space. Despite all these existingefforts; the curse of dimensionality remains to be a big challenge since all existing indexmethods deteriorate sharply as the dimensionality increases above 100. To cope with thisproblem; we propose G-tree; a novel indexing method that does not deteriorate even inhigher dimensionality. The rationale of G-tree is to combine the benefits of the R-tree and theparallel processing power of GPUs; without inheriting their shortcomings. First; to maximizethe parallelism in GPU memory access; we employ novel node structure and index …,*,*,*

Characteristics of Information Delivery in Open and Evolving Distributed Environments,Ling Liu,With the ongoing advance in WWW technology; everyone today can publish information onthe web independently at any time. The exibility and autonomy of producing and sharinginformation on WWW is phenomenal. On the other hand; one has to learn to deal with therapid increase of volume and diversity of online information and the constant changes ofinformation sources in number; content; and location. Thus; queries to the current WWWsearch tools are mostly speci ed independently of the structure; location; or existence ofrequested information. One simply types in the keywords; the search tools will handle therequest and nd the sources that match the given keywords. However; the scalability isachieved at the price of e ectiveness of queries; namely the quality and the responsivenessof the answers; for several reasons. First; responses returned by WWW search tools often …,*,*,*

XML-Enabled Data Extraction for Web Sources,Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Wei Han,Abstract The amount of useful semi-structured data on the web continues to grow at astunning pace. Often interesting web data are not in database systems but in HTML pages;XML pages; or text files. Data in these formats is not directly usable by standard SQL-likequery processing engines that support sophisticated querying and reporting beyondkeyword-based retrieval. Hence; the web users or applications need a smart way ofextracting data from these web sources. One of the popular approaches is to write wrappersaround the sources; either manually or with software assistance; to bring the web data withinthe reach of more sophisticated query tools and general mediator-based informationintegration systems. In this paper; we describe the methodology and the softwaredevelopment of an XML-enabled wrapper construction system-XWRAP for semi …,*,*,*
PeerCQ: A Scalable and Self-Configurable Peer-to-Peer Information Monitoring System,Ling Liu,Abstract PeerCQ is a peer-to-peer Continual Query system for information monitoring on theInternet. It uses Continual Queries (CQs) as its primitives to express information-monitoringrequests. A primary objective of the PeerCQ system is to build a decentralized Internet scaledistributed information-monitoring system; which is highly scalable; self-configurable andsupports efficient and robust way of processing CQs. In this paper we describe the basicarchitecture of the PeerCQ system and focus on the mechanisms used for servicepartitioning and service lookup. There are two unique characteristics of PeerCQ. First; itintroduces a donation based peer-aware mechanism for handling the peer heterogeneity.Second; it integrates CQ-aware and peeraware information into its service partitioningscheme; while maintaining decentralization and self-configurability. We report a set of …,*,*,*
Data Privacy: Are Operating Systems Doing Enough?,Aameek Singh; Ling Liu,Abstract In this paper; we evaluate operating systems for their support for user-data privacy.Our studies at three different installations indicate that current levels of user education andOS support are astonishingly poor. For example; at one installation of 836 users; we wereable to access over 86 GB of private data; including more than 300;000 emails; using simplescanning techniques. Along with this analysis; we also present a number of OS supportmechanisms to alleviate this problem and discuss their pros and cons.,*,*,*

Security Issues in Wireless Networks,Kapil K Singh; Ling Liu,Abstract The growing popularity of mobile hand-held devices has ignited the growth ofwireless networks over the past few years. As the popularity of wireless networks increases;they are fast becoming a subject to a variety of intrusions. A number of security solutionshave been proposed to protect the wireless resources; but none of these solutions havefound a global acceptance. This paper tries to evaluate these solutions and explore thevarious directions in wireless security research. It is hoped that the examination of theexisting protocols and their possible weaknesses will facilitate future study aimed at thedevelopment of a comprehensive security solution for the wireless domain.,*,*,*

VISTA: Validating and Refining Clusters via Visualization (final version),Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Abstract Clustering is an important technique for understanding of large multi-dimensionaldatasets. Most of clustering research to date has been focused on developing automaticclustering algorithms and cluster validation methods. The automatic algorithms are known towork well in dealing with clusters of regular shapes; eg compact spherical shapes; but mayincur higher error rates when dealing with arbitrarily shaped clusters. Although some effortshave been devoted to addressing the problem of skewed datasets; the problem of handlingclusters with irregular shapes is still in its infancy; especially in terms of dimensionality of thedatasets and the precision of the clustering results considered. Not surprisingly; thestatistical indices works ineffective in validating clusters of irregular shapes; too. In thispaper; we address the problem of clustering and validating arbitrarily shaped clusters …,*,*,*
Symmetric Encryption with Efficient Keyword Search,Rui Zhang; Rui Xue; Ling Liu,Abstract. Security and efficiency are widely recognized as important requirements for queryon encrypted data in the cloud environment. In this paper we propose efficient searchablesymmetric encryption (named ESSE) schemes that support binary search and achieve bothplaintext privacy and predicate privacy. Firstly; we present an idea that constructing asearchable symmetric encryption scheme that has capability of supporting binary search.Then we give a new framework for ESSE and its security definition to show that an ESSEscheme has both plaintext privacy and predicate privacy if the underlying symmetric-keypredicateonly encryption scheme has both plaintext privacy and predicate privacy. Next; wepropose a general construction with SKPOE scheme supporting inner product queries;where the class of predicates to be F={fy| y 2 Σ} with fy (x)= 1iff hx; yi= 0. Finally; we …,*,*,*
iVIBRATE: Interactive Visualization Based Framework for Clustering Large Datasets (Version 3),Keke Chen; Ling Liu,Abstract With continued advances in communication network technology and sensingtechnology; there is an astounding growth in the amount of data produced and madeavailable through the cyberspace. Efficient and high-quality clustering of large datasetscontinues to be one of the most important problems in largescale data analysis. A commonlyused methodology for cluster analysis on large datasets is the three-phase framework of“sampling/summarization− iterative cluster analysis− disk-labeling”. There are three knownproblems with this framework; which demand effective solutions. The first problem is how toeffectively define and validate irregularly shaped clusters; especially in large datasets.Automated algorithms and statistical methods are typically not effective in handling suchparticular clusters. The second problem is how to effectively label the entire data on disk …,*,*,*
Scaling Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Networks with Heterogeneity-Aware Topology And Routing,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Bungra Gedik; Ling Liu,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems such as Gnutella have been widelyacknowledged as the fastest growing Internet applications ever. The P2P model has manypotential advantages including high flexibility and server-less management. However; thesesystems suffer from the well-known performance mismatch between the randomlyconstructed overlay network topology and the underlying IP-layer topology. This paperproposes to structure the P2P overlay topology using a heterogeneity-aware multi-tiertopology to better balance the load at peers with heterogeneous capacities and to preventlow capability nodes from throttling the performance of the system. An analytical model isdeveloped to enable the construction and maintenance of heterogeneity-aware overlaytopologies with good node connectivity and better load balance. We also develop an …,*,*,*
