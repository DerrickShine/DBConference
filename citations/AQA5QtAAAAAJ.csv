On indoor position location with wireless LANs,Phongsak Prasithsangaree; Prashant Krishnamurthy; Panos Chrysanthis,Location aware services are becoming attractive with the deployment of next generationwireless networks and broadband multimedia wireless networks especially in indoor andcampus areas. To provide location aware services; obtaining the position of a useraccurately is important. While it is possible to deploy additional infrastructure for thispurpose; using existing communications infrastructure is preferred for cost reasons. Becauseof technical restrictions; location fingerprinting schemes are the most promising. In this paperwe present a systematic study of the performance tradeoff and deployment issues. In thispaper we present some experimental results towards such a systematic study and discusssome issues related to the indoor positioning problem.,Personal; Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications; 2002.

Synthesis of extended transaction models using ACTA,Panos K Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract ACTA is a comprehensive transaction framework that facilitates the formaldescription of properties of extended transaction models. Specifically; using ACTA; one canspecify and reason about (1) the effects of transactions on objects and (2) the interactionsbetween transactions. This article presents ACTA as a tool for the synthesis of extendedtransaction models; one which supports the development and analysis of new extendedtransaction models in a systematic manner. Here; this is demonstrated by deriving newtransaction definitions (1) by modifying the specifications of existing transaction models;(2)by combining the specifications of existing models; and (3) by starting from first principles. Toexemplify the first; new models are synthesized from atomic transactions and jointransactions. To illustrate the second; we synthesize a model that combines aspect of the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1994,336
Balancing energy efficiency and quality of aggregate data in sensor networks,Mohamed A Sharaf; Jonathan Beaver; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract. In-network aggregation has been proposed as one method for reducing energyconsumption in sensor networks. In this paper; we explore two ideas related to furtherreducing energy consumption in the context of in-network aggregation. The first is byinfluencing the construction of the routing trees for sensor networks with the goal of reducingthe size of transmitted data. To this end; we propose a group-aware network configurationmethod that “clusters” along the same path sensor nodes that belong to the same group. Thesecond idea involves imposing a hierarchy of output filters on the sensor network with thegoal of both reducing the size of transmitted data and minimizing the number of transmittedmessages. More specifically; we propose a framework to use temporal coherency tolerancesin conjunction with in-network aggregation to save energy at the sensor nodes while …,The VLDB journal,2004,319
TiNA: a scheme for temporal coherency-aware in-network aggregation,Mohamed A Sharaf; Jonathan Beaver; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract This paper presents TiNA; a scheme for minimizing energy consumption in sensornetworks by exploiting end-user tolerance to temporal coherency. TiNA utilizes temporalcoherency tolerances to both reduce the amount of information transmitted by individualnodes (communication cost dominates power usage in sensor networks); and to improvequality of data when not all sensor readings can be propagated up the network within agiven time constraint. TiNA was evaluated against a traditional in-network aggregationscheme with respect to power savings as well as the quality of data for aggregate queries.Preliminary results show that TiNA can reduce power consumption by up to 50% without anyloss in the quality of data.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2003,312

Supporting semantics-based transaction processing in mobile database applications,Gary D Walborn; Panos K Chrysanthis,Advances in computer and telecommunication technologies have made mobile computing areality. However; greater mobility implies a more tenuous network connection and a higherrate of disconnection. In order to tolerate disconnections as well as to reduce the delays andcost of wireless communication; it is necessary to support autonomous mobile operations ondata shared by stationary hosts. This would allow the part of a computation executing on amobile host to continue executing while the mobile host is not connected to the network. Inthis paper; we examine whether object semantics can be exploited to facilitate autonomousand disconnected operation in mobile database applications. We define the class offragmentable objects which may be split among a number of sites; operated uponindependently at each site; and then recombined in a semantically consistent fashion.

Theseextensions came about because the atomic transaction model in conjunction withserializability is found to be very constraining when used in advanced applications (eg;design databases) that function in distributed; cooperative; and heterogeneousenvironments.

Exploiting versions for handling updates in broadcast disks,Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Recently; broadcasting has attracted considerable attention as a means ofdisseminating information to large client populations in both wired and wireless settings. Inthis paper; we exploit versions to increase the concurrency of client transactions in thepresence of updates. We consider three alternative mediums for storing versions:(a) the air:older versions are broadcast along with current data;(b) the client's local cache: olderversions are maintained in cache; and (c) a local database or warehouse at the client: part ofthe server's database is maintained at the client in the form of a multiversion materializedview. The proposed techniques are scalable in that they provide consistency without anydirect communication from clients to the server. Performance results show that the overheadof maintaining versions can be kept low; while providing a considerable increase in …,VLDB,1999,111

KDDCS: a load-balanced in-network data-centric storage scheme for sensor networks,Mohamed Aly; Kirk Pruhs; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract We propose an In-Network Data-Centric Storage (INDCS) scheme for answering ad-hoc queries in sensor networks. Previously proposed In-Network Storage (INS) schemessuffered from Storage Hot-Spots that are formed if either the sensors' locations are notuniformly distributed over the coverage area; or the distribution of sensor readings is notuniform over the range of possible reading values. Our KD tree based Data-Centric Storage(KDDCS) scheme maintains the invariant that the storage of events is distributed reasonablyuniformly among the sensors. KDDCS is composed of a set of distributed algorithms whoserunning time is within a poly-log factor of the diameter of the network. The number ofmessages any sensor has to send; as well as the bits in those messages; is poly-logarithmicin the number of sensors.

Multiversion data broadcast,Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos K Chrysanthis,Recently; broadcasting has attracted considerable attention as a means of disseminatinginformation to large client populations in both wired and wireless settings. In this paper; weconsider broadcasting multiple versions of data items to increase the concurrency of clienttransactions in the presence of updates. We introduce various techniques for organizingmultiple versions on the broadcast channel. Performance results show that the overhead ofsupporting multiple versions can be kept low while providing a considerable increase inconcurrency. Besides increasing the concurrency of client transactions; multiversionbroadcast provides clients with the possibility of accessing multiple server states in a singlebroadcast cycle. Furthermore; multiversioning increases the tolerance of client transactionsof disconnections from the broadcast channel.,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2002,75
Algorithms and metrics for processing multiple heterogeneous continuous queries,Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Kirk Pruhs,Abstract The emergence of monitoring applications has precipitated the need for DataStream Management Systems (DSMSs); which constantly monitor incoming data feeds(through registered continuous queries); in order to detect events of interest. In this article;we examine the problem of how to schedule multiple Continuous Queries (CQs) in a DSMSto optimize different Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. We show that; unlike traditional onlinesystems; scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will bedifferent from policies that optimize for average slowdown; which is a more appropriatemetric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. Towards this; we proposepolicies to optimize for the average-case performance for both metrics.

Recovery and performance of atomic commit processing in distributed database systems,PK Chrysanthis; G Samaras; YJ Al-Houmaily,Abstract A transaction is traditionally de ned so as to provide the properties of atomicity;consistency; integrity; and durability (ACID) for any operation it performs. In order to ensurethe atomicity of distributed transactions; an atomic commit protocol needs to be followed byall sites participating in a transaction execution to agree on the nal outcome; that is; commitor abort. A variety of commit protocols have been proposed that either enhance theperformance of the classical two-phase commit protocol during normal processing or reducethe cost of recovery processing after a failure. In this chapter; we survey a number of two-phase commit variants and optimizations; including some recent ones; providing an insightin the performance trade-o between normal and recovery processing.

Distributed databases and peer-to-peer databases: past and present,Angela Bonifati; Panos K Chrysanthis; Aris M Ouksel; Kai-Uwe Sattler,Abstract The need for large-scale data sharing between autonomous and possiblyheterogeneous decentralized systems on the Web gave rise to the concept of P2P databasesystems. Decentralized databases are; however; not new. Whereas a definition for a P2Pdatabase system can be readily provided; a comparison with the more establisheddecentralized models; commonly referred to as distributed; federated and multi-databases;is more likely to provide a better insight to this new P2P data management technology. Thus;in the paper; by distinguishing between db-centric and P2P-centric features; we examinefeatures common to these database systems as well as other ad-hoc features that solelycharacterize P2P databases. We also provide a non-exhaustive taxonomy of the mostprominent research efforts toward the realization of full-fledged P2P databases.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2008,58

In such an environment; thepropagation latency will be the dominant component of the overall communication cost whilethe migration of large amount of data will not pose a problem. Furthermore; computersystems are expected to become highly reliable. In this paper; we present a two-phasecommit variant that exploits these new domain characteristics to minimize the cost ofdistributed transaction commitment. Although the protocol trades oe ciency during normalprocessing for slower recovery; it supports forward recovery that potentially reduces theoverall cost of recovery.,Int.

Zone Sharing: A hot-spots decomposition scheme for data-centric storage in sensor networks,Mohamed Aly; Nicholas Morsillo; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs,Abstract In the resource over-constrained environment of sensor networks; techniques forstoring data locally in sensor nodes have been proposed to support efficient processing ofad-hoc queries. These data-centric storage (DCS) techniques differ in the method ofmapping events to sensors; but all of them fail to deal with storage hot-spots due to irregularsensors deployments; and (or) data distributions. In this paper; we present Zone Sharing(ZS); a novel distributed scheme for the decomposition of storage hot-spots. We apply ZS tothe DIM scheme; which has been shown to be the best among all DCS schemes. ZS locallydetects hot-spots and tries to evenly distribute their loads among the sensor nodes in thenetwork. Simulations have shown the efficiency of ZS in decomposing small to moderatesized hot-spots without imposing an additional energy load to the network nodes.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Data management for sensor networks,2005,48

Power-aware in-network query processing for sensor data,Jonathan Beaver; Mohamed A Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Minimizing energy consumption has been a major objective at all levels in sensornetworks. In this paper; we present TiNA; an in-network aggregation scheme that maintainsthe user-specified quality of data requirement while significantly reducing the overall energyconsumption. Specifically; since communication dominates power usage in sensornetworks; TiNA exploits end-user temporal coherency tolerances to reduce the amount ofinformation transmitted by individual nodes. Further; we show that TiNa; by using temporalcoherency tolerances; can allow for better quality of data when the time given to performreadings is too short for all data to be propagated up through the network. We compare ourproposed scheme against an existing in-network aggregation scheme with a local sensorcache.

Optimized query routing trees for wireless sensor networks,Panayiotis Andreou; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Andreas Pamboris; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras,Abstract In order to process continuous queries over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs);sensors are typically organized in a Query Routing Tree (denoted as T) that provides eachsensor with a path over which query results can be transmitted to the querying node. Wefound that current methods deployed in predominant data acquisition systems construct T ina sub-optimal manner which leads to significant waste of energy. In particular; since T isconstructed in an ad hoc manner there is no guarantee that a given query workload will bedistributed equally among all sensors. That leads to data collisions which represent a majorsource of energy waste. Additionally; current methods only provide a topological-basedmethod; rather than a query-based method; to define the interval during which a sensingdevice should enable its transceiver in order to collect the query results from its children …,Information Systems,2011,41
Decomposing data-centric storage query hot-spots in sensor networks,Mohamed Aly; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs,Arising when a large percentage of queries is accessing data stored in few sensor nodes;query hot-spots reduce the quality of data (QoD) and the lifetime of the sensor network. Allcurrent in-network data-centric storage (IN-DCS) schemes fail to deal with query hot-spotsresulting from skewed query loads as well as skewed sensor deployments. In this paper; wepresent two algorithms to locally detect and decompose query hot-spots; namely zonepartitioning (ZP) and zone partial replication (ZPR). We build both algorithms on top of theDIM scheme; which has been shown to exhibit the best performance among all INDCSschemes. Experimental evaluation illustrates the efficiency of ZP/ZPR in decomposing queryhot-spots while increasing QoD as well as energy savings by balancing energy consumptionamong sensor nodes.,Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems-Workshops; 2006. 3rd Annual International Conference on,2006,41
1-2PC: the one-two phase atomic commit protocol,Yousef J Al-Houmaily; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract This paper proposes a one-phase; two-phase commit (1-2PC) protocol that can beused to atomically commit Internet transactions distributed across sites in a wide areanetwork. The 1-2PC protocol is characterized by its ability to dynamically select between one-phase and two-phase atomic commit protocols depending on the behavior of transactionsand the system requirements. Thus; it offers the performance advantages of the one-phaseatomic commit protocol whenever possible; while still providing the wide applicability of thetwo-phase commit protocol. This is achieved in spite of the incompatibilities between one-phase and two-phase commit protocols that lead to the general practice of having to adopt asingle atomic commit protocol in any distributed database system.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2004,40

In this paper; we examine the problem of how toschedule CQs in a DSMS to optimize for average QoS. We show that unlike standard on-linesystems; scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will bedifferent than policies that optimize for average slowdown which is more appropriate metricto use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. We also propose a hybrid schedulingpolicy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness.We further discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploitsharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs. Finally; we experimentallyshow using real data that our policies outperform currently used ones.,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,39

Furthermore; for read-only transactions; theyapply their unsolicited update-vote optimization and show that the cost associated with thistype of transactions is the same in both presumed commit and presumed abort protocols;thus; nullifying the basis for the argument that favors the presumed abort protocol. This isespecially important for modern distributed environments which are characterized by highreliability and high probability of transactions being committed rather than aborted.,Data Engineering; 1997.

A new token passing distributed mutual exclusion algorithm,Sujata Banerjee; Panos K Chrysanthis,Eliminating interference between concurrently executing activities through mutual exclusionis one of the most fundamental problems in computer systems. The problem of mutualexclusion in a distributed system is especially interesting owing to the lack of globalknowledge in the presence of variable communication delays. In this paper; a new token-based distributed mutual exclusion algorithm is proposed. The algorithm incursapproximately three messages at high loads; irrespective of the number of nodes N in thesystem. At low loads; it requires approximately N messages.

A typicalmaterialized view V maintains the complete results of a query Q in order to minimize the costof future query executions. In a sensor network context; maintaining consistency between Vand the underlying and distributed base relation R is very expensive in terms ofcommunication. Thus; our approach focuses on a subset V (sube. V) that unveils only the khighest-ranked answers at the sink for some user defined parameter k.

Preemptive rate-based operator scheduling in a data stream management system,Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Summary form only given. Data stream management systems are being developed toprocess continuous queries over multiple data streams. These continuous queries aretypically used for monitoring purposes where the detection of an event might trigger asequence of actions or the execution of a set of specified tasks. Such events are identified bytuples produced by a query and hence; it is important to produce the available portions of aquery result as early as possible. A core element for improving the interactive performanceof a continuous query is the operator scheduler. An operator scheduler is particularlyimportant when the processing requirements and the productivity of different streams arehighly skewed. The need for an operator scheduler becomes even more crucial when tuplesfrom different streams arrive asynchronously. To meet these needs; we are proposing a …,Computer Systems and Applications; 2005. The 3rd ACS/IEEE International Conference on,2005,32

This implies that sensor queries need to be optimized withrespect to both response time and energy consumption. With these requirements in mind;we develop novel cross-layer optimization techniques that utilize information about how themedium access control (MAC) layer operates while processing queries in large scale sensornetwork environments. The central framework of our approach is a Data TransmissionAlgebra that uniformly captures the structure of data transmissions along with theirconstraints and requirements. Our framework enables both qualitative analysis andquantitative cost-based optimization of sensor queries. We illustrate the effectiveness of ourframework by developing a collision-aware scheduler and evaluating it experimentally.,Proceeedings of the 1st international workshop on Data management for sensor networks: in conjunction with VLDB 2004,2004,32
Supporting mobile database access through query by icons,Antonio Massari; Susan Weissman; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract In this paper; we present both the theoretical framework and a prototype of a queryprocessing facility that supports the exploration and query of databases from a mobilecomputer through the manipulation of icons. Icons are particularly suitable for mobilecomputing since they can be manipulated without typing. The facility requires no specialknowledge of the location or the content of the remote database nor understanding of thedetails of the database schema. Its iconic query language involves no path specification incomposing a query. The query facility provides metaquery tools that assist in the formulationof complete queries in an incremental manner on the mobile computer and without involvingaccess to the actual data in the remote database. By not requiring constant access andcaching of the actual data; it is able to effectively cope with the inherent limitations in …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1996,32
Qbi: Query by icons,Antonio Massari; Stefano Pavani; Lorenzo Saladini; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract QBI is an icon-based query processing and exploration facility for large distributeddatabases [3]. As opposed to other interactive query interfaces; it combines (1) a pure iconicspecification; ie; no diagrams of any form; only icon manipulation; with (2) intensionalbrowsing or metaquery tools that assist in the formulation of complete queries withoutinvolving path specification or access to the actual data in the database. Path expressionsare automatically generated by QBI and irrespective of their length; represented by a singleicon; allowing for better use of the screen. It requires no special knowledge of the content ofthe underlying database nor understanding of the details of the database schema. Hence;QBI is domain independent and equally useful to both unsophisticated and expert users.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,30
Personalizing information gathering for mobile database clients,Susan Weissman Lauzac; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Mobile agents are ideal for mobile computing environments because of their abilityto support asynchronous communication and flexible query processing since tasks can bedelegated to mobile agents when a mobile client is disconnected. This paper explores theuse of mobile agents in personalizing information gathering for mobile database clients.Personalized data take the form of materialized views and personalization is provided in theform of view maintenance options. These options; expressed using an extended SQL CreateView command; offer a finer grain of control and balance between data availability andcurrency; the amount of wireless communication and the cost of maintaining consistency.The paper defines recomputational consistency and introduces new levels of materializedview consistency to better characterize the mobile client view currency customizations.,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2002,29
Efficient data dissemination to mobile clients in e-commerce applications,Ruchi Agrawal; Panos K Chrysanthis,Mobile commerce is the next growing area in electronic commerce and mobile computing.These are sophisticated; data-intensive mobile applications whose success dependsstrongly on the efficiency by which data are disseminated to a large number of mobile users.Different techniques have been put forward; of which the most promising are the push-basedtechniques that explore the asymmetry in wireless communications and the reduced energyconsumption of the receiving mode on mobile devices. This paper proposes a newbroadcast indexing scheme; termed" constant-size I-node distributed indexing"(CI); thatoffers more energy savings in practical applications. Our detailed simulation results indicatethat CI; which is a variant of the currently best-performing distributed indexing scheme;outperforms the latter for broadcast sizes of 12;000 or fewer data items; reducing the …,Advanced Issues of E-Commerce and Web-Based Information Systems; WECWIS 2001; Third International Workshop on.,2001,28

Framework for experimenting with QoS for multimedia services,Deming Chen; Regis Colwell; Herschel Gelman; Panos K Chrysanthis; Daniel Mosse,It has been recognized that an effective support for multimedia applications must provideQuality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Current methods propose to provide such QoSguarantees through coordinated network resource reservations. In our approach; we extendthis idea providing system-wide QoS guarantees that consider the data manipulation andtransformations needed in the intermediate and end sites of the network. Given a user's QoSrequirements; multisegment virtual channels are established with the necessarycommunication and computation resources reserved for the timely; synchronized; andreliable delivery of the different datatypes. Such data originate in several distributed datarepositories; are transformed at intermediate service stations into suitable formats fortransportation and presentation; and are delivered to a viewing unit. In this paper; we first …,Multimedia Computing and Networking 1996,1996,28

Freshness-Aware Scheduling of Continuous Queries in the Dynamic Web.,Mohamed A Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs,ABSTRACT The dynamics of the Web and the demand for new; active services are imposingnew requirements on Web servers. One such new service is the processing of continuousqueries whose output data stream can be used to support the personalization of individualuser's web pages. In this paper; we are proposing a new scheduling policy for continuousqueries with the objective of maximizing the freshness of the output data stream and hencethe QoD of such new services. The proposed Freshness-Aware Scheduling of MultipleContinuous Queries (FAS-MCQ) policy decides the execution order of continuous queriesbased on each query's properties (ie; cost and selectivity) as well the properties of the inputupdate streams (ie; variability of updates). Our experimental results have shown that FAS-MCQ can increase freshness by up to 50% compared to existing scheduling policies used …,WebDB,2005,27

In this paper; we areaddressing the issue of efficient delivery of business decision support data in the form ofsummary tables to mobile clients equipped with OLAP front-end tools. Towards this; wepropose a new on-demand scheduling algorithm; called SBS; that exploits both thederivation semantics among OLAP summary tables and the mobile clients' capabilities ofexecuting simple SQL queries.

Utilizing versions of views within a mobile environment,Susan Weissman Lauzac; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Data caching and hoarding provide the only means to support disconnected mobileoperations. In the context of mobile database applications; data cached can take the form ofa materialized view. In this paper; we present a mechanism or view holder within the fixednetwork; whose job is to maintain versions of the views that are required by a particularmobile host. These views are very likely to be a small and specialized portion of theinformation found within the various data sources and; therefore; versions can bedynamically maintained by the view holder without incurring huge storage requirements. Inaddition; the view holder will respond to mobile host's queries by communicating only thedifferences between versions. Thus; a view holder mediates and exports the views neededby a mobile host; and updates are computed and delivered in a flexible and batch …,In Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Computing and Information,1998,26
Optimized processing of multiple aggregate continuous queries,Shenoda Guirguis; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Data Streams Management Systems are designed to support monitoringapplications; which require the processing of hundreds of Aggregate Continuous Queries(ACQs). These ACQs typically have different time granularities; with possibly differentselection predicates and group-by attributes. In order to achieve scalability in the presenceof heavy workloads; in this paper; we introduce the concept of'Weaveability'as an indicator ofthe potential gains of sharing the processing of ACQs. We then propose Weave Share; acost-based optimizer that exploits weaveability to optimize the shared processing of ACQs.Our experimental analysis shows that Weave Share outperforms the alternative sharingschemes generating up to four orders of magnitude better quality plans. Finally; we describea practical implementation of the Weave Share optimizer.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,24

Multicastapplications range from the relief of Internet hot spots to healthcare alert systems. Muchresearch has focused on isolated data management issues that arise in a multicastenvironment; including our previous work on caching; scheduling; indexing; hybridschemes; and consistency maintenance. This paper discusses the integration of theseresearch contributions and the transition to a working software distribution that provides themiddleware support of a data management layer to applications.

However owing to the inherent limitations of mobile computing; we need toaugment the well-developed techniques of database management systems with newapproaches. We focus on the challenge of assuring data consistency. Our approach oflocalization is to reformulate global constraints so as to enhance the autonomy of the mobilehosts. We show how this approach unifies techniques of maintaining replicated data withmethods of enforcing polynomial inequalities.

ETC: energy-driven tree construction in wireless sensor networks,Panayiotis Andreou; Andreas Pamboris; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras,Continuous queries in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are founded on the premise ofQuery Routing Tree structures (denoted as T); which provide sensors with a path to thequerying node. Predominant data acquisition systems for WSNs construct such structures inan ad-hoc manner and therefore there is no guarantee that a given query workload will bedistributed equally among all sensors. That leads to data collisions which represent a majorsource of energy waste. In this paper we present the Energy-driven Tree Construction (ETC)algorithm; which balances the workload among nodes and minimizes data collisions; thusreducing energy consumption; during data acquisition in WSNs. We show through real micro-benchmarks on the CC2420 radio chip and trace-driven experimentation with real datasetsfrom Intel Research and UC-Berkeley that ETC can provide significant energy reductions …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009.

Caching and Replication in Mobile Data Management.,Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Mobile data management has been an active area of research for the past fifteenyears. Besides dealing with mobility itself; issues central in data management for mobilecomputing include low bandwidth; intermittent network connectivity and scarcity of resourceswith emphasis on power management. In this article; we focus on how caching andreplication in mobile data management address these challenges.

Database schema evolution using EVER diagrams,Chien-Tsai Liu; Shi-Kuo Chang; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract We present an approach to schema evolution through changes to the ER diagramrepresenting the schema of a database. In order to facilitate changes to the ER schema weenhance the graphical constructs used in ER diagrams; and develop EVER; an EVolutionaryER diagram for specifying the derivation relationships between schema versions;relationships among attributes; and the conditions for maintaining consistent views ofprograms.

Delegation in ACTA to control sharing in extended transactions,Panos K.  Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract ACTA is a comprehensive transaction framework that facilitates the formaldescription of properties of extended transaction models. Speci cally; using ACTA; one canspecify and reason about (1) the e ects of transactions on objects and (2) the interactionsbetween transactions. This paper focuses on one of the building blocks of ACTA; namelydelegation. A transaction ti can delegate to tj the responsibility for committing or aborting anoperation op. Once this delegation occurs; it is as if tj performed op and not ti. We discusshow the notion of delegation is useful to capture the interactions that take place in extendedtransactions.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,1993,22

Similarity-aware query processing in sensor networks,Ping Xia; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,We assume a sensor network with data-centric storage; where sensor data is stored withinthe sensor network and ad hoc queries are disseminated and processed inside the network.In such an environment; there are often similarities among submitted queries. Using currentsolutions; similar queries may have to go through the same expensive query processingsteps thus wasting energy. In this paper; we propose a similarity-aware query processingscheme (SAQP) that materializes previous query results within the sensor network andutilizes these materialized results to answer future similar queries. Through simulation; wedemonstrate that our SAQP scheme reduces energy consumption on queries with negligibleincrease in response time; and without compromising the quality of data,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2006.

Towards universal mobile caching,Ganesh Santhanakrishnan; Ahmed Amer; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract In the context of mobile data access; data caching is fundamental for bothperformance and functionality. For this reason there have been many studies intodeveloping energy-efficient caching algorithms suitable for specific mobile environments. Inthis papers; we present a novel caching policy; Universal Mobile Caching (UMC); which issuitable for managing object caches in structurally varying environments; and which is self-optimizing for changing workloads. UMC is based on a simple set of basic criteria whichreflect a spectrum of possible caching policies. UMC has demonstrated the ability to providecaching benefits in the on-demand retrieval of web documents for the mobile web; whereinmultiple levels of intervening caches can create adverse workloads for other generalcaching schemes.

Such architectures are part of anincreasing number of emerging applications in wireless mobile computing systems; theyalso provide a scalable means to deliver information in web-based applications; for examplein publish-subscribe systems. We introduce various forms of temporal and semanticcoherency applicable to such architectures and present a framework to precisely de. neprotocols for enforcing them.,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,21
The implicit-yes vote commit protocol with delegation of commitment,Y Al-Houmaily; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract The implicit yes {vote commit protocol (IYV); proposed for future gigabit {networkeddistributed databases; reduces the time required to commit a distributed transaction at theexpense of independent recovery of failed participant sites. In this paper; we propose anovel coordination scheme for IYV that reduces the window of vulnerability to blocking andminimizes the time required for the sites to become operational after a failure. The newscheme combines the delegation of commitment technique with a timestampsynchronization mechanism. Although this new scheme incurs extra coordination messagesand log writes; it enhances the performance of IYV during recovery in the presence of lessreliable sites while still maintaining the cost of commit processing during normal processingbelow that of twophase commit and its other well known variants.,Proc. of 9th Intl.

Visual query of completely encapsulated objects,Antonio Massari; Panos K Chrysanthis,This paper presents a general purpose object query system and language; called QBI(Query by Icon); that involves the manipulation of icons for composing a query. It requiresneither special knowledge of the content of the underlying database or understanding of thedetails of the database schema; hence it is equally useful to both unsophisticated and expertusers. A user perceives the database as classes of objects and generalized attributes whilethe system internally maintains a schema of the underlying database rich in semanticinformation. No relationship specification is required for composing a query. Furthermore;automatic natural language feedback and cardinality constraints analysis assist users inquery specification.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1995: Distributed Object Management; Proceedings.

Three-level processing of multiple aggregate continuous queries,Shenoda Guirguis; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Aggregate Continuous Queries (ACQs) are both a very popular class of Continuous Queries(CQs) and also have a potentially high execution cost. As such; optimizing the processing ofACQs is imperative for Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) to reach their fullpotential in supporting (critical) monitoring applications. For multiple ACQs that vary inwindow specifications and pre-aggregation filters; existing multiple ACQs optimizationschemes assume a processing model where each ACQ is computed as a final-aggregationof a sub-aggregation. In this paper; we propose a novel processing model for ACQs; calledTri Ops; with the goal of minimizing the repetition of operator execution at the sub-aggregation level.

Enforcing policy and data consistency of cloud transactions,Marian K Iskander; Dave W Wilkinson; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis,In distributed transactional database systems deployed over cloud servers; entitiescooperate to form proofs of authorizations that are justified by collections of certifiedcredentials. These proofs and credentials may be evaluated and collected over extendedtime periods under the risk of having the underlying authorization policies or the usercredentials being in inconsistent states. It therefore becomes possible for a policy-basedauthorization systems to make unsafe decisions that might threaten sensitive resources. Inthis paper; we highlight the criticality of the problem. We then present the first formalization ofthe concept of trusted transactions when dealing with proofs of authorizations. Accordingly;we define different levels of policy consistency constraints and present different enforcementapproaches to guarantee the trustworthiness of transactions executing on cloud servers …,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW); 2011 31st International Conference on,2011,20
Towards the measurement of tuple space performance,Daniel Fiedler; Kristen Walcott; Thomas Richardson; Gregory M Kapfhammer; Ahmed Amer; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Many applications rely upon a tuple space within distributed system middleware toprovide loosely coupled communication and service coordination. This paper describes anapproach for measuring the throughput and response time of a tuple space when it handlesconcurrent local space interactions. Furthermore; it discusses a technique that populates atuple space with tuples before the execution of a benchmark in order to age the tuple spaceand provide a worst-case measurement of space performance. We apply the tuple spacebenchmarking and aging methods to the measurement of the performance of a JavaSpace;a current example of a tuple space that integrates with the Jini network technology. Theexperiment results indicate that:(i) the JavaSpace exhibits limited scalability as the numberof concurrent interactions from local space clients increases;(ii) the aging technique can …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2005,20
Multi-criteria routing in wireless sensor-based pervasive environments,Qinglan Li; Jonathan Beaver; Ahmed Amer; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Ganesh Santhanakrishnan,Wireless sensor networks are expected to be an integral part of any pervasive computingenvironment. This implies an ever-increasing need for efficient energy and resourcemanagement of both the sensor nodes; as well as the overall sensor network; in order tomeet the expected quality of data and service requirements. There have been numerousstudies that have looked at the routing of data in sensor networks with the sole intention ofreducing communication power consumption. However; there has been comparatively littleprior art in the area of multi-criteria based routing that exploit both the semantics of queriesand the state of sensor nodes to improve network service longevity.

Algebraic optimization of data delivery patterns in mobile sensor networks,Vladimir Zadorozhny; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Database-like query processing over a network of sensors has become an attractiveparadigm for building sensor applications. A sensor query is characterized by data streamsamong participating sensor nodes with possible in-node data filtering or aggregation; andcan be described as a tree-like data delivery pattern. The data delivery pattern can also beconsidered as a query execution plan; or query routing tree. We propose an algebraicoptimization of the query routing tree construction and reconfiguration. In particular; we aimat generating query trees that maximize collision-free concurrent data transmissions hencereducing energy and time wastes due to retransmissions. Towards this; we introduce a datatransmission algebra (DTA) and apply it for efficient generation of such query trees.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2004.

PRO-MOTION: Support for mobile database access,Gary D Walborn; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract In order to provide data consistency in the presence of failures and concurrency;database methods will continue to be important to the processing of shared information in amobile computing environment. It is important; therefore; that we develop transactionprocessing systems that accommodate the limitations of mobile computing; such as frequentdisconnection; limited battery life; low-bandwidth communication and reduced storagecapacity; so that we can migrate existing database applications to mobile environments. Inthis paper; motivated by these needs; we propose a mobile transaction processing systemthat supports disconnected transaction processing in a mobile client-server environment.The proposed system employs compacts; which encapsulate access methods; stateinformation and consistency constraints; to allow for local management of database …,Personal Technologies,1997,20
In search of acceptability criteria: Database consistency requirements and transaction correctness properties,Krithi Ramamritham; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Whereas serializability captures database consistency requirements andtransaction correctness properties via a single notion; recent research has attempted tocome up with correctness criteria that view these two types of requirements independently.In this paper; we develop a taxonomy of various correctness criteria that focus on databaseconsistency requirements and transaction correctness properties from the viewpoint of whatthe different dimensions of these two are. This taxonomy allows us to categorize correctnesscriteria that have been proposed in the literature. To help in this categorization; we haveapplied a uniform speci cation technique; based on ACTA; to express the various criteria.Such a categorization helps shed light on the similarities and di erences between di erentcriteria and to place them in perspective.,Distributed Object Management,1993,20
Gradient-ascending routing via footprints in wireless sensor networks,Jai-Jin Lim; Kang G Shin,A novel gradient-ascending stateless routing protocol; called GRASP (gradient ascendingstateless protocol); is proposed for stationary wireless sensor networks. GRASP is built witha novel packet forwarding method called FBF (footprint-based forwarding); in which eachnode maintains a Bloom filter that holds a dejavu image for the nodes whose packets wererelayed through the filter. Forwarding a packet through networked sensors is then justrunning a membership test of the packet's destination against the networked Bloom filters;either dropping the packet before it reaches the destination or eventually delivering it to thedestination. An extensive simulation study with various routing scenarios has shown theproposed method to achieve about 99% packet delivery while incurring only a small amountof overhead. It also achieves more than 86% packet delivery even for a lossy channel …,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 2005. RTSS 2005. 26th IEEE International,2005,19
Scalable dissemination: what's hot and what's not,Jonathan Beaver; Nicholas Morsillo; Kirk Pruhs; Panos K Chrysanthis; Vincenzo Liberatore,Abstract A major problem in web database applications and on the Internet in general is thescalable delivery of data. One proposed solution for this problem is a hybrid system thatuses multicast push to scalably deliver the most popular data; and reserves traditionalunicast pull for delivery of less popular data. However; such a hybrid scheme introduces avariety of data management problems at the server. In this paper we examine three of theseproblems: the push popularity problem; the document classification problem; and thebandwidth division problem. The push popularity problem is to estimate the popularity of thedocuments in the web site. The document classification problem is to determine whichdocuments should be pushed and which documents must be pulled. The band-widthdivision problem is to determine how much of the server bandwidth to devote to pushed …,Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on the Web and Databases: colocated with ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2004,2004,19

We found that these structures are sub-optimality constructed inpredominant data acquisition systems leading to an enormous waste of energy. In this paperwe present MicroPulse; a workload-aware optimization algorithm for query routing trees inwireless sensor networks. Our algorithm is established on profiling recent data acquisitionactivity and on identifying the bottlenecks using an in-network execution of the critical pathmethod.

Data sharing and recovery in gigabit-networked databases,Sujata Banerjee; Panos K Chrysanthis,Major advances in optical fiber transmission and switching technology have enabled thedevelopment of very high speed networks with data rates of the order of gigabits per second.It is anticipated that in the future; wide area gigabit networks will interconnect databaseservers around the globe creating extremely powerful distributed information systems. In thispaper; we examine the implications of such a high speed network on data access andsharing techniques and propose a lock-based concurrency control protocol and a log-basedrecovery protocol that ensures data consistency in gigabit-networked databases. Bothprotocols exploit the characteristics of a gigabit network to enhance the performance of thedatabase system and; in particular; the fact that the size of the message is less of a concernthan the number of sequential phases of message passing.,Computer Communications and Networks; 1995.

Autonomy Requirements in Heterogeneous Distributed Database Systems.,Panos K Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract In the context of multidatabase systems and heterogeneous distributed databasesystems; it has been observed that autonomy of the component databases has to be violatedin order to maintain traditional database and transaction properties. However; very little workexists that systematically analyzes (a) the semantics of autonomy and (b) the implications ofautonomy vis a vis correctness speci cations and database protocols. Hence; this paper isaimed at characterizing the di erent types of autonomy by focusing on transactionmanagement and showing the relationships between autonomy requirements and databaseprotocols. As a case-study; we investigate the autonomy implications of the two-phasecommit protocol and its multidatabase variants. Our analysis shows that these protocolsinvolve tradeo s between the autonomy of the transactions; with respect to accessing the …,COMAD,1994,17
Astroshelf: understanding the universe through scalable navigation of a galaxy of annotations,Panayiotis Neophytou; Roxana Gheorghiu; Rebecca Hachey; Timothy Luciani; Di Bao; Alexandros Labrinidis; Elisabeta G Marai; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract This demo presents AstroShelf; our on-going effort to enable astrophysicists tocollaboratively investigate celestial objects using data originating from multiple sky surveys;hosted at different sites. The AstroShelf platform combines database and data stream;workflow and visualization technologies to provide a means for querying and displayingtelescope images (in a Google Sky manner); visualizations of spectrum data; and formanaging annotations. In addition to the user interface; AstroShelf supports a programmaticinterface (available as a web service); which allows astrophysicists to incorporatefunctionality from AstroShelf in their own programs. A key feature is Live Annotations whichis the detection and delivery of events or annotations to users in real-time; based on theirprofiles.

Admission control mechanisms for continuous queries in the cloud,Lory Al Moakar; Panos K Chrysanthis; Christine Chung; Shenoda Guirguis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panayiotis Neophytou; Kirk Pruhs,Amazon; Google; and IBM now sell cloud computing services. We consider the setting of afor-profit business selling data stream monitoring/management services and we investigateauction-based mechanisms for admission control of continuous queries. When submitting aquery; each user also submits a bid of how much she is willing to pay for that query to run.The admission control auction mechanism then determines which queries to admit; and howmuch to charge each user in a way that maximizes system revenue while beingstrategyproof and sybil immune; incentivizing users to use the system honestly. Specifically;we require that each user maximizes her payoff by bidding her true value of having herquery run. We design several payment mechanisms and experimentally evaluate them.

Adaptive navigation of vehicles in congested road networks,Vasilis Verroios; Konstantinos Kollias; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alex Delis,Abstract We examine the problem of routing vehicles in a road network where trafficcongestion affects the time required to traverse an edge. We propose a fully distributedapproach that uses only the computational resources and communication capabilities ofvehicles and requires no fixed infrastructure or centralized servers. Our approach bases itsoperation on wireless ad-hoc communications and offers a protocol for alerting vehiclesregarding traffic conditions in areas to be travelled through. Vehicles exchange estimationsfor the time required to reach areas of the road network and every vehicle dynamicallydetermines the path it will follow based on estimations received from fellow travellers.Considering vehicles as selfish players in a game-theoretic framework; we relate the steady-state of our protocol with theoretical results. In this direction; our simulation focuses on …,Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Pervasive services,2008,16
The micropulse framework for adaptive waking windows in sensor networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Panayiotis Andreou; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras; Andreas Pitsillides,In this paper we present MicroPulse; a novel framework for adapting the waking window of asensing device S based on the data workload incurred by a query Q. Assuming a typical tree-based aggregation scenario; the waking window is defined as the time interval r duringwhich S enables its transceiver in order to collect the results from its children. Minimizing thelength of r enables S to conserve energy that can be used to prolong the longevity of thenetwork and hence the quality of results. Our method is established on profiling recent dataacquisition activity and on identifying the bottlenecks using an in-network execution of theCritical Path Method. We show through trace-driven experimentation with a real dataset thatMicroPulse can reduce the energy cost of the waking window by three orders of magnitude.,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,16
An atomic commit protocol for gigabit-networked distributed database systems,Yousef J Al-Houmaily; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract In the near future; different database sites will be interconnected via gigabitnetworks; forming a very powerful distributed database system. In such an environment; thepropagation latency will be the dominant component of the overall communication cost whilethe migration of large amounts of data will not pose a problem. Furthermore; computersystems are expected to become even more reliable than today's systems with long meantime between failures and short mean time to repair. In this paper; we present implicit yes-vote (IYV); a one-phase atomic commit protocol; that exploits these new domaincharacteristics to minimize the cost of distributed transaction commitment. IYV eliminates theexplicit voting phase of the two-phase commit protocol; hence reducing the number ofsequential phases of message passing during normal processing.

An optimized multicast-based data dissemination middleware: A demonstration,Wei Li; Wenhui Zhang; Vincenzo Liberatore; Vince Penkrot; Jonathan Beaver; Mohamed A Sharaf; Siddhartha Roychowdhury; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs,A major problem on the Internet is the scalable dissemination of information. This problem isparticularly acute exactly at the time when the scalability of data delivery is most important.One proposed solution to this scalability problem is to use multicast communication.However; allowing multicast communication introduces many nontrivial data managementproblems; such as caching; consistency; and scheduling. We have built a middleware thatunifies and extends state-of-the-art data management methods and algorithms into onesoftware distribution. Its flexible and extensible architecture is built from individualcomponents that can be selected or replaced depending on the underlying multicasttransport mechanism or on the application needs.

Dealing with incompatible presumptions of commit protocols in multidatabase systems,Yousef J Al-Houmaily; Panos K Chrysanthis,ABSTRACT A multidatabase system (MDBS) is a software system that is built on top ofmultiple pre-existing and heterogeneous database systems to facilitate their interoperation.This paper discusses the issue of compatibility among atomic commit protocols (ACPs) in aMDBS environment. Specifically; it shows that supporting a visible prepare to commit state isnot enough for a successful integration of ACPs in an operational fashion because theoutcome of some transactions might have to be remembered forever. Therefore; we definean operational correctness criterion that allows terminated transactions to be forgotten andpropose Presumed Any; a Two-Phase Commit protocol variant that successfully integratesPresumed Nothing; Presumed Abort and Presumed Commit in a MDBS. We also show howthe behavior of a local database system that employs presumed abort can be made to …,Proceedings of the 1996 ACM symposium on Applied Computing,1996,15
Self-managing load shedding for data stream management systems,Thao N Pham; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Load shedding is an integral component in many Data Stream Management Systems;aiming at preventing the response time from exceeding a user-specified delay target underoverload situations. The currently best performing load shedder determines the correctamount of load to shed by utilizing a feedback loop for correcting the statistics-basedestimations. Although this load shedder outperforms previous works in controlling responsetime as well as minimizing data loss; it requires a manually-tuned parameter and cannotwork with complex query networks containing joins; aggregations or shared operators. Inthis paper; we propose SEaMLeSS-SElf Managing Load Shedding for data Streammanagement systems; which extends and rectifies these limitations of the state-of-the-artload shedder while making it applicable for multi-tenant servers.

Don’t reveal my intension: Protecting user privacy using declarative preferences during distributed query processing,Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,Abstract In a centralized setting; the declarative nature of SQL is a major strength: a user cansimply describe what she wants to retrieve; and need not worry about how the resultingquery plan is actually generated and executed. However; in a decentralized setting; twoquery plans that produce the same result might actually reveal vastly different informationabout the intensional description of a user's query to the servers participating its evaluation.In cases where a user considers portions of her query to be sensitive; this is clearlyproblematic. In this paper; we address the specification and enforcement of querier privacyconstraints on the execution of distributed database queries. We formalize a notion ofintensional query privacy called (I; A)-privacy; and extend the syntax of SQL to allow users toenforce strict (I; A)-privacy constraints or partially ordered privacy/performance …,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2011,14
Optimizing i/o-intensive transactions in highly interactive applications,Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Cristiana Amza,Abstract The performance provided by an interactive online database system is typicallymeasured in terms of meeting certain pre-specified Service Level Agreements (SLAs); withexpected transaction latency being the most commonly used type of SLA. This form of SLAacts as a soft deadline for each transaction; and user satisfaction can be measured in termsof minimizing tardiness; that is; the deviation from SLA. This objective is further complicatedfor I/O-intensive transactions; where the storage system becomes the performancebottleneck. Moreover; common I/O scheduling policies employed by the Operating Systemwith a goal of improving I/O throughput or average latency may run counter to optimizing per-transaction performance since the Operating System is typically oblivious to the applicationhigh-level SLA specifications. In this paper; we propose a new SLA-aware policy for …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,14
Peer support in a mobile world,Sujata Banerjee; P Chrysanthis,Even with the emerging technological advances; it is likely that in the near to medium termfuture the resources available to the mobile user will be at least a magnitude lower than thatavailable to the wired user. The scarcity of resources such as bandwidth; battery power; andscreen size pose fundamental challenges in developing effective wireless services. At thesame time; the demand for such wireless services is growing rapidly. Users crave thefreedom and flexibility in lifestyle that a wireless platform can provide and want similarelectronic services to those available on wired platforms. Further; the next generation ofelectronic services will have significant multi-media content that will further stress the mobileinfrastructure.

Our objectives are to explore a given geographic region by detecting andaggregating spatio-temporal events of interest and to store these events in the network untilthe user requests them. Such a setting finds applications in environments where the user (ie;the sink) is infrequently within communication range from the field deployment.

To broadcast push or not and what?,Jonathan Beaver; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs; Vincenzo Liberatore,A major problem in mobile web applications as well as the wireless Internet is the scalabledelivery of data. The most popular solution for this problem is a hybrid system that usesbroadcast push to scalably deliver the most popular data; and reserves broadcast pull fordelivery of less popular data. Such a hybrid scheme introduces a variety of datamanagement problems at the broadcast server. In this paper; we examine three of theseproblems: the push popularity problem; the document classification problem; and thebandwidth division problem. The push popularity problem is to estimate the popularity of thedocuments in the web site. The document classification problem is to determine whichdocuments should be pushed and which documents must be pulled. The bandwidth divisionproblem is to determine how much of the server bandwidth to devote to pushed …,Mobile Data Management; 2006. MDM 2006. 7th International Conference on,2006,13
Efficient Dissemination of Aggregate Data over the Wireless Web.,Mohamed A Sharaf; Yannis Sismanis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis; Nick Roussopoulos,ABSTRACT The proliferation of wireless technologies along with the large volume of dataavailable online are forcing us to rethink existing data dissemination techniques for dataover the Web; and in particular for aggregate data. In addition to scalability and responsetime; data delivery to mobile clients with wireless Web connectivity must also considerenergy consumption. In this work; we present a hybrid scheduling algorithm (DV-ES) forbroadcast-based data delivery of aggregate data over the wireless Web. Our algorithmefficiently" packs" aggregate data for broadcast delivery and utilizes view subsumption at themobile client; which allow for faster response times and lower energy consumption.,WebDB,2003,13
Caching constrained mobile data,Subhasish Mazumdar; Mateusz Pietrzyk; Panos Chrysanthis,Abstract As mobile devices get ubiquitous and grow in computational power; theirmanagement of interdependent data also becomes increasingly important. The mobileenvironment exhibits all the characteristics of a distributed database plus the feature ofwhimsical connectivity. Consequently; transactions respecting data consistency can sufferunbounded and unpredictable delays at both mobile and stationary nodes. The currentlypopular multi-tier model; in which mobile devices are in one end and always-connectedstationary servers in the other; has certain practical advantages. However; it assumes that allintegrity constraints are evaluated at the servers and hence relies on the semantics ofoperations for any autonomy enhancement of the mobile devices. In this paper; we examinethe idea of constraint localization in cases where two mobile nodes each own data that …,Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2001,13

Linking requirements and design data for automated functional evaluation,Stephen T Frezza; Steven P Levitan; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract This paper presents a methodology for automating the evaluation of complexhierarchical designs using black-box testing techniques. Based on an exploration model fordesign; this methodology generates evaluation tests using a novel semantic graph datamodel which captures the relationships between the related design and requirements data.Using these relationships; equivalent tests are generated and systematically applied tosimulations of the pieces of a modular design and its requirements.

Balancing Performance; Accuracy; and Precision for Secure Cloud Transactions,Marian K Iskander; Tucker Trainor; Dave W Wilkinson; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis,In distributed transactional database systems deployed over cloud servers; entitiescooperate to form proofs of authorizations that are justified by collections of certifiedcredentials. These proofs and credentials may be evaluated and collected over extendedtime periods under the risk of having the underlying authorization policies or the usercredentials being in inconsistent states. It therefore becomes possible for policy-basedauthorization systems to make unsafe decisions that might threaten sensitive resources. Inthis paper; we highlight the criticality of the problem. We then define the notion of trustedtransactions when dealing with proofs of authorization. Accordingly; we propose severalincreasingly stringent levels of policy consistency constraints; and present differentenforcement approaches to guarantee the trustworthiness of transactions executing on …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2014,12
Dilos: A dynamic integrated load manager and scheduler for continuous queries,Thao N Pham; Lory Al Moakar; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,In a Data Stream Management System (DSMS); continuous queries (CQs) registered bydifferent applications inherently have different levels of importance (ie; quality of service(QoS) and quality of data (QoD) requirements). Moreover; the shift to cloud services and thegrowing need for monitoring applications will inevitably lead to the establishment of datastream management cloud services. In such a multi-tenant environment; it is expected thatthe different applications/users will demand different QoS and QoD requirements for theirCQs. In this work; we are proposing an approach that exploits the synergy betweenscheduling and load shedding to effectively handle different ranks of CQ classes; eachassociated with different QoS and QoD requirements. The proposed approach wasimplemented and evaluated within AQSIOS; our DSMS prototype.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,12

Class-based continuous query scheduling for data streams,Lory Al Moakar; Thao N Pham; Panayiotis Neophytou; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Mohamed Sharaf,Abstract Wireless sensor networks link the physical and digital worlds enabling bothsurveillance as well as scientific exploration. In both cases; on-line detection of interestingevents can be accomplished with continuous queries (CQs) in a Data Stream ManagementSystem (DSMS). However; the quality-of-service requirements of detecting these events aredifferent for different monitoring applications. The CQs for detecting anomalous events (eg;fire; flood) have stricter response time requirements over CQs which are for logging andkeeping statistical information of physical phenomena. In this work; we are proposing theContinuous Query Class (CQC) scheduler; a new scheduling policy which employs two-level scheduling that is able to handle different ranks of CQ classes.

FSort: external sorting on flash-based sensor devices,Panayiotis Andreou; Orestis Spanos; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; George Samaras; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract In long-term deployments of Wireless Sensor Networks; it is often more efficient tostore sensor readings locally at each device and transmit those readings to the user onlywhen requested (ie; in response to a user query). Many of the techniques that collectinformation from a sensor network require that the data is sorted on some attribute (eg;range queries; top-k queries; join queries; etc.) Yet; the underlying storage medium of thesedevices (ie; Flash media) presents some unique characteristics which renders traditionaldisk-based sorting algorithms inefficient in this context. In this paper we devise the FSortalgorithm; an efficient external sorting algorithm for flash-based sensor devices with a smallmemory footprint. FSort minimizes the expensive write/delete operations of flash memoryminimizing in that way the consumption of energy. In particular; FSort uses a top-down …,Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Data Management for Sensor Networks,2009,12
Towards continuous workflow enactment systems,Panayiotis Neophytou; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Traditional workflow enactment systems and workflow design processes view theworkflow as a one-time interaction with the various data sources; executing a series of stepsonce; whenever the workflow results are requested. The fundamental underlyingassumption has been that data sources are passive and all interactions are structured alongthe request/reply (query) model. Hence; traditional Workflow Management Systems cannoteffectively support business or scientific monitoring applications that require the processingof data streams. In this paper; we propose a paradigm shift from the traditional step-wiseworkflow execution model to a continuous execution model; in order to handle data streamspublished and delivered asynchronously from multiple sources.,International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing,2008,12
Automated service integration for crisis management,Alan Berfield; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract The integration and coordination of different emergency service personnel is crucialto Crisis Management. Crisis centers create plans of action to deal with the varioussituations that arise during an event. These plans require different personnel with differentexpertise to execute them within a given set of constraints. In this paper; we show that suchplans can be represented as workflows; and that the discovery and integration of personnelcan use a scheme we previously developed for the establishment of virtual enterprises. Animportant extension to our previous work is the introduction of Intelligent PersonalAssistants; or iPAs. iPAs aid in the discovery of appropriate personnel and provide thecoordination between them and the crisis centers. iPAs also assist their users during planexecution by interfacing with different information sources; such as sensor networks; and …,First International Workshop on Databases in Virtual Organizations (DIVO 2004),2004,12
Two-phase commit processing with restructured commit tree,George Samaras; George K Kyrou; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Extensive research has been carried out in search for an efficient atomic commitprotocol and many optimizations have been suggested to improve the basic two-phasecommit protocol; either for the normal or failure case. Of these optimizations; the read-onlyoptimization is the best known and most widely used; whereas the flattening-of-the-commit-tree optimization is the most recent one proposed for Internet transactions. In this paper; westudy in depth the combined use of these two optimizations and show the limitations of theflattening-of-the-commit-tree method in committing large trees. Further; we propose a newrestructuring method of the commit tree and show using simulation that it performs betterthan flattening method even when dealing with large trees.,Panhellenic Conference on Informatics,2001,12
Finer grained concurrency for the database cache,J Eliot B Moss; Bruce Leban; Panos K Chrysanthis,The database cache transaction recovery technique as proposed in [Elhard and Bayer 84]offers significant performance advantages for reliable database systems. However; thesmallest granularity of locks it provides is the page. Here we present two schemessupporting smaller granularity. The first scheme allows maximal concurrency consistent withphysical two-phase locking; with the same per-transaction I/O cost as original databasecache scheme. The second scheme offers the same concurrency as the first; but featuresreduced I/O on commit; at the cost of some increase recovery time.,Data Engineering; 1987 IEEE Third International Conference on,1987,12

Ce-storm: Confidential elastic processing of data streams,Nick R Katsipoulakis; Cory Thoma; Eric A Gratta; Alexandros Labrinidis; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) are crucial for modern high-volume/high-velocity data-driven applications; necessitating a distributed approach toprocessing them. In addition; data providers often require certain levels of confidentiality fortheir data; especially in cases of user-generated data; such as those coming out of physicalactivity/health tracking devices (ie; our motivating application). This demonstration willshowcase Synefo; an infrastructure that enables elastic scaling of DSMS operators; andCryptStream; a framework that provides confidentiality and access controls for data streamswhile allowing computation on untrusted servers; fused as CE-Storm.

Adaptive multiversion data broadcast organizations,Oleg Shigiltchoff; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Broadcasting provides an efficient means for disseminating information in bothwired and wireless setting. In this paper; we propose a suite of broadcast organizationschemes for multiversion data broadcast; ie; data broadcast in which more than one value isbroadcast per data item. Besides increasing the concurrency of client transactions;multiversion broadcast provides clients with the possibility of accessing multiple serverstates. For example; such a functionality is essential to support applications that requireaccess to data sequences and have limited local memory to store the previous versions;such as in the case of sensor networks. We identify two basic multiversion organizations;namely vertical and horizontal broadcasts and propose an efficient compression schemeapplicable to both.

Power efficiency through tuple ranking in wireless sensor network monitoring,Panayiotis Andreou; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras,Abstract In this paper; we present an innovative framework for efficiently monitoring WirelessSensor Networks (WSNs). Our framework; coined KSpot; utilizes a novel top-k queryprocessing algorithm we developed; in conjunction with the concept of in-network views; inorder to minimize the cost of query execution. For ease of exposition; consider a set ofsensors acquiring data from their environment at a given time instance. The generatedinformation can conceptually be thought as a horizontally fragmented base relation R.Furthermore; the results to a user-defined query Q; registered at some sink point; canconceptually be thought as a view V. Maintaining consistency between V and R is veryexpensive in terms of communication and energy. Thus; KSpot focuses on a subset V′(⊆V) that unveils only the k highest-ranked answers at the sink; for some user defined …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2011,9
Scheduling continuous queries in data stream management systems,Mohamed A Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Recently; several policies have been proposed for scheduling multiple ContinuousQueries (CQs) in a Data Stream Management System (DSMS). The decision on which policyto use plays an important role in shaping the percieved online performance provided by theDSMS. In this tutorial; we provide an overview of different policies employed by current CQschedulers and the performance goals optimized by these policies. Further; we discuss thesalient properties of CQs conisdered by current policies as well as the efficentimplementation of such policies into CQ schedulers.

ViP: a user-centric view-based annotation framework for scientific data,Qinglan Li; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Annotations play an increasingly crucial role in scientific exploration and discovery;as the amount of data and the level of collaboration among scientists increase. In this paper;we introduce ViP; a user-centric; view-based annotation framework that promotesannotations as first-class citizens. ViP introduces novel ways of propagating annotations;empowering users to express their preferences over the time and network semantics ofannotations. To efficiently support such novel functionality; ViP utilizes database views andintroduces new caching techniques. Through an extensive experimental study on a realsystem; we show that ViP can seamlessly introduce new annotation propagation semanticswhile significantly improving the performance over the current state of the art.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,9
Poster session: ASETS: A self-managing transaction scheduler,Mohamed A Sharaf; Shenoda Guirguis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Kirk Pruhs; Panos K Chrysanthis,User satisfaction determines the success of web-database applications. User satisfactioncan be expressed in terms of expected response time or expected delay. Given the burstyand unpredictable behavior of web user populations; we model user requests astransactions with soft-deadlines. For such a model of user requests with soft-deadlines; thehit ratio is not the most expressive metric. Instead; the average tardiness is a better measurein such cases. In this paper; we propose and evaluate an adaptive self-managing algorithmcalled ASETS; which optimizes for the average tardiness.

Mobile agent-based services for view materialization,Kyriakos Karenos; George Samaras; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Mobile agents are ideal for mobile computing environments because of their abilityto support asynchronous communication and disconnected data processing. In this paper;we present a prototype set of extensible mobile-agent based services that allow thedefinition; materialization; maintenance and sharing of views created over remote web-accessible datasources; called V< i> i</i> SMA (Views Supported by Mobile Agents). V< i>i</i> SMA's primary goal is to support the customization and personalization of views bymobile users carrying lightweight devices of various connectivity and resources such asportable computers and PDAs. It achieves efficient view customization by localizing thematerialization of view fragments of a complex view within different mobile agents whichmonitor each other's movement in order to minimize communication costs.

Multiversion data broadcast organizations,Oleg Shigiltchoff; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In recent years broadcasting attracted considerable attention as a promisingtechnique of disseminating information to large number of clients in wireless environment aswell as in the web. In this paper; we study different schemes of multiversion broadcast andshow that the way broadcast is organized has an impact on performance; as different kind ofclients needs different types of data. We identify two basic multiversion organizations;namely Vertical and Horizontal broadcasts; and propose an efficient compression schemeapplicable to both. The compression can significantly reduce the size of the broadcast andconsequently; the average access time; while it does not require costly decompression. Bothorganizations and the compression scheme were evaluated using simulation.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2002,9
The Dynamic View System (DVS): Mobile Agents to Support Web Views.,Constantinos Spyrou; Evaggelia Pitoura; Stavros Papastavrou; George Samaras; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract The Dynamic View System (DVS) is an experimental mobile agent basedinfrastructure that provides the necessary components for the definition; materialization;storage; maintenance and re-use of views over remote web databases. Through the system;clients identify web databases of interest; access their metadata and create personalizedviews that can be shared by other clients. Creating personalized views provides a moreefficient way of data processing than directly issuing complex queries to the data sourcesespecially in the case of light-weight and wireless clients that suffer from scarce localresources; limited bandwidth and high communication costs. DVS's multi-tier architectureimplemented using mobile Java agents allows automatic code deployment as well asdynamic relocation of views.,ICDE Demo Sessions,2001,9

A network-aware framework for energy-efficient data acquisition in wireless sensor networks,Panayiotis G Andreou; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; George S Samaras; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Wireless sensor networks enable users to monitor the physical world at anextremely high fidelity. In order to collect the data generated by these tiny-scale devices; thedata management community has proposed the utilization of declarative data-acquisitionframeworks. While these frameworks have facilitated the energy-efficient retrieval of datafrom the physical environment; they were agnostic of the underlying network topology andalso did not support advanced query processing semantics. In this paper we presentKSpot+; a distributed network-aware framework that optimizes network efficiency bycombining three components:(i) the tree balancing module; which balances the workload ofeach sensor node by constructing efficient network topologies;(ii) the workload balancingmodule; which minimizes data reception inefficiencies by synchronizing the sensor …,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2014,8
PAQO: Preference-aware query optimization for decentralized database systems,Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,The declarative nature of SQL has traditionally been a major strength. Users simply statewhat information they are interested in; and the database management system determinesthe best plan for retrieving it. A consequence of this model is that should a user ever want tospecify some aspect of how their queries are evaluated (eg; a preference to read data from aspecific replica; or a requirement for all joins to be performed by a single server); they areunable to. This can leave database administrators shoehorning evaluation preferences intodatabase cost models. Further; for distributed database users; it can result in queryevaluation plans that violate data handling best practices or the privacy of the user. Toaddress such issues; we have developed a framework for declarative; user-specifiedconstraints on the query optimization process and implemented it within PosgreSQL.

In this paper; we present a distributedsearch architecture for intelligent search of objects in a mobile social community. Ourframework; coined SmartOpt; is founded on an in-situ data storage model; where capturedobjects remain local on smartphones and searches then take place over an intelligent multi-objective lookup structure we compute dynamically.

Structuring pervasive services in infrastructureless networks,Anandha Gopalan; Taieb Znati; Panos K Chrysanthis,Realizing the potential of pervasive computing will be predicated upon the availability of aflexible; mobility-aware infrastructure and technologies to support seamless servicemanagement; provisioning and delivery. Despite advances in routing and media accesscontrol technologies; little progress has been made toward large-scale deployment ofservices and applications in pervasive and ubiquitous environments. The lack of a fixedinfrastructure; coupled with the time-varying characteristics of the underlying networktopology; makes service delivery challenging.

ML-1-2PC: an adaptive multi-level atomic commit protocol,Yousef J Al-Houmaily; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract The one-two phase commit (1-2PC) protocol is a combination of a one-phaseatomic commit protocol; namely; implicit yes-vote; and a two-phase atomic commit protocol;namely; presumed commit. The 1-2PC protocol integrates these two protocols in a dynamicfashion; depending on the behavior of transactions and system requirements; in spite of theirincompatibilities. This paper extends the applicability of 1-2PC to the multi-level transactionexecution model; which is adopted by database standards. Besides allowing incompatibleatomic commit protocols to co-exist in the same environment; 1-2PC has the advantage ofenhanced performance over the currently known atomic commit protocols making it moresuitable for Internet database applications.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2004,8
An evaluation of the java-based approaches to web database access,Stavros Papastavrou; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras; Evaggelia Pitoura,Given the undeniable popularity of the Web; providing efficient and secure access to remotedatabases using a Web browser is crucial for the emerging cooperative information systemsand applications. In this paper; we evaluate all currently available Java-based approachesthat support persistent connections between Web clients and database servers. Theseapproaches include Java applets; Java Sockets; Servlets; Remote Method Invocation;CORBA; and mobile agents technology. Our comparison is along the dimensions ofperformance and programmability. Our findings point out that best performance is not alwaysachievable with high programmability and low resource requirements. Moreover; the mobileagent technology needs to improve its programmability while giving particular emphasis onits infrastructure.,International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems,2001,8

Architecture-aware graph repartitioning for data-intensive scientific computing,Angen Zheng; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Graph partitioning and repartitioning have been widely used by scientists to parallelizecompute-and dataintensive simulations. However; existing graph (re) partitioning algorithmsusually assume homogeneous communication costs among partitions; which contradicts theincreasing heterogeneity in inter-core communication in modern parallel architectures and isfurther exacerbated by increasing dataset sizes (ie; Big Data). To resolve this; we proposean architecture-aware graph repartitioner; called AragonLB. AragonLB considers theheterogeneity in both inter-and intra-node communication while rebalancing the load. Ourexperimental study with a turbulent combustion simulation dataset shows that AragonLB canresult in up to 60% improvement against existing architecture-agnostic graph repartitioners(which assume uniform communication costs among partitions); and the improvement …,Big Data (Big Data); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,7
Blocking reduction for distributed transaction processing within MANETs,Sebastian Obermeier; Stefan Böttcher; Martin Hett; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras,Abstract Atomic commit protocols for distributed transactions in mobile ad-hoc networkshave to consider message delays and network failures. We consider ad-hoc networkscenarios; in which participants hold embedded databases and offer services to otherparticipants. Services that are composed of several other services can access andmanipulate data of physically different databases. In such a scenario; distributed transactionprocessing can be used to guarantee atomicity and serializability throughout all databases.However; with problems like message loss; node failure; and network partitioning; mobileenvironments make it hard to get estimations on the duration of a simple messageexchange. In this article; we focus on the problem of setting up reasonable time-outs whenguaranteeing atomicity for transaction processing within mobile ad-hoc networks; and we …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2009,7
Distributed data streams,Minos Garofalakis,realized using such logical structures. For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,7
A decade of dynamic web content: A structured survey on past and present practices and future trends,Stavros Papastavrou; George Samaras; Paraskevas Evripidou; Panos K Chrysanthis,ABSTRACT The shift from static to dynamic Web content has been dramatic. Dynamic Webcontent is facilitated by specialized cooperating component systems better known as contentmiddlewares. Unlike static content; the generation and delivery of dynamic Web contentintroduce heavy a workload on content middlewares. To address this problem; numerousresearch approaches have been proposed in the literature; some of which are the drivingforce behind popular commercial systems; a fact that stresses the importance andapplicability of this research area. This article surveys the literature during the period of 1995–2005 on accelerating the generation and delivery of dynamic Web content. It classifies theproposed approaches into taxonomies based on their underlying methodologies andpractices.

MuVE: Efficient multi-objective view recommendation for visual data exploration,Humaira Ehsan; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis,To support effective data exploration; there is a well-recognized need for solutions that canautomatically recommend interesting visualizations; which reveal useful insights into theanalyzed data. However; such visualizations come at the expense of high data processingcosts; where a large number of views are generated to evaluate their usefulness. Thosecosts are further escalated in the presence of numerical dimensional attributes; due to thepotentially large number of possible binning aggregations; which lead to a drastic increasein the number of possible visualizations. To address that challenge; in this paper wepropose the MuVE scheme for Multi-Objective View Recommendation for Visual DataExploration.

Confluence: Continuous workflow execution engine,Panayiotis Neophytou; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Traditional workflow enactment systems view a workflow as a one-time interactionwith various data sources; executing a series of steps once; whenever the workflow resultsare requested. The fundamental underlying assumption has been that data sources arepassive and all interactions are structured along the request/reply (query) model. Hence;traditional Workflow Management Systems cannot effectively support business or scientificreactive applications that require the processing of continuous data streams.

Whirlpool implements a rotating interrogation of amonitoring structure and provides collision-aware scheduling of the monitoring queries. TheWhirlpool strategy can be tuned for the required Quality of Data (QoD). We apply Whirlpoolto examine the unique properties of output signals of the structure under critical integrityconditions and to perform instability detection using redundancy-based estimation ofKolmogorov-Sinai entropy.,The 5th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring,2005,6
Planar: Parallel lightweight architecture-aware adaptive graph repartitioning,Angen Zheng; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Graph partitioning is an essential preprocessing step in distributed graph computation andscientific simulations. Existing well-studied graph partitioners are designed for static graphs;but real-world graphs; such as social networks and Web networks; keep changingdynamically. In fact; the communication and computation patterns of some graph algorithmsmay vary significantly; even across their different computation phases. This means that theoptimal partitioning changes over time; requiring the graph to be repartitioned periodically tomaintain good performance. However; the state-of-the-art graph (re) partitioners are knownfor their poor scalability against massive graphs. Furthermore; they usually assume ahomogeneous and contention-free computing environment; which is no longer true inmodern high performance computing infrastructures. In this paper; we introduce Planar; a …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,5

However; well-studied graph (re) partitioners usually assume ahomogeneous and contention-free computing environment; which contradicts the increasingcommunication heterogeneity and shared resource contention in modern; multicore highperformance computing clusters. To bridge this gap; we introduce PARAGON; a parallelarchitecture-aware graph partition refinement algorithm; which mitigates the mismatch bymodifying a given decomposition according to the nonuniform network communication costsand the contentiousness of the underlying hardware topology.

Radio Map Prefetching for Indoor Navigation in Intermittently Connected Wi-Fi Networks,Andreas Konstantinidis; George Nikolaides; Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Giannis Evagorou; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Panos K Chrysanthis,Wi-Fi (or WLAN) based indoor navigation applications for mobiles rely on cloud-basedservices (s) that take care of a user's (u) localization task using structures called Radio Maps(RMs). It is imperative for u to have a stable WiFi connection in order to either continuouslyreceive location updates from s or to download RMs a priori for offline navigation. Wi-Finetworks however; suffer from intermittent connectivity due to poor network planning thatresults in sparse deployment of access points and effectively areas where Wi-Fi coveragecannot be guaranteed. This inherently affects the localization accuracy and therefore thenavigation experience of users. In this paper; we propose an innovative framework foraccurate and fast indoor localization over an intermittently connected WiFi network; coinedPrefetching Localization (PreLoc).

In order to customize their query results; users need to express their preferences in asimple and user-friendly manner. In this paper; we present a graph-based theoreticalframework and a prototype system that unify qualitative and quantitative preferences; whileeliminating their disadvantages. Our integrated system allows for (1) the specification ofdatabase preferences and the creation of user preference profiles in a user-friendlymanner;(2) the manipulation of preferences of individuals or groups of users and (3) totalordering of the tuples in the database; matching both qualitative and quantitativepreferences; hence significantly increasing the number of tuples covered by the user …,Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Exploratory Search in Databases and the Web,2015,5
Preferential diversity,Xiaoyu Ge; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract The ever increasing supply of data is bringing a renewed attention to querypersonalization. Query personalization is a technique that utilizes user preferences with thegoal of providing relevant results to the users. Along with preferences; diversity is anotherimportant aspect of query personalization especially useful during data exploration. Thegoal of result diversification is to reduce the amount of redundant information included in theresults. Most previous approaches of result diversification focus solely on generating themost diverse results; which do not take user preferences into account. In this paper; wepropose a novel framework called Preferential Diversity (PrefDiv) that aims to support bothrelevancy and diversity of user query results.

PAQO: a preference-aware query optimizer for PostgreSQL,Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,Abstract Although the declarative nature of SQL provides great utility to database users; itsuse in distributed database management systems can leave users unaware of which serversin the system are evaluating portions of their queries. By allowing users to merely say whatdata they are interested in accessing without providing guidance regarding how to retrieve it;query optimizers can generate plans with unintended consequences to the user (eg;violating user privacy by revealing sensitive portions of a user's query to untrusted servers;or impacting result freshness by pulling data from stale data stores). To address these typesof issues; we have created a framework that empowers users with the ability to specifyconstraints on the kinds of plans that can be produced by the optimizer to evaluate theirqueries. Such constraints are specified through an extended version of SQL that we have …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,5
Qmd: exploiting flash for energy efficient disk arrays,Sean M Snyder; Shimin Chen; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Energy consumption for computing devices in general and for data centers inparticular is receiving increasingly high attention; both because of the increasing ubiquity ofcomputing and also because of increasing energy prices. In this work; we propose QMD(Quasi Mirrored Disks) that exploit flash as a write buffer to complement RAID systemsconsisting of hard disks. QMD along with partial on-line mirrors; are a first step towardsenergy proportionality which is seen as the" holy grail" of energy-efficient system design.QMD exhibits significant energy savings of up 31%; as per our evaluation study using realworkloads.,Proceedings of the seventh international workshop on data management on new hardware,2011,5
Effective privacy-preserving online route planning,Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Ira Assent; Christian S Jensen,An online Route Planning Service (RPS) computes a route from one location to another.Current RPSs such as Google Maps require the use of precise locations. However; someusers may not want to disclose their source and destination locations due to privacyconcerns. An approach that supplies fake locations to an existing service incurs asubstantial loss of quality of service; and the service may well return a result that may be nothelpful to the user. We propose a solution that is able to return accurate route planningresults when source and destination regions are used in order to achieve privacy. Thesolution re-uses a standard online RPS rather than replicate this functionality; and it needsno trusted third party. The solution is able to compute the exact results without leaking of theexact locations to the RPS or un-trusted parties. In addition; we provide heuristics that …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2011 12th IEEE International Conference on,2011,5
Power-aware operator placement and broadcasting of continuous query results,Panayiotis Neophytou; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Complex event detection over data streams has become ubiquitous through thewidespread use of sensors; wireless connectivity and the wide variety of end-user mobiledevices. Typically; such event detection is carried out by a data stream management serverexecuting continuous queries; previously submitted by the users. In this paper; we considerthe situation where the end-users submit queries from hand-held devices and the results ofthe continuous queries; which are in the form of individual data streams; are disseminated tothe users over a shared broadcast medium. Specifically; we propose three power-awarequery operator placement algorithms that determine which part of a continuous query plan isexecuted at the data stream management server and which part is executed at the users'wireless device.

Such asetting finds applications in mobile environments where the user (ie; the sink) is infrequentlywithin communication range from the field deployment. Our framework; coinedSenseSwarm; dynamically partitions the sensing devices into perimeter and core nodes.Data acquisition is scheduled at the perimeter; in order to minimize energy consumption;while storage and replication takes place at the core nodes which are physically andlogically shielded to threats and obstacles.

User-centric annotation management for biological data,Qinglan Li; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Annotations play an increasingly crucial role in scientific exploration and discovery;as the amount of data and the level of collaboration among scientists increases. Although allsuch systems are implemented to take user input (ie; the annotations themselves); very fewsystems are user-centric; taking into account user preferences on how annotations shouldpropagate and be applied over data. In this paper; we propose to treat annotations as first-class citizens for biological data management by presenting a user− centric; view− basedannotation framework; called ViP. Under the ViP framework we consider user preferencesover the time semantics of annotations (by supporting future annotations) and over thenetwork semantics of annotations (by supporting both implicitly-defined and explicitly-defined annotation propagation paths).

Self‐tuning caching: the Universal Caching algorithm,Ganesh Santhanakrishnan; Ahmed Amer; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract A cache replacement policy is normally suited to a particular class of applications;or limited to a set of fixed criteria for evaluating the cache-worthiness of an object. Wepresent Universal Caching as a mechanism to capture the generality of the most adaptivealgorithms; while depending on a very limited set of basic criteria for cache-replacementdecisions. Our testing was limited to Web workloads; where we tested the Universal Cachingpolicy using real-world traces from both the server-side and client-side proxies. Using a self-tuning mechanism; combined with a generalization of the criteria employed in GD-* Webcaching; Universal Caching was able to consistently outperform any other fixed choice ofalgorithm we tested.

Our approach consists of using new and existing sensors to gather data from thefield; processing this data to detect and predict emergency/disaster situations; anddisseminating this data among the appropriate organizational units. The data flow will bedone in a reliable and secure manner and EMs will coordinate actions in a VirtualCoordination Center (VCC); which need not be in a fixed (and thus vulnerable) physicallocation. The EMs are responsible for indicating what type of data is more valuable; so that S-CITI can display that information appropriately.,Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Digital government research,2006,5

To enabledynamic content; various technologies have been developed for embedding of script codeblocks into static HTML files in order to perform various forms of tasks such as sessiontracking; bank transactions; financial calculations; products catalog generation; dynamicimage generation; or even fetching information from remote servers. In this way; static HTMLpages are transformed into dynamic web pages. Typically; dynamic Web pages include anumber of tasks that are executed in a serial manner by current Web servers. In this paper;we propose a back-end; finer-grained parallel approach for dynamic content generation;and elaborate on how it affects the design and performance of Web servers.

From location databases to pervasive catalog,Panos K Chrysanthis; Vladimir I Zadorozhny,One characteristic of next generation wireless mobile environments is the high level ofinteroperability between mobile applications and services. This imposes significant demandon knowledge maintained by the wireless network about itself (system meta-data).Maintaining a repository of wireless meta-data in the way that location databases aremaintained is not sufficient to support adaptable application interoperability. Theavailability/freshness/precision requirements for the system meta-data are different from therequirements for location data and involve more complex monitoring queries.

A Fast and Robust Failure Recovery Scheme for Shared-Nothing Gigabit-Networked Databases,Sujata Banerjee; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Major technological advances have enabled the development of very high speednetworks with data rates of the order of gigabits per second. In the future; wide area gigabitnetworks will interconnect database servers around the globe creating extremely powerfuldistributed information systems. In a high speed network; the size of the message is less of aconcern than the number of sequential phases of message passing. In a previous paper; wehave developed a lock-based concurrency control protocol for gigabit-networked databases(GNDB). In this paper; we expand on a log-based recovery protocol that provides e cientrecovery in a GNDB with the above mentioned concurrency control scheme.,Proc. of 9th Intl.

Argo: Architecture-aware graph partitioning,Angen Zheng; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis; Jack Lange,The increasing popularity and ubiquity of various large graph datasets has caused renewedinterest for graph partitioning. Existing graph partitioners either scale poorly against largegraphs or disregard the impact of the underlying hardware topology. A few solutions haveshown that the nonuniform network communication costs may affect the performance greatly.However; none of them considers the impact of resource contention on the memorysubsystems (eg; LLC and Memory Controller) of modern multicore clusters. They all neglectthe fact that the bandwidth of modern high-speed networks (eg; Infiniband) has becomecomparable to that of the memory subsystems.

Processing of aggregate continuous queries in a distributed environment,Anatoli U Shein; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract. Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) performing online analytics rely onthe efficient execution of large numbers of Aggregate Continuous Queries (ACQs). In thispaper; we study the problem of generating high quality execution plans of ACQs in DSMSsdeployed on multi-node (multi-core and multi-processor) distributed environments. Towardsthis goal; we classify optimizers based on how they partition the workload among computingnodes and on their usage of the concept of Weavability; which is utilized by the state-ofthe-art WeaveShare optimizer to selectively combine ACQs and produce low cost executionplans for single-node environments. For each category; we propose an optimizer; whicheither adopts an existing strategy or develops a new one for assigning and grouping ACQsto computing nodes.

Optimizing the energy consumption of continuous query processing with mobile clients,Panayiotis Neophytou; Jesse Szwedko; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Complex event detection over data streams has become ubiquitous through the widespreaduse of sensors; wireless connectivity and the wide variety of end-user mobile devices.Typically; such event detection is carried out by a data stream management systemexecuting continuous queries (CQs); registered by the users. In this paper; we consider thesituation where the results of the CQs; which are in the form of individual data streams; aredisseminated to the users' hand-held; battery-operated devices over a shared broadcastmedium. In order to reduce the overall energy consumption of the mobile devices; wepropose Bose*; a power-aware query operator placement algorithm that determines whichpart of a CQ plan should be executed at the data stream management system and whichpart should be executed at the mobile device.

Tuning qod in stream processing engines,Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Data (QoD) are the two major dimensions forevaluating any query processing system. In the context of data stream management systems(DSMSs); multi-query scheduling has been exploited to improve QoS. In this paper; we areproposing to exploit query scheduling to improve QoD in DSMSs. Specifically; we arepresenting a new policy for scheduling multiple continuous queries with the objective ofmaximizing the freshness of the output data streams and hence the QoD of such outputs.The proposed Freshness-Aware Scheduling of Multiple Continuous Queries (FAS-MCQ)policy decides the execution order of continuous queries based on each query's properties(ie; cost and selectivity) as well the properties of the input update streams (ie; variability ofupdates).

Improving the hybrid data dissemination model of web documents,Jonathan Beaver; Kirk Pruhs; Panos K Chrysanthis; Vincenzo Liberatore,Abstract One of the major problems in the Internet today is the scalable delivery of data. Withmore and more people joining the Internet community; web servers and services are beingforced to deal with workloads beyond their original data dissemination design capacity. Onesolution that has arisen to address scalability is to use multicasting; or push-based datadissemination; to send out data to many clients at once. More recently; the idea of usingmulticasting as part of a hybrid system with unicasting has shown positive results inincreasing server scalability. In this paper we focus on solving problems associated with thehybrid dissemination model. In particular; we address the issues of document popularity anddocument division while arguing for the use of a third channel; called the multicast pullchannel; in the hybrid system model. This channel improves performance in terms of …,World Wide Web,2008,4
Middleware for scalable data dissemination,Panos K Chrysanthis; Vincenzo Liberatore; Kirk Pruhs,A major problem on the Internet is the scalable dissemination of information. This problem isparticularly acute exactly at the time when the scalability of data delivery is most important;for example; election results on the night of the 2000 US presidential election; and newsduring 9/11/2001. The current unicast pull framework simply does not scale up to thesetypes of workloads. One proposed solution to this scalability problem is to use multicastcommunication. Multicast introduces many nontrivial data management problems; which arecommon to various data dissemination applications. Multicast data management issues canbe addressed by a middleware such that• the middleware would free application developersfrom the need of implementing in each application a common set of data;• the middlewarewould free application developers from the details of the underlying multicast transport …,Middleware for Communications,2004,4
The multicast pull advantage in dissemination-based data delivery,Jonathan Beaver; Kirk Pruhs; Panos K Chrysanthis; Vincenzo Liberatore,ABSTRACT A major problem in web database applications and on the Internet in general isthe scalable delivery of data. Multicast is one of the standard techniques to achieve scalabledata dissemination. However the use of multicast introduces a variety of data managementissues at the server. In this paper we examine three major problems namely; the pushpopularity problem; the document classification problem and the bandwidth divisionproblem; that arise in the design of a hybrid data dissemination scheme. We proposesolutions to these problems and argue that these are essentially the best possible solutions.In particular; we argue for having a multicast pull mode; in addition to the traditional unicastpull mode and the commonly proposed multicast push mode. We give a simple method forestimating the current popularities of pushed documents. We give an algorithm for …,Proceedings of 3rd Hellenic Data Management Symposium,2004,4
Broadcast data organizations and client side cache,Oleg Shigiltchoff; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Broadcasting provides an efficient means for disseminating information in both wired andwireless setting. In this paper; we study different client side cache organizations for varioustypes of multiversion data broadcast; ie; data broadcast in which more than one value isbroadcast per data item. Besides increasing the concurrency of client transactions;multiversion broadcast provides clients with the possibility of accessing multiple serverstates. For example; such a functionality is essential to support applications that requireaccess to data sequences and have limited local memory to store the previous versions;such as in the case of sensor networks.,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops; 2003.

View propagation and inconsistency detection for cooperative mobile agents,Susan Weissman Lauzac; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Mobile agents are autonomous programs that migrate from one machine to anotherwithin a network on behalf of a client; thus; they are ideal for mobile computing environmentssince tasks can be delegated to mobile agents when a mobile client is disconnected. Thispaper extends the traditional functionality of a mobile service agent with capabilities thatfacilitate asynchronous cooperation among mobile database clients. In the context of mobileclient-server database applications; data cached to support disconnected operations cantake the form of a materialized view. We design mobile agents to reduce computation andwireless communication costs; and use view versioning to cope with disconnectedoperations by allowing application sessions to access current data without invalidating workpreviously done.

Correctness criteria and concurrency control,Panos K Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham,Database systems have been widely incorporated in almost all aspects of the operations oflarge organizations. Database systems offer reliability guarantees concerning thecorrectness of data in spite of failures and concurrent accesses by multiple users. Similarguarantees are expected from multidatabase systems (MDBSs); which logically integratemultiple preexisting database systems; providing uniform and transparent access to datastored in these databases. MDBSs meet the need for organizations to intemperate theirdatabases already in service by supporting new global applications that access multipledatabases. An MDBS allows each local database system to continue to operateindependently.

An entity-relationship approach to schema evolution,Chien-Tsai Liu; Shi-Kuo Chang; Panos K Chrysanthis,A dynamically evolving information system supports changes to its database schema inorder to facilitate the needs of new application programs. This paper presents an approachto schema evolution through changes to the entity-relationship schema of a database. Thisapproach has the advantage of being closer to the designer's perception of data; rather thanto the logical database schema which describes how data are stored in the database. Theunderlying database structure is re-organized; if necessary; to accommodate new datawithout the changes affecting existing objects. In this way and through the construction ofviews; modifications of existing programs are avoided while all objects in the database areaccessible to all application programs; both new and old. Thus; the invariance of theprograms' interface is preserved by the views.,Computing and Information; 1993. Proceedings ICCI'93.; Fifth International Conference on,1993,4

Platforms such as Foursquare and Yelp curateinformation about establishments in an area that can then be used for recommendationpurposes. Traditionally an approach followed by these systems is to rank places based ontheir popularity; proximity or any other feature that represents the quality of the venue andthen return the top-k of them. However; this approach; while simple and intuitive; is notnecessarily providing a diverse set of recommendations; since similar venues typically areranked closely.

Avoiding class warfare: managing continuous queries with differentiated classes of service,Thao N Pham; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Data stream management systems (DSMSs) offer the most effective solution forprocessing data streams by efficiently executing continuous queries (CQs) over theincoming data. CQs inherently have different levels of criticality and hence different levels ofexpected quality of service (QoS) and quality of data (QoD). Adhering to such expectedQoS/QoD metrics is even more important in cases of multi-tenant data stream managementservices. In this work; we propose DILoS; a framework that; through priority-basedscheduling and load shedding; supports differentiated QoS and QoD for multiple classes ofCQs. Unlike existing works that consider scheduling and load shedding separately; DILoS isa novel unified framework that exploits the synergy between scheduling and load shedding.We also propose ALoMa; a general; adaptive load manager that DILoS is built upon.

A user-friendly framework for database preferences,Roxana Gheorghiu; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Data drives all aspects of our society; from everyday life; to business; to medicine; andscience. It is well known that query personalization can be an effective technique in dealingwith the data scalability challenge; primarily from the human point of view. In order tocustomize their query results; users need to express their preferences in a simple and user-friendly manner. There are two types of preferences: qualitative and quantitative. Eachpreference type has advantages and disadvantages with respect to expressiveness. In thispaper; we present a graph-based theoretical framework and a prototype system that unifyqualitative and quantitative preferences; while eliminating their disadvantages. Ourintegrated system allows for (1) the specification of database preferences and creation ofuser preference profiles in a user-friendly manner and (2) the manipulation of preferences …,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2014 International Conference on,2014,3
Performance vs. freshness in web database applications,Stavros Papastavrou; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras,Abstract In this work; we present a novel approach for the efficient materialization of dynamicweb pages in e-commerce applications such as an online retail store with millions of items;hundreds of HTTP requests per second and tens of dynamic web page types. In suchapplications; user satisfaction; as measured in terms of response time (QoS) and contentfreshness (QoD); determines their success especially under heavy workload. The novelty ofour materialization approach over existing ones is that; it considers the data dependenciesbetween content fragments of a dynamic web page. We introduce two new semantic-baseddata freshness metrics that capture the content dependencies and propose twomaterialization algorithms that balance QoS and QoD.

Database preferences-a unified model,Roxana Gheorghiu; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,ABSTRACT In this work we present a new model that combines two different types ofpreferences; qualitative and quantitative. We show how our model can support differenttypes of preferences at different granularity levels and how can an application use thesepreferences to retrieve a list of tuples. The new model takes advantage of graphrepresentation of preferences where nodes in the graph are SQL predicates; edges betweentwo nodes describe a qualitative preference and edges from a node to the same nodecapture quantitative preferences. Each edge is labeled with a numeric value; between-1 and1; to express the intensity of each preference. Using this graph representation we furthershow how two different preferences can be combined and applied to the existing queryresult set to filter the result and identify the most relevant tuples first.,PersDB,2012,3
Sensor queries: Algebraic optimization for time and energy,Vladimir I Zadorozhny; Panos K Chrysanthis; Divyasheel Sharma,Sensor networks naturally apply to a broad range of applications that involve systemmonitoring and information tracking (eg; airport security infrastructure; monitoring of childrenin metropolitan areas; product transition in warehouse networks; fine-grained weather/environmental measurements; etc.). Meanwhile; there are considerable performancedeficiencies in applying existing sensornets in the applications that have stringentrequirements for efficient mechanisms for querying sensor data and delivering the queryresult. The amount of data collected from all relevant sensors may be quite large and willrequire high data transmission rates to satisfy time constraints.

Multi-criteria routing in pervasive environment with sensors,Ganesh Santhanakrishnan; Qinglan Li; Jonathan Beaver; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ahmed Amer; Alexandros Labrinidis,Interconnected computing nodes in pervasive systems demand efficient management toensure longevity and effectiveness. This is particularly true when we consider wirelesssensor networks; for which we propose a new scheme for adaptive route management.There have been numerous studies that have looked at the routing of data in sensornetworks with the sole intention of reducing communication power. However there has beencomparatively less prior art in the area of semantic and multi-criteria based routing. We lookat routing in sensor networks from these perspectives and propose an adaptive multi-criteriarouting protocol in the context of wireless sensor networks.

A comparison of two view materialization approaches for disease surveillance system,Zhen Liu; Panos K Chrysanthis; Fu-Chiang Tsui,Abstract The effectiveness of a disease surveillance system such as RODS depends heavilyon the performance of the underlying data management components. Given that suchsystem's core functionality is to support decision making and data mining; the response timeof complex queries involving aggregation requires special attention. Traditionally;materialized views have been advocated to address this issue. The question that this paperexamines is which approach implementing materialized views is more suitable in a diseasesurveillance environment. Our comparison focuses on the two most common approaches;namely; the Cache Tables approach and the Data Warehousing approach. Our evaluationshows that the choice of an approach is not limited by the cost-performance but by the cost-flexibility of usage as well.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2004,3

Performance of five atomic commit protocols in gigabit-networked database systems,YJ Al-Houmaily; R Conticello; J Pike; PK Chrysanthis,Abstract In this paper; based on an empirical simulation study; we report on the performanceimplications of ve atomic commit protocols on transaction throughput in future; wide-areagigabit-networked database systems. In our study; in addition to the three well known two-phase commit (2PC) variants; we considered two single-phase commit protocols; namely;the implicit yes-vote (IYV) and coordinator log. Salient results of our study show that IYV is; ingeneral; better than all the other evaluated protocols during normal processing.Performance enhancements due to a read-only optimization are more pronounced withshort transactions. The choice of a 2PC variant has very little impact on performance in thecase of long transactions as opposed to short ones; with presumed commit being better thanpresumed abort in most cases.,Proc. of PDCS,1998,3

Empirical Evaluation of Task and Resource Scheduling in Dynamic Real-Time Systems,Ken Tew; Panos K Chrysanthis; Daniel Mosse,Abstract This paper reports on our on-going empirical evaluation of a two-tiered resourceallocation scheme assuming independent jobs; that is; jobs have no precedence constraints.The first tier extends the temporal density approach (load balancing within a time interval);while the second tier uses variations of the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) approach toschedule jobs at a site. However; job scheduling at sites is constrained by the precedencerelation between the loading and execution of a job. That is; in addition to CPU scheduling;we also take care of the time it takes to load a task onto memory from a disk (or from anotherprocessor over the network). In our scheme; loading (ie; disk scheduling) uses non-preemptive EDF whereas the execution (ie; CPU scheduling) uses preemptive EDF. 1Introduction It is well accepted that there are two classes of realtime systems: hard real …,*,1996,3

F1: Accelerating the Optimization of Aggregate Continuous Queries,Anatoli U Shein; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Data Stream Management Systems performing on-line analytics rely on the efficientexecution of large numbers of Aggregate Continuous Queries (ACQs). The state-of-the-artWeaveShare optimizer uses the Weavability concept in order to selectively combine ACQsfor partial aggregation and produce high quality execution plans. However; WeaveSharedoes not scale well with the number of ACQs. In this paper we propose a novel closedformula; F1; that accelerates Weavability calculations; and thus allows WeaveShare toachieve exceptional scalability in systems with heavy workloads. In general; F1 can reducethe computation time of any technique that combines partial aggregations within compositeslides of multiple ACQs. We theoretically analyze the Bit Set approach currently used byWeaveShare and show that F1 is superior in both time and space complexities.

Interactive preference-aware query optimization,NR Ong; SE Rojcewicz; Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,PASQL is an extension to SQL that allows users of a distributed database to specify privacyconstraints on an SQL query evaluation plan. However; privacy constraints can be difficultfor users to specify; and worse yet; all possible situations that could lead to a privacyviolation may not be known to the user a priori. To address these challenges; we propose aGUI-based interactive process for detecting such violations and generating appropriateconstraints.

A continuous workflow scheduling framework,Panayiotis Neophytou; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Traditional workflow management or enactment systems (WfMS) and workflowdesign processes view the workflow as a one-time interaction with the various data sources;ie; when a workflow is invoked; its steps are executed once and in-order. The fundamentalunderlying assumption has been that data sources are passive and all interactions arestructured along the request/reply (query) model. Hence; traditional WfMS cannot effectivelysupport business or scientific monitoring applications that require the processing of datastreams such as those generated nowadays by sensing devices as well as mobile and webapplications. Our hypothesis is that WfMS; both in the scientific and business domains; canbe extended to support data stream semantics to enable monitoring applications.

Key-key-value stores for efficiently processing graph data in the cloud,Alexander G Connor; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Modern cloud data storage services have powerful capabilities for data-sets that can beindexed by a single key-key-value stores-and for data-sets that are characterized by multipleattributes (such as Google's BigTable). These data stores have non-ideal overheads;however; when graph data needs to be maintained; overheads are incurred because related(by graph edges) keys are managed in physically different host machines. We propose anew distributed data-storage paradigm; the key-key-value store; which will extend the key-value model and significantly reduce these overheads by storing related keys in the sameplace. We provide a high-level description of our proposed system for storing large-scale;highly interconnected graph data-such as social networks-as well as an analysis of our key-key-value system in relation to existing work.

Data Transmission Algebra for Collision-Aware Scheduling in Sensor Networks,V Zadorozhny; Divyasheel Sharma; P Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Sensor databases extend database technology to query and monitor the physical world as ahighly distributed database. In this paper we consider a Data Transmission Algebra (DTA)that allows a query optimizer to utilize lower layer communication protocols in schedulingsensor database queries. By being able to determine the order in which data are processedat sensor nodes and transmitted between sensor nodes in a query routing tree; a queryoptimizer can both improve the response time and reduce the energy consumption perquery. We use a logical framework to specify DTA semantics and to prove its soundness andcompleteness. Further; we prove that DTA query execution schedules have the key propertyof being collision-free.,Formal Methods in Compositional infrastructures of Heterogeneous Distributed Information Systems; Russian Academy of Science Publ,2005,2

Energy efficient access in multiversion broadcast environment,Oleg Shigiltchoff; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Broadcasting provides an efficient means for disseminating information in both wired andwireless settings; especially for popular data items. Multiversion (MV) data broadcast; ie;data broadcast in which more than one value is broadcast per data item; has the advantageof allowing more client transactions to read consistent data and complete their operationsuccessfully. Naturally; the MV broadcast can satisfy both historical queries in which a clientaccesses many versions of the same data item and snapshot queries in which a clientaccesses different data items of the same version. Furthermore; multiple versions increaseclients' tolerance to network disconnections that are common in wireless communications. Inthis paper; we expand our previous work on MV broadcasts to support efficient selectivetuning. Selective tuning is important for energy constraint mobile devices since it enables …,Mobile Data Management; 2004. Proceedings. 2004 IEEE International Conference on,2004,2
A goal-oriented self-tuning caching algorithm,Ganesh Santhanakrishnan; Ahmed Amer; Panos K Chrysanthis,The contribution of this paper is a novel approach to adaptivity that combines alternativesrather than selecting one among alternatives. Using only three; homogenous; cachereplacement algorithms; GD-GhOST were able to provide a cache replacement policy thatrequires no tuning or user-intervention beyond the initial selection of the performancecriteria to be optimized. Overall; at its worst observed performance GD-GhOST was withinapproximately 1% of the best policy's miss ratio; and at its best; GD-GhOST reduced bytemiss rates by well over 50%.,Performance; Computing; and Communications; 2004 IEEE International Conference on,2004,2

In Search for an E cient Real-Time Atomic Commit Protocol,Yousef J Al-Houmaily; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract The purpose of this paper is to report on the rst step in our quest for an e cientatomic commit protocol in realtime databases. This includes the development of realtimeimplicit yes-vote (RT-IYV); a new real-time atomic commit protocol. In contrast to other real-time commit protocols that provide for semantic atomicity; RT-IYV is designed to ensure thetraditional notion of transaction atomicity. To illustrate its performance advantages; wecompare RT-IYV with the recently proposed optimistic commit protocol which is alsodesigned to support the standard transaction atomicity in real-time databases.,Proceeding of the 17th Real-Time Systems Symposium on Work in Progress,1996,2

Uninterruptible migration of continuous queries without operator state migration,Thao N Pham; Nikos R Katsipoulakis; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,ABSTRACT The elasticity brought by cloud infrastructure provides a promising solution for adata stream management system to handle its incoming workload; which can be highlyvariable: the system can scale out when heavily loaded; and scale in otherwise. In such asolution; the efficiency of the mechanism used to migrate a query from one node to anotheris very important. Generally; a stream application requires real-time outputs for itscontinuous queries; and downtime is not acceptable. Moreover; the migration should notadd considerable processing cost to a node that could have been already overloaded. Inthis paper; we present our migration protocol; named UniMiCo; which satisfies thoserequirements. We implemented UniMiCo in a DSMS prototype and experimentally show thatthe protocol preserves correctness; while introducing no noticeable changes in the …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2017,1
A holistic view of stream partitioning costs,Nikos R Katsipoulakis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Stream processing has become the dominant processing model for monitoring andreal-time analytics. Modern Parallel Stream Processing Engines (pSPEs) have made itfeasible to increase the performance in both monitoring and analytical queries byparallelizing a query's execution and distributing the load on multiple workers. A determiningfactor for the performance of a pSPE is the partitioning algorithm used to disseminate tuplesto workers. Until now; partitioning methods in pSPEs have been similar to the ones used inparallel databases and only recently load-aware algorithms have been employed to improvethe effectiveness of parallel execution. We identify and demonstrate the need to incorporateaggregation costs in the partitioning model when executing stateful operations in parallel; inorder to minimize the overall latency and/or through-put. Towards this; we propose new …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Flatfit: Accelerated incremental sliding-window aggregation for real-time analytics,Anatoli U Shein; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Data stream processing is becoming essential in most current advanced scientificor business applications as data production rates are increasing. Different companiescompete to efficiently ingest high velocity data and apply some form of computation in orderto make better business decisions. In order to successfully compete in this environment;companies are focusing on the most recent data within a count or time-based window bycontinuously executing aggregate queries on it. Incremental sliding-window computation iscommonly used to avoid the performance implications of re-evaluating the aggregate valueof the window from scratch on every update. The state-of-the-art FlatFAT technique executesACQs with high efficiency but it does not scale well with the increasing workloads. In thispaper we propose a novel algorithm; FlatFIT; that accelerates such calculations by …,Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2017,1
Interactive Exploration of Correlated Time Series,Daniel Petrov; Rakan Alseghayer; Mohamed Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract The rapid growth of monitoring applications has led to unprecedented amounts ofgenerated time series data. Data analysts typically explore such large volumes of time seriesdata looking for valuable insights. One such insight is finding pairs of time series; in whichsubsequences of values exhibit certain levels of correlation. However; since exploratoryqueries tend to be initially vague and imprecise; an analyst will typically use the results ofone query as a springboard to formulating a new one; in which the correlation specificationsare further refined. As such; it is essential to provide analysts with quick initial results to theirexploratory queries; which allows for speeding up the refinement process. This goal ischallenging when exploring the correlation in a large search space that consists of a bignumber of long time series. In this work we propose search algorithms that address …,Proceedings of the ExploreDB'17,2017,1
Artifact Evaluation: Is it a Real Incentive?,Bruce R Childers; Panos K Chrysanthis,It is well accepted that we learn hard lessons when implementing and re-evaluatingsystems; yet it is also acknowledged that science faces a crisis in reproducibility. Aremarkable study; reported in Nature [3]; showed that 70% of researchers could not faithfullyreproduce another study's results. Experimental computer science (CS) is far from immuneto this crisis; although it should be easier for CS than other sciences; given the emphasis onencapsulating experimental artifacts; such as source code; data sets; workflows;configuration parameters; etc. Collberg and Proebsting report that only 32.3% of computersystems experiments could be reproduced [4]. Fortunately; there is growing recognition ofthe challenge in CS.

REQUEST: A scalable framework for interactive construction of exploratory queries,Xiaoyu Ge; Yanbing Xue; Zhipeng Luo; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis,Exploration over large datasets is a key first step in data analysis; as users may beunfamiliar with the underlying database schema and unable to construct precise queries thatrepresent their interests. Such data exploration task usually involves executing numerous ad-hoc queries; which requires a considerable amount of time and human effort. In this paper;we present REQUEST; a novel framework that is designed to minimize the human effort andenable both effective and efficient data exploration. REQUEST supports the query-from-examples style of data exploration by integrating two key components: 1) Data Reduction;and 2) Query Selection. As instances of the REQUEST framework; we propose severalhighly scalable schemes; which employ active learning techniques and provide differentlevels of efficiency and effectiveness as guided by the user's preferences.

Holistically evaluating the environmental impacts in modern computing systems,Donald Kline; Nikolas Parshook; Xiaoyu Ge; Erik Brunvand; Rami Melhem; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alex K Jones,There is mounting evidence that manufacturing energy and environmental costs are agrowing factor in the overall energy footprint of computing systems. The quantification ofthese impacts requires the evaluation of both the manufacturing and use phaseenergy/environmental costs of major integrated circuit (IC) components; includingprocessing units; memory; and storage. In particular; expansions of memory and cache canpotentially increase manufacturing costs beyond what can be recovered through use phaseadvantages for reasonable usage patterns. With this holistic view of sustainability in mind;we provide evaluations of the environmental impacts of memory and cache options forParsec and SPEC multi-program workloads.

Repartitioning Strategies for Massively Parallel Simulation of Reacting Flow,Patrick Pisciuneri; Angen Zheng; Peyman Givi; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos Chrysanthis,Abstract The majority of parallel CFD simulators partition the domain into equal regions andassign the calculations for a particular region to a unique processor. This type of domaindecomposition is vital to the efficiency of the solver. However; as the simulation develops;the workload among the partitions often become uneven (eg by adaptive mesh refinement;or chemically reacting regions) and a new partition should be considered. The process ofrepartitioning adjusts the current partition to evenly distribute the load again. We comparetwo repartitioning tools: Zoltan; an architecture-agnostic graph repartitioner developed at theSandia National Laboratories; and Paragon; an architecture-aware graph repartitionerdeveloped at the University of Pittsburgh.

Stream query processing on emerging memory architectures,Chelsea Mafrica; John Johnson; Santiago Bock; Thao N Pham; Bruce R Childers; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Stream query processing is becoming increasingly important as more time-oriented data isproduced and analyzed online. Stream processing is typically memory-resident for thefastest processing of ephemeral data. With workload consolidation; processing separatedata streams on the same processor may lead to harmful contention between queryworkloads. This contention may become particularly problematic as new main memorytechnologies are adopted; such as phase-change memory; that have asymmetric read andwrite latency. This work presents a preliminary study of performance implications ofconsolidation and emerging memory on stream query processing. We show that contentionin the memory subsystem worsens with a phase-change main memory; suggesting that newstream optimization and hardware approaches will be required to achieve quality of …,Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA); 2015 IEEE,2015,1
Harnessing off-grid renewable energy,Guy Gadola; Panos K Chrysanthis,This paper explores how to economically harness renewable energy resources that are off-grid or otherwise isolated from customers. Its hypothesis is that under certain conditions;isolated renewable energy resources can be economically harnessed by using unmannedhydrogen-filled airships. Because hydrogen is an energy carrier and a lifting gas; unmannedhydrogen-filled airships can be used to carry hydrogen and cargo simultaneously.Unmanned airships do not have air crews to be put at risk although hydrogen airship safetyhas been reportedly increased. Furthermore; unmanned airships reduce cost in personnel.Finally; this paper proposes an operational model of hydrogen airships for efficient deliveryof hydrogen within a known multiplier of optimum.,Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA); 2013 International Conference on,2013,1
Enabling intensional access control via preference-aware query optimization,Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,Abstract Although the declarative nature of SQL provides great utility to database users; itsuse in distributed database management systems can result in unintended consequences touser privacy over the course of query evaluation. By allowing users to merely say what datathey are interested in accessing without providing guidance regarding how to retrieve it;query optimizers can generate plans that leak sensitive query intension. To address thesetypes of issues; we have created a framework that empowers users with the ability to specifyaccess controls on the intension of their queries through extensions to the SQL SELECTstatement. In this demonstration; we present a version of PostgreSQL's query optimizer thatwe have modified to produce plans that respect these constraints while optimizing user-specified SQL queries in terms of performance.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2013,1

Data broadcasting; caching and replication in mobile computing,Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,realized using such logical structures. For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,1
Semantics-based Concurrency Control,Krithi Ramamritham; Panos K Chrysanthis,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,1

Profile and context filtering of streaming data for a mobile personal assistant,Alan Berfield; Jonathan Beaver; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract A key component in an ubiquitous computing environment is a personal assistantthat can provide a link between devices and services and a human user. A large part ofinteractions in such an environment is expected to be using XML data. In this paper wepresent the use of profiles and context to obtain useful information from streamingdocuments. The user profile contains all the preferences and information on typical behaviorfor the user. This information can be entered by the user and learned over time. As theprofile is never shared or transmitted; strict user privacy is maintained. Context informationincludes current day and time; and the user's location. We have implemented our ideas in anintelligent personal assistant; iPA; within the context of mobile commerce.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2004,1

These datasets are comprised of both continuous and categorical data(“Mixed Data”); and essential variables may be unobserved in this data due to the complexnature of biomedical phenomena. Causal inference algorithms can identify importantrelationships from biomedical data; however; handling the challenges of causal inferenceover mixed data with unmeasured confounders in a scalable way is still an open problem.Despite recent advances into causal discovery strategies that could potentially handle thesechallenges; individually; no study currently exists that comprehensively compares theseapproaches in this setting.

Efficient Recommendation of Aggregate Data Visualizations,Humaira Ehsan; Mohamed Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis,Data visualization is a common and effective technique for data exploration. However; forcomplex data; it is infeasible for an analyst to manually generate and browse all possiblevisualizations for insights. That motivated the need for automated solutions that caneffectively recommend such visualizations. The main idea underlying those solutions is toevaluate the utility of all possible visualizations and then recommend the top-kvisualizations. This process incurs high data-processing cost; that is further aggravated bythe presence of numerical dimensional attributes. To address that challenge; we proposenovel view recommendation schemes that are based on numerical dimensions.

Detection of Highly Correlated Live Data Streams,Rakan Alseghayer; Daniel Petrov; Panos K Chrysanthis; Mohamed Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract More and more organizations (commercial; health; government and security)currently base their decisions on real-time analysis of fast arriving; large volumes of datastreams. For such analysis to lead to actionable information in real-time and at the right time;the most recent data needs to be processed within a specified delay target. Effectivesolutions for analysis of such data streams rely on two techniques;(1) incremental sliding-window computation of aggregates; to avoid unnecessary recomputations and (2) intelligentscheduling of computational steps and operations. In this paper; we propose a solution thatcombines both of these techniques to find highly correlated data streams in real-time; usingthe Pearson Correlation Coefficient as a correlation metric for two windows of data streams.Specifically; we propose to partition a set of data streams into micro-batches that capture …,Proceedings of the International Workshop on Real-Time Business Intelligence and Analytics,2017,*

This expansion in complexity requires new methodologies formanaging data that alleviate as much of the burden as possible from the individual user.Instead of requiring users to understand their full collection of data and the underlyingstorage architectures; future storage systems need to be able to decide on their own how tomanage individual files both in terms of the appropriate storage medium as well as thenecessary file operation semantics. In this paper we present a vision for future storagesystems that address the dramatic increase in complexity and volume by providing …,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,*
Auction-based Admission Control for Continuous Queries in a Multi-Tenant DSMS,Lory Al Moakar; Panos K Chrysanthis; Christine Chung; Shenoda Guirguis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panayiotis Neophytou; Kirk Pruhs,Abstract The growing popularity of monitoring applications and “Big Data” analytics used bya variety of users will leadto a multi-tenant data stream management system. This paperdeals with the problem of admission control ofcontinuous queries; where the streamprocessing resources are sold to the end users. We employ variable pricingby means ofauction-based mechanisms. The admission control auction mechanism determines whichqueries toadmit; and how much to charge the user for each query in a way that maximizessystem revenue. The admissionmechanism is required to be strategyproof and sybil-immune; incentivizing users to use the system honestly. Specifically; we require that eachuser maximizes her payoff by bidding her true value of having a query run.

Using a distributed search engine to identify optimal product sets for use in an outbreak detection system,Ruhsary Rexit; Fuchiang Tsui; Jeremy Espino; Sahawut Wesaratchakit; Ye Ye; Panos K Chrysanthis,This study tests an approach for identifying sets of over-the-counter (OTC) thermometerproducts whose aggregate sales correlate optimally with aggregate counts of emergencydepartment (ED) visits where patients have symptoms consistent with Constitutionalsyndrome such as fever and chills. We show that by using a distributed search enginealongside search algorithms (Brute-force); we can quickly identify a minimum set of OTCthermometer products whose sales are optimally correlated to the ED data. We used thePearson correlation coefficient function to measure the degree of correlation between OTCand ED time series. The optimal OTC product set-comprising 9 thermometer products foundby the Brute-force algorithm-has a correlation coefficient value of 0.96. We believe theapproach used in this study can be used to efficiently identify different optimal OTC sets …,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2012 8th International Conference on,2012,*
Visualization of Energy Consumption of Continuous Query Processing with Mobile Clients,Jesse Szwedko; Panayiotis Neophytou; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Mohamed A Sharaf,Complex event detection over data streams has become ubiquitous through the widespreaduse of sensors; wireless connectivity and the wide variety of end-user mobile devices.Typically; event detection is carried out by a central server executing continuous queries. Inthis demonstration; we focus on the case where users with mobile devices submitcontinuous queries (for event detection) to a data stream management server whichdisseminates the results to the users over a shared broadcast medium. In order to minimizethe overall energy consumption of the mobile devices (clients); we have proposed operatorplacement algorithms that split the processing of each continuous query between thecentralized server and the requesting mobile clients; thus trading off energy consumption forcommunication energy consumption for computation.

We consider thesetting of a for-profit business selling data stream monitoring/management services and weinvestigate auction-based mechanisms for admission control of continuous queries. Whensubmitting a query; each user also submits a bid of how much she will commit to paying forthat query to run. The admission control auction mechanism then determines which queriesto admit; and how much to charge each user in a way that maximizes system revenue whileincentivizing users to use the system honestly. Specifically; we require that each usermaximizes her payoff by bidding her true value of having her query run. We further considerthe requirement that the mechanism be sybil-immune; that is; that no user can increase herpayoff by submitting queries that she does not value.

Towards Continuous Workﬂow Enactment Systems,Panayiotis Neophytou; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract. Traditional workﬂow enactment systems and workﬂow design processes view theworkﬂow as a one-time interaction with the various data sources; executing a series of stepsonce; whenever the workﬂow results are requested. The fundamental underlyingassumption has been that data sources are passive and all interactions are structured alongthe request/reply (query) model. Hence; traditional Workﬂow Management Systems cannoteﬀectively support business or scientiﬁc monitoring applications that require the processingof data streams. In this paper; we propose a paradigm shift from the traditional step-wiseworkﬂow execution model to a continuous execution model; in order to handle data streamspublished and delivered asynchronously from multiple sources.,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing: 4th International Conference; CollaborateCom 2008; Orlando; FL; USA; November 13-16; 2008; Revised Selected Papers,2009,*

Better client OFF time prediction to improve performance in web information systems,Alan Berfield; Bill Simons; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs,Abstract Prefetching is a potential technique for reducing latency in Web informationSystems. However; it has been shown that the burstiness of standard prefetching candrastically increase network congestion; and can even increase; rather than decrease;average user perceived latency. Accurate OFF time; the idle periods between user requests;prediction potentially allows the document to be downloaded at an even rate over the OFFtime; which can ameliorate the burstiness; and significantly improve both networkcongestion and average user perceived latency. Yet accurate prediction of such OFF timeshas been difficult to achieve.

Multi—Criteria Routing in Pervasive Environment with Sensors,Panos K Chrysanthis; Qinglan Li,Abstract Interconnected computing nodes in pervasive systems demand efﬁcientmanagement to ensure longevity and effectiveness. This is particularly true when weconsider wireless sensor networks; for which we propose a new scheme for adaptive routemanagement. There have been numer—ous studies that have looked at the routing of datain sensor networks with the sole intention of reducing communication power. However therehas been comparatively less prior art in the area of semantic and multi-criteria basedrouting. We look at routing in sensor networks from these perspectives and propose anadaptive multi-criteria routing protocol in the context of wireless sensor networks.

Distributed Databases and Transaction Processing,Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos K Chrysanthis; George Samaras,Summary This chapter discusses the use of mobile agents in distributed database systemsand applications. It presents a number of software architectures for distributed systemsranging from simple client-server configurations to architectures involving variousmiddleware components and mobile agents; and then focuses on the applications of thesesoftware architectures to database management systems (DBMSs). There are similarities inthe issues addressed in agent-based systems and in peer-to-peer (p2p) computing. Thechapter discusses on how the various stages of query processing can be assigned to mobileagents; and focuses on the topic of view materialization. It presents issues related to a fault-tolerant execution of agents and focuses on transaction models for agents and protocols formaintaining the transaction properties of agents even in the case of failures.

Structuring the Commit Tree for Better Performance of Two Phase Commit Processing,George Samaras; G Kyrou; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract. Extensive research has been carried out in search for an efficient atomic commitprotocol and many optimizations have been suggested to improve the two-phase commitprotocol; either for the normal or failure case. Yet; the performance effects on transactionprocessing when combining some of these optimizations have not been studied in depth. Inthis paper; we concentrate on the flattening-of-the-commit-tree optimization; in particular thecombination of flattening with the read-only optimization. Our simulation results reveal amajor pitfall of flattening when dealing with large trees. A new restructuring method isproposed that performs better than flattening even when dealing with large trees. Requiredprotocol modifications to support the suggested optimizations are also addressed.,Proc. of the 8th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics and Computer Science,*,*

Middleware for Scalable Data Dissemination* Panos K. Chrysanthis† Vincenzo Liberatore* Kirk Pruhs,Panos K Chrysanthis,A major problem on the Internet is the scalable dissemination of information. This problem isparticularly acute exactly at the time when the scalability of data delivery is most important;eg; election results on the night of the 2000 United States presidential election; and newsduring 9/11/2001. The current unicast pull framework simply does not scale up to thesetypes of workloads. One proposed solution to this scalability problem is to use multicastcommunication. Multicast introduces many non-trivial data management problems; whichare common to various data dissemination applications. Multicast data management issuescan be addressed by a middleware such that,*,*,*
ViSMA: Implementation of an Extendible Mobile-Agent Based System for the Materialization and Maintenance of Personalized and Shareable Web Views,George Samaras; Kyriakos Karenos; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,ABSTRACT ViSMA (Views Supported by Mobile Agents) is an implementation of a flexibleand extendible mobile-agent based system that allows the definition; materialization;maintenance and sharing of distributed views created over remote webaccessibledatabases. The ViSMA architectural components can be distinguished into ViSMA Serverside components; Database side components and Client side components. We haveimplemented three mobile client types based on the user's resource availability andsupporting software. We will demonstrate the functionality of the system includingdatasource definition; shareable and personalized view creation; monitoring; view updatingand deletion. Finally; we will exhibit how view mobility is achieved.,*,*,*

Scheduling Multiple Continuous Queries to Improve QoD,Mohamed A Sharaf; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panos K Chrysanthis; Kirk Pruhs,ABSTRACT Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Data (QoD) are the two majordimensions for evaluating any query processing system. In the context of the new datastream management stystems (DSMSs); multi-query scheduling has been exploited toimprove QoS. In this paper; we are proposing to exploit scheduling to improve QoD.Specifically; we are presenting a new policy for scheduling multiple continuous queries withthe objective of maximizing the freshness of the output data streams and hence the QoD ofsuch outputs. The proposed Freshness-Aware Scheduling of Multiple Continuous Queries(FAS-MCQ) policy decides the execution order of continuous queries based on each query'sproperties (ie; cost and selectivity) as well the properties of the input update streams (ie;variability of updates). Our experimental results have shown that FAS-MCQ can increase …,*,*,*
Sensor Queries: Algebraic Optimization for Data Quality; Time and Energy,Vladimir I Zadorozhny; Panos K Chrysanthis; Divyasheel Sharma,Abstract Sensor databases extend database technology to query and monitor the physicalworld as a highly distributed database. In this paper we consider a Data TransmissionAlgebra (DTA) that allows a query optimizer to utilize lower layer communication protocols inscheduling sensor database queries. By being able to determine the order in which data areprocessed at sensor nodes and transmitted between sensor nodes in a query routing tree; aquery optimizer can both improve the response time and reduce the energy consumptionper query. We use a logical framework to specify DTA semantics and to prove its soundnessand completeness. Further; we prove that DTA query execution schedules have the keyproperty of being collision-free.,*,*,*

Parse & Dispatch: Parallelizing the Generation of Dynamic Web Content,Stavros Papastavrou; George Samaras; Paraskevas Evripidou; Panos K Chrysanthis,ABSTRACT The use of dynamically generated Web content is gaining in popularity overtraditional static HTML content. Dynamic Web content is generated on the fly according tothe instructions embedded in HTML script files. Such instructions generate HTML by carryingout various forms of tasks such as session tracking; database queries and transactions;dynamic image generation; or even fetching information from remote servers. Popular portaland e-commerce Web pages contain a number of tasks that are executed in a serial mannerby traditional multithreaded Web servers. In this ongoing work; we propose a parallelapproach for dynamic content generation; and elaborate on how it affects the design andperformance of Web servers. We have developed a prototype Web server that supports theparallel processing of tasks involved in the dynamic content generation with improved …,*,*,*
Characterizing the Temporal and Semantic Coherency of Broadcast-based Data Dissemination Evaggelia Pitourai*; Panos K. Chrysanthis2**; and Krithi Ramamrith...,Evaggelia Pitourai; Panos K Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract. In this paper; we develop a general theory of temporal and semantic coherency foran extended client/server architecture in which the server broadcasts items of interest to alarge number of clients without a specific client request. Such architectures are part of anincreasing number of emerging applications in wireless mobile computing systems; theyalso provide a scalable means to deliver information in web-based applications; for examplein publish-subscribe systems. We introduce various forms of temporal and semanticcoherency applicable to such architectures and present a framework to precisely defineprotocols for enforcing them.,*,*,*
Exploiting Flash for Energy Efficient Disk Arrays,Shimin Chen; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,A growing concern; energy consumption in data centers has been the focus of numerouswhite papers; research studies; and news reports [1; 11; 4; 3]. According to a report to UScongress [11]; the total energy consumption by servers and data centers in US was about 61billion kWh in 2006; and is projected to nearly double by 2011 [11]. Among the componentsin data centers; it has been shown that storage experienced the fastest annual growth (20%between 2000 and 2006) in energy consumption [11]. A key goal in energy efficient systemdesign is to achieve energy proportionality [2]; ie; energy consumption being proportional tothe system utilization. However; hard disk drives (HDDs); the dominant technology for datastorage today; contain moving components; making it difficult to achieve this goal. Forexample; an enterprise class Seagate Cheetah 15K. 4 HDD consumes about 15W under …,*,*,*
