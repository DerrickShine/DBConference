A brief review of atomic layer deposition: from fundamentals to applications,Richard W Johnson; Adam Hultqvist; Stacey F Bent,Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a vapor phase technique capable of producing thin films ofa variety of materials. Based on sequential; self-limiting reactions; ALD offers exceptionalconformality on high-aspect ratio structures; thickness control at the Angstrom level; andtunable film composition. With these advantages; ALD has emerged as a powerful tool formany industrial and research applications. In this review; we provide a brief introduction toALD and highlight select applications; including Cu (In; Ga) Se 2 solar cell devices; high-ktransistors; and solid oxide fuel cells. These examples are chosen to illustrate the variety oftechnologies that are impacted by ALD; the range of materials that ALD can deposit–frommetal oxides such as Zn 1− x Sn x O y; ZrO 2; Y 2 O 3; to noble metals such as Pt–and theway in which the unique features of ALD can enable new levels of performance and …,*,2014,321

Shore-MT: a scalable storage manager for the multicore era,Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Nikos Hardavellas; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,Abstract Database storage managers have long been able to efficiently handle multipleconcurrent requests. Until recently; however; a computer contained only a few single-coreCPUs; and therefore only a few transactions could simultaneously access the storagemanager's internal structures. This allowed storage managers to use non-scalableapproaches without any penalty. With the arrival of multicore chips; however; this situation israpidly changing. More and more threads can run in parallel; stressing the internalscalability of the storage manager. Systems optimized for high performance at a limitednumber of cores are not assured similarly high performance at a higher core count; becauseunanticipated scalability obstacles arise. We benchmark four popular open-source storagemanagers (Shore; BerkeleyDB; MySQL; and PostgreSQL) on a modern multicore …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,196
Data-oriented transaction execution,Ippokratis Pandis; Ryan Johnson; Nikos Hardavellas; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract While hardware technology has undergone major advancements over the pastdecade; transaction processing systems have remained largely unchanged. The number ofcores on a chip grows exponentially; following Moore's Law; allowing for an ever-increasingnumber of transactions to execute in parallel. As the number of concurrently-executingtransactions increases; contended critical sections become scalability burdens. In typicaltransaction processing systems the centralized lock manager is often the first contendedcomponent and scalability bottleneck. In this paper; we identify the conventional thread-to-transaction assignment policy as the primary cause of contention. Then; we design DORA; asystem that decomposes each transaction to smaller actions and assigns actions to threadsbased on which data each action is about to access. DORA's design allows each thread …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,180
European adolescent substance use: the roles of family structure; function and gender,Paul McArdle; Auke Wiegersma; Eilish Gilvarry; Birgitta Kolte; Steven McCarthy; Michael Fitzgerald; Aoife Brinkley; Maria Blom; Ingo Stoeckel; Anna Pierolini; Ingo Michels; Rob Johnson; Stephan Quensel,Results Living with both parents was associated with reduced levels of drug use in four citiesbut not in Dublin; due perhaps to the high availability from peers in that city. It was not associatedwith reduced levels of regular drinking. The effect of confiding in mother was evident in all citiesand in relation to substance use in general. However; when a delinquency variable was addedto the logistic regressions; its significance in relation to polydrug use disappeared. Supervisionwas somewhat more important in relation to male than female drug use … Conclusion Livingwith both parents is a less robust barrier to substance use than qualitative aspects of familylife; particularly attachment to mothers. The latter is a robust inhibitor of substance use irrespectiveof regional differences in drug availability; weakening only in the face of more generally problematicbehaviour.

Database servers on chip multiprocessors: Limitations and opportunities,Nikos Hardavellas; Ippokratis Pandis; Ryan Johnson; Naju Mancheril; Anastassia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,ABSTRACT Prior research shows that database system performance is dominated by off-chip data stalls; resulting in a concerted effort to bring data into on-chip caches. At the sametime; high levels of integration have enabled the advent of chip multiprocessors andincreasingly large (and slow) on-chip caches. These two trends pose the imminent technicaland research challenge of adapting high-performance data management software to ashifting hardware landscape. In this paper we characterize the performance of a commercialdatabase server running on emerging chip multiprocessor technologies. We find that themajor bottleneck of current software is data cache stalls; with L2 hit stalls rising from oblivionto become the dominant execution time component in some cases. We analyze the sourceof this shift and derive a list of features for future database designs to attain maximum …,*,2007,171

Write-ahead logging is a fundamental; omnipresent component in ARIES-styleconcurrency and recovery; and one of the most important yet-to-be addressed potentialbottlenecks; especially in OLTP workloads making frequent small changes to data. In thispaper; we identify four logging-related impediments to database system scalability.

Selective metal deposition at graphene line defects by atomic layer deposition,Kwanpyo Kim; Richard W Johnson; Jukka T Tanskanen; Nan Liu; Myung-Gil Kim; Changhyun Pang; Chiyui Ahn; Stacey F Bent; Zhenan Bao,Abstract One-dimensional defects in graphene have a strong influence on its physicalproperties; such as electrical charge transport and mechanical strength. With enhancedchemical reactivity; such defects may also allow us to selectively functionalize the materialand systematically tune the properties of graphene. Here we demonstrate the selectivedeposition of metal at chemical vapour deposited graphene's line defects; notably grainboundaries; by atomic layer deposition. Atomic layer deposition allows us to deposit Ptpredominantly on graphene's grain boundaries; folds and cracks due to the enhancedchemical reactivity of these line defects; which is directly confirmed by transmission electronmicroscopy imaging. The selective functionalization of graphene defect sites; together withthe nanowire morphology of deposited Pt; yields a superior platform for sensing …,Nature communications,2014,98
Scalable logging through emerging non-volatile memory,Tianzheng Wang; Ryan Johnson,Abstract Emerging byte-addressable; non-volatile memory (NVM) is fundamentally changingthe design principle of transaction logging. It potentially invalidates the need for flush-before-commit as log records are persistent immediately upon write. Distributed logging---a onceprohibitive technique for single node systems in the DRAM era---becomes a promisingsolution to easing the logging bottleneck because of the non-volatility and high performanceof NVM. In this paper; we advocate NVM and distributed logging on multicore and multi-socket hardware. We identify the challenges brought by distributed logging and discusssolutions. To protect committed work in NVM-based systems; we propose passive groupcommit; a lightweight; practical approach that leverages existing hardware and groupcommit. We expect that durable processor cache is the ultimate solution to protecting …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,92

PLP: page latch-free shared-everything OLTP,Ippokratis Pandis; Pinar Tözün; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Scaling the performance of shared-everything transaction processing systems tohighly-parallel multicore hardware remains a challenge for database system designers.Recent proposals alleviate locking and logging bottlenecks in the system; leaving pagelatching as the next potential problem. To tackle the page latching problem; we proposephysiological partitioning (PLP). The PLP design applies logical-only partitioning;maintaining the desired properties of shared-everything designs; and introduces a multi-rooted B+ Tree index structure (MRBTree) which enables the partitioning of the accesses atthe physical page level. Logical partitioning and MRBTrees together ensure that allaccesses to a given index page come from a single thread and; hence; can be entirely latch-free; an extended design makes heap page accesses thread-private as well.

Here are my data files. here are my queries. where are my results?,Stratos Idreos; Ioannis Alagiannis; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Database management systems (DBMS) provide incredible flexibility andperformance when it comes to query processing; scalability and accuracy. To fully exploitDBMS features; however; the user must define a schema; load the data; tune the system forthe expected workload; and answer several questions. Should the database use a column-store; a row-store or some hybrid format? What indices should be created? All thesequestions make for a formidable and time-consuming hurdle; often deterring newapplications or imposing high cost to existing ones. A characteristic example is that ofscientific databases with huge data sets. The prohibitive initialization cost and complexitystill forces scientists to rely on “ancient” tools for their data management tasks; delayingscientific understanding and progress.

Row-wise parallel predicate evaluation,Ryan Johnson; Vijayshankar Raman; Richard Sidle; Garret Swart,Abstract Table scans have become more interesting recently due to greater use of ad-hocqueries and greater availability of multi-core; vector-enabled hardware. Table scanperformance is limited by value representation; table layout; and processing techniques. Inthis paper we propose a new layout and processing technique for efficient one-passpredicate evaluation. Starting with a set of rows with a fixed number of bits per column; weappend columns to form a set of banks and then pad each bank to a supported machineword length; typically 16; 32; or 64 bits. We then evaluate partial predicates on the columnsof each bank; using a novel evaluation strategy that evaluates column level equality; rangetests; IN-list predicates; and conjuncts of these predicates; simultaneously on multiplecolumns within a bank; and on multiple rows within a machine register.

Computer-assisted personal interviewing: an experimental evaluation of data quality and cost,Reginald P Baker; Robert A Johnson,Abstract This article uses experimental data from the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) tocompare the quality and costs of data collected using computer-assisted personalinterviewing (CAPI) and traditional paper-and-pencil personal interviewing (PAPI). Theexperiment was carried out as part of the NLS Youth Cohort (NLS/Y); a continuinglongitudinal face-to-face survey of United States residents who were aged 14-21 in 1979.Interviewers were randomly assigned to conduct personal interviews using the same NLS/Yquestionnaire as adapted for administration by either PAPI or CAPI. The results suggest that;compared with PAPI; CAPI yields lower item nonresponse rates and greater respondentwillingness to disclose sensitive information.

Evaluating and repairing write performance on flash devices,Radu Stoica; Manos Athanassoulis; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract In the last few years NAND flash storage has become more and more popular asprice per GB and capacity both improve at exponential rates. Flash memory offers significantbenefits compared to magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs) and DBMSs are highly likely to useflash as a general storage backend; either alone or in heterogeneous storage solutions withHDDs. Flash devices; however; respond quite differently than HDDs for common accesspatterns; and recent research shows a strong asymmetry between read and writeperformance. Moreover; flash storage devices behave unpredictably; showing a highdependence on previous IO history and usage patterns. In this paper we investigate how aDBMS can overcome these issues to take full advantage of flash memory as persistentstorage.

Decoupling contention management from scheduling,F Ryan Johnson; Radu Stoica; Anastasia Ailamaki; Todd C Mowry,Abstract Many parallel applications exhibit unpredictable communication between threads;leading to contention for shared objects. The choice of contention management strategyimpacts strongly the performance and scalability of these applications: spinning providesmaximum performance but wastes significant processor resources; while blocking-basedapproaches conserve processor resources but introduce high overheads on the critical pathof computation. Under situations of high or changing load; the operating system complicatesmatters further with arbitrary scheduling decisions which often preempt lock holders; leadingto long serialization delays until the preempted thread resumes execution. We observe thatcontention management is orthogonal to the problems of scheduling and load managementand propose to decouple them so each may be solved independently and effectively.

Improving OLTP scalability using speculative lock inheritance,Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Transaction processing workloads provide ample request level concurrency whichhighly parallel architectures can exploit. However; the resulting heavy utilization of coredatabase services also causes resource contention within the database engine itself andlimits scalability. Meanwhile; many database workloads consist of short transactions whichaccess only a few database records each; often with stringent response time requirements.Performance of these short transactions is determined largely by the amount of overhead thedatabase engine imposes for services such as logging; locking; and transactionmanagement. This paper highlights the negative scalability impact of database locking; aneffect which is especially severe for short transactions running on highly concurrentmulticore hardware.

TPC-E vs. TPC-C: characterizing the new TPC-E benchmark via an I/O comparison study,Shimin Chen; Anastasia Ailamaki; Manos Athanassoulis; Phillip B Gibbons; Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Radu Stoica,Abstract TPC-E is a new OLTP benchmark recently approved by the Transaction ProcessingPerformance Council (TPC). In this paper; we compare TPC-E with the familiar TPCCbenchmark in order to understand the behavior of the new TPC-E benchmark. In particular;we compare the I/O access patterns of the two benchmarks by analyzing two OLTP disktraces. We find that (i) TPC-E is more read intensive with a 9.7: 1 I/O read to write ratio; whileTPC-C sees a 1.9: 1 read-to-write ratio; and (ii) although TPC-E uses pseudo-realistic data;TPC-E's I/O access pattern is as random as TPC-C. The latter suggests that like TPC-C; TPC-E can benefit from SSDs; which have superior random I/O support. To verify this; we replayboth disk traces on an Intel X25-E SSD and see dramatic improvements for both TPC-C andTPC-E.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2011,51
To share or not to share?,Ryan Johnson; Stavros Harizopoulos; Nikos Hardavellas; Kivanc Sabirli; Ippokratis Pandis; Anastasia Ailamaki; Naju G Mancheril; Babak Falsafi,Abstract Intuitively; aggressive work sharing among concurrent queries in a databasesystem should always improve performance by eliminating redundant computation or dataaccesses. We show that; contrary to common intuition; this is not always the case in practice;especially in the highly parallel world of chip multiprocessors. As the number of cores in thesystem increases; a trade-off appears between exploiting work sharing opportunities and theavailable parallelism. To resolve the trade-off; we develop an analytical approach thatpredicts the effect of work sharing in multi-core systems. Database systems can use themodel to determine; statically or at runtime; whether work sharing is beneficial and apply itonly when appropriate. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First; we introduce andanalyze the effects of the trade-off between work sharing and parallelism on database …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,50

A new look at the roles of spinning and blocking,Ryan Johnson; Manos Athanassoulis; Radu Stoica; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Database engines face growing scalability challenges as core counts exponentiallyincrease each processor generation; and the efficiency of synchronization primitives used toprotect internal data structures is a crucial factor in overall database performance. The trade-offs between different implementation approaches for these primitives shift significantly withincreasing degrees of available hardware parallelism. Blocking synchronization; which haslong been the favored approach in database systems; becomes increasingly unattractive asgrowing core counts expose its bottlenecks. Spinning implementations improve peak systemthroughput by a factor of 2x or more for 64 hardware contexts; but suffer from poorperformance under load.

Carcinogenesis by cancer chemotherapeutic agents: Second malignancies complicating Hodgkin’s disease in remission,GP Canellos; VT De Vita; JC Arseneau; RC Johnson,Abstract It has been long known that in some types of malignant disease there exists anassociated propensity to develop other malignant tumors. Acute leukemia complicating thecourse of polycythemia vera and the increased incidence of skin cancer in chroniclymphocytic leukemia are well known (M odan; 1965; H yman; 1969). It has remainedenigmatic whether the disease renders the host more likely to develop second tumors orwhether the therapy itself in certain settings; is capable of inducing genetic changes whichsubsequently lead to malignant degeneration. The importance of second tumor inductionemerges only if the patient with advanced disease can survive; with treatment; long enoughto increase his risk. This is especially true in the atomic bomb radiation induced leukemiaswhere a latent period of over 5 years was required before an increased incidence of …,*,1974,31

Withenough threads in the system; some critical section will eventually become a bottleneck.While algorithmic changes are the only long-term solution; they tend to be complex andcostly to develop. Meanwhile; changes in enforcement of critical sections require much lesseffort. We observe that; in practice; many critical sections are so short that enforcing themcontributes a significant or even dominating fraction of their total cost and tuning themdirectly improves database system performance.

Even so; there is the danger that the results could be due to other factors such asthe geographical or regional variations in mortality. Hospitals in poor areas might have highmortality rates and might attract less able HR practitioners; the high flyers preferring to go tothe top teaching hospitals.

Eliminating unscalable communication in transaction processing,Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Multicore hardware demands software parallelism. Transaction processingworkloads typically exhibit high concurrency; and; thus; provide ample opportunities forparallel execution. Unfortunately; because of the characteristics of the application;transaction processing systems must moderate and coordinate communication betweenindependent agents; since it is notoriously difficult to implement high performing transactionprocessing systems that incur no communication whatsoever. As a result; transactionprocessing systems cannot always convert abundant; even embarrassing; request-levelparallelism into execution parallelism due to communication bottlenecks. Transactionprocessing system designers must therefore find ways to achieve scalability while stillallowing communication to occur.

Unfortunately; traditionalparallel spatial databases are ill-equipped to deal with the performance heterogeneity that iscommon in the Cloud. We introduce Niharika; a parallel spatial data analysis infrastructurethat exploits all available cores in a heterogeneous cluster. Niharika first uses a declusteringtechnique that creates balanced spatial partitions.

Scalable and dynamically balanced shared-everything OLTP with physiological partitioning,Pınar Tözün; Ippokratis Pandis; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Scaling the performance of shared-everything transaction processing systems tohighly parallel multicore hardware remains a challenge for database system designers.Recent proposals alleviate locking and logging bottlenecks in the system; leaving pagelatching as the next potential problem. To tackle the page latching problem; we proposephysiological partitioning (PLP). PLP applies logical-only partitioning; maintaining thedesired properties of sharedeverything designs; and introduces a multi-rooted B+ Tree indexstructure (MRBTree) that enables the partitioning of the accesses at the physical page level.Logical partitioning and MRBTrees together ensure that all accesses to a given index pagecome from a single thread and; hence; can be entirely latch free; an extended design makesheap page accesses thread private as well. Moreover; MRBTrees offer an infrastructure …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2013,20
Ammonia removal from air stream and biogas by a H2SO4 impregnated adsorbent originating from waste wood-shavings and biosolids,Xuejun Jack Guo; Jin Kwon Tak; Richard L Johnson,Abstract A new and cost-effective adsorbent N-TRAP; made from waste wood-shavings andanaerobically digestion biosolids and impregnated with H 2 SO 4; was applied for theammonia removal from air stream and biogas with high efficiency and effectiveness. Bearinga 75–80 and 65 wt.% sulfuric acid; the N-TRAPs mediated with wood shavings and biosolidsshowed the maximum ammonia adsorption capacity of 260–280 and 230 mg g− 1;respectively. Gas temperatures (20 and 60° C) and moisture content (100% relativehumidity) had no significantly negative effect on ammonia capture performance whentemperature in the fixed-bed column was kept equalled to or slightly above the feed gastemperature. The pressure drop increased significantly when NH 3 began to break throughthe N-TRAP stripper due to the formation of ammonium sulfate blocking the vacuum …,Journal of hazardous materials,2009,20
Ermia: Fast memory-optimized database system for heterogeneous workloads,Kangnyeon Kim; Tianzheng Wang; Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis,Abstract Large main memories and massively parallel processors have triggered not only aresurgence of high-performance transaction processing systems optimized for large main-memory and massively parallel processors; but also an increasing demand for processingheterogeneous workloads that include read-mostly transactions. Many modern transactionprocessing systems adopt a lightweight optimistic concurrency control (OCC) scheme toleverage its low overhead in low contention workloads. However; we observe that thelightweight OCC is not suitable for heterogeneous workloads; causing significant starvationof read-mostly transactions and overall performance degradation. In this paper; we presentERMIA; a memory-optimized database system built from scratch to cater the need ofhandling heterogeneous workloads.

Steal this Note: Proactive Intellectual Property Protection in the People's Republic of China,Ryan P Johnson,A brief anecdote circulating on the internet describes a recent photograph of a few pairs ofjeans seen in an Asian market.'All of the jeans visible in the photograph have the traditionalleather patch fastened at the waist on the back side of the pants; indicating each pair'sbrand. Two familiar trademarks are visible on jeans in the background; but the pair in theforeground of the image has an unfamiliar; indecipherable message printed on the leatherpatch. A glitch in a computer program caused a line of code to be printed on the patch; ratherthan a brand name. When functioning properly; this line of code was designed to tell aprinting machine which trademark to select from a virtual library of marks. The machinewould then repeatedly emblazon the trademark on pairs of newly minted" name brand"jeans. The ironic labeling malfunction described in this anecdote is a telling example of …,Conn. L.

Skew-resistant parallel in-memory spatial join,Suprio Ray; Bogdan Simion; Angela Demke Brown; Ryan Johnson,Abstract Spatial join is a crucial operation in many spatial analysis applications in scientificand geographical information systems. Due to the compute-intensive nature of spatialpredicate evaluation; spatial join queries can be slow even with a moderate sized dataset.Efficient parallelization of spatial join is therefore essential to achieve acceptableperformance for many spatial applications. Technological trends; including the rising corecount and increasingly large main memory; hold great promise in this regard. Previousparallel spatial join approaches tried to partition the dataset so that the number of spatialobjects in each partition was as equal as possible. They also focused only on the filter step.However; when the more compute-intensive refinement step is included; significantprocessing skew may arise due to the uneven size of the objects.

The literature is rife with justifications (orhopes) for the continued and necessary expansion of AFS in the face of unsustainableconventional food provisioning. Within the next five years it will be important to determinehow to make alternatives more stable in order for them to play a more prominent role inbattling the food insecurity and other social and economic challenges equated with agro-industrial foods.

However; today'shardware landscape is very different; and moving in directions that make databasemachines increasingly attractive. Stagnant clock speeds; looming dark silicon; availability ofreconfigurable hardware; and the economic clout of cloud providers all align to make customdatabase hardware economically viable or even necessary. Dataflow workloads (businessintelligence and streaming) already benefit from emerging hardware support.

Apparatus for spent catalyst treating for fluidized catalytic cracking systems,*,Apparatus for increasing the overall efficiency of fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) withcrystalline zeolitic catalysts is disclosed. Separated or spent cracking catalyst after reactionwith hydrocarbonaceous material is first stripped and then subjected to an additional periodof time in the presence of steam in the dense phase before the catalyst is returned to aregenerator. In a preferred form the spent catalyst after normal steam stripping is subjectedto an additional period from 1/2 to 30 minutes at elevated temperature. This time is from 6 to900 times the reaction time of the catalyst and hydrocarbonaceous mixture in an FCCreactor riser pipe. Such additional contact time for steam to react with the spent catalystand/or coke produces significant beneficial results in FCC performance.

As seen recently from the highperformance computing community; leveraging a GPU can yield performance increases ofseveral orders of magnitude. We propose using GPU acceleration to greatly speed up cloudmanagement tasks in VMMs. This is only becoming possible now that the GPU is moving on-chip; since the latency across the PCIe bus was too great to make fast; informed decisionsabout the state of a system at any given point. We explore various examples of cloudmanagement tasks that can greatly benefit from GPU acceleration. We also tackle toughquestions of how to manage this hardware in a multi-tenant system.

Structural evolution of platinum thin films grown by atomic layer deposition,Scott M Geyer; Rungthiwa Methaapanon; Richard Johnson; Sean Brennan; Mike F Toney; Bruce Clemens; Stacey Bent,The structural properties of Pt films grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are investigatedwith synchrotron based x-ray scattering and x-ray diffraction techniques. Using grazingincidence small angle scattering; we measure the lateral growth rate of the Pt islands to be1.0 Å/cycle. High resolution x-ray diffraction reveals that the in-plane strain of the Pt latticeundergoes a transition from compressive strain to tensile strain when the individual islandscoalescence into a continuous film. This transition to tensile strain is attributed to the lateralexpansion that occurs when neighboring islands merge to reduce their surface energy.Using 2D grazing incidence x-ray diffraction; we show that the lattice orientation becomesmore (111) oriented during deposition; with a sharp transition occurring during coalescence.Pt ALD performed at a lower deposition temperature (250° C) is shown to result in …,Journal of Applied Physics,2014,8
A data-oriented transaction execution engine and supporting tools,Ippokratis Pandis; Pinar Tözün; Miguel Branco; Dimitris Karampinas; Danica Porobic; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Conventional OLTP systems assign each transaction to a worker thread and thatthread accesses data; depending on what the transaction dictates. This thread-to-transactionwork assignment policy leads to unpredictable accesses. The unpredictability forces eachthread to enter a large number of critical sections for the completion of even the simplest ofthe transactions; leading to poor performance and scalability on modern manycorehardware. This demonstration highlights the chaotic access patterns of conventional OLTPdesigns which are the source of scalability problems. Then; it presents a working prototypeof a transaction processing engine that follows a non-conventional architecture; called data-oriented or DORA.

Overcoming barriers to scaling up sustainable alternative food systems: A comparative case study of two ontario-based wholesale produce auctions,Rylea Johnson; Evan DG Fraser; Roberta Hawkins,Abstract: Conventional food systems are viewed by the literature as unsustainable in thatthey provide consumers with convenience while disconnecting them from producers thusleading to environmental and social problems. By contrast; sustainable or “alternative” foodsystems are viewed as correcting such problems. Wholesale produce auctions; which arewell established in the Old Order Mennonite community; are physical sites where largequantities of produce are sold through a competitive bidding process to local buyers. Theseare seen as a way of better connecting producers and consumers and thus realizing a moresustainable food system. However; this potential has not been tested. Therefore; this paperexplores two produce auctions in southwestern Ontario; Canada; using an interview basedmethodology (N= 48) and demonstrates that despite wholesale produce auctions offering …,Sustainability,2016,6

The price of generality in spatial indexing,Bogdan Simion; Daniel N Ilha; Angela Demke Brown; Ryan Johnson,Abstract Efficient indexing can significantly speed up the processing of large volumes ofspatial data in many BigData applications. Many new emerging spatial applications (eg;biomedical imaging; genome analysis; etc.) have varying indexing requirements; thus; aunified indexing infrastructure for implementing new indexing schemes without requiringknowledge of database internals is beneficial. However; designing a generic indexingframework is a challenging task. We study the issues with general indexing schemes; suchas the GiST (used in PostGIS) and expose the tradeoff between generality and performance;showing that generality can be severely detrimental to performance if the abstractions arenot carefully designed. Our experiments indicate that the GiST framework; as implementedin PostgreSQL/PostGIS; performs 4.5-6x slower for filtering records through the index …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Analytics for Big Geospatial Data,2013,5

Toward scalable transaction processing: evolution of shore-MT,Anastasia Ailamaki; Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Pínar Tözün,Abstract Designing scalable transaction processing systems on modern multicore hardwarehas been a challenge for almost a decade. The typical characteristics of transactionprocessing workloads lead to a high degree of unbounded communication on multicores forconventional system designs. In this tutorial; we initially present a systematic way ofeliminating scalability bottlenecks of a transaction processing system; which is based onminimizing the unbounded communication. Then; we show several techniques that applythe presented methodology to minimize logging; locking; latching etc. related bottlenecks oftransaction processing systems. In parallel; we demonstrate the internals of the Shore-MTstorage manager and how they have evolved over the years in terms of scalability onmulticore hardware through such techniques. We also teach how to use Shore-MT with …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,4
The market for retail certificates of deposit: Explaining interest rates,Raymond M Johnson; David R Lange; Joseph A Newman,Abstract Retail certificates of deposit provide financial institutions with funds and depositorswith income. Because interest rates and terms on deposits vary; understanding the reasonsfor the variation should help participants in this market make better decisions. This studyexplores interest rates and terms on deposit offerings from banks and thrifts while controllingfor risk; service; and demographics. Results suggest that less than perfect market efficiencyexists to the extent that institutions paying lower interest rates without offering other benefitsmay still obtain deposits; and depositors may improve returns and receive other benefits bycomparing rates.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT],Financial Services Review,2008,4

Efficiently making (almost) any concurrency control mechanism serializable,Tianzheng Wang; Ryan Johnson; Alan Fekete; Ippokratis Pandis,Abstract Concurrency control (CC) algorithms must trade off strictness for performance. Inparticular; serializable CC schemes generally pay higher cost to prevent anomalies; both inruntime overhead such as the maintenance of lock tables and in efforts wasted by abortingtransactions. We propose the serial safety net (SSN); a serializability-enforcing certifierwhich can be applied on top of various CC schemes that offer higher performance but admitanomalies; such as snapshot isolation and read committed. The underlying CC mechanismretains control of scheduling and transactional accesses; while SSN tracks the resultingdependencies. At commit time; SSN performs a validation test by examining only directdependencies of the committing transaction to determine whether it can commit safely ormust abort to avoid a potential dependency cycle. SSN performs robustly for a variety of …,The VLDB Journal,2017,3

These systems leverage spacious main memory to fit the whole workingset in DRAM with streamlined; memoryfriendly data structures; further; optimizations formulticore and multi-socket hardware allow a much higher level of parallelism compared toconventional database systems. With disk overheads and delays removed; transactionlatencies drop precipitously and worker threads can usually execute transactions tocompletion without in-terruption. The result is a welcome reduction in contention and lesspressure on whatever concurrency control (CC) scheme might be in place.

An analysis of database system performance on chip multiprocessors,Nikos Hardavellas; Ippokratis Pandis; Ryan Johnson; Naju Mancheril; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,ABSTRACT Prior research shows that database system performance is dominated by off-chip data stalls; resulting in a concerted effort to bring data into on-chip caches. At the sametime; high levels of integration have enabled the advent of chip multiprocessors andincreasingly large (and slow) on-chip caches. These two trends pose the imminent technicaland research challenge of adapting high-performance data management software to ashifting hardware landscape. In this paper we characterize the performance of a commercialdatabase server running on emerging chip multiprocessor technologies. We find that themajor bottleneck of current software is data cache stalls; with L2 hit stalls rising from oblivionto become the dominant execution time component in some cases. We analyze the sourceof this shift and derive a list of features for future database designs to attain maximum …,*,2007,1

Verification of process structures of interacting digital systems,RT Johnson; DR Fitzwater,ABSTRACT A formal; universe for systems design has been developed; in whichrepresentations of interacting digital; systems are interpreted by a deterministic automatonacting on state information in the form of character strings. Since process structures in thisuniverse can be described with regular languages; a new interpretation is defined in whichregular languages represent state information. Computations under this new interpretationcontain the previous ones (with some loss of detail); making it possible to prove assertionsabout the original string computations. An example is given to show the formulation; andalgorithmic verification; of some interesting properties of two asynchronous communicatingsystems.,IEEE Computer Group Automated Logic Design,1973,1

Transaction Logging Unleashed with NVRAM,Tianzheng Wang; Ryan Johnson,Most single node database systems such as PostgreSQL use centralized write-aheadlogging [4]: log records are first buffered in DRAM and then flushed to stable storage uponcommit to ensure durability and consistency. On today's massively parallel hardware;however; this single log buffer design has become a bottleneck: as shown in Figure 1; on a 4-socket; 24-core server with hyperthreading (the OS sees 48 “CPUs”) logging graduallybecame the worst bottleneck with increasing parallelism:∼ 45% of the CPU cycles are spenton contending for the log buffer (in green color). In this paper; we advocate using byte-addressable; non-volatile memory (NVRAM) as log buffers. The non-volatility andbyteaddressability of NVRAM resurrect distributed logging—a once prohibitive technique forsingle node systems—to scale databases on modern hardware. We discuss the …,*,*,1

Pairing continuous authentication with proactive platform hardening,Ryan Johnson; Rahul Murmuria; Angelos Stavrou; Vincent Sritapan,Mobile authentication has always been a usability and security challenge. In the past;researchers have discovered various methods to bypass the screen lock protectionmechanism without entering authentication credentials on mobile devices. There is a clearneed for authentication to be seamless and continuous but also address the security threatsthat stem from the current unlock-once; always-on mechanisms. To that end; we developeda framework for continuous behavioral authentication of users. In addition; we introduce aconfigurable “authentication level” for access to resources and applications. For example; ifa user's authentication level declines below a pre-specified threshold; all externalcommunications are disabled to prevent exfiltration of sensitive data. Similarly; viewing ormodifying any sensitive data on the device is also restricted by moderating access to the …,Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops); 2017 IEEE International Conference on,2017,*

Query Fresh: Log Shipping on Steroids,Tianzheng Wang; Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis,ABSTRACT Hot standby systems often have to trade safety (ie; not losing committed work)and freshness (ie; having access to recent updates) for performance. Guaranteeing safetyrequires synchronous log shipping that blocks the primary until the log records are durablyreplicated in one or multiple backups; maintaining freshness necessitates fast log replay onbackups; but is often defeated by the dual-copy architecture and serial replay: a backupmust generate the “real” data from the log to make recent updates accessible to read-onlyqueries. This paper proposes Query Fresh; a hot standby system that provides both safetyand freshness while maintaining high performance on the primary. The crux is an append-only storage architecture used in conjunction with fast networks (eg; InfiniBand) andbyteaddressable; non-volatile memory (NVRAM).

Fighting back: using observability tools to improve the DBMS (not just diagnose it),Ryan Johnson,Abstract Observability tools increase the transparency of the system and help practitionersidentify a wide variety of bugs and bottlenecks. In this paper we claim that such tools(DTrace; in our case) can play a much more active role: the same features which alloweffective; but largely passive; measurement also have the potential to provide a powerful toolfor actively improving the system. This capability proves particularly useful with databaseengines; which have complexity approaching that of operating systems but are neverthelesshosted by--and often impeded by--an underlying OS. We illustrate our point with several non-traditional use cases for DTrace where the DBMS and OS communicate; leading to elegantsolutions for OS-DBMS interaction problems that are otherwise difficult to solve.,Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Testing Database Systems,2012,*

Although GDSPs areused widely; and are generally perceived as useful; there is too little empirical evidence toassess the value of GDSPs to the warfighter. Achieving a better understanding of thepotential value of GDSPs while they are still in development would help to prioritize scarceintellectual; physical; and monetary resources; and would result in having the most valuableGDSPs available to the warfighter. General experimental methods are well understood andhave been used recently to evaluate GDSPs during development (eg; Powell et al.; 2009).However; it can take considerable time and effort to recruit the type and number ofparticipants required to conduct experiments with adequate statistical power.

An evaluation of various methods for tracing the propagation of electromagnetic energy through the atmosphere,Randall Johnson,Electromagnetic energy emitted by radar bends as it propagates through the atmospherebecause the index of refraction of the atmosphere is not constant. Variations in the index ofrefraction are primarily caused by local changes in temperature and humidity. The manner inwhich electromagnetic ray paths bend in various atmospheric environments is of particularinterest to groups involved with the use of radar for risk mitigation associated with unmannedaircraft system operations. Radar can be used to detect a majority of targets entering anunmanned aircraft operations area by detecting reflected electromagnetic energy. Thedetection and accurate determination of the locations of these targets is enabling to collisionavoidance.

Improving OLTP concurrency through Early Lock Release,Manos Athanassoulis; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki; Radu Stoica,ABSTRACT Since the beginning of the multi-core era; database systems research hasrestarted focusing on increasing concurrency. Even though database systems have beenable to accommodate concurrent requests; the exploding number of available cores per chiphas surfaced new difficulties. More and more transactions can be served in parallel (sincemore threads can run simultaneously) and; thus; concurrency in a database system is moreimportant than ever in order to exploit the available resources. In this paper; we evaluateEarly Lock Release (ELR); a technique that allows early release of locks to improveconcurrency level and overall throughput in OLTP. This technique has been proven to leadto a database system that can produce correct and recoverable histories but it has neverbeen implemented in a full scale DBMS.

Changes in land use and/orclimate of this landscape can have significant impacts on amphibian communities. Weexamine the potential impacts of wetland loss on N. leopard frog population viability undertwo temperature and moisture regimes. A wetland model (WETLANDSCAPE) was used tosimulate the impacts of climate change on two main drivers of biodiversity across the PPR:the cover cycle of semi-permanent wetlands and the hydrological conditions of wetlandcomplexes. We combined this modeling approach with extensive wetland field surveys ofamphibian communities to predict the range of responses expected across this region. Lossof wetlands in the western PPR and changes in their hydrologic regime are predicted to …,*,2008,*
Optimal Combinations of the Current Accounts: A Solver Application,A Lee Gurley; Raymond M Johnson; Joseph A Newman,Abstract This paper provides a methodology and a pedagogical template for the discovery ofthe optimal combination of a firm's inventory; accounts receivable; and other current assetsthrough the utilization of Excel's Solver. As for an application of the methodology; relevantdata taken from Starbuck's annual reports for the years of 1998-2007 are utilized.Optimization; as determined by Excel's Solver; is a combination of current accountsconsistent with the portfolio's minimum variance. A three–asset portfolio is created byconsidering accounts receivable; inventory; and collectively all other current assets. Theweights associated with each asset component are determined initially on the basis of whatprevailed during the 1998-2006 time period. Solver's optimization process is then utilized todetermine the minimum variance for these categories and the weights consistent with the …,Compiled and Edited by: Vivek Bhargava; Alcorn State University Co-editor: Steve Wells; Western Kentucky University Editorial Assistant,2008,*
What is electronic contact lens?,R Colin Johnson,Abstract Electronic contact lenses promise to overlay a heads-up display over a user's visualfield; enabling tactical information-like an automobile speedometer for drivers-to be seenonly by the wearer. Researchers at the University of Washington (Seattle) recentlydemonstrated the world's first electronic contact lens; complete with integrated light-emitting-diodes. So far the researchers have only completed animal testing on unpowered lenses;but for the upcoming human trials the researchers hope to power a virtual control panel thatenables the display to appear to float in mid-air. Future applications could give military usersvirtual heads-up displays; give video gamers" anywhere" action; and let any contact-lenswearer surf the Internet sans monitor.,ACM SIGDA Newsletter,2008,*

Steal This Note: Proactive Intellectual Property Protection in the People's Republic of China,Ryan P Johnson,A brief anecdote circulating on the Internet describes a recent photograph of a few pairs ofjeans seen in an Asian market.'All of the jeans visible in the photograph have the traditionalleather patch fastened at the waist on the back side of the pants; indicating each pair'sbrand. Two familiar trademarks are visible on jeans in the background; but the pair in theforeground of the image has an unfamiliar; indecipherable message printed on the leatherpatch. A glitch in a computer program caused a line of code to be printed on the patch; ratherthan a brand name. When functioning properly; this line of code was designed to tell aprinting machine which trademark to select from a virtual library of marks. The machinewould then repeatedly emblazon the trademark on pairs of newly minted" name brand"jeans. The ironic labeling malfunction described in this anecdote is a telling example of …,J.

A deal of time and effort,Rob Johnson,Any purchaser worth his salt knows that what goes on behind the scenes - the managementof a supplier that comes after the deal - is fundamental if organisations are to achieve real benefitfrom their purchasing strategies. It is not enough for organisations to draft a first-class agreementwith a top supplier and simply sit back and expect the medium to long-term benefits to rollin.Supplier management is the catalyst for organisations to acquire products or services thatmeet or exceed their expectations to give them competitive advantage. However; it should notbe restricted to the post contractual phase of supplier relationships. Effective management ofsuppliers during the sourcing and contracting process will normally produce a much betterresult; owing to the buyer clearly communicating their expectations and in turn demanding agreater insight into a supplier's infrastructure and capabilities.,Supply Management,2003,*

''A Wavelet Optimized Adaptive; High-Order; Multi-Domain Method for Parallel Architectures'',LM Jameson; JR Johnson; JS Hesthaven,Constructing numerical schemes which are both adaptive and suitable for parallelarchitectures is very challenging. The challenge lies in the need to maintain a balanced loadacross the processing elements using a method that is both efficient and scalable. Here wepropose a method which is adaptive; load balanced; absolutely efficient and scalableoffering significant speedup over lower order adaptive schemes. The ability of wavelets toaccurately and efficiently represent functions with localized features has spawned intensiveresearch into applying wavelets for the solution of partial differential equations with thepromise of significantly reducing the necessary computational effort and memoryrequirements. Traditionally; this effort has been centered around using wavelets as anorthogonal and complete basis; spanning a space in which to seek approximate solutions …,*,2001,*

In addition; a careful readingof this book by economic and government planners; finance ministers; and other worldleaders rnay provide insights that could assist them in avoiding similar and subsequentoccurrences. The initial diagnosis of the Asian crisis was to attribute it exclusively to anexchange rate problem; governments were accused of trying to maintain unrealistic fixedexchange rates for too long.

Simultaneously; non-genetic factors are also strongly impacting on addictive states; however their nature remainscontroversial. The patterns of familial aggregation propose the operation of multiple genes.Major progress in specifying genes contributing to addiction can be expected from thegrowing knowledge and developing methods emerging from the human genome project.Currently; besides the big COGA study searching for linkage in alcoholism by a genomescan approach; the candidate gene approach is widely used and produced the firstsusceptibility genes involved in ethanol metabolization. Furthermore; the candidate geneapproach stimulated also receptor ligand studies related to addiction. Thus; we are …,European Addiction Research,2000,*

Signals from spacecraft at planetary distances arrive at Earthwith poor S/N ratio. To reduce errors; the signals are encoded with an inner code of Viterbiencoding. One of the key parameters of Viterbi encoding is the constraint length. Previousspace missions have used a constraint length of 7. Newer missions use 15; to give aconsiderably improved error correction ability. However; the complexity of the Viterbidecoder is increased so as to be 256 times more complex.,*,1996,*

BionicDB: A Custom Hardware Approach Towards Fast and Power-Efficient Transaction Processing,Kangnyeon Kim; Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis,ABSTRACT With the rise of dark silicon; specialization has been considered as a promisingalternative to general-purpose hardware for certain range of applications; ushering inheterogeneous computing paradigm. Meanwhile; several recent trends are converging toeliminate the barriers to custom hardware deployment; allowing it to be both technologicallyand economically feasible. Considering the opportunities and challenges from the recenthardware landscape; we describe the design and implementation of BionicDB; a customhardware for online transaction processing (OLTP) that can be built on field programmablegate array (FPGA). With the majority of transaction components offloaded; BionicDBperforms as fast as state-of-the-art databases running on high-end CPUs with an order ofmagnitude lower power footprint; thanks to its highly OLTP-optimized hardware design.

PARTICIPATIVE MODELING AND PUBLIC POLICY: THE CASE OF AMERICAN WELFARE REFORM,Aldo A Zagonel; David F Andersen; Robert Johnson; John Rohrbaugh; George P Richardson,Approaches to systems thinking; strategic planning; decision analysis; decision support; anddecision conferencing are increasingly coming to rely upon the practice of building modelsdirectly with management teams and decision-making groups (Zagonel 2002). Theobjectives of these researchers and practitioners are manifold; ranging from improvinggroup decision-making processes to enhancing group; team and organizationaleffectiveness and productivity (Andersen et al. 1997). The importance of involving the clientsin the process of model building has been recognized early on in the field of systemdynamics (Forrester 1961; Roberts 1978). Stenberg (1980) first introduced the practice ofdrawing upon a reference group; as a “mini-universe of the part of the real world understudy”(p. 303).

Factory Resets and Obtaining Notifications on Samsung Android Devices,Ryan Johnson; Angelos Stavrou,ABSTRACT We have identified software vulnerabilities present in two different system appsin multiple Samsung Android releases. The two vulnerabilities expose systemic problemswith the inadequacy of testing for pre-loaded vendor applications. The vulnerable systemapps are persistent and cannot be disabled or uninstalled by the user unless the user hasroot privileges on the device. The first vulnerability can be manipulated to programmaticallyinitiate a factory reset of certain devices from a zero-permission Android app. During afactory reset; the user would most likely lose application data; photos; videos; text messages;and anything else that is not synced or backed up to a separate device. The attack is testedto be successful for certain Android 5.0. 2 and 5.1. 1 releases for the following SamsungGalaxy devices: S6; S6 Edge; S6 Edge+; and Note 5.

14TH INTERNATIONAL COMMAND AND CONTROL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY SYMPOSIUM C2 AND AGILITY,Kathryn Blackmond Laskey-GMU; Leonard Adelman-GMU; Daniel Visone-TEC; Kenneth Braswell-TEC,Abstract How does the underlying data affect the ability of warfighters to derive usefulinformation and make decisions? The Army Topographic Engineering Center (TEC) andGMU endeavor to shed light on this question with the third in TEC's series of valueexperiments. The fundamental objective of the series is to improve TEC's support of militarypersonnel in the field through better geospatial products. The third experiment in the seriesgoes in a different direction from the previous two experiments; which were presented at the12th and 13th ICCRTS. Whereas previous experiments assessed the value of cutting-edgegeospatial tools while keeping the data constant; the present experiment evaluated theeffect of higher resolution imagery and elevation data while keeping the tools constant.

From Saving to Investing: An Examination of Risk in Companies with Direct Stock Purchase Plans that Pay Dividends,Raymond M Johnson; Joseph A Newman,Abstract Low interest rates force savers to become investors if they want higher returns.Whereas average savings rates paid by commercial banks in the United States haveaveraged near zero; dividend rates paid on stock can approach five percent annually. Directstock purchase plans offer an inexpensive way for savers to become investors and earnhigher returns from dividends. This study examined the extent to which savers would have toexcept higher risk for higher dividends. Using three different measures of risk; this studyfinds evidence to suggest that investors do not have to accept higher risk to earn higherdividends.,*,*,*

Expected return should come from historical relationships betweenmeasures of return and risk. Stock reports contain historical measures of return by showingthe total dollar accumulation of a $10;000 investment over the past five years; and historicalmeasures of risk in the form of valuations compared to market; company size; stability ofearnings and dividends; stock price volatilities; and betas. This study compared the totalreturn for companies to these risk measures. Regressions results show that the riskmeasures explained very little of total stock return; although valuation compared to market …,*,*,*

An Analysis of Research Accelerator for Multiple Processors (RAMP) Gold,Revarr Johnson; Andrew Waterman; Krste Asanovic,Abstract: Concerning the transition to multicore microprocessing; we argue that FPGAArchitecture Model Execution (FAME) simulators can increase the number of usefularchitecture research experiments per day by over a factor of 1000 verses SoftwareArchitecture Model Execution (SAME) simulators. To validate this claim; studies are made onRAMP Gold; a FAME simulator focusing on the speed up curve and scalability as thenumbers of cores are increased. Computer architects have long used software simulators toexplore instruction set architectures; microarchitectures; and approaches to implementation.Compared to hardware prototyping; their low capital cost; relatively low-cost ofimplementation and ease of change have made them the ideal choice in the early stages ofresearch exploration. Architects can explore many variations of a design simply by …,*,*,*

Thread Scheduling For Shared Caches ECE 742 Final Project Report,Yevgen Voronenko; Ryan Johnson,Abstract—Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) processors and chip multiprocessors (CMP)with shared caches usually require a primary cache increase by a factor proportional to thenumber of execution contexts to retain the cache performance of the uniprocessor. In thispaper we study depth-first task scheduling; which was recently shown to reduce the numberof cache misses when a single multithreaded application is executed. Intuitively; a depth-firstscheduler attempts to exploit the memory locality inherent in the application by schedulinghighly related threads at the same time. We collected memory traces for severalmultithreaded scientific applications that use fork/join parallelism; and perform post-mortemscheduling using three different schedulers. We show that for standard codes; which arewritten with relatively coarse thread granularity; all schedulers perform equally …,*,*,*
