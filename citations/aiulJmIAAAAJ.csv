Web Modeling Language (WebML): a modeling language for designing Web sites,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Aldo Bongio,Abstract Designing and maintaining Web applications is one of the major challenges for thesoftware industry of the year 2000. In this paper we present Web Modeling Language(WebML); a notation for specifying complex Web sites at the conceptual level. WebMLenables the high-level description of a Web site under distinct orthogonal dimensions: itsdata content (structural model); the pages that compose it (composition model); the topologyof links between pages (navigation model); the layout and graphic requirements for pagerendering (presentation model); and the customization features for one-to-one contentdelivery (personalization model). All the concepts of WebML are associated with a graphicnotation and a textual XML syntax. WebML specifications are independent of both the client-side language used for delivering the application to users; and of the server-side platform …,Computer Networks,2000,1378

What you always wanted to know about Datalog (and never dared to ask),Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Datalog; a database query language based on the logic programming paradigm; isdescribed. The syntax and semantics of Datalog and its use for querying a relationaldatabase are presented. Optimization methods for achieving efficient evaluations of Datalogqueries are classified; and the most relevant methods are presented. Various improvementsof Datalog currently under study are discussed; and what is still needed in order to extendDatalog's applicability to the solution of real-life problems is indicated.,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1989,636
Deriving production rules for incremental view maintenance,Stefano Ceri; Jennifer Widom,It is widely recognized that production rules in database systems can be used toautomatically maintain derived data such as views. However; writing a correct set of rules foreffciently maintaining a given view can be a diffcult and ad-hoc process. We provide a facilitywhereby a user defines a view as an SQL select expression; from which the systemautomatically derives set-oriented production rules that maintain a materialization of thatview. The maintenance rules are triggered by operations on the view's base tables.Generally; the rules perform incremental maintenance: the materialized view is modifiedaccording to the sets of changes made to the base tables; which are accessible throughlogical tables provided by the rule language. However; for some operations substantialrecomputation may be required. We give algorithms that; based on key information …,*,1991,540
Deriving production rules for constraint maintenance,Stefano Ceri; Jennifer Widom,Traditionally; integrity constraints in database systems are maintained either by rolling backany transaction that produces an inconsistent state or by disallowing or modifying operationsthat may produce an inconsistent state. An alternative approach is to provide automatic"repair" of inconsistent states using production rules. For each constraint; a production rule isused to detect constraint violation and to initiate database operations that restoreconsistency. We describe an SQL-based language for defining integrity constraints and aframework for translating these constraints into constraint-maintaining production rules.Some parts of the translation are automatic while other parts require user intervention.Based on the semantics of our set-oriented production rules language and under certainassumptions; we prove that at the end of each transaction the rules are guaranteed to …,*,1990,509
Vertical partitioning algorithms for database design,Shamkant Navathe; Stefano Ceri; Gio Wiederhold; Jinglie Dou,Abstract This paper addresses the vertical partitioning of a set of logical records or a relationinto fragments. The rationale behind vertical partitioning is to produce fragments; groups ofattribute columns; that “closely match” the requirements of transactions. Vertical partitioningis applied in three contexts: a database stored on devices of a single type; a database storedin different memory levels; and a distributed database. In a two-level memory hierarchy;most transactions should be processed using the fragments in primary memory. Indistributed databases; fragment allocation should maximize the amount of local transactionprocessing. Fragments may be nonoverlapping or overlapping. A two-phase approach forthe determination of fragments is proposed; in the first phase; the design is driven byempirical objective functions which do not require specific cost information. The second …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1984,506
Workflow evolution,Fabio Casati; Stefano Ceri; Barbara Pernici; Giuseppe Pozzi,Abstract A basic step towards flexibility in workflow systems is the consistent and effectivemanagement of workflow evolution; ie of changing existing workflows while they areoperational. One of the most challenging issue is the handling of running instances whentheir schemata are modified: simple solutions can be devised; but they often imply losing allthe work done or failing in capturing the advantages offered by workflow modifications; thisis unacceptable for many applications. In this paper we address the problem of workflowevolution; from both a static and a dynamic point of view. We define a complete; minimal;and consistent set of modification primitives that allow modifications of workflow schemataand we introduce a taxonomy of policies to manage evolution of running instances when thecorresponding workflow schema is modified.

A new SQL-like operator for mining association rules,Rosa Meo; Giuseppe Psaila; Stefano Ceri,Abstract Data mining evolved as a collection of applicative problems and efficient solutionalgorithms relative to rather peculiar problems; all focused on the discovery of relevantinformation hidden in databases of huge dimensions. In particular; one of the mostinvestigated topics is the discovery of association rules. This work proposes a unifyingmodel that enables a uniform description of the problem of discovering association rules.The model provides SQL-like operator; named MINE RULE; which is capable of expressingall the problems presented so far in the literature concerning the mining of association rules.We demonstrate the expressive power of the new operator by means of several examples;some of which are classical; while some others are fully original and correspond to noveland unusual applications. We also present the operational semantics of the operator by …,VLDB,1996,420
XML-GL: a graphical language for querying and restructuring XML documents1,Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Ernesto Damiani; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The growing acceptance of XML as a standard for semi-structured documents onthe Web opens up challenging opportunities for Web query languages. In this paper weintroduce XML-GL; a graphical query language for XML documents. The use of a visualformalism for representing both the content of XML documents (and of their DTDs) and thesyntax and semantics of queries enables an intuitive expression of queries; even when theyare rather complex. XML-GL is inspired by G-log; a general purpose; logic-based languagefor querying structured and semi-structured data. The paper presents the basic capabilitiesof XML-GL through a sequence of examples of increasing complexity.,Computer networks,1999,405
Comparative analysis of five XML query languages,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri,Abstract XML is becoming the most relevant new standard for data representation andexchange on the WWW. Novel languages for extracting and restructuring the XML contenthave been proposed; some in the tradition of database query languages (ie SQL; OQL);others more closely inspired by XML. No standard for XML query language has yet beendecided; but the discussion is ongoing within the World Wide Web Consortium and withinmany academic institutions and Internet-related major companies. We present a comparisonof five; representative query languages for XML; highlighting their common features anddifferences.,ACM Sigmod Record,2000,353
Specification and implementation of exceptions in workflow management systems,Fabio Casati; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi; Guiseppe Pozzi,Abstract Although workflow management systems are most applicable when an organizationfollows standard business processes and routines; any of these processes faces the needfor handling exceptions; ie; asynchronous and anomalous situations that fall outside thenormal control flow. In this paper we concentrate upon anomalous situtations that; althoughunusual; are part of the semantics of workflow applications; and should be specified andmonitored coherently; in most real-life applications; such exceptions affect a significantfraction of workflow cases. However; very few workflow management systems are integratedwith a highly expressive language for specifying this kind of exception and with a systemcomponent capable of handling it.

Designing data marts for data warehouses,Angela Bonifati; Fabiano Cattaneo; Stefano Ceri; Alfonso Fuggetta; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Data warehouses are databases devoted to analytical processing. They are used tosupport decision-making activities in most modern business settings; when complex datasets have to be studied and analyzed. The technology for analytical processing assumesthat data are presented in the form of simple data marts; consisting of a well-identifiedcollection of facts and data analysis dimensions (star schema). Despite the wide diffusion ofdata warehouse technology and concepts; we still miss methods that help and guide thedesigner in identifying and extracting such data marts out of an enterprisewide informationsystem; covering the upstream; requirement-driven stages of the design process.

Horizontal data partitioning in database design,Stefano Ceri; Mauro Negri; Giuseppe Pelagatti,Abstract In this paper the problem of horizontally partitioning data on a set of resources isconsidered. The main optimization parameter is the number of accesses performed by theapplication programs to different portions of data. The concepts which are required for thedetermination of relevant portions of data are defined and a methodology for determining theaccess parameters is proposed. The formulation of the general partitioning problem in 3specific application environments is shown: distributed database design; file partitioning ona primary and a secondary memory and data distribution on different devices. It is shownthat the analytical models of these specific applications use the parameters of the generalformulation.,Proceedings of the 1982 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,1982,259
Conceptual modeling of workflows,Fabio Casati; Stefano Ceri; Barbara Pernici; Giuseppe Pozzi,Abstract Workflow management is emerging as a challenging area for databases; stressingdatabase technology beyond its current capabilities. Workflow management systems needto be more integrated with data management technology; in particular as it concerns theaccess to external databases. Thus; a convergence between workflow management anddatabases is occurring. In order to make such convergence effective; however; it is requiredto improve and strengthen the specification of workflows at the conceptual level; byformalizing within a unique model their “internal behavior”(eg interaction and cooperationbetween tasks); their relationship to the environment (eg the assignment of work task toagents) and the access to external databases. The conceptual model presented in thispaper is a basis for achieving convergence of workflows and databases; the workflow …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1995,253

It's a streaming world!

Sim- ilarly; the problem of changing vocabularies and evolving ontologies has undergonethorough inves- tigation; but here the standard practice relies on configuration managementtechniques taken from software engineering; such as vocabulary and on- tology versioning. Theseare suitable for ontologies that change on a weekly or monthly basis; but not forhigh-change-rate; high-frequency domains.

Integrating object-oriented data modelling with a rule-based programming paradigm,Filippo Cacace; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Crespi-Reghizzi; Letizia Tanca; Roberto Zicari,Abstract LOGRES is a new project for the development of extended database systems whichis based on the integration of the object-oriented data modelling paradigm and of the rule-based approach for the specification of queries and updates. The data model supportsgeneralization hierarchies and object sharing; the rule-based language extends Datalog tosupport generalized type constructors (sets; multisets; and sequences); rule-based integrityconstraints are automatically produced by analyzing schema definitions. Modularization is afundamental feature; as modules encapsulate queries and updates; when modules areapplied to a LOGRES database; their side effects can be controlled. The LOGRES project isa follow-up of the ALGRES project; and takes advantage of the ALGRES programmingenvironment for the development of a fast prototype.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1990,216

Distribution design of logical database schemas,Stefano Ceri; Shamkant Navathe; Gio Wiederhold,The optimal distribution of a database schema over a number of sites in a distributednetwork is considered. The database is modeled in terms of objects (relations or record sets)and links (predefined joins or CODASYL sets). The design is driven by user-suppliedinformation about data distribution. The inputs required by the optimization model are: 1)cardinality and size information about objects and links; 2) a set of candidate horizontalpartitions of relations into fragments and the allocations of the fragments; and 3) thespecification of all important transactions; their frequencies; and their sites of origin.,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,1983,206

Automatic generation of production rules for integrity maintenance,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this article we present an approach to integrity maintenance; consisting ofautomatically generating production rules for integrity enforcement. Constraints areexpressed as particular formulas of Domain Relational Calculus; they are automaticallytranslated into a set of repair actions; encoded as production rules of an active databasesystem. Production rules may be redundant (they enforce the same constraint in differentways) and conflicting (because repairing one constraint may cause the violation of anotherconstraint). Thus; it is necessary to develop techniques for analyzing the properties of the setof active rules and for ensuring that any computation of production rules after any incorrecttransaction terminates and produces a consistent database state. Along these guidelines;we describe a specific architecture for constraint definition and enforcement. The …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1994,202

With the success of the modeling and transformationparadigm; the need arises to address more complex applications that require a directmanipulation of model transformations. The uniformity and flexibility of the model-drivenparadigm allows this class of applications to make use of the same transformationinfrastructure. This is possible because transformations can be translated into transformationmodels and given as objects to a different class of model transformations; called Higher-Order Transformations (HOT).

Most online trading and e-commerce sites fall into thiscategory; as do digital libraries and institutional sites describing private and publicorganizations. Several commercial Web development systems aid rapid creation of data-intensive applications by supporting semiautomatic data resource publishing. Automaticpublishing is typically subject to the constraints of database schemas; which limit anapplication designer's choices.

Model-driven design and deployment of service-enabled web applications,Ioana Manolescu; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali,Abstract Significant effort is currently invested in application integration; enabling businessprocesses of different companies to interact and form complex multiparty processes. Webservice standards; based on WSDL (Web Service Definition Language); have been adoptedas process-to-process communication paradigms. However; the conceptual modeling ofapplications using Web services has not yet been addressed. Interaction with Web servicesis often specified at the level of the source code; thus; Web service interfaces are buriedwithin a programmatic specification. In this article; we argue that Web services should beconsidered first-class citizens in the specification of Web applications. Thus; service-enabledWeb applications should benefit from the high-level modeling and automatic codegeneration techniques that have long been advocated for Web application design and …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2005,141

Incremental reasoning on streams and rich background knowledge,Davide Francesco Barbieri; Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract This article presents a technique for Stream Reasoning; consisting in incrementalmaintenance of materializations of ontological entailments in the presence of streaminginformation. Previous work; delivered in the context of deductive databases; describes theuse of logic programming for the incremental maintenance of such entailments. Ourcontribution is a new technique that exploits the nature of streaming data in order toefficiently maintain materialized views of RDF triples; which can be used by a reasoner. Byadding expiration time information to each RDF triple; we show that it is possible to computea new complete and correct materialization whenever a new window of streaming dataarrives; by dropping explicit statements and entailments that are no longer valid; and thencomputing when the RDF triples inserted within the window will expire. We provide …,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2010,131
Practical applications of triggers and constraints: Success and lingering issues,Stefano Ceri; Roberta Cochrane; Jennifer Widom,From about the mid-1980's to the mid-1990's there was a flurry of research activity in thearea of database triggers and constraints; seeing the development of numerous researchproposals and prototypes. Soon thereafter; most mainstream database products ramped uptheir support for constraints and triggers; with expressive constraint specifications appearingin the SQL-92 standard; and both constraints and triggers in the SQL-99 standard. We brieflyreview the emergence of research in constraints and triggers; and we briefly describestandards and current commercial support. We then focus on practical applications oftriggers. We describe a variety of interesting and significant ways in which triggers havebeen put into practice; and we classify trigger applications along two di-,Proc. 26th VLDB,2000,121
Answering search queries with crowdsearcher,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri,Abstract Web users are increasingly relying on social interaction to complete and validatethe results of their search activities. While search systems are superior machines to getworld-wide information; the opinions collected within friends and expert/local communitiescan ultimately determine our decisions: human curiosity and creativity is often capable ofgoing much beyond the capabilities of search systems in scouting" interesting" results; orsuggesting new; unexpected search directions. Such personalized interaction occurs inmost times aside of the search systems and processes; possibly instrumented and mediatedby a social network; when such interaction is completed and users resort to the use ofsearch systems; they do it through new queries; loosely related to the previous search or tothe social interaction. In this paper we propose CrowdSearcher; a novel search paradigm …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,117
Active rules for XML: A new paradigm for E-services,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract. XML is rapidly becoming one of the most widely adopted technologies forinformation exchange and representation. As the use of XML becomes more widespread;we foresee the development of active XML rules; ie; rules explicitly designed for themanagement of XML information. In particular; we argue that active rules for XML offer anatural paradigm for the rapid development of innovative e-services. In the paper; we showhow active rules can be specified in the context of XSLT; a pattern-based language forpublishing XML documents (promoted by the W3C) which is receiving strong commercialsupport; and Lorel; a query language for XML documents that is quite popular in theresearch world. We demonstrate; through simple examples of active rules for XSLT andLorel; that active rules can be effective for the implementation of e-commerce services …,The VLDB Journal,2001,116
Improved rule analysis by means of triggering and activation graphs,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract In this paper; we propose new methods for the compile-time analysis of thebehavior of active rules; based on the distinction between mutual triggering and mutualactivation of rules. This distinction motivates the introduction of two graphs defining ruleinteraction; called triggering and activation graphs respectively. Analysis techniquespresented in this paper are focused on the problem of termination; results provide asystematic identification of reactive behaviors which can be guaranteed to terminate andreactive behaviors which may lead to infinite rule processing.,International Workshop on Rules in Database Systems,1995,114
Deriving active rules for workflow enactment,Fabio Casati; Stefano Ceri; Barbara Pernici; Giuseppe Pozzi,Abstract Workflows consist of computer-supported; data-intensive activities which involvemultiple “steps” of processing; Workflow management is an emerging and challenging field;offering opportunities for exporting database technology beyond its classical boundaries. Inparticular; active rules supported by many database systems appear as an ideal paradigmfor expressing the control and data flows between processing steps; and consequently theyare being proposed as a suitable implementation mechanism for Workflow managers. Onthe other end; active rules appear a too low level description of Workflows to be presented toWorkflow system users. In this paper; we propose automatic derivation techniques of activerules from conceptual Workflow specifications. In addition; the paper includes a fullcollection of case-independent rules at the basis of any Workflow enactment. The …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1996,113

Choosing the right crowd: expert finding in social networks,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Matteo Silvestri; Giuliano Vesci,Abstract Expert selection is an important aspect of many Web applications; eg; when theyaim at matching contents; tasks or advertisement based on user profiles; possibly retrievedfrom social networks. This paper focuses on selecting experts within the population of socialnetworks; according to the information about the social activities of their users. We considerthe following problem: given an expertise need (expressed for instance as a naturallanguage query) and a set of social network members; who are the most knowledgeablepeople for addressing that need? We considers social networks both as a source ofexpertise information and as a route to reach expert users; and define models and methodsfor evaluating people's expertise by considering their profiles and by tracing their activities insocial networks.

Compile-time and runtime analysis of active behaviors,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Active rules may interact in complex and sometimes unpredictable ways; thus possiblyyielding infinite rule executions by triggering each other indefinitely. This paper presentsanalysis techniques focused on detecting termination of rule execution. We describe anapproach which combines static analysis of a rule set at compile-time and detection ofendless loops during rule processing at runtime. The compile-time analysis technique isbased on the distinction between mutual triggering and mutual activation of rules. Thisdistinction motivates the introduction of two graphs defining rule interaction; calledTriggering and Activation Graphs; respectively. This analysis technique allows us to identifyreactive behaviors which are guaranteed to terminate and reactive behaviors which maylead to infinite rule processing.

Distributed database design methodologies,Stefano Ceri; Barbara Pernici; Gio Wiederhold,This paper surveys methodological approaches for distributed database design. The designof distribution can be performed top-down or bottom-up; the first approach is typical of adistributed database developed from scratch; while the second approach is typical of thedevelopment of a multi-database as the aggregation of existing databases. We review thedesign problems and methodologies along both directions; and we describe DATAID-D; atop-down methodology for distribution design. We indicate how the methodology is part of aglobal approach to database design; how to collect the requirements about the distributionof data and applications; and how to progressively build the distribution of a schema. Ourapproach is exemplified through one case study.,Proceedings of the IEEE,1987,101

Apart from the presentation ofa specific solution; the focus of the chapter is on two aspects. First; we analyze the couplingmodes (immediate and deferred) that can be adopted to integrate the event application partand the rule evaluation part. Then; we illustrate how the component responsible of updatingXML data and the rule processing engine can be integrated in a loose or tight way;producing two distinct rule execution semantics.,*,2004,97

Pushing reactive services to XML repositories using active rules,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Push technology; ie; the ability of sending relevant information to clients in reactionto new events; is a fundamental aspect of modern information systems; XML is rapidlyemerging as the widely adopted standard for information exchange and representation andhence; several XML-based protocols have been defined and are the object of investigationat W3C and throughout commercial organizations. In this paper; we propose the newconcept of active XML rules for “pushing” reactive services to XML-enabled repositories.Rules operate on XML documents and deliver information to interested remote users inreaction to update events occurring at the repository site.

A first step towards stream reasoning,Emanuele Della Valle; Stefano Ceri; Davide Francesco Barbieri; Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi,Abstract While reasoners are year after year scaling up in the classical; time invariantdomain of ontological knowledge; reasoning upon rapidly changing information has beenneglected or forgotten. On the contrary; processing of data streams has been largelyinvestigated and specialized Stream Database Management Systems exist. In this paper; bycoupling reasoners with powerful; reactive; throughput-efficient stream managementsystems; we introduce the concept of Stream Reasoning. We expect future realization ofsuch concept to have high impact on the future Internet because it enables reasoning in realtime; at a throughput and with a reactivity not obtained in previous works.,Future Internet Symposium,2008,87
Search computing,Stefano Ceri,Abstract Search Computing is a new paradigm for composing search services. While state-of-art search systems answer generic or domain-specific queries; Search Computing enablesanswering questions via a constellation of dynamically selected; cooperating searchservices; which are correlated by means of join operations. The idea is simple; yetpervasive. New language and description paradigms are required for expressing queriesand for connecting services.

Deriving incremental production rules for deductive data,Stefano Ceri; Jennifer Widom,Abstract We show that the production rule mechanism provided by active database systemscan be used to quickly and easily implement the logic rule interface of deductive databasesystems. Deductive rules specify derived relations using Datalog with built-in predicates andstratified negation; the deductive rules are compiled automatically into production rules. Wepresent a materialized approach; in which the derived relations are stored in the databaseand the production rules automatically and incrementally propagate base relation changesto the derived relations. We also present a non-materialized approach; in which theproduction rules compute the derived relations on demand.,Information Systems,1994,85
Liquid query: multi-domain exploratory search on the web,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali,Abstract In this paper we propose the Liquid Query paradigm; to support users in findingresponses to multi-domain queries through exploratory information seeking acrossstructured information sources (Web documents; deep Web data; and personal datarepositories); wrapped by means of a uniform notion of search service. Liquid Query aims atfilling the gap between general-purpose search engines; which are unable to findinformation spanning multiple topics; and domain-specific search systems; which cannot gobeyond their domain limits. The Liquid Query interface consists of interaction primitives thatlet users pose questions and explore results spanning over multiple sources incrementally;thus getting closer and closer to the sought information. We demonstrate our approach witha prototype built upon the YQL (Yahoo! Query Language) framework.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,83
Exception handling in workflow-driven web applications,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Christina Tziviskou,Abstract As the Web becomes a platform for implementing B2B applications; the need arisesof Web conceptual models for describing Web oriented workflow applications implementingbusiness processes. In this context; new problems about process correctness arise; due tothe loose control of Web applications upon the behavior of their Web clients. Indeed;incoherent user's behavior can lead to inconsistent processes. This paper presents a highlevel approach to the management of exceptions that occur during the execution ofprocesses on the Web. We present a classification of exceptions that can be raised insideworkflow-driven Web applications; and recovery policies to retrieve coherent status and dataafter an exception. We devise these concepts at high level and then we exploit them using aWeb modeling language (WebML) that in turn provides development facilities like …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,83

This scenariochallenges the Web engineering methods to address a broader class of applications.

Modularization techniques for active rules design,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Active database systems can be used to establish and enforce data managementpolicies. A large amount of the semantics that normally needs to be coded in applicationprograms can be abstracted and assigned to active rules. This trend is sometimes called“knowledge independence” a nice consequence of achieving full knowledge independenceis that data management policies can then effectively evolve just by modifying rules insteadof application programs. Active rules; however; may be quite complex to understand andmanage: rules react to arbitrary event sequences; they trigger each other; and sometimesthe outcome of rule processing may depend on the order in which events occur or rules arescheduled. Although reasoning on a large collection of rules is very difficult; the taskbecomes more manageable when the rules are few. Therefore; we are convinced that …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1996,82

Discovering interesting information in XML data with association rules,Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Mika Klemettinen; PierLuca Lanzi,Abstract Data mining algorithms are designed to extract interesting information from largeamounts of data. They usually assume that source data are in relational (tabular) from.However; the recent success of XML as a standard to represent semi-structured data and theincreasing amount of data available in XML pose new challenges to the data miningcommunity. In this paper we introduce association rules for XML data. To accomplish this;we propose a new operator; based on XPath and inspired by the syntax of XQuery; whichallows us to express complex mining tasks; compactly and intuitively. The operator canindifferently (and simultaneously) target both the content and the structure of the data; sincethe distinction in XML is slight.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2003,79
Optimal file allocation in a computer network: a solution method based on the knapsack problem,Stefano Ceri; Giancarlo Martella; Giuseppe Pelagatti,Abstract In this paper; the problem of determining an optimal file allocation in a distributeddatabase is considered. The solution method is based on the isomorphism between the non-redundant file allocation problem and the “multiple choice constraints” knapsack problem;which is a well-known; classical problem of operations research. An 'ad hoc'branch andbound algorithm is then introduced for the redundant file allocation problem.

XML: Current developments and future challenges for the database community,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract While we can take as a fact “the Web changes everything”; we argue that “XML isthe means” for such a change to make a significant step forward. We therefore regard XML-related research as the most promising and challenging direction for the community ofdatabase researchers. In this paper; we approach XML-related research by taking threeprogressive perspectives. We first consider XML as a data representation standard (in thesmall); then as a data interchange standard (in the large); and finally as a basis for buildinga new repository technology. After a broad and necessarily coarse-grain analysis; we turnour focus to three specific research projects which are currently ongoing at the Politecnico diMilano; concerned with XML query languages; with active document management; and withXML-based specifications of Web sites.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,78

Methods are reviewed both in their normal and abnormalbehaviour (ie; after a network partition). We show that several methods presented in theliterature; sometimes in independent papers with no crossreference; are indeed very muchrelated; for instance because they share the same basic technique. We also show in whatsense they diverge from the basic technique. This classi cation can serve as a basis forchoosing the method that is most suitable to a speci c application.

Production rules in parallel and distributed database environments,Stefano Ceri; Jennifer Widom,In most database systems with production rule facilities; rules respond to operations oncentralized data and rule processing is performed in a centralized; sequential fashion. Inparallel and distributed database environments; for maximum autonomy it is desirable forrule processing to occur separately at each site (or noresponding to operations on data atthat site. However; since rules at one site may read or modify data and interact with rules atother sites; independent rule processing at each site may be impossible or incorrect. Wedescribe mechanisms that allow rule processing to occur separately at each site andguarantee correctness: parallel or distributed rule processing is provably equivalent to ruleprocessing in the corresponding centralized environment.

Better termination analysis for active databases,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Jennifer Widom,Abstract An important problem for the usability of active databases is to determine bysyntactic analysis whether a given set of rules is guaranteed to terminate. Rule processing inactive databases does not terminate when rules activate each other indefinitely. Previousapproaches to termination analysis in active databases use very conservative algorithms todetermine when rules may activate each other. In this paper we introduce an algebraicmodel for a class of active database rules and we present a theory by which we candetermine; much less conservatively; when rules may activate each other. Hence our theoryforms the basis of better termination analysis for active databases.,*,1994,62

Reactive crowdsourcing,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Andrea Mauri,Abstract An essential aspect for building effective crowdsourcing com-putations is the abilityof" controlling the crowd"; ie of dynamically adapting the behaviour of the crowdsourcingsystems as response to the quantity and quality of completed tasks or to the availability andreliability of performers. Most crowdsourcing systems only provide limited and predefinedcontrols; in contrast; we present an approach to crowdsourcing which provides fine-level;powerful and flexible controls. We model each crowdsourcing application as composition ofelementary task types and we progressively transform these high level specifications into thefeatures of a reactive execution environment that supports task planning; assignment andcompletion as well as performer monitoring and exclusion. Controls are specified as activerules on top of data structures which are derived from the model of the application; rules …,Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web,2013,60
Clip: a visual language for explicit schema mappings,Alessandro Raffio; Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Paolo Papotti; Mauricio A Hernandez,Many data integration solutions in the market today include tools for schema mapping; tohelp users visually relate elements of different schemas. Schema elements are connectedwith lines; which are interpreted as mappings; ie high-level logical expressions capturing therelationship between source and target data-sets; these are compiled into queries andprograms that convert source-side data instances into target-side instances. This paperdescribes Clip; an XML schema mapping tool distinguished from existing tools in thatmappings explicitly specify structural transformations in addition to value couplings. Sinceclip maps hierarchical XML schemas; lines appear naturally nested. We describe thetransformation semantics associated with our" lines" and how they combine to formmappings that are more expressive than those generated by Clio; a well-known mapping …,Data Engineering; 2008.

Correctness of query execution strategies in distributed databases,Stefano Ceri; Giuseppe Pelagatti,Abstract A major requirement of a Distributed DataBase Management System (DDBMS) is toenable users to write queries as though the database were not distributed (distributiontransparency). The DDBMS transforms the user's queries into execution strategies; that is;sequences of operations on the various nodes of the network and of transmissions betweenthem. An execution strategy on a distributed database is correct if it returns the same resultas if the query were applied to a nondistributed database. This paper analyzes thecorrectness problem for query execution strategies. A formal model; called MultirelationalAlgebra; is used as a unifying framework for this purpose. The problem of proving thecorrectness of execution strategies is reduced to the problem of proving the equivalence oftwo expressions of Multirelational Algebra. A set of theorems on equivalence is given in …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1983,52

Composite events in Chimera,Rosa Meo; Giuseppe Psaila; Stefano Ceri,Abstract In this paper; we extend event types supported by Chimera; an active object-oriented database system. Chimera rules currently support disjunctive expressions of set-oriented; elementary event types; our proposal introduces instance-oriented event types;arbitrary boolean expressions (including negation); and precedence operators. Thus; weintroduce a new event calculus; whose distinguishing feature is to support a minimal set oforthogonal operators which can be arbitrarily composed. We use event calculus todetermine when rules are triggered; this is a change of each rule's internal status whichmakes it suitable for being considered by the rule selection mechanism. The proposedextensions do not affect the way in which rules are processed after their triggering; therefore;this proposal is continuously evolving the syntax and semantics of Chimera in the …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1996,50

In this paper;we present a view of the main features of Chimera and discuss the design choices made.The most remarkable characteristic of Chimera is the fact that fully developed rulelanguages for both active and deductive rules have been integrated in an object-orientedcontext. Rules are in the center of interest of the IDEA project; which aims at developingprototypical components of a future “intelligent” DBMS.,*,1995,48
A tightly-coupled architecture for data mining,Rosa Meo; Giuseppe Psaila; Stefano Ceri,Current approaches to data mining are based on the use of a decoupled architecture; wheredata are first extracted from a database and then processed by a specialized data miningengine. This paper proposes instead a tightly-coupled architecture; where data mining isintegrated within a classical SQL server. The premise of this work is a SQL-like operator;called MINE RULE. We show how the various syntactic features of the operator can bemanaged by either a SQL engine or a classical data mining engine; our main objective is toidentify the border between typical relational processing; executed by the relational server;and data mining processing; executed by a specialized component. The resultingarchitecture exhibits portability at the SQL level and integration of inputs and outputs of thedata mining operator with the database; and provides the guidelines for promoting the …,Data Engineering; 1998.

GenoMetric Query Language: a novel approach to large-scale genomic data management,Marco Masseroli; Pietro Pinoli; Francesco Venco; Abdulrahman Kaitoua; Vahid Jalili; Fernando Palluzzi; Heiko Muller; Stefano Ceri,Abstract Motivation: Improvement of sequencing technologies and data processing pipelinesis rapidly providing sequencing data; with associated high-level features; of many individualgenomes in multiple biological and clinical conditions. They allow for data-driven genomic;transcriptomic and epigenomic characterizations; but require state-of-the-art 'bigdata'computing strategies; with abstraction levels beyond available tool capabilities. Results:We propose a high-level; declarative GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL) and a toolkit forits use. GMQL operates downstream of raw data preprocessing pipelines and supportsqueries over thousands of heterogeneous datasets and samples; as such it is key togenomic 'big data'analysis. GMQL leverages a simple data model that provides bothabstractions of genomic region data and associated experimental; biological and clinical …,Bioinformatics,2015,46
Model-driven design of web applications with client-side adaptation,Stefano Ceri; Peter Dolog; Maristella Matera; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract In this paper; we integrate WebML; a high-level model and technology for buildingserver-side Web applications; with UML-Guide; a UML-based system that generates client-side guides for the adaptation of Web applications. The combination of the two systems isshown at work on an e-learning scenario: WebML is the basis of the specification of ageneric e-learning system; collecting a large number of learning objects; while UML-Guideis used for building company-specific e-learning curricula. The resulting system can beconsidered an “adaptive hypermedia generator” in full strength; whose potential expressivepower goes beyond the experiments reported in this paper.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2004,46

The history of webml lessons learned from 10 years of model-driven development of web applications,Stefano Ceri; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali,Abstract This work presents a retrospective analysis on the conceptual modeling languagefor Web applications called WebML; which was first defined about 10 years ago. WebML hasbeen an incubator for research on conceptual modeling; exploiting existing experiences inthe field and continuously addressing new challenges concerning abstractions; methods;tools; and technologies. People working on WebML are spread among universities;technology transfer centres; and a spin-off. In this paper; we illustrate the history of WebML;we summarize the essence of the approach; and we sketch the main research branches thatspawned from the initial proposal. We describe how new trends in research; applicationdevelopment; methodology; and tool prototyping led to the continuous growth of themodeling language.,*,2009,43
Building multi-device; content-centric applications using WebML and the W3I3 Tool Suite,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Andrea Maurino,Abstract In the forthcoming years; two factors will jeopardize the deployment of Webapplications: supporting multi-device outputs and one-to-one personalization. These twofactors will lead to an explosion of solutions; to be developed; maintained; and keptconsistent; meanwhile; Web hosting companies will be subject to growing service demandsand will be lacking the technical man-power required to master them. With these premises;the strength of the W3I31 tool suite is to propose a model-driven approach to Web sitedesign. Such an approach is based on WebML; a high-level language for specifying thestructure of the content of aWeb application and the organization and presentation of such acontent in a Web site. In this paper; after a brief presentation of WebML; we concentrate onthe W3I3 tool architecture; shown at work on case-study based on the popular site http …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2000,43
Model-driven engineering of active context-awareness,Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Federico M Facca; Maristella Matera,Abstract More and more Web users ask for contents and services highly tailored to theirparticular contexts of use. Especially due to the increasing affordability of new and powerfulmobile communication devices; they also appreciate the availability of ubiquitous access;independent from the device actually in use. Due to such premises; traditional softwaredesign methods need to be extended; and new issues and requirements need to beaddressed for supporting context-aware access to services and applications. In this paperwe propose a model-driven approach towards adaptive; context-aware Web applications;accompanied by a general-purpose execution framework enabling active context-awareness. Whereas conventional adaptive hypermedia systems address the problem ofadapting HTML pages in response to user-generated requests; in this work we especially …,World Wide Web,2007,42
Towards expressive stream reasoning,Heiner Stuckenschmidt; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Frank Van Harmelen,Abstract Stream Data processing has become a popular topic in database researchaddressing the challenge of efficiently answering queries over continuous data streams.Meanwhile data streams have become more and more important as a basis for higher leveldecision processes that require complex reasoning over data streams and rich backgroundknowledge. In previous work the foundation for complex reasoning over streams andbackground knowledge was laid by introducing technologies for wrapping and queryingstreams in the RDF data format and by supporting simple forms of reasoning in terms ofincremental view maintenance. In this paper; we discuss how this existing technologiesshould be extended toward richer forms of reasoning using Sensor Networks as a motivatingexample.,Dagstuhl Seminar proceedings,2010,41
Independent updates and incremental agreement in replicated databases,Stefano Ceri; Maurice AW Houtsma; Arthur M Keller; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Update propagation and transaction atomicity are major obstacles to thedevelopment of replicated databases. Many practical applications; such as automated tellermachine networks; flight reservation; and part inventory control; do not require theseproperties. In this paper we present an approach for incrementally updating a distributed;replicated database without requiring multi-site atomic commit protocols. We prove that themechanism is correct; as it asymptotically performs all the updates on all the copies. Ourapproach has two important characteristics: it is progressive; and non-blocking. Progressivemeans that the transaction's coordinator always commits; possibly together with a group ofother sites. The update is later propagated asynchronously to the remaining sites. Non-blocking means that each site can take unilateral decisions at each step of the algorithm …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1995,40
Allocation of operations in distributed database access,Stefano Ceri; Giuseppe Pelagatti,A model is developed for allocating the operations which are required by a transaction on adistributed database. The model considers the possibility of performing each operationdistributedly; ie; as a set of partial operations performed on different nodes. The criterion ofoptimality is the minimization of transmission costs. The model is formulated as a linearinteger zero-one program. An example is given which shows the use of the model and theadvantages of distributed operations.,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1982,40

After a summary of the basic features on the language; we focuson complex queries; whose expressive power subsumes some well-known relationaloperations (eg union; difference; cartesian product) but goes well beyond from theserelatively simple operators.,Proceedings of the 2000 ACM symposium on Applied computing-Volume 2,2000,39
Semantic workflow interoperability,Fabio Casati; Stefano Ceri; Barbara Pernici; Giuseppe Pozzi,Abstract A workflow consists of a collection of activities which support a specific businessprocess; classical examples range from claim management in an insurance company toproduction scheduling in a manufacturing company to patient care management andsupport within an hospital. In conventional workflow systems; each business process isseparately specified and autonomously supported by a workflow management system;which drives and assists computer-supported activities. However; business processes ofteninteract with each other; in particular; activities which are performed in the context of oneprocess may influence activities of a different process in a way that; laying “between” the twoprocesses; is quite difficult to formalize and understand. Therefore; a new challenging areafor research consists of studying the process of workflow interoperability; ie to focus on …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1996,39
Method for extracting; merging and ranking search engine results,*,A method and a computer program product for identifying the domains; selecting for eachdomain one domain-specific search engine and data source to be involved; generating thedomain-specific subqueries for each selected search engine; defining a strategy for sendingrequests to each search engine and data source; and receiving; merging and rankingresults. The result of the multi-domain query is a list of combinations; where everycombination consists of a tuple of data; each relative to one of the domains of the query;such data is present in the results returned either by search engines or by data sources. Themethod provides the combinations having the highest combination score; as computed by amonotone aggregation function over the combinations.,*,2012,38
Optimization problems and solution methods in the design of data distribution,Stefano Ceri; Barbara Pernici; Gio Wiederhold,Abstract The design of data distribution requires solving interrelated optimization problems;concerning data fragmentation and allocation; operations optimization and allocation; andthe evaluation of system's performance for given data and operation allocations. Eachproblem can be solved with several different solution methods; thus; designing datadistribution is a very difficult task. In this paper; we characterize each problem and theinteractions between them; presenting a general framework for the design of datadistribution. We present an entity-relationship schema of the design data dictionary; whichstores all information useful during the design; and we use the data dictionary to specify theinput and output data for each design problem. We then discuss how the design problemsinteract. Finally; we present an integrated toolset for the vertical partitioning of relations …,Information Systems,1989,37
Joining the results of heterogeneous search engines,Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Raffio,Abstract In recent years; while search engines have become more and more powerful;several specialized search engines have been developed for different domains (eg libraryservices; services dedicated to specific business sectors; geographic services; and so on).While such services beat generic search engines in their specific domain; they do notenable cross-references; therefore; they are of little use when queries require input from twoor more of such services (eg;“find papers in VLDB 2000 authored by a member of aspecified department” or “books sold online written by prolific database authors” or“vegetarian restaurants in the surroundings of San Francisco”). In this paper; we study howto join heterogeneous search engines and get a unique answer that satisfies conjunctivequeries; where each query can be routed to a specialized engine.

An approach to user-behavior-aware web applications,Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Vera Demaldé; Federico M Facca,Abstract The Adaptive Web is a new research area addressing the personalization of theWeb experience for each user. In this paper we propose a new high-level model for thespecification of Web applications that take into account the manner users interact with theapplication for supplying appropriate contents or gathering profile data. We thereforeconsider entire processes (rather than single properties) as smallest information units;allowing for automatic restructuring of application components. For this purpose; a high-levelEvent-Condition-Action (ECA) paradigm is proposed; which enables capturing arbitrary (andtimed) clicking behaviors. Also; a possible architecture as well as a first prototypeimplementation are discussed.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2005,36
Architectural issues and solutions in the development of data-intensive web applications,Stefano Ceri; P Fratemali; S Ceri P Fraternali,Abstract A data-intensive Web application is a Web-enabled software system for thepublication and management of large data collections; typically stored in one or moredatabase management systems. Data-intensive Web applications constitute the mostdiffused class of applications found on the Web today; and their industrial relevance is anestablished fact. As a consequence; an intense technical and scientific debate is ongoing onthe various aspects of their implementation; especially on the software architectures anddesign process best suited to cope with the peculiar aspects of a data-intensive Webapplication.,In Proc. of CIDR’03; Asilomar,2003,36
A survey of parallel execution strategies for transitive closure and logic programs,Filippo Cacace; Stefano Ceri; Maurice Houtsma,Abstract An important feature of database technology of the nineties is the use of parallelismfor speeding up the execution of complex queries. This technology is being tested in severalexperimental database architectures and a few commercial systems for conventional select-project-join queries. In particular; hash-based fragmentation is used to distribute data todisks under the control of different processors in order to perform selections and joins inparallel. With the development of new query languages; and in particular with the definitionof transitive closure queries and of more general logic programming queries; the newdimension of recursion has been added to query processing. Recursive queries arecomplex; at the same time; their regular structure is particularly suited for parallel execution;and parallelism may give a high efficiency gain. We survey the approaches to parallel …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1993,36

Design and implementation of a graphical interface to XQuery,Enrico Augurusa; Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri,Abstract As the use of XML is rapidly growing; a growing number of users withoutprogramming skills will need to query XML data. Although designed to be easily understoodby humans; XQuery; the XML standard query language; has the typical syntax ofprogramming languages; which most users dislike. In this paper we describe a graphicallanguage (XQBE) inspired by" Query By Example"(QBE); a popular relational querylanguage used by MS Access. XQBE covers a significant subset of XQuery and is supportedby a prototype enabling the formulation of queries on a graphical interface and theirtranslation into XQuery; thus providing non-trivial querying capabilities to a wide spectrum ofusers. Simple queries are easily represented in XQBE; but many" complex" queries allow aswell for an intuitive graphical representation.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2003,34
Designing data-intensive web applications for content accessibility using web marts,Stefano Ceri; Maristella Matera; Francesca Rizzo; Vera Demaldé,We define content accessibility as the property of a Web site of delivering well-organizedinformation. Content accessibility requires a clear identification of few core contents thatsynthetically convey the information of the entire application; and then the repeated use offew; well-designed access patterns; so as to give to users the impression of mastering theprocess of retrieval and navigation. Content accessibility is essential: when it is lacking;even the most effective use of presentation facilitations does not make a site accessible. Inthis article; we discuss methods and heuristics to achieve content accessibility; whichdepend on a few fundamental principles: being driven by high-level models andapproaching the problems in a top-down fashion. In addition; this article presents Webmarts; a new abstraction that; similarly to data marts in data warehousing; helps shaping …,Communications of the ACM,2007,33
Efficient database access from PROLOG,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Gio Wiederhold,In designing the interface between a relational database and a Prolog interpreter; efficiencyis a major issue. The authors present a method for loading into the memory-residentdatabase of Prolog facts permanently stored in secondary storage. The rationale of themethod is to save access to the database by never repeating the same query and by storingin main memory; in a compact and efficient way; information about the past interaction withthe database. The authors discuss how to reduce subsumption rests required by the methodto pattern matching in many relevant cases. They also describe a simulator of the method;which validates their approach; and they discuss the results of the simulation.,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,1989,33

Run-time detection of non-terminating active rule systems,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Especially during the design and tuning of active rules; it is possible that ruleexecution enters an endless loop; where rules “cascade” by triggering each otherindefinitely; so that their processing does not terminate. Commercial systems detect thissituation in a simple way; by keeping counters on the number or depth of cascading rules;and suspending an execution when the counters exceed given thresholds. However; thesetting of these counters is quite critical: too low thresholds may cause the halting of ruleprocessing in absence of loops; too high thresholds may reveal a loop only after anexpensive processing. In this paper; we propose a technique for revealing loops; which isbased on recognizing that a given situation has already occurred in the past and thereforewill occur an infinite number of times in the future. This technique is potentially very …,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1995,31
A declarative approach to active databases,Stefano Ceri,A general description is provided of the field of active databases; focusing on the mainproblems yet to be solved. The author suggests that deductive databases may contribute tothe understanding of some of these problems. Classes of applications that can be specifiedin a declarative manner are indicated. Important classes of active database applications canhave a declarative interface supporting the designer during rule generation; resulting incollections of rules with an efficient and well-understood behavior.,Data Engineering; 1992.

First of all; wepropose the applicationof visual languagesto service composition. In order to con-nect basicServices of various kinds into a larger system; their interactions along the time dimensionare defined with the JOperaVisual Composition Language. As opposed to the textual or XML-based syntax of existingapproaches; our language features a very simple graphical notation.This visual syntax is used to specify the data flow and control flow graphs linking the variousservice invocations. This way; it becomes possible to rapidly build distributed applicationsout of a set of reusable Services by literally drawing the interactionsbetween them. Toachieve this; we present how usabilityfeatures such as automatic; incremental graph layoutand visual scalability features such as multiple views have been driving the design of …,*,2004,30
Effective scheduling of detached rules in active databases,Stefano Ceri; Claudio Gennaro; Stefano Paraboschi; Giuseppe Serazzi,While triggers have become a classical ingredient of relational database systems; researchin active databases is aiming at extending the functionality and expressive power of activerules beyond the scope of relational triggers. One of the most important current trendconcerns the support of detached active rules; ie; of rules which are executed as separatetransactions; running outside of the scope of the transaction which generates the triggeringevent. Detached rules have important applications in workflow management and globalintegrity maintenance across transactions. One of the main issues in designing the ruleengine for detached rules is determining their optimal scheduling. In this paper; we study theperformance of a detached rule scheduler whose objective is to minimize the interference ofdetached rule execution with regard to the normal transactional load. This objective is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,30
Rules in database systems,Stefano Ceri; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Extending database systems with deductive and active rules is one of the major steps in therecent evolution of database technology. By means of rules; database designers expressboth declarative and procedural knowledge about their applications; rules introduce asignificant increase of the expressive power of database languages; resulting in theenhancement of processing capabilities within database servers. Deductive rules wereinfluenced by work in logic programming and offer a rich query language that extends SQLin many important directions (including support for aggregation; negation; and recursion).Deductive rules express declarative knowledge: they represent queries in a style thatreflects the meaning of the query itself and does not depend on the query evaluationstrategy. Thus they have a pure declarative semantics. In addition; rules may be …,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1996,30
Optimizing joins between two partitioned relations in distributed databases,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob,Abstract This paper analyzes the problem of optimizing the execution of a join between twopartitioned relations in a distributed database. The approach followed in this paper consistsin developing a formal model of partitioned databases and of distributed joins; and thendiscussing all the relevant optimization problems in this framework. These problems includethe “semantic” optimization of joins; semi-join reduction; and the “physical” optimization ofjoins. The “physical” optimization of joins is formulated as a linear zero-one program; andthen a theorem is presented which reduces the complexity of the program. Finally; an overallprocedure for the minimization of join execution costs in distributed databases is developed;which uses the formulations of the above problems in sequence.,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,1986,30

Streams; being unboun-ded sequences of time-varying data elements;should not be treated as persistent data to be stored “forever” and queried on demand; butrather as transient data to be consumed on the fly by queries which are regis-tered once andfor all and keep analyzing such streams; producing an-swers triggered by the streamingdata and not by explicit invocation. In this paper; we propose an approach to continuousqueries and real-time analysis of social semantic data with C-SPARQL; an extension ofSPARQL for querying RDF streams.,ISWC 2009: Second Workshop on Social Data on the Web (SDoW2009),2009,28

Structured methodology for designing static and dynamic aspects of data base applications,Stefano Ceri; Giuseppe Pelagatti; Giampio Bracchi,Abstract This paper presents an integrated methodology for specifying; verifying andprocessing both static and dynamic requirements of data base applications. A semanticbinary data model that in all the different design stages supports definition; integration andtesting of views and transactions is illustrated first. The underlying related languages arethen illustrated: a Schema Definition Language is introduced to specify the information thatshould be represented; while a Transaction Definition Language is utilised to describe thetransactions that will be executed on the data base. The structure; the computer-assistedtools and the specific interactive steps of the design methodology are finally presented.,Information Systems,1981,28
Developing eBusiness solutions with a model driven approach: the case of acer EMEA,Roberto Acerbis; Aldo Bongio; Marco Brambilla; Massimo Tisi; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Tosetti,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of developing enterprise-class eBusinesssolutions in a more economically viable and time-effective way; by adopting Model DrivenDevelopment (MDD). Specifically; we report on an experience of more than six years ofcollaboration between Acer Inc.(the 4th branded PC vendor worldwide) and Web Models; anItalian startup company spinoff of Politecnico di Milano; innovator in the market of softwaretools and methodologies for MDD. The results clearly demonstrate that MDD can shorten thedevelopment of complex eBusiness solutions; improve the quality and conformance torequirements; and increase the economic profitability of solutions; by lowering the total costof ownership and extending the life span of systems.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2007,26
One-to-One Personalization of Data-Intensive Web Sites.,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Andrea Maurino; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract The main purpose of research on the integration of Web Technology with databasesystems is the delivery of Data-Intensive Web Sites; ie; Web applications whose primarypurpose is to present a large amount of content to a variety of possible users. These sitesmust offer a generic user the possibility to browse a large collection of data; in a way thatfulfills some application-specific goal eg; in electronic commerce; showing to each userexactly those goods that he will most likely purchase. Data-Intensive Web Sites are typicallygenerated by means of tools that extract content from large data sources eg; catalogs ofgoods. One important aspect of these tools is their ability to support one-to-one Webdelivery; ie; to give each user the impression of interacting with the application by means ofa dedicated interface; specifically tailored to the user's needs and preferences.

On object-oriented database systems,Klaus R Dittrich; Umeshwar Dayal; Alejandro P Buchmann,Object-oriented database systems have been approached with mainly two major intentionsin mind; namely to better support new application areas including CAD/CAM; officeautomation; knowledge engineering; and to overcome theimpendance mismatch'betweendata models and programming languages. This volume gives a comprehensive overwiew ofdevelopments in this flourishing area of current database research. Data model andlanguage aspects; interface and database design issues; architectural and implementationquestions are covered. Although based on a series of workshops; the contents of this bookhas been carefully edited to reflect the current state of international research in objectoriented database design and implementation.,*,2012,25
Delegation: Efficiently rewriting history,Cris Pedregal Martin; Krithi Ramamritham,Transaction delegation; as introduced in ACTA; allows a transaction to transfer responsibilityfor the operations that it has performed on an object to another transaction. Delegation canbe used to broaden the visibility of the delegatee; and to tailor the recovery properties of atransaction model. Delegation has been shown to be useful in synthesizing advancedtransaction models. With an efficient implementation of delegation it becomes practicable torealize various advanced transaction models whose requirements are specified at a highlevel language instead of the current expensive practice of building them from scratch. Theauthors identify the issues in efficiently supporting delegation and hence advancedtransaction models; and illustrate this with our solution in ARIES; an industrial-quality systemthat uses UNDO/REDO recovery. Since delegation is tantamount to rewriting history; a …,Data Engineering; 1997. Proceedings. 13th International Conference on,1997,25
Model-driven design of service-enabled web applications,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Roberto Acerbis; Aldo Bongio,Abstract Significant efforts are currently invested in application integration to enable theinteraction and composition of business processes of different companies; yielding complex;multi-party processes. Web service standards; based on WSDL; have been adopted as aprocess-to-process communication paradigm. This paper presents an industrial experiencein integrating data-intensive and process-intensive Web applications through Web services.Design of sites and of Web services interaction exploits modern Web engineering methods;including conceptual modeling; model verification; visual data marshalling and automaticcode generation. In particular; the applied method is based on a declarative model forspecifying data-intensive Web applications that enact complex interactions; driven by theuser; with remote processes implemented as services.

Exploratory search framework for Web data sources,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Davide Mazza,Abstract Exploratory search is an information seeking behavior where users progressivelylearn about one or more topics of interest; it departs quite radically from traditional keyword-based query paradigms; as it combines querying and browsing of resources; and coversactivities such as investigating; evaluating; comparing; and synthesizing retrievedinformation. In most cases; such activities are enabled by a conceptual description ofinformation in terms of entities and their semantic relationships. Customized Webapplications; where few applicative entities and their relationships are embedded within theapplication logics; typically provide some support to exploratory search; which is; however;specific for a given domain. In this paper; we describe a general-purpose exploratory searchframework; ie; a framework which is neutral to the application logic. Our contribution …,The VLDB Journal,2013,23
Order matters! harnessing a world of orderings for reasoning over massive data,Emanuele Della Valle; Stefan Schlobach; Markus Krötzsch; Alessandro Bozzon; Stefano Ceri; Ian Horrocks,Abstract More and more applications require real-time processing of massive; dynamicallygenerated; ordered data; order is an essential factor as it reflects recency or relevance.Semantic technologies risk being unable to meet the needs of such applications; as they arenot equipped with the appropriate instruments for answering queries over massive; highlydynamic; ordered data sets. In this vision paper; we argue that some data managementtechniques should be exported to the context of semantic technologies; by integratingordering with reasoning; and by using methods which are inspired by stream and rank-aware data management. We systematically explore the problem space; and point both toproblems which have been successfully approached and to problems which still needfundamental research; in an attempt to stimulate and guide a paradigm shift in semantic …,Semantic Web,2013,23

Parallel hierarchical evaluation of transitive closure queries,Maurice AW Houtsma; Filippo Cacace; Stefano Ceri,Presents a new approach to parallel computation of transitive closure queries using asemantic data fragmentation. Tuples of a large base relation denote edges in a graph; whichmodels a transportation network. A fragmentation algorithm is proposed which produces apartitioning of the base relation into several fragments such that any fragment correspondsto a subgraph. One fragment; called high-speed fragment; collects all edges whichguarantee maximum speed. Thus; the fragmentation algorithm induces a hierarchicalrelationship between the high-speed fragment and all other fragments. With thisfragmentation; any query about paths connecting two nodes can be answered by using justthe fragments in which nodes are located and the high-speed fragment. In general; if eachfragment is managed by a distinguished processor; then the query can be answered by …,Parallel and Distributed Information Systems; 1991.; Proceedings of the First International Conference on,1991,22

This paper proposes to integrate constraintlanguages with the declarative specifications of their integrity repair actions. We introduce arather powerful; predicate-based language for specifying integrity constraints; then wediscuss the semantics of repair actions as computations which react to constraint violations;then we establish sufficient conditions for ensuring their termination; and finally we showhow repair actions can be integrated in the SQL2 standard and implemented by means ofrelational triggers (written in Oracle).,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1994,21

Research chapters in the area of stream reasoning,Emanuele Della Valle; Stefano Ceri; Daniele Braga; Irene Celino; Dieter Frensel; Frank van Harmelen; Gulay Unel,Abstract. Data streams occur in a variety of modern applications. Specialized StreamDatabase Management Systems proved to be an optimal solution for on the fly analysis ofdata streams; but they cannot perform complex reasoning tasks that requires to combine thestreaming data with less time variant knowledge. At the same time; while reasoners are yearafter year scaling up in the classical; time invariant domain of ontological knowledge;reasoning upon rapidly changing information has been neglected or forgotten. We herebypropose stream reasoning-an unexplored; yet high impact; research area-as the new multi-disciplinary approach which will provide the abstractions; foundations; methods; and toolsrequired to integrate data streams and reasoning systems. In particular the focus of thispaper is to sketch the research chapters of Stream Reasoning.,SR2009,2009,20

Modeling web applications reacting to user behaviors,Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Federico M Facca,Abstract Many current research efforts address the problem of personalizing the Webexperience for each user with respect to user's identity and/or context. In this paper wepropose a new high-level model for the specification of Web applications that takes intoaccount the manner in which users interact with the application for supplying appropriatecontents or gathering profile data. We therefore consider entire behaviors (rather than singleproperties) as the smallest information units; allowing for automatic restructuring ofapplication components. For this purpose; a high-level Event–Condition–Action (ECA)paradigm is proposed; which enables capturing arbitrary (and timed) clicking behaviors.Also; the architecture and components of a first prototype implementation are discussed.,Computer Networks,2006,20

Evaluating recursive queries in distributed databases,Wolfgang Nejdl; Stefano Ceri; Gio Wiederhold,The execution of logic queries in a distributed database environment is studied.Conventional optimization strategies; such as the early evaluation of selection conditionsand the clustering of processing to manipulate and exchange large sets of tuples; areredefined in view of the additional difficulties due to logic queries; in particular to recursiverules. In order to allow efficient processing of these logic queries; several programtransformation techniques that attempt to minimize distribution costs based on the idea ofsemijoins and generalized semijoins in conventional databases are presented. Althoughlocal computation of semijoins is not possible for the general case; classes of programs areindicated for which these transformations succeed in producing set-oriented computation.Processes evaluating the recursive program in a distributed network are described; and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1993,20

Here we describe the reformulation for an abstract graph; elsewhere we havedescribed an actual implementation of our approach and some promising simulation results.We view the study of distributed computation of transitive closure queries as a result of thetrend towards distributed computation. First selections were distributed to fragments of arelation; then fragmentation was used to compute joins in a distributed way; and now we arestudying distributed computation of transitive closure queries. This should result in a deeperinsight into the use and possible benefit of parallelism. Our work may be used in ordinary …,International Conference on Database Theory,1990,19

Constraint management in Chimera,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Chimera is a novel database language jointly designed by researchers atPolitecnico di Milano; Bonn University; and ECRC of Munich in the context of the EspritProject P6333; IDEA. Chimera integrates an object-oriented data model; a declarative querylanguage based on deductive rules; and an active rule language for reactive processing. Inthis paper; we present the authors' proposal for constraint management in Chimera; whichrelies on the declarative specification of passive constraints as deductive rules and on theirtransformation into different types of active rules.,IEEE Data Eng.

The case for independent updates,Stefano Ceri; Maurice AW Houtsma; Arthur M Keller; Pierangela Samarati,The authors present the case for allowing independent updates on replicated databases. Inautonomous; heterogeneous; or large scale systems; using two-phase commit for updatesmay be infeasible. Instead; the authors propose that a site may perform updatesindependently. Sites that are available can receive these updates immediately. But sites thatare unavailable; or otherwise do not participate in the update transaction receive theseupdates later through propagation; rather than preventing the execution of the updatetransaction until sufficient sites can participate. Two or more sites come to agreement usinga reconciliation procedure that uses reception vectors to determine how much of the historylog should be transferred from one site to another. They also consider what events caninitiate a reconciliation procedure.,Management of Replicated Data; 1992.; Second Workshop on the,1992,16

Mining constraint violations,Stefano Ceri; Francesco Di Giunta; Pier Luca Lanzi,Abstract In this article; we introduce pesudoconstraints; a novel data mining pattern aimed atidentifying rare events in databases. At first; we formally define pesudoconstraints using aprobabilistic model and provide a statistical test to identify pesudoconstraints in a database.Then; we focus on a specific class of pesudoconstraints; named cycle pesudoconstraints;which often occur in databases. We define cycle pesudoconstraints in the context of the ERmodel and present an automatic method for detecting cycle pesudoconstraints from arelational database. Finally; we present an experiment to show cycle pesudoconstraints “atwork” on real data.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,15

The LOGIDATA+ language and semantics,Paolo Atzeni; Luca Cabibbo; Giansalvatore Mecca; Letizia Tanca,Abstract A language for the LOGIDATA+ model is presented. The language is rule-basedand allows for the management of complex structures; classes; hierarchies and datafunctions. Negation is allowed in the body of rules. The semantics is based on a fixpointoperator and represents an extension of ordinary declarative-language semantics. The mainissue is the management of oid-invention; that is; the creation and manipulation of objectsbelonging to the classes of a scheme. In order to correctly deal with negation andmultivalued data functions; an extended notion of stratification is introduced.,*,1993,15
Interoperable data migration between nosql columnar databases,Marco Scavuzzo; Elisabetta Di Nitto; Stefano Ceri,NoSQL databases have emerged as the solution to handle large quantities of user-generated contents still guaranteeing fault tolerance; availability and scalability. EachNoSQL database offers differentiated properties and characteristics as well as different datamodels and architectures. As a result; the development of applications exploiting such kindof technology is strictly dependent on the specific NoSQL solution being adopted; and themigration from a NoSQL to the other requires the development of ad-hoc code managing thetransfer of data. In order to mitigate such issue; this paper proposes an interoperablemigration system for columnar NoSQL databases. The proposed approach is based on anorginal Metamodel; capable of preserving both strong and weak consistency between dataupdates; secondary indexes and various data types. Moreover; the approach allows …,Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops and Demonstrations (EDOCW); 2014 IEEE 18th International,2014,14
Exploratory search in multi-domain information spaces with liquid query,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Salvatore Vadacca,Abstract Search Computing (SeCo) aims at building search applications that bridge the gapbetween general-purpose and vertical search engines. SeCo queries extract rankedinformation about several interconnected domains; such as" hotels";" restaurants" or"concerts"; by interacting with Web data sources which are wrapped as search services; anexample of query is:" Find a good Jazz concert close to the user's current location; togetherwith close-by good restaurants and hotels". The SeCo system supports the deployment ofsearch applications; by providing a generic software architecture and the tools for serviceand query registration; for query formulation and execution; and for result browsing.

A CASE tool for modelling and automatically generating web service-enabled applications,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali,This paper presents a CASE tool for the high-level specification of web applicationsintegrated with web services. The CASE tool is based on WebML; a conceptual modellinglanguage used for the specification of the front end of web applications. WebML; extendedwith new primitives for modelling web services; allows one to specify complex interactionsbetween a web application; driven by the user; and remote processes; represented byservices. The CASE tool also allows the specification and deployment of applicationfunctionalities as web services and automatically generates the running code; including webpages; web services calls and the exposed web services.

Achieving incremental consistency among autonomous replicated databases,Stefano Ceri; Maurice AW Houtsma; Arthur M Keller; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In this paper; we present methods for supporting autonomous updates in replicateddatabases. Autonomous updates are of particular importance to applications that cannottolerate the delay and vulnerability due to synchronous update methods (2PC). We separatethe notion of replication consistency; meaning that all copies have the same value andreflect the same update transactions; from behavior consistency; meaning that transactionexecution reflects all integrity constraints. The method proposed in this paper supportsindependent updates during network partitioning; and achieves a consistent final databasestate on recovery of partitions that reflects all actions that were executed during networkpartitioning. To this purpose; we describe a reconciliation procedure that applies all actionsto each updated data item in the order in which they were originally performed; possibly …,*,1993,14

Extracting emerging knowledge from social media,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Riccardo Volonterio; Felix Xavier Acero Salazar,Abstract Massive data integration technologies have been recently used to produce verylarge ontologies. However; knowledge in the world continuously evolves; and ontologies arelargely incomplete for what concerns low-frequency data; belonging to the so-called longtail. Socially produced content is an excellent source for discovering emerging knowledge: itis huge; and immediately reflects the relevant changes which hide emerging entities. Thus;we propose a method for discovering emerging entities by extracting them from socialcontent. Once instrumented by experts through very simple initialization; the method iscapable of finding emerging entities; we use a purely syntactic method as a baseline; andwe propose several semantics-based variants. The method uses seeds; ie prototypes ofemerging entities provided by experts; for generating candidates; then; it associates …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,13
An introduction to information retrieval,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Information retrieval is a discipline that deals with the representation; storage;organization; and access to information items. The goal of information retrieval is to obtaininformation that might be useful or relevant to the user: library card cabinets are a“traditional” information retrieval system; and; in some sense; even searching for a visitingcard in your pocket to find out a colleague's contact details might be considered as aninformation retrieval task. In this chapter we introduce information retrieval as a scientificdiscipline; providing a formal characterization centered on the notion of relevance. We touchon some of its challenges and classic applications and then dedicate a section to its mainevaluation criteria: precision and recall.,*,2013,13

The main design goals of PRIMO include portability;modularity; and transparency. As a result of portability; the PRIMO interface can beestablished between any two PROLOG and relational systems; provided that the formersupports a call to the operating system and that the latter supports SQL. Modularity enablesus to separate the system into its components; each component has several; differentversions; whose relative performance is benchmarked.

Models of all kinds; from analytic to numeric; fromexact to stochastic; from simulative to predictive; from behavioral to ontological; from patternsto laws; enable massive data analysis and mining; often in real time. Scientific discovery inmost cases stems from complex pipelines of data analysis and data mining methods on topof “big” experimental data; confronted and contrasted with state-of-art knowledge.

Providing flexible process support to project-centered learning,Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Maristella Matera; Alessandro Raffio,While business process definition is becoming more and more popular as an instrument fordescribing human activities; there is a growing need for software tools supporting businessprocess abstractions to help users organize and monitor their desktop work. Tools are mosteffective when they embed some knowledge about the process; eg; in terms of the typicalactivities required by the process; so that users can execute the activities without having todefine them. Tools must be lightweight and flexible; so as to enable users to create orchange the process as soon as there is a new need. In this article; we first describe anapplication-independent approach to flexible process support by discussing the abstractionsrequired for modeling; creating; enacting; and modifying flexible processes. Then; we showour approach at work in the context of project-centered learning. In this application …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,12

Design of active rule applications: Issues and approaches,Stefano Ceri; Elena Baralis; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract The use of objects and rules in modern database systems is the main focus of theIDEA Esprit Project. In particular; it inspires the IDEA Methodology; a comprehensive andsystematic approach to the design of database applications which use both deductive andactive rules. The IDEA Methodology reconciles deductive and active rules by assigning themthe role of expressing knowledge about the application domain; either with a purelydeclarative style; or with a more procedural style. Although active rules are inherentlyprocedural; in many cases they can be automatically or semi-automatically generated fromdeclarative specifications. This paper is focused on active rules; the main research interestof the Politecnico in the IDEA project. We concentrate on active rule analysis; design; andprototyping as developed in the context of the IDEA Methodology.

Taxonomy and formal properties of distributed joins,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Giuseppe Pelagatti,Abstract A general framework for studying the properties of joins between fragmentedrelations is presented. A join between fragmented relations can be performed as a set ofpartial joins between their fragments and can be represented as a join graph. A taxonomy ofjoin graphs is developed. Rules are given for determining the class of a join graph from theproperties of the fragmentation of relations and from semantic knowledge of different types ofdatabase dependencies. The fact that a join graph belongs to a given class is relevant forthe efficiency of join execution; two typical application areas of these results are the designof distributed databases and the optimization of distributed queries.,Information Systems,1986,11

Framework for supporting genomic operations,Abdulrahman Kaitoua; Pietro Pinoli; Michele Bertoni; Stefano Ceri,Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a family of technologies for reading the DNA or RNA;capable of producing whole genome sequences at an impressive speed; and causing arevolution of both biological research and medical practice. In this exciting scenario; while ahuge number of specialized bio-informatics programs extract information from sequences;there is an increasing need for a new generation of systems and frameworks capable ofintegrating such information; providing holistic answers to the needs of biologists andclinicians. To respond to this need; we developed GMQL; a new query language forgenomic data management that operates on heterogeneous genomic datasets. In thispaper; we focus on three domain-specific operations of GMQL used for the efficientprocessing of operations on genomic regions; and we describe their efficient …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2017,9
Modeling and interoperability of heterogeneous genomic big data for integrative processing and querying,Marco Masseroli; Abdulrahman Kaitoua; Pietro Pinoli; Stefano Ceri,Abstract While a huge amount of (epi) genomic data of multiple types is becoming availableby using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies; the most important emergingproblem is the so-called tertiary analysis; concerned with sense making; eg; discoveringhow different (epi) genomic regions and their products interact and cooperate with eachother. We propose a paradigm shift in tertiary analysis; based on the use of the GenomicData Model (GDM); a simple data model which links genomic feature data to theirassociated experimental; biological and clinical metadata. GDM encompasses all the dataformats which have been produced for feature extraction from (epi) genomic datasets.

Towards mega-modeling: a walk through data analysis experiences,Stefano Ceri; Themis Palpanas; Emanuele Della Valle; Dino Pedreschi; Johann-Christoph Freytag; Roberto Trasarti,Big data is perceived as a fundamental ingredient for fostering the progress of science in avariety of disciplines. However; we believe that the current ICT solutions are not adequatefor this challenge. Abstractions and languages for big data management are tailored tovertical domains and influenced by underlying ICT platforms; hence unsuitable forsupporting “computational interdisciplinarity”; as it is required if one wants to use the best of;eg; analytical; inductive; and simulation techniques; all at work on the same data. In otherwords;“our society is data-rich; but it lacks the conceptual tools to handle it”[1].

The service computing paradigmhas so far been neutral to the specific features of search applications and services. Toaddress this weakness; search computing advocates a new approach in which search; join;and ranking are the central aspects for service composition.,IEEE Internet Computing,2010,9
Comparison: mediation on WebML/WebRatio and jABC/jETI,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Federico M Facca; Christian Kubczak; Tiziana Margaria; Bernhard Steffen; Christian Winkler,In this chapter we compare two solutions to the mediation scenario of the SWS challengethat are based on the use of WebML [1] and of the jABC [2; 3] as modeling and executionplatforms. In particular; first we give a general overview of the differences among the toapproaches; and then we compare in the details the two solutions for the SWS challenge.We use selected parts from the mediation scenarios to keep the comparison simple butexpressive. Looking on the advanced scenarios would be more complex but wouldobviously lead to the same results.,*,2009,9
Clip: a tool for mapping hierarchical schemas,Alessandro Raffio; Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Paolo Papotti; Mauricio A Hernández,Abstract Many data integration solutions in the market today include visual tools for schemamapping. Users connect schema elements with lines that are interpreted as high-levellogical expressions capturing the relationship between source and target data-sets. Theseexpressions are compiled into queries or programs that convert source-side data instancesinto target-side instances. In this demo we showcase Clip; an XML Schema mapping tool.Clip is distinguished from existing tools in that mappings explicitly specify structuraltransformations in addition to value correspondences. We show how Clip's users entermappings by drawing lines and how these lines are translated into XQuery.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,9
NGS: a framework for multi-domain query answering,Daniele Braga; Diego Calvanese; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Davide Martinenghi; Paolo Merialdo; Riccardo Torlone,If we consider a query involving multiple domains; such as" find all database conferencesheld within six months in locations whose seasonal average temperature is 28degC and forwhich a cheap travel solution exists"; we note that (i) general-purpose search engines fail toanswer multi-domain queries and (ii) specific search services may cover one of suchdomains; but no general integration framework is readily available. Currently; the only wayto treat such cases is to separately query dedicated services and feed the result of onesearch as input to another; or to pairwise compare them by hand. This paper presents NGS;a framework providing fully automated support for cross-domain queries. In particular; NGS(a) integrates different kinds of services (search engines; web services; and wrapped webpages) into a global ontology; ie; a unified view of the concepts supported by the …,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008.

CMIS/P++: extensions to CMIS/P for increased expressiveness and efficiency in the manipulation of management information,G Pavlov; Antonio Liotta; Paola Abbi; Stefano Ceri,CMIS/P is the OSI systems management service and protocol used as the base technologyfor the telecommunications management network. It is a generic object oriented protocol thatprovides multiple object access capabilities to managed object clusters administered byagent applications. Its navigation and object selection capabilities rely on traversingcontainment relationships. This is restrictive because information models for emergingbroadband technologies (SDH/SONET; ATM) exhibit various other relationships. We presentextensions to the CMIS service that provide a richer access language and show how theseextensions can be supported by corresponding extensions to the CMIP protocol. Theseextensions allow traversal of any object relationship and filtering out objects at any stage ofthe selection process. CMIS++ provides much greater expressive power than CMIS; while …,IEEE network,1998,9
On the quest for changing knowledge,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Emanuele Della Valle,Abstract For centuries; science (in German" Wissenschaft") has aimed to create (" schaffen")new knowledge (" Wissen") from the observation of physical phenomena; their modeling andempirical validation.

Panta rhei: flexible execution engine for search computing queries,Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Francesco Corcoglioniti; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract The efficient execution of data-intensive computations over services is achallenging task: data are retrieved from remote sources and therefore are not available inthe query engine until after the execution of these calls; but the system must be inherentlyefficient thereafter; by guaranteeing that data is immediately cached and processedefficiently; according to the best query plan. In this chapter; we present a flexible executionmodel for search computing queries; named Panta Rhei. The proposed execution engineparadigm adopts the producer/consumer model and supports both data-driven and event-driven synchronization; and their interplay. Query plans are modeled as directed graphs;whose nodes are processing units and whose edges are either control or data flows. Whilecontrol flows synchronize service calls and unit execution; data flows transfer data …,*,2010,8
Engineering search computing applications: vision and challenges,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri,Abstract Search computing is a novel discipline whose goal is to answer complex; multi-domain queries. Such queries typically require combining in their results domain knowledgeextracted from multiple Web resources; therefore; conventional crawling and indexingtechniques; which look at individual Web pages; are not adequate for them.

The UM-MAIS methodology for multi-channel adaptive web information systems,Carlo Batini; Davide Bolchini; Stefano Ceri; Maristella Matera; Andrea Maurino; Paolo Paolini,Abstract Multichannel Adaptive Web Information Systems (WISs) are emerging as a newclass of information systems; characterized by their powerful use of mobility and context-awareness. Different methodologies have been proposed so far for the analysis and designof Multichannel Adaptive WISs; specifically focused on the front-end layer or the back-endlayer; but no methodology has aimed to cover all the lifecycle and to design all thecomponents that characterize Multichannel Adaptive WIS. This paper fills such a gap; bypresenting UM-MAIS (Unified Methodology for Multichannel Adaptive Information Systems);a new methodology that capitalizes on well-established existing methods. It supports theanalysis and design of the various components of Multichannel Adaptive WISs (including theuser's experience) in a comprehensive and unified manner with special emphasis on …,World Wide Web,2007,8
XQBE: A graphical interface for XQuery engines,Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri,Abstract XQuery is increasingly popular among computer scientists with a SQL background;since queries in XQuery and SQL require comparable skills to be formulated. However; thenumber of these experts is limited; and the availability of easier XQuery “dialects” could beextremely valuable. Something similar happened with QBE; initially proposed as analternative to SQL; that has then become popular as the user-friendly query languagesupported by MS Access. We designed and implemented XQBE; a visual dialect of XQuerythat uses hierarchical structures; coherent with the hierarchical nature of XML; to denote theinput and output documents. Our demo consists of examples of queries in XQBE and showshow our prototype allows to switch between equivalent representations of the same query.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,8

Flexible processes in project-centred learning,Stefano Ceri; Maristella Matera; Alessandro Raffio; Howard Spoelstra,Abstract Project-centred learning is increasingly used both in academia and in companies;universities train students to master complex tasks; often suggested by real-life situations;while companies train users to learn about new products; methods; technologies. This paperintroduces a model-driven; extensible environ-ent; delivered on the Web; which is able tosupport long-distance collaboration of teams working on complex projects. The main merit ofthis proposal is the ability to self-organize processes; by using a simple Web interface and alibrary of activities and templates which cover most of the needs of this well-defined class ofapplications.

The Story of the IDEA methodology,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali,Abstract The IDEA Methodology is a comprehensive approach to the design of informationsystems; its main focus is the use of innovative features of database technology; in particularthe object-oriented and rule-based paradigms. The development of the IDEA Methodologystarted three years ago; in the framework of the IDEA Esprit project. The methodology wasfirst conceived in our university; then experienced by several industrial partners of the IDEAConsortium; then consolidated. In the summer of 1997; the IDEA Methodology is widelyavailable through a variety of media and sufficiently stable to permit us to attempt a criticalevaluation of this three-years story. Of course; this is a preliminary evaluation: themethodology will have its most significant assessment after its dissemination and usage;which is currently taking place.

A solution method for the non-additive resource allocation problem in distributed system design,Stefano Ceri; Giuseppe Pelagatti,Distributed information systems are characterized by the sharing of data and processingresources between the different nodes of a computer network. The applications which areactivated at each node can be distinguished into local applications; which are processedcompletely at that node; and distributed applications; which need some non-local resource.In the latter case; non-local processes are activated and some information is transmittedalong the computer network. Clearly; the determination of the optimal allocation of resourceswith respect to a given computer r:: twork and a given c; et of applications is crucial to thedesign of a successful distributed inf&mation system. Several works exist on this su'bject [1-3); in all of them the advantage of allocatihg a resource where it is used by an application (orconversely; the cost of accessing a remote resource by an. application) is the relevant …,Information Processing Letters,1982,7

Ontology-based search of genomic metadata,Javier D Fernández; Maurizio Lenzerini; Marco Masseroli; Francesco Venco; Stefano Ceri,The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) is a huge and still expanding publicrepository of more than 4;000 experiments and 25;000 data files; assembled by a largeinternational consortium since 2007; unknown biological knowledge can be extracted fromthese huge and largely unexplored data; leading to data-driven genomic; transcriptomic;and epigenomic discoveries. Yet; search of relevant datasets for knowledge discovery islimitedly supported: metadata describing ENCODE datasets are quite simple andincomplete; and not described by a coherent underlying ontology. Here; we show how toovercome this limitation; by adopting an ENCODE metadata searching approach which useshigh-quality ontological knowledge and state-of-the-art indexing technologies.

Extending search to crowds: A model-driven approach,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Andrea Mauri,Abstract In many settings; the human opinion provided by an expert or knowledgeable usercan be more useful than factual information retrieved by a search engine. Search systemsdo not capture the subjective opinions and recommendations of friends; or fresh; online-provided information that require contextual or domain-specific expertise. Search resultsobtained from conventional search engines can be complemented by crowdsearch; anonline interaction with crowds; selected among friends; experts; or people who are presentlyat a given location; an interplay between conventional and search-based queries can occur;so that the two search methods can support each other.

The anatomy of a multi-domain search infrastructure,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla,Abstract Current search engines do not support queries that require a complex combinationof information. Problems such as “Which theatre offers an at least-three-stars action movie inLondon close to a good Italian restaurant” can only be solved by asking multiple queries;possibly to different search engines; and then manually combining results; therebyperforming “data integration in the brain.” While searching the Web is the preferred methodfor accessing information in everyday's practice; users expect that search systems will soonbe capable of mastering complex queries. However; combining information requires adrastic change of perspective: a new generation of search computing systems is needed;capable of going beyond the capabilities of current search engines.

We showthat dynamic adaptation of crowdsourcing campaigns to community behaviour is particularlyrelevant. We demonstrate that this approach can be very effective for obtaining answers fromcommunities; with very different size; precision; delay and cost; by exploiting the socialnetworking relations and the features of the crowdsourcing task. We show the approach atwork within the CrowdSearcher platform; which allows configuring and dynamically adaptingcrowdsourcing campaigns tailored to different communities.

Semantic search,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Semantic search seeks to answer user queries based on meanings rather thankeyword matching. For instance; when searching for “museums in Milan”; a traditionalsearch engine would answer with a list of links to Web pages that contain the keywords“museums” and “Milan”. However; a semantic search engine understands the intention ofthe user to obtain a list of museums and returns Web representations of the required real-world entities; including their semantic properties. This chapter illustrates the processadopted by semantic search engines and uses it to compare alternative semantic searchsolutions offered on the market as well as academic prototypes.,*,2013,5

It is too early to anticipate such reactions–as the technology is still “underconstruction”–but this chapter attempts a first identification of the possible future players inthe development of Search Computing applications; by grossly identifying the roles of “datasource publishers” and of “application developers”; and by discussing how classicaladvertising-based models may support the new applications.

Liquid queries and liquid results in search computing,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract Liquid queries are a flexible tool for information seeking; based on the progressiveexploration of the search space; they produce “fluid” results which dynamically adapt to theshape of the query; as a liquid adapts to its container. The liquid query paradigm relies onthe SeCo service mart and multi-domain query execution concepts: an expert user selects apriori the service marts relevant to the information seeking task at hand and the connectionsnecessary to join them; and publishes such a definition in the SeCo back-end. The LiquidQuery client-side interface consumes the application definition created by the expert anddynamically builds a query interface for the end-user. Such interface allows one to supplykeywords to query the pre-configured service marts and offers controls for exploring thecombinations computed by the SeCo execution engine. The interaction commands are …,*,2010,5

Web Modeling-based Approach to Automating Web Services Mediation; Choreography and Discovery,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Dario Cerizza; Emanuele Della Valle; Federico Michele Facca; Piero Fraternali; Christina Tziviskou,Abstract. We propose an approach for the discovery and integration of Semantic WebServices that exploits modern Web engineering methods; including visual declarativemodeling (based on the WebML language); visual data marshalling; and automatic codegeneration. The approach to automatic interaction between services is based on a relationalrepresentation of the WSMO ontology model and on a set of visual primitives for defining theinteraction between services and the choreography structure. Choreography; front-end; andservices implementations are completely modeled by WebML schemas. Service discovery isbased on a research prototype engine called Glue.,SWS Challenge I,2006,5
XQBE: a visual environment for learning XML query languages,Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Raffio,Abstract XQBE (XQuery By Example) is a visual XML query language which; coherently withthe hierarchical XML data model; uses tree-shaped structures to express queries andtransformations over XML documents. These structures are annotated to express selectionpredicates; explicit bindings between the nodes of such structures visualize the input/outputmappings. XQuery and XSLT; the standard query and transformation languages for XML;happen to be too complex for most occasional or unskilled users who might need to specifyqueries; schema mappings; or document transformations; if they are only aware of thebasics of the XML data model. The implementation of XQBE allows to generate the XQueryand XSLT translations of the visual queries; assisting the user in several aspects of theinteraction (eg providing interactive access to schema information); therefore; XQBE …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,5
XQuery by Example,Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Enrico Augurusa,Abstract XQuery; the standard query language for XML; is gaining popularity among userswith a SQL background; indeed; formulating XQuery and SQL queries requires comparableskills. However; this nucleus of programmers is not vast; and the availability of simplerXQuery “dialects” could be valuable for establishing its success. With this motivation in mind;we designed XQBE; a visual dialect of XQuery inspired by QBE (Query by Example). QBEwas initially proposed as alternative to SQL and has gained popularity as the languagesupported by MS Access; currently presented to users with a very limited experience ofquery languages. Coherent with the XML data model; XQBE uses one or more hierarchicalstructures to denote the input XML documents and one structure to denote the outputdocument. Similar to QBE; structures are annotated to express selection predicates; …,In Proc. Int. World Wide Web Conf,2003,5

TANGO: A notation for describing advanced transaction models,Sergio Bandinelli; Stefano Ceri; Miguel Felder,Abstract The classical transaction model; that guarantees atomicity; consistency; isolation;and durability of transactions; has proved to be very useful in the development of traditionaldatabase applications. However; these properties are not adequate for modeling nontraditional applications; such as software engineering; CAD; office automation; andcooperative work. New transaction models have been proposed in order to capture thesemantics of non traditional database applications. This work briefly surveys theseextensions to the traditional transaction model and proposes a formal notation; calledTANGO; that may be used to describe existing models and; in general; to design non-traditional database applications; involving complex dependencies among transactions.TANGO is based on a high-level Petri net formalism; and includes a modularization …,*,1994,5

Chapter 1: search computing,Stefano Ceri,Abstract. Search Computing is a new paradigm for composing search services. While state-of-art search systems answer generic or domain-specific queries; Search Computingenables answering questions via a constellation of dynamically selected; cooperatingsearch services; which are correlated by means of join operations. The idea is simple; yetpervasive. New language and description paradigms are required for expressing queriesand for connecting services.

XQuery layers,Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Paola Spoletini,Abstract XML is becoming widespread as data interoperability standard in many applicationdomains. An increasing number of researchers and professionals; who are not computerscientists (although they may have a strong technical background); needs to query andtransform XML data during their working activities. Such tasks typically require simplequeries and partial awareness of the XML data model; in the context of a given; domain-specific XML-based protocol. The W3C community has proposed XQuery as the standardquery language for XML [9]. XQuery has a huge expressive power-as it encompassesfeatures belonging both to query and functional languages; but it may be considered as toocomplex for the above user profiles; well-designed subsets of XQuery are sufficient to satisfytheir needs.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2007,4
Extended memory (xMem) of web interactions,Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Maristella Matera; Francesca Rizzo,Abstract Finding a previously visited page during a Web navigation is avery common andimportant kind of interaction.

In most active object-oriented databases; active rules are associatedwith objects through methods—rules are triggered by method activations; and are used asdevices for testing pre-and post-conditions for method applications to individual objectinstances. The Chimera approach is substantially different: it uses set-orzented active rules;activated as the effect of several; logically indistinguishable events affecting multiple objectinstances. This approach is consistent with the rest of Chimera; which supports a set-oriented; declarative query and update language. Object-orientation in Chimera guaranteesimportant advantages over relational active rules; due to the use of object tdenttjiers. In …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,4

The quality of theoutcome of these applications depends on different design parameters and constraints; andit is very hard to judge about their combined effects without doing some experiments; on theother hand; there are no experiences or guidelines that tell how to conduct experiments; andthus these are often conducted in an ad-hoc manner; typically through adjustments of aninitial strategy that may converge to a parameter setting which is quite different from the bestpossible one. In this paper we propose a comparative; explorative approach for designingcrowdsourcing tasks. The method consists of defining a representative set of execution …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,3

Classification and Clustering,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Information overload can be addressed through machine learning techniques thatorganize and categorize large amounts of data. The two main techniques are classificationand clustering. Classification is a supervised technique that assigns a class to each dataitem by performing an initial training phase over a set of human annotated data and then asubsequent phase which applies the classification to the remaining elements. Clustering isan unsupervised technique that does not assume a priori knowledge: data are grouped intocategories on the basis of some measure of inherent similarity between instances; in such away that objects in one cluster are very similar (compactness property) and objects indifferent clusters are different (separateness property). Similarity must be calculated indifferent ways based on the data types it involves; namely categorical; numeric; textual; or …,*,2013,2
Search Computing: Broadening Web Search,Stefano Ceri; Marco Brambilla,Search computing; which has evolved from service computing; focuses on building theanswers to complex search queries by interacting with a constellation of cooperating searchservices; using the ranking and joining of results as the dominant factors for servicecomposition. The field is multi-disciplinary in nature and takes advantage of contributionsfrom other research areas such as knowledge representation; human-computer interfaces;psychology; sociology; economics; and legal sciences. This book is the third in the SearchComputing series and contains a collection of 16 papers; which in most cases werecontributed to several workshops during 2011 organized by members of the SearchComputing project in the context of major international conferences: ExploreWeb at ICWE2011; Very Large Data Search and DBRank at VLDB 2011; DATAVIEW at ECOWS 2011 …,*,2012,2
CrowdSearch: Crowdsourcing Web search,Piero Fraternali; Stefano Ceri; Ricardo Baeza-Yates; Fausto Giunchiglia,1. GOALS AMD MOTIVATIONS Link analysis; that has shaped Web search technology in thelast decade; can be seen as a massive mining of crowd- secured reputation associated withpages. With the expo- nential increase of social engagement; link analysis is now complementedby other kinds of crowd-generated informa- tion; such as multimedia content;recommendations; tweets and tags; and each person can ask for information or advices fromdedicated sites. With the growth of online presence; we expect questions to be directly routedto informed crowds. At the same time; many kinds of tasks - either directly used for search orindirectly used for enriching content to make it more searchable - are explicitlycrowd-sourced; possibly under the format of games. Many such tasks can be used to craftinformation; eg by naming and tagging data objects and by solving representational …,CrowdSearch: Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Crowdsourcing Web Search,2012,2
Materialization of web data sources,Alessandro Bozzon; Stefano Ceri; Srđan Zagorac,Abstract Recent years witnessed an exponential increase in the number of data servicesavailable on the Web. Many popular Web sites; including social networks; offer API forinteracting with their information; and open data initiative such as the Linked Data projectpromise to achieve the vision of the Web of data. Unfortunately; access to Web data istypically limited by the constraints imposed by the query interface; and by technicallimitations such as the network latency; or the number and frequency of allowed dailyservice invocations. Moreover; several sources may independently publish data about thesame real-world objects; in such case; their combined use for assembling all availableinformation about those objects requires duplicate removal; reconciliation and integration.This paper describes various data materialization problems; defining properties such as …,*,2012,2
Understanding web data sources for search and exploration,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract As information sources become increasingly available on the Internet; searchingand extracting information from them is getting more important. We present a data modeland a general service framework for supporting search and exploration of heterogeneousdata sources. In our approach; concepts and abstractions find suitable and efficientimplementations. In this paper; we especially focus on the support of dynamicity andflexibility offered by our framework; from the definition of data sources to the interactionoptions offered to users when expressing queries and interacting with results.,Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Discovering Meaning On the Go in Large Heterogeneous Data,2011,2

Temporal Analysis of Social Media Response to live events: the Milano Fashion Week,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Gianmarco Donetti,Abstract Social media response to catastrophic events; such as natural disasters or terroristattacks; has received a lot of attention. However; social media are also extremely importantin the context of planned events; such as fairs; exhibits; festivals; as they play an essentialrole in communicating them to fans; interest groups; and the general population. Thesekinds of events are geo-localized within a city or territory and are scheduled within a publiccalendar. We consider a specific scenario; the Milano Fashion Week (MFW); which is animportant event in our city. We focus our attention on the spreading of social content in time;measuring the delay of the event propagation. We build different clusters of stakeholders(fashion brands); we characterize several features of time propagation and we correlate it tothe popularity of involved actors.

Data-driven optimization of search service composition for answering multi-domain queries,Davide Francesco Barbieri; Alessandro Bozzon; Daniele Braga; Marco Brambilla; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Michael Grossniklaus; Davide Martinenghi,Answering multi-domain queries requires the combination of knowledge from variousdomains. Such queries are inadequately answered by general-purpose search engines;because domain-specific systems typically exhibit sophisticated knowledge about their ownfields of expertise. Moreover; multi-domain queries typically require combining in the resultdomain knowledge possibly coming from multiple web resources; therefore conventionalcrawling and indexing techniques; based on individual pages; are not adequate. In thispaper we present a conceptual framework for addressing the composition of search servicesfor solving multi-domain queries. The approach consists in building an infrastructure forsearch service composition that leaves within each search system the responsibility ofmaintaining and improving its domain knowledge; and whose main challenge is to …,VLDB Workshop on Using Search Engine Technology for Information Management (USETIM),2009,1

Enabling Project-Centred Learning through Flexible Processes: the COOPER Experience,Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Maristella Matera; Alessandro Raffio; Howard Spoelstra,This paper proposes a model-driven; extensible platform; delivered on the Web; which isable to support long-distance collaboration of students' teams working on complex projects.The main merit of this proposal is the ability to support end-users to self-organize processes;by using a simple Web interface and a library of activities that cover most of the needsarising in collaborative environments. In this way; students can organize processes in aflexible way; and at the same time their work is well-organized; well-understood by all teammembers. This underlying paradigm for the management of dynamic processes is verygeneral and can be applied to other application contexts; different from e-learning; afterunderstanding and modelling the relevant collaboration activities.,*,2007,1

Flexible Specification of Semantic Services using Web Engineering Methods and Tools,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Irene Celino; Dario Cerizza; Emanuele Della Valle; Federico M Facca; Christina Tziviskou,Abstract. Today's IT architectures are largely considered the biggest roadblocks that mostcompanies face when making strategic business moves. The good news is that the SoftwareEngineering community and the Semantic Web community are bridging their efforts to fostera new generation of design and development tools. In this paper we describe a top-downapproach to the design and development of applications employing Semantic Web Services;that combines semantic methods and tools (ie; ontology engineering; semantic serviceannotation and discovery) with Software Engineering ones (ie; formal business processdevelopment; component-based software design techniques; and computer-aided softwaredesign). The described approach was the most complete among those that took part in theSemantic Web Service Challenge 2006.,Proc. SWESW,2006,1

XML challenges for the database community: past; present; and future,Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri,Abstract It is a common understanding that “the Web changes everything”; and this appliesto an increasing number of computer applications. In the last years; we also understood that“XML is the means” for this change to take effect; as XML has progressively become thebasis on which Web applications are built. This corollary was the claim of [9]; published fouryears ago; in which XML was pointed out as a prominent and promising research directionfor the database community. Indeed; among the many promises that followed the advent ofXML; some have been fulfilled; some are still at the stage of promise. After four years; one ofthe authors was asked to “redo” the same exercise; reconsidering the challenges posed tothe database community and making another assessment of the area checking whether theexpectations and challenges of the year 2000 have been met in 2004.

Models and tools for designing data-intensive Web applications,Stefano Ceri,Summary form only given; as follows. Data-intensive WEB applications; whose pages areautomatically generated from large data sources; are becoming more and more relevant.Their design requires orthogonal abstractions; for the definition of the structure; derivation;navigation; composition; and presentation of WEB sites. While the abstractions for structure;derivation; and presentation of WEB sites are classical; those for navigation and compositionare quite original. This talk will focus on the model which is used for navigation andcomposition of WEB pages; and then on the process which is required in order to producedesign specifications; including the problems due to extracting data from heterogeneousdata sources. These ingredients are used in Torii; a tool environment for the specificationand automatic generation of EB sites; developed in the context of a large Esprit project …,Cooperative Information Systems; 1999.

Debugging and Run-time Monitoring of Active Rules,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Especially during the design and tuning of active rules; it is possible that ruleexecution enters an endless loop; where rules “cascade” by triggering each otherindefinitely; so that their processing does not terminate. Commercial systems detect thissituation in a simple way; by keeping counters on the number or depth of cascading rules;and suspending an execution when the counters exceed given thresholds. However; thesetting of these counters is quite critical: too low thresholds may cause the halting of ruleprocessing in absence of loops; too high thresholds may reveal a loop only after anexpensive processing. In this paper; we propose a technique for revealing loops; which isbased on recognizing that a given situation has already occurred in the past and thereforewill occur an infinite number of times in the future. We exploit this property to develop …,Journal of Systems Integration,1997,1

Bridging objects with logical rules: towards object oriented deductive databases,Stefano Ceri; Letizia Tanca,Abstract A recent direction of database research has been focused on integrating logicprogramming and object orientation. The rationale of such integration stems from twoarguments; on one hand; object-orientation brings powerful data modeling capabilities byadding semantic and structural complexity to value-based relational databases. On the otherhand; logic programming languages provide means for expressing queries and updates ona database with a declarative style; further; they provide the ideal language paradigms forexpressing constraints and integrity rules. The integration of these two worlds has beeninvestigated theoretically; firm bases for the coexistence of value-based and identity-basedconcepts within a unique data model have been established; and novel features have beenadded to logic programming languages in order to give them full power on semantically …,*,1993,1
MOOD An architecture for object oriented access to a relational data base,Marco Lugli; Luca Nini; Stefano Ceri,Abstract In this paper we describe MOOD; a system which may be used to easily andefficiently build C++ programs accessing a relational database. MOOD has its own datamodel; which is Object-Oriented; and supports object identity; generalization hierarchies;and object sharing; by processing schema definitions; the MOOD system builds a relationalschema and a C++ Class Library that enable the interaction between a C++ programmingenvironment and a conventional relational database. We associate a C++ class to eachclass in the MOOD schema. Methods of this class may be used to access; create or modifyMOOD objects. In particular; MOOD primitives provide tools for expressing complex; set-oriented queries to extract objects by traversing the MOOD schema along semantics links.These primitives generate SQL queries in order to extract relevant tuples and assign them …,*,1993,1

These datasets are typically used by biologists for validating orenriching their experiments; their content is documented by metadata. However; emphasison data sharing is not matched by accuracy in data documentation; metadata are notstandardized across the sources and often unstructured and incomplete. In this paper; wepropose a conceptual model of genomic metadata; whose purpose is to query theunderlying data sources for locating relevant experimental datasets. First; we analyze themost typical metadata attributes of genomic sources and define their semantic properties …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2017,*

Suchdesign can be adapted to two different kinds of data engines: the family of scientificdatabases (among them; SciDB) and the broader family of generic platforms (among them;Spark). Trade-offs are not obvious; scientific databases are expected to outperform genericplatforms when they use features which are embedded within their specialized design; butgeneric platforms are expected to outperform scientific databases on general-purposeoperations.

We illustrate a comprehensive model of the actions and strategies thatcan be exploited for progressively boosting the social engagement during the challengeevolution. The model studies the organizer-driven management of interactions amongplayers; and evaluates the effectiveness of each action in light of several other factors (time;repetition; third party actions; interplay between different social networks; and so on).

Link Analysis,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Ranking is perhaps the most important feature of a search engine; as it allows theuser to efficiently order the huge amount of pages matching a query according to theirrelevance to the user's information need. With respect to traditional textual search engines;Web information retrieval systems build ranking by combining at least two evidences ofrelevance: the degree of matching of a page—the content score—and the degree ofimportance of a page—the popularity score. While the content score can be calculated usingone of the information retrieval models described in Chap. 3; the popularity score can becalculated from an analysis of the indexed pages' hyperlink structure using one or more linkanalysis models. In this chapter we introduce the two most famous link analysis models;PageRank and HITS.,*,2013,*
Recommendation and Diversification for the Web,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Web search effectiveness is hampered by several factors; including the existence ofseveral similar resources; ambiguous queries posed by users; and the varied profiles andobjectives of users who submit the same query. This chapter focuses on recommendationand diversification techniques as possible solutions to these issues. Recommendationsystems aim at predicting the level of preferences of users towards some items; with thepurpose of suggesting ones they may like; among a set of elements they haven't consideredyet. Diversification is a technique that aims at removing redundancy in search results; withthe purpose of reducing the information overload and providing more satisfying and diverseinformation items to the user.

The main aspect of search engines is their ability to scale andmanage billions of indexed pages dispersed on the Web. We provide an architectural viewof the main elements of search engines; and we focus on their main components; namelythe crawling and indexing subsystems.,*,2013,*
Search Process and Interfaces,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Traditional information retrieval is based on a simple paradigm: driven by aninformation need; users seek information by composing a query; using a search system; thesystem; in turn; associates relevant documents to the query and returns them to the users.However; search is more a means than an end; and the needs behind an informationseeking process are typically diverse and articulated. Thus; interaction with search systemstypically involves several steps of refinement and exploration. Visual interfaces are designedto effectively support this iterative process; help users to understand and express theirinformation needs; and collect the results when the process ends. This chapter providesinsight into the main theoretical models used to describe the information seeking process;and offers an overview of the user interface components used by modern search engines.,*,2013,*

Build your complex search: social; behavioral; and micro-economic perspective on modern Web search,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon,ABSTRACT So far; Web search has been a playground for few giants. However; whiletraditional search engines are superb in their ability of extracting the Web pages that mostclosely match with user's keywords; they fail in going beyond such simple paradigm. On theother side; an increasing number of data sets is becoming available on the Web as (semi)structured data instead of userconsumable pages. Web search has huge potentials forimprovement thanks to the high quality of these data sources; but this can be achieved onlyby designing new search applications that federate those sources. To tackle the long tail ofuser requirements and tastes; the need arises for new ways of thinking and designingsearch applications: application providers (and perhaps even end users) will need to buildtheir own; customized search experiences; by combining search services available on the …,*,2011,*

Search Computing: Addressing Complex Search on the Web,Stefano Ceri; Marco Brambilla,Abstract Web search is considered a playground for a few giants—such as Google; Yahoo!and Bing—that relegate the other players to market niches. However; Web search is far fromsatisfying all information needs; because many search queries are complex; requireinformation integration; and go beyond what can be offered by a single Web page; on thesequeries; generalized search engines do not perform well enough. This paper addresses anew paradigm for search-driven data integration; called Search Computing; based oncombining data extraction from distinct sources and data integration by means of specializedintegration engines. The Search Computing project has the ambitious goal of lowering thetechnological barrier required for building complex search applications; thereby enablingthe development of many new applications which will cover relevant search needs.,*,2011,*

New Forms of Reasoning for the Semantic Web: Scalable & Dynamic,Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Jim Hendler; Zhisheng Huang,Initiatives like Linked Open Data have resulted in a rapid growth of the Web of data; and thisgrowth is expected to continue. While impressive progress has been made in recent years inscalable storing; querying; and reasoning with languages like RDFS and OWL; existingreasoning techniques fail to perform when applied at Web-scale; due to the quantities ofinstance data; expressiveness of the ontologies; or the inherent inconsistency andincompleteness of data on the Web. These problems of scale are increasingly compoundedby the appearance of highly dynamic data streams.

D4. 6.1–Strategies & Design for stream reasoning,Daniele Braga; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle,EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In this first 24 months of LarKC we have been extensivelyexperimenting with processing of RDF streams with C-SPARQL-the extension to SPARQLwe proposed in D3. 1. In D2. 6.1; we summarise; in the form of a paper-entitled “ContinuousQueries and Real-time Analysis of Social Semantic Data with C-SPARQL” accepted atSDOW 20091-the experiments that we conducted starting from the assumption that our C-SPARQL window-based selection over RDF Streams would outperform the standard filter-based selection that one can implement by storing the RDF stream and using SPARQL. Theexperiments provided evidence that this is the case; and allowed us to show the advantagesof using C-SPARQL in the field of Social Data analysis on the Web.,*,2010,*

Bio-Search Computing: Online Integration of Biomedical Search Results,Giorgio Ghisalberti; Marco Masseroli; Stefano Ceri,Abstract—In biomedicine and e-health; numerous questions can be addressed only bycomprehensively searching different types of data that are inherently ordered; or areassociated with ranked confidence values. Bio-Search Computing has been proposed tosupport the integration of the results of search engines with other data and computationalresources. In this work we report and discuss a case study of the use of a domainindependent search computing platform to describe well known bioinformatics resources assearch services; and for carrying out integrated analyses over the resulting services. Inparticular; this makes explicit how different ranked data can be integrated in a way that takesaccount of the ranked results from different types of data and analyses. In so doing; thepaper illustrates the use of ranking as a first class citizen for data integration in the life …,BioMed@ POLIMI: Twenty Years and Beyond,2010,*
Model-based service-oriented architectures for Internetworked Enterprises,Devis Bianchini; Marco Brambilla; Alessandro Campi; Cinzia Cappiello; Stefano Ceri; Marco Comuzzi; Valeria De Antonellis; Barbara Pernici; Pierluigi Plebani,Abstract Service-oriented architectures (SOA) provide the basis to (re) design businessprocesses in order to develop flexible applications where available services are dynamicallycomposed to satisfy business goals. The adoption of this type of architecture enables thedesign of information systems that connect IEs to each other to run collaborative businessprocesses. In fact; organizations can design service-based processes based either onsimple internal applications or on external services. This chapter provides models andmethods for the design and execution of service-based processes able to exploit all theservices offered in an IEs registry. This service registry contains services that need to bedefined with the same granularity and described via the same functional and non-functionalmodels. The alignment in process and service design and modeling is discussed in this …,*,2010,*

Cost-aware top-k join algorithms,Stefano Ceri; Davide Martinenghi; Marco Tagliasacchi,Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of joining ranked results produced by searchservices on the Web. We consider services that output data tuples sorted by score. We castthis problem as a generalization of the traditional rank aggregation problem; ie; combiningseveral ranked lists of objects to produce a single consensus ranking. The ranked lists maycontain a high number of objects; typically presented in pages; and accessing such pages iscostly. Therefore; algorithms should determine the best overall results without accessing allthe objects. Besides pagination of results; additional difficulties with respect to rankaggregation include the fact that the ranked lists do not; in general; rank the same set ofobjects; but rather heterogeneous sets of objects that may match on given join attributes toform a join tuple (here called combination). Each combination is assigned a combined …,*,2009,*

Early deployment technologies werevery unstable and immature; as a reaction; WebML was thought as a high level;implementation-independent conceptual model; and the associated design supportenvironment; called WebRatio [7]; has always been platform-independent; so as to adapt tofrequent technological changes. WebML is based upon orthogonal separation of concerns:content; interface logics; and presentation logics are defined as separate components. Themain innovation in WebML comes from the interface logics; that enables the computation ofWeb pages made up of logical components (units) interconnected by logical links (ie; notonly the units but also the links have a formal semantics); the computation is associated …,British National Conference on Databases,2007,*

The xMem Project: Semantic Memory of Web Interactions,Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Maristella Matera; Francesca Rizzo,Abstract Finding a previously visited page during a Web navigation is a very common andimportant kind of interaction. Although most commercial browsers incorporate historymechanisms; such mechanisms are typically very simple indexes of visited pages; sortedaccording to the time dimension. They are not very effective and are quite far from givingusers the impression of a semantically aware; longterm memory; as it is available to thehuman brain. In particular they lack associative; semantic-based mechanisms that areessential for supporting information retrieval. This paper introduces the xMem (ExtendedMemory Navigation) as a new method to access users' navigational history; based uponsemantic-based and associative accesses. Its aim is to imitate some of the features of thehuman memory; so as to give users a better understanding of the context of their …,WISM 2005,2005,*

MOOD,Marco Lugli; Luca Ninii; Stefano Ceri,Abstract. In this paper we describe MOOD; a system which may be used to easily andefficiently build C++ programs accessing a relational database. MOOD has its own datamodel; which is Object-Oriented; and supports object identity; generalization hierarchies;and object sharing; by processing schema definitions; the MOOD system builds a relationalschema and a C++ Class Library that enable the interaction between a C++ programmingenvironment and a conventional relational database. We associate a C++ class to eachclass in the MOOD schema. Methods of this class may be used to access; create or modifyMOOD objects. In particular; MOOD primitives provide tools for expressing complex; set-oriented queries to extract objects by traversing the MOOD schema along semantics links.These primitives generate SQL queries in order to extract relevant tuples and assign them …,LOGIDATA+: Deductive Databases with Complex Objects,1993,*

Prolog as a Query Language,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In Chap. 1 we provided an overview of the main reasons for the integration ofdatabase and logic programming technologies; and we established a comparison betweenthe main features of relational databases and logic programming languages. Here we willjust recall some important aspects of Prolog as a query language; these features essentiallyenrich the expressive power of classical query languages based on relational algebra orcalculus.,*,1990,*
Coupling Prolog Systems to Relational Databases,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In Chap. 3 we have seen that Prolog is a very expressive query language; one thatcan express queries with no counterpart in relational languages such as algebra or calculus.In this chapter; we describe how it is possible to build systems that interface Prolog todatabases; providing efficient data access.,*,1990,*
Evaluation Methods,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this chapter; we present methods for evaluating a Datalog program; namely; forgenerating the actual set of tuples which satisfy a given user's goal for a given set of Datalogrules. We deal with bottom-up and top-down evaluation methods in two separate sections.Evaluation methods are expressed using either of the logic and algebraic formalismsintroduced in the previous chapter; and in fact we do not stress the choice of formalism verymuch; given the equivalence between them.,*,1990,*
Classification of Optimization Methods for Datalog,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this chapter; we provide a classification of optimization methods for evaluatingDatalog goals. We use orthogonal classification criteria in order to identify various classes ofmethods; then; each class will be dealt with in a separate section. A systematic overview ofmethods is required; since optimization can be achieved using a variety of techniques; andunderstanding their relationships is not obvious.,*,1990,*

The reader who has a background in these topics can skip this chapter or part of it;perhaps after taking a look at the notation. The first section gives a description of the fundamentalconcepts of relational databases and relational algebra. The second section provides a briefintroduction to the language Prolog. We assume the reader to be familiar with the basic conceptsof first-order logic. Other aspects of logic programming will be treated in Chaps. 6 and 7; wherewe present a complete introduction to the language Datalog … The Relational Model was introducedby Codd in 1970 and represents; together with the Network and the Hierarchical models; oneof the three data models currently supported by most Database Management Systems(DBMS).

Logic Programming and Databases: An Overview,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract This book deals with the integration of logic programming and databases togenerate new types of systems; which extend the frontiers of computer science in animportant direction and fulfil the needs of new applications. Several names are used todescribe these systems: a) The term deductive database highlights the ability to use a logicprogramming style for expressing deductions concerning the content of a database. b) Theterm knowledge base management system (KBMS) highlights the ability to manage(complex) knowledge instead of (simple) data. c) The term expert database systemhighlights the ability to use expertise in a particular application domain to solve classes ofproblems; but having access over a large database.,*,1990,*
Syntax and Semantics of Datalog,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,In this chapter we give an exact syntactic and semantic definition of the Datalog querylanguage. First; in Sect.6.1; we formally define several basic concepts and introduce Datalogprograms as sets of Horn clauses. We also explain important notions; such as Herbrandbase; extensional database; substitution; and unification. In Sect. 6.2; we then define the purelylogical semantics of Datalog programs by using concepts of model theory. Model theory allowsus to define the concepts of logical truth and logical consequence in a very elegant and intuitivelycompre- hensible way. Using this theory; we are able to give a precise characterization of whata Datalog program computes. However; we do not explain how the output of a Datalog programcan be computed; deferring this subject to Chap. 7. Note that Datalog is with many respects asimplified version of Logic Pro- gramming. During our discussion; we point out some of …,*,1990,*
Proof Theory and Evaluation Paradigms of Datalog,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The aim of this chapter is to show how the answer to a Datalog program can becomputed. In order to achieve a computational approach to Datalog; in Sect. 7.1 we developthe proof theory of this language. We show how new facts can be inferred from anextensional database by use of a Datalog program. We then demonstrate that our proof-theoretic method is sound and complete; ie; that it computes exactly what it should accordingto the model-theoretic semantics of Datalog. The proof theory of Datalog leads to a firstalgorithm “INFER” for processing Datalog programs. This algorithm iteratively computes newfacts from facts that have already been established by using a forward chaining technique.,*,1990,*
Rewriting Methods,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this chapter we introduce a number of rewriting methods for Datalog programs.Section 10.1 presents rewriting methods that apply directly to Datalog programs: the MagicSets; Counting; Static Filtering and Semi-naive Evaluation by Rewriting. Section 10.2presents a structured approach to the optimization of algebraic systems; it consists of anumber of preliminary steps; after which the optimization methods of reduction of variablesand reduction of constants are applied.,*,1990,*

Parallel Hierarchical Evaluation of Transitive Closure Queries,Filippo Cacace; Stefano Ceri,Abstract This paper presents a new approach to parallel computation of transitive closurequeries using a semantic data fragmentation. Tuples of a large base relation denote edgesin a graph; which models a transportation network. We propose a fragmentation algorithmuhich produces a partitioning of the base relation into several fragments such that anyfragment corresponds to a subgraph. One fragment; called high-speed fragment; collects alledges which guarantee mazimum speed; these edges correspond to highways or tohighspeed inter-city trains. Thus; the fragmentation algorithm induces a hierarchicalrelationship between the high-speed fragment and all other fragments. With thisfragmentation; any query about paths connecting two nodes can be answered by using justthe fragments in which nodes are located and the high-speed fragment. In general; if …,*,*,*

Pattern Similarity Search in Genomic Sequences,Stefano Ceri; Marco Masseroli,Abstract—Genomics; with the high amount of heterogeneous data that it is generating; isopening many interesting practical and theoretical computational problems; one of them isthe search for a collections of genomic regions at given distances from each other; ie; apattern of genomic regions; along the whole genome. In this paper we present an optimizedpattern-search algorithm able to find efficiently; within a large set of genomic data; genomicregion sequences which are similar to a given pattern. We start with a base version of theproblem; which is solved using dynamic programming enhanced with an efficient window-based technique; then; we extend the algorithm to more complex scenarios with practicalapplications in revealing interesting and unknown regions of the genome; thus; making it animportant ingredient in supporting biological research. We apply our algorithm to …,*,*,*

A Framework for the Integration; Exploration and Search of Location-Based Data Services,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract. The widespread availability of smart phones and other locationaware; Web-enabled mobile devices paves the way to a huge set of applications that exploit userposition and geo-tagged information. Users expect their devices to provide richer usageexperience by integrating their local context with a wide range of general data sourcesavailable on the Web; therefore; applications must be able to support not only geo-localization; but also the integration of such contexts with information needs about genericdata resources. In this paper; we present the adaptation of a general search computingframework as suggested by the specificity of location-based data services; this affectsseveral layers of the framework; resulting in a conceptual model of geographic entities; theintegrated provisioning of spatial functions operating upon them; and finally a special …,*,*,*
Extending Search to Crowds,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Andrea Mauri,Abstract In many settings; the human opinion provided by an expert or knowledgeable usercan be more useful than factual information retrieved by a search engine. Search systemsdo not capture the subjective opinions and recommendations of friends; or fresh; online-provided information that require contextual or domain-specific expertise. In this paper wepropose an approach where search is complemented by online help by “special” crowds;selected among friends; experts; or people who are presently at a given location. We showhow a conventional search can interplay with a search of crowd opinions; so that the twosearch methods can support each other. For specifying and implementing our system; weuse a model-driven approach; in particular we define two models: the “Query Task Model”;representing the meta-model of the query that is submitted to the crowd and the …,*,*,*

Web-Integrated Smart City Infrastructure,Giovanni Malnati; Friedemann Mattern; Stefano Ceri,By 2050 most of the world's population will live in cities [42]; but the the urban population isalready overcoming the rural population; as shown in Figure 1.1. This demographic mutationleads to a growing size of cities; and consequently of their peripheries; producing anincreasingly environmental impact. Cities; in such a context; become the principal consumerof the world's annual energy needs [12] and of other essential resources (such as water;food; and productive land).,*,*,*

Calcolo Numerico,Giacomo Sacchetti; Stefano Ceri; Paolo Filippelli,Nel momento in cui abbiamo la necessità di risolvere con l'aiuto del computer un problematrovato nella vita reale; sorge la necessità di formalizzarlo attraverso modelli matematici.Con la soluzione degli stessi; siamo perciò in grado di determinare i risultati che possonoaddirittura permetterci la previsione di eventi futuri; o un analisi accurata del fenomenoformalizzato. Lo scopo del calcolo numerico è dunque quello di garantire il correttopassaggio dal modello matematico a una plausibile soluzione. Sono molteplici i casi in cuierrori causati da un errato utilizzo di modelli matematici hanno prodotto gravi dannieconomici e sociali.,*,*,*

Model-Driven Design and Deployment of Service-Enabled Web Applications loana Manolescu1 lNRlA Futurs-LRl; France,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali,Significant effort is currently invested in application integration; enabling business processesof different companies to interact and form complex multi-party processes. Web servicestandards; based on WSDL; have been adopted as process-to-process communicationparadigms. However; the conceptual modeling of applications using Web services has notyet been addressed. Interaction with Web services is often specified at the level of thesource code; thus; Web service interfaces are buried within a programmatic specification. Inthis paper; we argue that Web services should be considered as first-class citizens in thespecification of Web applications. Thus; service-enabled Web applications should benefitfrom the high-level modeling and automatic code generation techniques that have longbeen advocated for Web application design and implementation. To this end; we extend a …,*,*,*
SERVICE DISCOVERY WITH SWE-ET AND DIANE,Ulrich Küster; Andrea Turati; Maciej Zaremba; B König-Ries; D Cerizza; E Della Valle; M Brambilla; S Ceri; FM Facca; C Tziviskou,Abstract: Semantic service discovery and matchmaking has received increased attentionwithin the last years. Various approaches have been proposed but agreed upon criteria orcommon use and test cases to objectively evaluate such approaches are widely lacking. Inthis paper we present an in-depth comparison of the solutions to the discovery problemsdefined by the SWS-Challenge 2006. By means of this common and independentlydeveloped scenario we can develop a much better understanding for the appliedtechnologies in general; but also and in particular for the trade-offs involved in the differentapproaches.,*,*,*

2nd International Workshop on Logical Aspects and Applications of Integrity Constraints,Henning Christiansen; Davide Martinenghi; Marcelo Arenas; Andrea Calì; Stefano Ceri,Integrity constraints are commonly recognized as the tool for characterizing data semanticsand well-formedness in databases and information systems in general. As such; integrityconstraints apply to different contexts; such as relational and deductive databases; activedatabase systems; and XML document collections; and are relevant for several applications;including integrity control; data integration and semantic query optimization. LAAIC'06 is the2nd International Workshop on Logical Aspects and Applications of Integrity Constraints;and its goal is to gather experts in the field and to stimulate a constructive dialogue amongresearchers. It provides an international forum for the presentation of the most recent trends;and a common starting point to address the most pressing research problems. We haveselected eight high-quality; full papers for discussion and presentation in the workshop …,*,*,*

Web search-State of the art of Web service technologies and their ontological domains,Daniele Braga; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel,Search Engines assist the user in rapidly and effectively accessing and navigating contentspublished on the Web. They are among the most sophisticated and useful instrumentsavailable on the Internet. To underline their importance; it suffices to recognize that; to someextent; the problem of finding information on the Web can be rephrased as the problem ofknowing where search engines are; what they are designed to retrieve; and how to usethem. Two different types of engines have emerged so far: large-scale search engines anddomainspecific search engines. Large-scale search engines aim at addressing the wholewealth of data available on the Web without particular attention on the domains the datapertains to; domain-specific engines; on the other hand; narrow their attention to particulardomains and; thus; are more likely to quickly focus a search on relevant items in one …,*,*,*
