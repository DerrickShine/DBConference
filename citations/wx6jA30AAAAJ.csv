Adaptive scheduling of web transactions,Shenoda Guirguis; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Kirk Pruhs,In highly interactive dynamic web database systems; user satisfaction determines theirsuccess. In such systems; user requested web pages are dynamically created by executinga number of database queries or web transactions. In this paper; we model the interrelatedtransactions generating a web page as workflows and quantify the user satisfaction byassociating dynamic web pages with soft-deadlines. Further; we model the importance oftransactions in generating a page by associating different weights to transactions. Using thisframework; system success is measured in terms of minimizing the deviation from thedeadline (ie; tardiness) and also minimizing the weighted such deviation (ie; weightedtardiness). In order to efficiently support the materialization of dynamic web pages; wepropose ASETS∗; which is a parameter-free adaptive scheduling algorithm that …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Optimized processing of multiple aggregate continuous queries,Shenoda Guirguis; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract Data Streams Management Systems are designed to support monitoringapplications; which require the processing of hundreds of Aggregate Continuous Queries(ACQs). These ACQs typically have different time granularities; with possibly differentselection predicates and group-by attributes. In order to achieve scalability in the presenceof heavy workloads; in this paper; we introduce the concept of'Weaveability'as an indicator ofthe potential gains of sharing the processing of ACQs. We then propose Weave Share; acost-based optimizer that exploits weaveability to optimize the shared processing of ACQs.Our experimental analysis shows that Weave Share outperforms the alternative sharingschemes generating up to four orders of magnitude better quality plans. Finally; we describea practical implementation of the Weave Share optimizer.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,24
Three-level processing of multiple aggregate continuous queries,Shenoda Guirguis; Mohamed A Sharaf; Panos K Chrysanthis; Alexandros Labrinidis,Aggregate Continuous Queries (ACQs) are both a very popular class of Continuous Queries(CQs) and also have a potentially high execution cost. As such; optimizing the processing ofACQs is imperative for Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) to reach their fullpotential in supporting (critical) monitoring applications. For multiple ACQs that vary inwindow specifications and pre-aggregation filters; existing multiple ACQs optimizationschemes assume a processing model where each ACQ is computed as a final-aggregationof a sub-aggregation. In this paper; we propose a novel processing model for ACQs; calledTri Ops; with the goal of minimizing the repetition of operator execution at the sub-aggregation level. We also propose Tri Weave; a Tri Ops-aware multi-query optimizer. Weanalytically and experimentally demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,20
Admission control mechanisms for continuous queries in the cloud,Lory Al Moakar; Panos K Chrysanthis; Christine Chung; Shenoda Guirguis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panayiotis Neophytou; Kirk Pruhs,Amazon; Google; and IBM now sell cloud computing services.

A computation-oriented multimedia data streams model for content-based information retrieval,Shi-Kuo Chang; Lei Zhao; Shenoda Guirguis; Rohit Kulkarni,Abstract Multimedia applications nowadays are becoming prevalent. In the past therelational database model was generalized to the multimedia database model. Morerecently the relational database model was generalized to the data streams model; as thetechnology advanced and data became bulky and unbounded in size due to the utilization ofsensor networks. In this paper we take one more step of generalization by providing amultimedia data streams model. The objective is to furnish a formal framework to designmultimedia data streams (MMDS) schema for efficient content based information retrieval.We also extend the functional dependency theory and the normalization framework tohandle multimedia data streams. Finally we present algorithmic methods of generatingcontinuous multimedia queries along with examples for illustration.,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2010,9
Poster session: ASETS: A self-managing transaction scheduler,Mohamed A Sharaf; Shenoda Guirguis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Kirk Pruhs; Panos K Chrysanthis,User satisfaction determines the success of web-database applications. User satisfactioncan be expressed in terms of expected response time or expected delay. Given the burstyand unpredictable behavior of web user populations; we model user requests astransactions with soft-deadlines. For such a model of user requests with soft-deadlines; thehit ratio is not the most expressive metric. Instead; the average tardiness is a better measurein such cases. In this paper; we propose and evaluate an adaptive self-managing algorithmcalled ASETS; which optimizes for the average tardiness. ASETS prioritize resources asneeded in order to keep users satisfied under varying workloads. Our performanceevaluation shows ASETS to outperform both EDF and SRPT which are known to be optimalfor the under and over utilization system conditions respectively.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008.

Mining the Future: Predicting Itemsets' Support of Association Rules Mining,Shenoda Guirguis; Khalil M Ahmed; Nagwa M El Makky; Alaaeldin M Hafez,This paper proposes a novel research dimension in the field of data mining; which is miningthe future data before its arrival; or in other words: predicting association rules ahead beforethe arrival of the data. To achieve that; we need only predict the itemsets' support; uponwhich association rules could be easily produced. A time series analysis approach (MFTP)is proposed to perform itemsets' support prediction task. The proposed techniqueoutperforms other prediction techniques for short history. The conducted performance studyshowed good prediction accuracy and response time. Thus; we provide a new tool toprovide more information in the decision support field,Data Mining Workshops; 2006.

Competitive cost-savings in data stream management systems,Christine Chung; Shenoda Guirguis; Anastasia Kurdia,Abstract In Continuous Data Analytics and in monitoring applications; hundreds of similarAggregate Continuous Queries (ACQs) are registered at the Data Stream ManagementSystem (DSMS) to continuously monitor the infinite input stream of data tuples. Optimizingthe processing of these ACQs is crucial in order for the DSMS to operate at the adequaterequired scalability. One optimization technique is to share the results of partial aggregationoperations between different ACQs on the same data stream. However; finding the queryexecution plan that attains maximum reduction in total plan cost is computationallyexpensive. Weave Share; a multiple ACQs optimizer that computes query plans in a greedyfashion; was recently shown in experiments to achieve more than an order of magnitudeimprovement over the best existing alternatives.

Scalable processing of multiple aggregate continuous queries,Shenoda Guirguis,Abstract Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) were developed to be at the heart ofevery monitoring application. Monitoring applications typically register hundreds ofContinuous Queries (CQs) in DSMSs in order to continuously process unbounded datastreams to detect events of interest. DSMSs must be designed to efficiently handleunbounded streams with large volumes of data and large numbers of CQs; ie; exhibitscalability. This need for scalability means that the underlying processing techniques aDSMS adopts should be optimized for high throughput (ie; tuple output rate). Towards this;two main approaches were proposed in the literature:(1) Multiple Query Optimization (MQO)and (2) Scheduling. In this dissertation we focus on optimizing the processing of multipleAggregate Continuous Queries (ACQs); given their high processing cost and popularity in …,*,2011,1

Auction-based Admission Control for Continuous Queries in a Multi-Tenant DSMS,Lory Al Moakar; Panos K Chrysanthis; Christine Chung; Shenoda Guirguis; Alexandros Labrinidis; Panayiotis Neophytou; Kirk Pruhs,Abstract The growing popularity of monitoring applications and “Big Data” analytics used bya variety of users will leadto a multi-tenant data stream management system. This paperdeals with the problem of admission control ofcontinuous queries; where the streamprocessing resources are sold to the end users. We employ variable pricingby means ofauction-based mechanisms. The admission control auction mechanism determines whichqueries toadmit; and how much to charge the user for each query in a way that maximizessystem revenue. The admissionmechanism is required to be strategyproof and sybil-immune; incentivizing users to use the system honestly.

BronzeGate: real-time transactional data obfuscation for GoldenGate,Shenoda Guirguis; Alok Pareek,Abstract Data privacy laws have appeared recently; such as the HIPAA laws for protectingmedical records; and the PCI guidelines for protecting Credit Card information. Data privacycan be defined as maintaining the privacy of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) fromunauthorized accessing. PII includes any piece of data that can be used alone; or inconjunction with additional information; to uniquely identify an individual. Examples of suchinformation include national identification numbers; credit card numbers; as well as financialand medical records. Access control methods and data encryption provide a level of dataprotection from unauthorized access; however; it is not enough; it does not prohibit identitythefts.

DSAF: A Data Stream driven Accelerating Firewall,Subrata Acharya; Shenoda Guirguis,Stream processing engines are a paradigm of today's system software. Such systems allowthe user or the system administrator to analyze and respond to real-time requests in fractionof seconds. The data steam management concept was introduced in [1] and further a fullblown stream management system was proposed by [3]. The tenet of this research is tostudy the application of such systems to the network monitoring and Intrusion DetectionSystems (IDSs); specially in optimizing centralized and distributed firewall operation. Multi-dimensional packet filtering is a very well-known NP complete problem [10]. Furthermore; asnetwork speed increases there is a huge demand for building fast packet filteringmechanisms. But; the size limitation in hardware based approaches [9]; puts the onus onsystem researchers to search for better software design to optimize multi-dimensional …,*,*,*
