Online topic-aware influence maximization,Shuo Chen; Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Kian-lee Tan; Jinhui Tang,Abstract Influence maximization; whose objective is to select k users (called seeds) from asocial network such that the number of users influenced by the seeds (called influencespread) is maximized; has attracted significant attention due to its widespread applications;such as viral marketing and rumor control. However; in real-world social networks; usershave their own interests (which can be represented as topics) and are more likely to beinfluenced by their friends (or friends' friends) with similar topics. We can increase theinfluence spread by taking into consideration topics. To address this problem; we study topic-aware influence maximization; which; given a topic-aware influence maximization (TIM)query; finds k seeds from a social network such that the topic-aware influence spread of thek seeds is maximized. Our goal is to enable online TIM queries. Since the topic-aware …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,70
A hybrid machine-crowdsourcing system for matching web tables,Ju Fan; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Wang-Chiew Tan; Meihui Zhang,The Web is teeming with rich structured information in the form of HTML tables; whichprovides us with the opportunity to build a knowledge repository by integrating these tables.An essential problem of web data integration is to discover semantic correspondencesbetween web table columns; and schema matching is a popular means to determine thesemantic correspondences. However; conventional schema matching techniques are notalways effective for web table matching due to the incompleteness in web tables. In thispaper; we propose a two-pronged approach for web table matching that effectivelyaddresses the above difficulties. First; we propose a concept-based approach that mapseach column of a web table to the best concept; in a well-developed knowledge base; thatrepresents it. This approach overcomes the problem that sometimes values of two web …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,67
Seal: Spatio-textual similarity search,Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Lizhu Zhou; Shanshan Chen; Jun Hu,Abstract Location-based services (LBS) have become more and more ubiquitous recently.Existing methods focus on finding relevant points-of-interest (POIs) based on users'locations and query keywords. Nowadays; modern LBS applications generate a new kind ofspatio-textual data; regions-of-interest (ROIs); containing region-based spatial informationand textual description; eg; mobile user profiles with active regions and interest tags. Tosatisfy search requirements on ROIs; we study a new research problem; called spatio-textualsimilarity search: Given a set of ROIs and a query ROI; we find the similar ROIs byconsidering spatial overlap and textual similarity. Spatio-textual similarity search has manyimportant applications; eg; social marketing in location-aware social networks. It calls for anefficient search method to support large scales of spatio-textual data in LBS systems. To …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,64
icrowd: An adaptive crowdsourcing framework,Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-lee Tan; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Crowdsourcing is widely accepted as a means for resolving tasks that machines arenot good at. Unfortunately; Crowdsourcing may yield relatively low-quality results if there isno proper quality control. Although previous studies attempt to eliminate" bad" workers byusing qualification tests; the accuracies estimated from qualifications may not be accurate;because workers have diverse accuracies across tasks. Thus; the quality of the results couldbe further improved by selectively assigning tasks to the workers who are well acquaintedwith the tasks. To this end; we propose an adaptive crowdsourcing framework; callediCrowd. iCrowd on-the-fly estimates accuracies of a worker by evaluating her performanceon the completed tasks; and predicts which tasks the worker is well acquainted with. When aworker requests for a task; iCrowd assigns her a task; to which the worker has the highest …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,60
Interactive SQL query suggestion: Making databases user-friendly,Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Lizhu Zhou,SQL is a classical and powerful tool for querying relational databases. However; it is ratherhard for inexperienced users to pose SQL queries; as they are required to be proficient inSQL syntax and have a thorough understanding of the underlying schema. To give usersgratification; we propose SQLSUGG; an effective and user-friendly keyword-based methodto help various users formulate SQL queries. SQLSUGG suggests SQL queries as userstype in keywords; and can save users' typing efforts and help users avoid tedious SQLdebugging. To achieve high suggestion effectiveness; we propose queryable templates tomodel the structures of SQL queries. We propose a template ranking model to suggesttemplates relevant to query keywords. We generate SQL queries from each suggestedtemplate based on the degree of matchings between keywords and attributes. For …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,41
Location-aware instant search,Ruicheng Zhong; Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract Location-Based Services (LBS) have been widely accepted by mobile usersrecently. Existing LBS-based systems require users to type in complete keywords. Howeverfor mobile users it is rather difficult to type in complete keywords on mobile devices. Toalleviate this problem; in this paper we study the location-aware instant search problem;which returns users location-aware answers as users type in queries letter by letter. Themain challenge is to achieve high interactive speed. To address this challenge; in this paperwe propose a novel index structure; prefix-region tree (called PR-Tree); to efficiently supportlocation-aware instant search. PR-Tree is a tree-based index structure which seamlesslyintegrates the textual description and spatial information to index the spatial data. Using thePR-Tree; we develop efficient algorithms to support single prefix queries and multi …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,28
Personalizing web page recommendation via collaborative filtering and topic-aware markov model,Qingyan Yang; Ju Fan; Jianyong Wang; Lizhu Zhou,Web-page recommendation is to predict the next request of pages that Web users arepotentially interested in when surfing the Web. This technique can guide Web users to findmore useful pages without asking for them explicitly and has attracted much attention in thecommunity of Web mining. However; few studies on Web page recommendation considerpersonalization; which is an indispensable feature to meet various preferences of users. Inthis paper; we propose a personalized Web page recommendation model called PIGEON(abbr. for PersonalIzed web paGe rEcommendatiON) via collaborative filtering and a topic-aware Markov model. We propose a graph-based iteration algorithm to discover users'interested topics; based on which user similarities are measured.

Suggesting topic-based query terms as you type,Ju Fan; Hao Wu; Guoliang Li; Lizhu Zhou,Query term suggestion that interactively expands the queries is an indispensable techniqueto help users formulate high-quality queries and has attracted much attention in thecommunity of web search. Existing methods usually suggest terms based on statistics indocuments as well as query logs and external dictionaries; and they neglect the fact that thetopic information is very crucial because it helps retrieve topically relevant documents. Togive users gratification; we propose a novel term suggestion method: as the user types inqueries letter by letter; we suggest the terms that are topically coherent with the query andcould retrieve relevant documents instantly. For effectively suggesting highly relevant terms;we propose a generative model by incorporating the topical coherence of terms. The modellearns the topics from the underlying documents based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation …,Web Conference (APWEB); 2010 12th International Asia-Pacific,2010,24
Crowdop: Query optimization for declarative crowdsourcing systems,Ju Fan; Meihui Zhang; Stanley Kok; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,We study the query optimization problem in declarative crowdsourcing systems. Declarativecrowdsourcing is designed to hide the complexities and relieve the user of the burden ofdealing with the crowd. The user is only required to submit an SQL-like query and thesystem takes the responsibility of compiling the query; generating the execution plan andevaluating in the crowdsourcing marketplace. A given query can have many alternativeexecution plans and the difference in crowdsourcing cost between the best and the worstplans may be several orders of magnitude. Therefore; as in relational database systems;query optimization is important to crowdsourcing systems that provide declarative queryinterfaces. In this paper; we propose CROWDOP; a cost-based query optimization approachfor declarative crowdsourcing systems. CROWDOP considers both cost and latency in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,21

Competence-Based Song Recommendation: Matching Songs to One’s Singing Skill,Kuang Mao; Lidan Shou; Ju Fan; Gang Chen; Mohan S Kankanhalli,Singing is a popular social activity and a pleasant way of expressing one's feelings. Oneimportant reason for unsuccessful singing performance is because the singer fails to choosea suitable song. In this paper; we propose a novel competence-based songrecommendation framework for the purpose of singing. It is distinguished from most existingmusic recommendation systems which rely on the computation of listeners' interests orsimilarity. We model a singer's vocal competence as a singer profile; which takes voice pitch;intensity; and quality into consideration. Then we propose techniques to acquire singerprofiles. We also present a song profile model which is used to construct a human annotatedsong database. Then we propose a learning-to-rank scheme for recommending songs by asinger profile. Finally; we introduce a reduced singer profile which can greatly simplify the …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2015,11
CDB: optimizing queries with crowd-based selections and joins,Guoliang Li; Chengliang Chai; Ju Fan; Xueping Weng; Jian Li; Yudian Zheng; Yuanbing Li; Xiang Yu; Xiaohang Zhang; Haitao Yuan,Abstract Crowdsourcing database systems have been proposed to leverage crowd-poweredoperations to encapsulate the complexities of interacting with the crowd. Existing systemssuffer from two major limitations. Firstly; in order to optimize a query; they often adopt thetraditional tree model to select an optimized table-level join order. However; the tree modelprovides a coarse-grained optimization; which generates the same order for different joinedtuples and limits the optimization potential that different joined tuples can be optimized bydifferent orders. Secondly; they mainly focus on optimizing the monetary cost. In fact; thereare three optimization goals (ie; smaller monetary cost; lower latency; and higher quality) incrowdsourcing; and it calls for a system to enable multi-goal optimization. To address thelimitations; we develop a crowd-powered database system CDB that supports crowd …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,9

To alleviate this problem; wedevelop an integrative healthcare analytics system called GEMINI which allows point of careanalytics for doctors where real-time usable and relevant information of their patients arerequired through the questions they asked about the patients they are caring for. GEMINIextracts data of each patient from various data sources and stores them as information in apatient profile graph. The data sources are complex and varied consisting of both structureddata (such as; patients' demographic data; laboratory results and medications) andunstructured data (such as; doctors' notes).

A user-friendly patent search paradigm,Yang Cao; Ju Fan; Guoliang Li,As an important operation for finding existing relevant patents and validating a new patentapplication; patent search has attracted considerable attention recently. However; manyusers have limited knowledge about the underlying patents; and they have to use a try-and-see approach to repeatedly issue different queries and check answers; which is a verytedious process. To address this problem; in this paper; we propose a new user-friendlypatent search paradigm; which can help users find relevant patents more easily and improveuser search experience. We propose three effective techniques; error correction; topic-based query suggestion; and query expansion; to improve the usability of patent search. Wealso study how to efficiently find relevant answers from a large collection of patents. We firstpartition patents into small partitions based to their topics and classes.

Song recommendation for social singing community,Kuang Mao; Ju Fan; Lidan Shou; Gang Chen; Mohan Kankanhalli,Abstract Nowadays; an increasing number of singing enthusiasts upload their cover songsand share their performances in online social singing communities. They can also listen andrate other users' song renderings. An important feature of the social singing communities isto recommend appropriate singing-songs which users are able to perform excellently. In thispaper; we propose a singing-song recommendation framework to make songrecommendation in social singing community. Instead of recommending songs that peoplelike to listen; we recommend suitable songs that people can sing well. We propose todiscover the song difficulty orderings from the song performance ratings of each user. Wetransform the difficulty orderings into a difficulty graph and propose an iterative inferencealgorithm to make singing-song recommendation on the difficulty graph.

TsingNUS: A location-based service system towards live city,Guoliang Li; Nan Zhang; Ruicheng Zhong; Sitong Liu; Weihuang Huang; Ju Fan; Kian-Lee Tan; Lizhu Zhou; Jianhua Feng,Abstract We present our system towards live city; called TsingNUS; aiming to provide userswith more user-friendly location-aware search experiences. TsingNUS crawls location-based user-generated content from the Web (eg; Foursquare and Twitter); cleans andintegrates them to provide users with rich well-structured data. TsingNUS provides threeuser-friendly search paradigms: location-aware instant search; location-aware similaritysearch and direction-aware search. Instant search returns relevant answers instantly asusers type in queries letter by letter; which can help users to save typing efforts significantly.Location-aware similarity search enables fuzzy matching between queries and theunderlying data; which can tolerate typing errors.

Distribution-aware crowdsourced entity collection,Ju Fan; Zhewei Wei; Dongxiang Zhang; Jingru Yang; Xiaoyong Du,The problem of crowdsourced entity collection solicits people (aka workers) to completemissing data in a database and has witnessed many applications in knowledge basecompletion and enterprise data collection. Although previous studies have attempted toaddress the “open world” challenge of crowdsourced entity collection; they do not pay muchattention to the “distribution” of the collected entities. Evidently; in many real applications;users may have distribution requirements on the collected entities; eg; even spatialdistribution when collecting points-of-interest. In this paper; we study a new researchproblem; distribution-aware crowdsourced entity collection (CROWDDEC): Given anexpected distribution wrt an attribute (eg; region or year); it aims to collect a set of entities viacrowdsourcing and minimize the difference of the entity distribution from the expected …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,4
Discovering your selling points: Personalized social influential tags exploration,Yuchen Li; Ju Fan; Dongxiang Zhang; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Social influence has attracted significant attention owing to the prevalence of socialnetworks (SNs). In this paper; we study a new social influence problem; called personalizedsocial tags exploration (PITEX); to help any user in the SN explore how she influences thenetwork. Given a target user; it finds a size-k tag set that maximizes this user's socialinfluence. We prove the problem is NP-hard to be approximated within any constant ratio. Tosolve it; we introduce a sampling-based framework; which has an approximation ratio of 1-εover 1+ ε with high probabilistic guarantee. To speedup the computation; we devise moreefficient sampling techniques and propose best-effort exploration to quickly prune tag setswith small influence. To further enable instant exploration; we devise a novel index structureand develop effective pruning and materialization techniques.

Processing Long Queries Against Short Text: Top-k Advertisement Matching in News Stream Applications,Dongxiang Zhang; Yuchen Li; Ju Fan; Lianli Gao; Fumin Shen; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract Many real applications in real-time news stream advertising call for efficientprocessing of long queries against short text. In such applications; dynamic news feeds areregarded as queries to match against an advertisement (ad) database for retrieving the kmost relevant ads. The existing approaches to keyword retrieval cannot work well in thissearch scenario when queries are triggered at a very high frequency. To address theproblem; we introduce new techniques to significantly improve search performance. First; wedevise a two-level partitioning for tight upper bound estimation and a lazy evaluationscheme to delay full evaluation of unpromising candidates; which can bring three to fourtimes performance boosting in a database with 7 million ads. Second; we propose a novelrank-aware block-oriented inverted index to further improve performance. In this index …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2017,1
Crowdsourcing-Assisted Query Structure Interpretation.,Jun Han; Ju Fan; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract Structured Web search incorporating data from structured sources into searchengine results has attracted much attention from both academic and industrial communities.To understand user's intent; query structure interpretation is proposed to analyze thestructure of queries in a query log and map query terms to the semantically relevantattributes of data sources in a target domain. Existing methods assume all queries should beclassified to the target domain; and thus they are limited when interpreting queries fromdifferent domains in real query logs. To address the problem; we introduce a human-machine hybrid method by utilizing crowdsourcing platforms. Our method selects a smallnumber of query terms and asks the crowdsourcing workers to interpret them; and theninfers the interpretations based on the crowdsourcing results.

An effective approach for searching closest sentence translations from the web,Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract There are large numbers of well-translated sentence pairs on the Web; which canbe used for translating sentences in different languages. It is an interesting problem tosearch the closest sentence translations from the Web for high-quality translation; which hasattracted significant attention recently. However; it is not straightforward to develop aneffective approach; as this task heavily depends on the effectiveness of the similarity modelwhich is used to quantify the similarity between two sentences. In this paper; we proposeseveral optimization techniques to address this problem. We devise a phrase-based modelto quantify the similarity between two sentences. We judiciously select high-quality phrasesfrom sentences; which can capture the key features of sentences and thus can be used toquantify similarity between sentences.

Measuring similarity of chinese web databases based on category hierarchy,Juan Liu; Ju Fan; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract The amount of high-quality data in the Web databases has been increasingdramatically. To utilize such wealth of information; measuring the similarity betweenWebdatabases has been proposed for many applications; such as clustering and top-krecommendation. Most of the existing methods use the text information either in theinterfaces of Web databases or in the Web pages where the interfaces are located; torepresent the Web databases. These methods have the limitation that the text may contain alot of noisy words; which are rarely discriminative and cannot capture the characteristics ofthe Web databases. To better measure the similarity between Web databases; we introducea novel Web database similarity method.
