Content-based image retrieval: theory and applications.,Ricardo da Silva Torres; Alexandre X Falcao,Abstract: Advances in data storage and image acquisition technologies have enabled thecreation of large image datasets. In this scenario; it is necessary to develop appropriateinformation systems to efficiently manage these collections. The commonest approachesuse the so-called Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems. Basically; these systemstry to retrieve images similar to a user-defined specification or pattern (eg; shape sketch;image example). Their goal is to support image retrieval based on content properties (eg;shape; color; texture); usually encoded into feature vectors. One of the main advantages ofthe CBIR approach is the possibility of an automatic retrieval process; instead of thetraditional keyword-based approach; which usually requires very laborious and time-consuming previous annotation of database images. The CBIR technology has been …,RITA,2006,275
A genetic programming framework for content-based image retrieval,Ricardo da S Torres; Alexandre X Falcão; Marcos A Gonçalves; João P Papa; Baoping Zhang; Weiguo Fan; Edward A Fox,Abstract The effectiveness of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems can beimproved by combining image features or by weighting image similarities; as computed frommultiple feature vectors. However; feature combination do not make sense always and thecombined similarity function can be more complex than weight-based functions to bettersatisfy the users' expectations. We address this problem by presenting a GeneticProgramming framework to the design of combined similarity functions. Our method allowsnonlinear combination of image similarities and is validated through several experiments;where the images are retrieved based on the shape of their objects. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that the GP framework is suitable for the design of effective combinationsfunctions.,Pattern Recognition,2009,196
Comparative study of global color and texture descriptors for web image retrieval,Otávio AB Penatti; Eduardo Valle; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract This paper presents a comparative study of color and texture descriptorsconsidering the Web as the environment of use. We take into account the diversity and large-scale aspects of the Web considering a large number of descriptors (24 color and 28 texturedescriptors; including both traditional and recently proposed ones). The evaluation is madeon two levels: a theoretical analysis in terms of algorithms complexities and an experimentalcomparison considering efficiency and effectiveness aspects. The experimental comparisoncontrasts the performances of the descriptors in small-scale datasets and in a largeheterogeneous database containing more than 230 thousand images. Although there is asignificant correlation between descriptors performances in the two settings; there arenotable deviations; which must be taken into account when selecting the descriptors for …,Journal of visual communication and image representation,2012,177
A graph-based approach for multiscale shape analysis,R da S Torres; Alexandre X Falcao; L da F Costa,Abstract This paper presents two shape descriptors; multiscale fractal dimension andcontour saliences; using a graph-based approach—the image foresting transform. Itintroduces a robust approach to locate contour saliences from the relation between contourand skeleton. The contour salience descriptor consists of a vector; with salience location andvalue along the contour; and a matching algorithm. We compare both descriptors with fractaldimension; Fourier descriptors; moment invariants; Curvature Scale Space and Beam AngleStatistics regarding to their invariance to object characteristics that belong to a same class(compact-ability) and to their ability to separate objects of distinct classes (separability).,Pattern Recognition,2004,166
Contour salience descriptors for effective image retrieval and analysis,R da S Torres; Alexandre X Falcão,Abstract This work exploits the resemblance between content-based image retrieval andimage analysis with respect to the design of image descriptors and their effectiveness. In thiscontext; two shape descriptors are proposed: contour saliences and segment saliences.Contour saliences revisits its original definition; where the location of concave points was aproblem; and provides a robust approach to incorporate concave saliences. Segmentsaliences introduces salience values for contour segments; making it possible to use anoptimal matching algorithm as distance function. The proposed descriptors are comparedwith convex contour saliences; curvature scale space; and beam angle statistics using a fishdatabase with 11;000 images organized in 1100 distinct classes. The results indicatesegment saliences as the most effective descriptor for this particular application and …,Image and Vision Computing,2007,131
Vison: Video summarization for online applications,Jurandy Almeida; Neucimar J Leite; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract Recent advances in technology have increased the availability of video data;creating a strong requirement for efficient systems to manage those materials.

Visual structures for image browsing,Ricardo S Torres; Celmar G Silva; Claudia B Medeiros; Heloisa V Rocha,Abstract Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) presents several challenges and has beensubject to extensive research from many domains; such as image processing or databasesystems. Database researchers are concerned with indexing and querying; whereas imageprocessing experts worry about extracting appropriate image descriptors. Comparativelylittle work has been done on designing user interfaces for CBIR systems. This; in turn; has aprofound effect on these systems since the concept of image similarity is strongly influencedby user perception. This paper describes an initial effort to fill this gap; combining recentresearch in CBIR and Information Visualization; studied from a Human-Computer Interfaceperspective. It presents two visualization techniques based on Spiral and Concentric Ringsimplemented in a CBIR system to explore query results. The approach is centered on …,Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2003,86
Relevance feedback based on genetic programming for image retrieval,CD Ferreira; JA Santos; R da S Torres; MA Gonçalves; RC Rezende; Weiguo Fan,Abstract This paper presents two content-based image retrieval frameworks with relevancefeedback based on genetic programming. The first framework exploits only the userindication of relevant images. The second one considers not only the relevant but also theimages indicated as non-relevant. Several experiments were conducted to validate theproposed frameworks. These experiments employed three different image databases andcolor; shape; and texture descriptors to represent the content of database images. Theproposed frameworks were compared; and outperformed six other relevance feedbackmethods regarding their effectiveness and efficiency in image retrieval tasks.,Pattern Recognition Letters,2011,78
Multiscale classification of remote sensing images,Jefersson Alex Dos Santos; Philippe-Henri Gosselin; Sylvie Philipp-Foliguet; Ricardo da S Torres; Alexandre Xavier Falao,A huge effort has been applied in image classification to create high-quality thematic mapsand to establish precise inventories about land cover use. The peculiarities of remotesensing images (RSIs) combined with the traditional image classification challenges madeRSI classification a hard task. Our aim is to propose a kind of boost-classifier adapted tomultiscale segmentation. We use the paradigm of boosting; whose principle is to combineweak classifiers to build an efficient global one. Each weak classifier is trained for one levelof the segmentation and one region descriptor. We have proposed and tested weakclassifiers based on linear support vector machines (SVM) and region distances provided bydescriptors. The experiments were performed on a large image of coffee plantations. Wehave shown in this paper that our approach based on boosting can detect the scale and …,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,2012,73
Image re-ranking and rank aggregation based on similarity of ranked lists,Daniel Carlos GuimarãEs Pedronette; Ricardo Da S Torres,Abstract In Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems; ranking accurately collectionimages is of great relevance. Users are interested in the returned images placed at the firstpositions; which usually are the most relevant ones. Collection images are ranked inincreasing order of their distance to the query pattern (eg; query image) defined by users.Therefore; the effectiveness of these systems is very dependent on the accuracy of thedistance function adopted. In this paper; we present a novel context-based approach forredefining distances and later re-ranking images aiming to improve the effectiveness ofCBIR systems. In our approach; distances among images are redefined based on thesimilarity of their ranked lists. Conducted experiments involving shape; color; and texturedescriptors demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.,Pattern Recognition,2013,72
Visual word spatial arrangement for image retrieval and classification,Otávio AB Penatti; Fernanda B Silva; Eduardo Valle; Valerie Gouet-Brunet; Ricardo Da S Torres,Abstract We present word spatial arrangement (WSA); an approach to represent the spatialarrangement of visual words under the bag-of-visual-words model. It lies in a simple ideawhich encodes the relative position of visual words by splitting the image space intoquadrants using each detected point as origin. WSA generates compact feature vectors andis flexible for being used for image retrieval and classification; for working with hard or softassignment; requiring no pre/post processing for spatial verification. Experiments in theretrieval scenario show the superiority of WSA in relation to Spatial Pyramids. Experimentsin the classification scenario show a reasonable compromise between those methods; withSpatial Pyramids generating larger feature vectors; while WSA provides adequateperformance with much more compact features. As WSA encodes only the spatial …,Pattern Recognition,2014,69

Our projects with bio-scientistshave led us to develop a scientific workflow infrastructure named WOODSS. This frameworkhas two main objectives in mind: to help scientists to specify and annotate their models andexperiments; and to document collaborative efforts in scientific activities. In both contexts;workflows are annotated and stored in a database. This" annotated scientific workflow"database is treated as a repository of (sometimes incomplete) approaches to solvingscientific problems. Thus; it serves two purposes: allows comparison of distinct solutions to aproblem; and their designs; and provides reusable and executable building blocks toconstruct new scientific workflows; to meet specific needs.

Shape feature extraction and description based on tensor scale,Fernanda A Andaló; Paulo AV Miranda; R da S Torres; Alexandre X Falcão,Abstract Tensor scale is a morphometric parameter that unifies the representation of localstructure thickness; orientation; and anisotropy; which can be used in several computervision and image processing tasks. In this article; we exploit this concept for binary imagesand propose a shape salience detector and a shape descriptor—Tensor Scale Descriptorwith Influence Zones. It also introduces a robust method to compute tensor scale; using agraph-based approach—the Image Foresting Transform.

In our proposal; users are able to interact with the classification system;indicating regions of interest (and those which are not). This feedback information isemployed by a genetic programming approach to learning user preferences and combiningimage region descriptors that encode spectral and texture properties.

Learning to rank for content-based image retrieval,Fabio F Faria; Adriano Veloso; Humberto M Almeida; Eduardo Valle; Ricardo da S Torres; Marcos A Gonçalves; Wagner Meira Jr,Abstract In Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR); accurately ranking the returned images isof paramount importance; since users consider mostly the topmost results. The typicalranking strategy used by many CBIR systems is to employ image content descriptors; so thatreturned images that are most similar to the query image are placed higher in the rank.While this strategy is well accepted and widely used; improved results may be obtained bycombining multiple image descriptors. In this paper we explore this idea; and introducealgorithms that learn to combine information coming from different descriptors. The proposedlearning to rank algorithms are based on three diverse learning techniques: Support VectorMachines (CBIR-SVM); Genetic Programming (CBIR-GP); and Association Rules (CBIR-AR). Eighteen image content descriptors (color; texture; and shape information) are used …,Proceedings of the international conference on Multimedia information retrieval,2010,58

In this paper; weformalize and generalize DL exploring services within a DL theory. We develop theorems toindicate that browsing and searching can be converted or mapped to each other undercertain conditions. The theorems guide the design and implementation of exploring servicesfor an integrated archaeological DL; ETANA-DL.

A digital library framework for biodiversity information systems,Ricardo da S Torres; Claudia Bauzer Medeiros; Marcos André Gonçcalves; Edward A Fox,Abstract Biodiversity Information Systems (BISs) involve all kinds of heterogeneous data;which include ecological and geographical features. However; available informationsystems offer very limited support for managing these kinds of data in an integrated fashion.Furthermore; such systems do not fully support image content (eg; photos of landscapes orliving organisms) management; a requirement of many BIS end-users. In order to meet theirneeds; these users—eg; biologists; environmental experts—often have to alternate betweenseparate biodiversity and image information systems to combine information extracted fromthem. This hampers the addition of new data sources; as well as cooperation amongscientists. The approach provided in this paper to meet these issues is based on takingadvantage of advances in digital library innovations to integrate networked collections of …,International Journal on Digital Libraries,2006,54

We propose theuse of different types of Wavelets for representing and describing the textural informationpresented in fingerprint images in a compact way. For that purpose; the feature vectors usedto characterize the fingerprints are obtained by computing the mean and the standarddeviation of the decomposed images in the wavelet domain. These feature vectors are usedboth to retrieve the most similar fingerprints; given a query image; and their indexation isused to reduce the search spaces of candidate images. The different types of Wavelets usedin our study include: Gabor wavelets; tree-structured wavelet decomposition using both …,Journal of computational and applied mathematics,2009,48
Comparison of video sequences with histograms of motion patterns,Jurandy Almeida; Neucimar J Leite; Ricardo da S Torres,Making efficient use of video information requires the development of a video signature anda similarity measure to rapidly identify similar videos in a huge database.

Rotation-invariant and scale-invariant steerable pyramid decomposition for texture image retrieval,Javier A Montoya-Zegarra; Neucimar J Leite; Ricardo da S Torres,This paper proposes a new rotation-invariant and scale-invariant representation for textureimage retrieval based on steerable pyramid decomposition. By calculating the mean andstandard deviation of decomposed image subbands; the texture feature vectors areextracted. To obtain rotation or scale invariance; the feature elements are aligned byconsidering either the dominant orientation or dominant scale of the input textures.Experiments were conducted on the Brodatz database aiming to compare our approach tothe conventional steerable pyramid decomposition; and a proposal for texturecharacterization based on Gabor wavelets with regard to their retrieval effectiveness.Results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in rotated and scaled imagedatasets.,Computer Graphics and Image Processing; 2007.

By using a new rotation-invariant andscale-invariant image descriptor based on steerable pyramid decomposition; and a novelmulticlass recognition method based on optimum-path forest; a new texture recognitionsystem is proposed. By combining the discriminating power of our image descriptor andclassifier; our system uses small-size feature vectors to characterize texture images withoutcompromising overall classification rates. State-of-the-art recognition results are furtherpresented on the Brodatz data set. High classification rates demonstrate the superiority ofthe proposed system.,EURASIP journal on advances in signal processing,2008,40

In those applications; it is fundamental to identify andunderstand trends and patterns in space occupation. However; the identification andrecognition of crop regions in remote sensing images are not trivial tasks yet. In high-resolution image analysis and recognition; many of the problems are related to therepresentation scale of the data; and to both the size and the representativeness of thetraining set.

Exploiting pairwise recommendation and clustering strategies for image re-ranking,Daniel Carlos GuimarãEs Pedronette; Ricardo Da S Torres,Abstract In Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems; accurately ranking collectionimages is of great relevance. Users are interested in the returned images placed at the firstpositions; which usually are the most relevant ones. Commonly; image content descriptorsare used to compute ranked lists in CBIR systems. In general; these systems perform onlypairwise image analysis; that is; compute similarity measures considering only pairs ofimages; ignoring the rich information encoded in the relations among several images. Thispaper presents a novel re-ranking approach used to improve the effectiveness of CBIR tasksby exploring relations among images. In our approach; a recommendation-based strategy iscombined with a clustering method. Both exploit contextual information encoded in rankedlists computed by CBIR systems.

A scalable re-ranking method for content-based image retrieval,Daniel Carlos Guimarães Pedronette; Jurandy Almeida; Ricardo Da S Torres,Abstract Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems consider only a pairwise analysis;ie; they measure the similarity between pairs of images; ignoring the rich informationencoded in the relations among several images. However; the user perception usuallyconsiders the query specification and responses in a given context. In this scenario; re-ranking methods have been proposed to exploit the contextual information and; hence;improve the effectiveness of CBIR systems. Besides the effectiveness; the usefulness ofthose systems in real-world applications also depends on the efficiency and scalability of theretrieval process; imposing a great challenge to the re-ranking approaches; once theyusually require the computation of distances among all the images of a given collection. Inthis paper; we present a novel approach for the re-ranking problem. It relies on the …,Information Sciences,2014,36
Making colors worth more than a thousand words,Jurandy Almeida; Anderson Rocha; Ricardo Torres; Siome Goldenstein,Abstract Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a challenging task. Common techniquesuse only low-level features. However; these solutions can lead to the so-called'semanticgap'problem: images with high feature similarities may be different in terms of userperception. In this paper; our objective is to retrieve images based on color cues which maypresent some affine transformations. For that; we present CSIR: a new method for comparingimages based on discrete distributions of distinctive color and scale image regions. Wevalidate the technique using images with a large range of viewpoints; partial occlusion;changes in illumination; and various domains.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2008,36

A visual approach for video geocoding using bag-of-scenes,Otávio AB Penatti; Lin Tzy Li; Jurandy Almeida; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract This paper presents a novel approach for video representation; called bag-of-scenes. The proposed method is based on dictionaries of scenes; which provide a high-level representation for videos. Scenes are elements with much more semantic informationthan local features; specially for geotagging videos using visual content. Thus; eachcomponent of the representation model has self-contained semantics and; hence; it can bedirectly related to a specific place of interest. Experiments were conducted in the context ofthe MediaEval 2011 Placing Task. The reported results show our strategy compared to thosefrom other participants that used only visual content to accomplish this task.

A framework for selection and fusion of pattern classifiers in multimedia recognition,Fabio A Faria; Jefersson A Dos Santos; Anderson Rocha; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract The frequent growth of visual data; either by countless monitoring video cameraswherever we go or the popularization of mobile devices that allow each person to create andedit their own images and videos have contributed enormously to the so-called “big-datarevolution”. This shear amount of visual data gives rise to a Pandora box of new visualclassification problems never imagined before. Image and video classification tasks havebeen inserted in different and complex applications and the use of machine learning-basedsolutions has become the most popular approach for several applications. Notwithstanding;there is no silver bullet that solves all the problems; ie; it is not possible to characterize allimages of different domains with the same description method nor is it possible to use thesame learning method to achieve good results in any kind of application.

We propose a Reciprocal kNN Graph algorithmthat considers the relationships among ranked lists in the context of a k-reciprocalneighborhood. The similarity is propagated among neighbors considering the geometry ofthe dataset manifold. The proposed method can be used both for re-ranking and rankaggregation tasks.

Incorporating multiple distance spaces in optimum-path forest classification to improve feedback-based learning,André Tavares da Silva; Jefersson Alex dos Santos; Alexandre Xavier Falcão; Ricardo da S Torres; Léo Pini Magalhães,Abstract In content-based image retrieval (CBIR) using feedback-based learning; the usermarks the relevance of returned images and the system learns how to return more relevantimages in a next iteration. In this learning process; image comparison may be based ondistinct distance spaces due to multiple visual content representations. This work improvesthe retrieval process by incorporating multiple distance spaces in a recent method based onoptimum-path forest (OPF) classification. For a given training set with relevant and irrelevantimages; an optimization algorithm finds the best distance function to compare images as acombination of their distances according to different representations.

Fusion of local and global descriptors for content-based image and video retrieval,Felipe SP Andrade; Jurandy Almeida; Hélio Pedrini; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract Recently; fusion of descriptors has become a trend for improving the performance inimage and video retrieval tasks. Descriptors can be global or local; depending on how theyanalyze visual content. Most of existing works have focused on the fusion of a single type ofdescriptor. Different from all of them; this paper aims to analyze the impact of combiningglobal and local descriptors. Here; we perform a comparative study of different types ofdescriptors and all of their possible combinations. Extensive experiments of a rigorousexperimental design show that global and local descriptors complement each other; suchthat; when combined; they outperform other combinations or single descriptors.,Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition,2012,25
BP-tree: An efficient index for similarity search in high-dimensional metric spaces,Jurandy Almeida; Ricardo da S Torres; Neucimar J Leite,Abstract Similarity search in high-dimensional metric spaces is a key operation in manyapplications; such as multimedia databases; image retrieval; object recognition; and others.The high dimensionality of the data requires special index structures to facilitate the search.Most of existing indexes are constructed by partitioning the data set using distance-basedcriteria. However; those methods either produce disjoint partitions; but ignore the distributionproperties of the data; or produce non-disjoint groups; which greatly affect the searchperformance. In this paper; we study the performance of a new index structure; called Ball-and-Plane tree (BP-tree); which overcomes the above disadvantages. BP-tree is constructedby recursively dividing the data set into compact clusters. Distinctive from other techniques; itintegrates the advantages of both disjoint and non-disjoint paradigms in order to achieve …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,23
Superimposed image description and retrieval for fish species identification,Uma Murthy; Edward A Fox; Yinlin Chen; Eric Hallerman; Ricardo da Silva Torres; Evandro J Ramos; Tiago RC Falcao,Abstract Fish species identification is critical to the study of fish ecology and management offisheries. Traditionally; dichotomous keys are used for fish identification. The keys consist ofquestions about the observed specimen. Answers to these questions lead to more questionstill the reader identifies the specimen. However; such keys are incapable of adapting orchanging to meet different fish identification approaches; and often do not focus upondistinguishing characteristics favored by many field ecologists and more user-friendly fieldguides. This makes learning to identify fish difficult for Ichthyology students. Students usuallysupplement the use of the key with other methods such as making personal notes; drawings;annotated fish images; and more recently; fish information websites; such as Fishbase.Although these approaches provide useful additional content; it is dispersed across …,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2009,23
Shape description by image foresting transform,R da S Torres; AX Falcao; L da F Costa,The image foresting transform (IFT) is a unified and effective graph-based approach to thedesign of image-processing operations; often with considerable efficiency gains overpublished algorithms.

TSD: a shape descriptor based on a distribution of tensor scale local orientation,Paulo AV Miranda; R da S Torres; Alexandre X Falcao,We present tensor scale descriptor (TSD)—a shape descriptor for content-based imageretrieval; registration; and analysis. TSD exploits the notion of local structure thickness;orientation; and anisotropy as represented by the largest ellipse centered at each imagepixel and within the same homogeneous region. The proposed method uses the normalizedhistogram of the local orientation (the angle of the ellipse) at regions of high anisotropy andthickness within a certain interval. It is shown that TSD is invariant to rotation and to somereasonable level of scale changes. Experimental results with a fish database are presentedto illustrate and validate the method.,Computer Graphics and Image Processing; 2005. SIBGRAPI 2005. 18th Brazilian Symposium on,2005,22
Multimodal retrieval with relevance feedback based on genetic programming,Rodrigo Tripodi Calumby; Ricardo da Silva Torres; Marcos André Gonçalves,Abstract This paper presents a framework for multimodal retrieval with relevance feedbackbased on genetic programming. In this supervised learning-to-rank framework; geneticprogramming is used for the discovery of effective combination functions of (multimodal)similarity measures using the information obtained throughout the user relevance feedbackiterations. With these new functions; several similarity measures; including those extractedfrom different modalities (eg; text; and content); are combined into one single measure thatproperly encodes the user preferences. This framework was instantiated for multimodalimage retrieval using visual and textual features and was validated using two imagecollections; one from the Washington University and another from the ImageCLEFPhotographic Retrieval Task. For this image retrieval instance several multimodal …,Multimedia tools and applications,2014,21

Robust estimation of camera motion using optical flow models,Jurandy Almeida; Rodrigo Minetto; Tiago A Almeida; Ricardo da S Torres; Neucimar J Leite,Abstract The estimation of camera motion is one of the most important aspects for videoprocessing; analysis; indexing; and retrieval. Most of existing techniques to estimate cameramotion are based on optical flow methods in the uncompressed domain. However; todecode and to analyze a video sequence is extremely time-consuming. Since video data areusually available in MPEG-compressed form; it is desirable to directly process video materialwithout decoding. In this paper; we present a novel approach for estimating camera motionin MPEG video sequences. Our technique relies on linear combinations of optical flowmodels. The proposed method first creates prototypes of optical flow; and then performs alinear decomposition on the MPEG motion vectors; which is used to estimate the cameraparameters.

Improving texture description in remote sensing image multi-scale classification tasks by using visual words,Jefersson Ale Dos Santos; Otávio Augusto Bizetto Penatti; R da S Torres; Philippe Henri Gosselin; Sylvie Philipp-Foliguet; A Falcao,Although texture features are important for region-based classification of remote sensingimages; the literature shows that texture descriptors usually have poor performance whencompared and combined with color descriptors. In this paper; we propose a bag-of-visual-words (BOW)“propagation” approach to extract texture features from a hierarchy of regions.This strategy improves efficacy of feature as it encodes texture information independently ofthe region shape. Experiments show that the proposed approach improves the classificationresults when compared with global descriptors using the bounding box padding strategy.,Pattern Recognition (ICPR); 2012 21st International Conference on,2012,20
Effective image retrieval by shape saliences,R da S Torres; Eduardo M Picado; Alexandre X Falcao; L da F Costa,Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems have been developed aiming at enablingusers to search and retrieve images based on their properties such as shape; color andtexture. We are concerned with shape-based image retrieval. Here; we discuss a recentlyproposed shape descriptor; called contour saliences; defined as the influence areas of itshigher curvature points. We introduce a robust approach to estimate contour saliences byexploiting the relation between a contour and its skeleton; modifies the original definition toinclude the location and the value of saliences along the contour; and proposes a newmetric to compare contour saliences. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the proposeddescriptor with respect to Fourier descriptors; curvature scale space and moment invariants.,Computer Graphics and Image Processing; 2003.

Applying machine learning based on multiscale classifiers to detect remote phenology patterns in cerrado savanna trees,Jurandy Almeida; Jefersson A dos Santos; Bruna Alberton; Ricardo da S Torres; Leonor Patricia C Morellato,Abstract Plant phenology is one of the most reliable indicators of species responses toglobal climate change; motivating the development of new technologies for phenologicalmonitoring. Digital cameras or near remote systems have been efficiently applied as multi-channel imaging sensors; where leaf color information is extracted from the RGB (Red;Green; and Blue) color channels; and the changes in green levels are used to infer leafingpatterns of plant species. In this scenario; texture information is a great ally for imageanalysis that has been little used in phenology studies. We monitored leaf-changing patternsof Cerrado savanna vegetation by taking daily digital images. We extract RGB channels fromthe digital images and correlate them with phenological changes. Additionally; we benefitfrom the inclusion of textural metrics for quantifying spatial heterogeneity. Our first goals …,Ecological informatics,2014,19

Exploiting clustering approaches for image re-ranking,Daniel Carlos Guimarães Pedronette; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract This paper presents the Distance Optimization Algorithm (DOA); a re-rankingmethod aiming to improve the effectiveness of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)systems. DOA considers an iterative clustering approach based on distances correlation andon the similarity of ranked lists. The algorithm explores the fact that if two images are similar;their distances to other images and therefore their ranked lists should be similar as well. Wealso describe how DOA can be used to combine different descriptors and then improve thequality of results of CBIR systems. Conducted experiments involving shape; color; andtexture descriptors demonstrate the effectiveness of our method; when compared with state-of-the-art approaches.,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,2011,19
Approximate similarity search for online multimedia services on distributed CPU–GPU platforms,George Teodoro; Eduardo Valle; Nathan Mariano; Ricardo Torres; Wagner Meira; Joel H Saltz,Abstract Similarity search in high-dimensional spaces is a pivotal operation for severaldatabase applications; including online content-based multimedia services. With theincreasing popularity of multimedia applications; these services are facing new challengesregarding (1) the very large and growing volumes of data to be indexed/searched and (2)the necessity of reducing the response times as observed by end-users. In addition; thenature of the interactions between users and online services creates fluctuating queryrequest rates throughout execution; which requires a similarity search engine to adapt tobetter use the computation platform and minimize response times.

Exploiting contextual information for image re-ranking and rank aggregation,Daniel Carlos Guimarães Pedronette; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems aim to retrieve the most similarimages in a collection; given a query image. Since users are interested in the returnedimages placed at the first positions of ranked lists (which usually are the most relevant ones);the effectiveness of these systems is very dependent on the accuracy of rankingapproaches. This paper presents a novel re-ranking algorithm aiming to exploit contextualinformation for improving the effectiveness of rankings computed by CBIR systems. In ourapproach; ranked lists and distance scores are used to create context images; later used forretrieving contextual information. We also show that our re-ranking method can be applied toother tasks; such as (a) combining ranked lists obtained using different image descriptors(rank aggregation) and (b) combining post-processing methods.

Efficient and effective hierarchical feature propagation,Jefersson A dos Santos; Otávio AB Penatti; Philippe-Henri Gosselin; Alexandre X Falcaão; Sylvie Philipp-Foliguet; Ricardo da S Torres,Many methods have been recently proposed to deal with the large amount of data providedby the new remote sensing technologies. Several of those methods rely on the use ofsegmented regions. However; a common issue in region-based applications is the definitionof the appropriate representation scale of the data; a problem usually addressed byexploiting multiple scales of segmentation. The use of multiple scales; however; raises newchallenges related to the definition of effective and efficient mechanisms for extractingfeatures. In this paper; we address the problem of extracting features from a hierarchy byproposing two approaches that exploit the existing relationships among regions at differentscales. The H-Propagation propagates any histogram-based low-level descriptors.

Encoding spatial arrangement of visual words,Otávio AB Penatti; Eduardo Valle; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract This paper presents a new approach to encode spatial-relationship information ofvisual words in the well-known visual dictionary model. The current most popular approachto describe images based on visual words is by means of bags-of-words which do notencode any spatial information. We propose a graceful way to capture spatial-relationshipinformation of visual words that encodes the spatial arrangement of every visual word in animage. Our experiments show the importance of the spatial information of visual words forimage classification and show the gain in classification accuracy when using the newmethod. The proposed approach creates opportunities for further improvements in imagedescription under the visual dictionary model.,Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition,2011,16

Since video data are usually available in compressedform; it is desirable to directly process video material without decoding. In this paper; wepresent a novel approach for video cut detection that works in the compressed domain. Theproposed method is based on both exploiting visual features extracted from the video streamand on using a simple and fast algorithm to detect the video transitions.

Interactive classification of remote sensing images by using optimum-path forest and genetic programming,Jefersson Alex Dos Santos; André Tavares da Silva; Ricardo da Silva Torres; Alexandre Xavier Falcão; Léo P Magalhaes; Rubens AC Lamparelli,Abstract The use of remote sensing images as a source of information in agribusinessapplications is very common. In those applications; it is fundamental to know how the spaceoccupation is. However; identification and recognition of crop regions in remote sensingimages are not trivial tasks yet. Although there are automatic methods proposed to that;users very often prefer to identify regions manually.

Extending the 5s framework of digital libraries to support complex objects; superimposed information; and content-based image retrieval services,Uma Murthy; Nadia Kozievitch; Jonathan Leidig; Ricardo Torres; Seungwon Yang; Marcos Gonçalves; Lois Delcambre; David Archer; Edward Fox,Abstract Advanced services in digital libraries (DLs) have been developed and widely usedto address the required capabilities of an assortment of systems as DLs expand into diverseapplication domains. These systems may require support for images (eg; Content-BasedImage Retrieval); Complex (information) Objects; and use of content at fine grain (eg;Superimposed Information). Due to the lack of consensus on precise theoretical definitionsfor those services; implementation efforts often involve ad hoc development; leading toduplication and interoperability problems. This article presents a methodology to addressthose problems by extending a precisely specified minimal digital library (in the 5Sframework) with formal definitions of aforementioned services.

SIFT applied to CBIR,Jurandy Almeida; Ricardo da S Torres; Siome Goldenstein,Abstract—Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a chal-lenging task. Commonapproaches use only low-level features. Notwithstanding; such CBIR solutions fail oncapturing some local features representing the details and nuances of scenes. Manytechniques in image processing and computer vision can capture these scene semantics.Among them; the Scale Invariant Features Transform (SIFT) has been widely used in a lot ofapplications. This approach relies on the choice of several parameters which directly impactits effectiveness when applied to retrieve images. In this paper; we discuss the resultsobtained in several experiments proposed to evaluate the application of the SIFT in CBIRtasks.,Revista de Sistemas de Informacao da FSMA n,2009,12

Detecting contour saliences using tensor scale,Fernanda A Andaló; Paulo AV Miranda; Ricardo da S Torres; Alexandre X Falcao,Tensor scale is a morphometric parameter that unifies the representation of local structurethickness; orientation; and anisotropy; which can be used in several image processing tasks.This paper introduces a new application for tensor scale; which is the detection of salienceson a given contour; based on the tensor scale orientations computed for the entire objectand mapped to its contour. For validation purposes; we present a shape descriptor that usesthe detected contour saliences. Experimental results are provided; comparing the proposedmethod with our previous contour salience descriptor (CS). We show that the proposedmethod can be not only faster and more robust in the detection of salience points than theCS method; but also more effective as a shape descriptor.,Image Processing; 2007.

A soft computing approach for learning to aggregate rankings,Javier Alvaro Vargas Muñoz; Ricardo da Silva Torres; Marcos André Gonçalves,Abstract This paper presents an approach to combine rank aggregation techniques using asoft computing technique--Genetic Programming--in order to improve the results inInformation Retrieval tasks. Previous work shows that by combining rank aggregationtechniques in an agglomerative way; it is possible to get better results than with individualmethods. However; these works either combine only a small set of lists or are performed in acompletely ad-hoc way. Therefore; given a set of ranked lists and a set of rank aggregationtechniques; we propose to use a supervised genetic programming approach to searchcombinations of them that maximize effectiveness in large search spaces.

Hyperspectral band selection through optimum-path forest and evolutionary-based algorithms,Rodrigo Nakamura; J Papa; L Fonseca; Jefersson Alex dos Santos; R da S Torres,In this paper we addressed the problem of dimensionality reduction in hyperspectralimagery classification by combining OPF classifier together with three recent evolutionary-based optimization algorithms: PSO; HS and GSA. We conducted experiments with twopublic datasets (Indian Pines and Salinas); which demonstrated that OPF combined with HSand GSA have obtained promising results; being the former the fastest approach. In regardto Indian Pines dataset; HS and GSA have achieved close classification rates; but HS hasselected 46.25% less bands; which means a faster feature extraction step. For future works;we intend to provide a more detailed convergence analysis for PSO; HS and GSA; and alsoto introduce novel evolutionary-based band selection techniques and also to apply thesemethodologies for hyperspectral image classification in forest and agriculture applications.,Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS); 2012 IEEE International,2012,8

Sorted dominant local color for searching large and heterogeneous image databases,Márcio Luiz A Vidal; João MB Cavalcanti; Edleno Silva de Moura; Altigran Soares da Silva; Ricardo da Silva Torres,Recent work on Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) have presented alternative methodsfor fast image indexing and retrieval using Bags of Visual Words (BoVW). In such methods;images are represented as sets of visual words; which can be indexed and searched usingwell-known text retrieval techniques; allowing fast search on large image databases. In thispaper we propose a novel method based on BoVW that improves over current methods byusing a new kind of local color descriptor; which we call SDLC; that encodes the mostpredominant color occurrences in blocks of different image regions. We report results ofexperiments we performed with two publicly available image databases.

A digital library (DL)facilitates management; access; retrieval; and use of collections of data and metadatathrough services. However; most DLs do not provide infrastructure or services to supportworking with subdocuments. Superimposed information (SI) refers to new information that iscreated to reference subdocuments in existing information resources. We combine this ideaof SI with traditional DL services; to define and develop a DL with SI (SI-DL). We exploredthe use of subimages and evaluated the use of SuperIDR; a prototype SI-DL; in fish speciesidentification; a scholarly task that involves working with subimages. The contexts andstrategies of working with subimages in SuperIDR suggest new and enhanced support …,Proceedings of the 11th annual international ACM/IEEE joint conference on Digital libraries,2011,7

Annotating data to support decision-making: a case study,Geovana N Macário; Jefersson A dos Santos; Claudia Bauzer Medeiros; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract Georeferenced data are a key factor in many decision-making systems. However;their interpretation is user and context dependent so that; for each situation; data analystshave to interpret them; a time-consuming task. One approach to alleviate this task; is the useof semantic annotations to store the produced information. Annotating data is however hardto perform and prone to errors; especially when executed manually. This difficulty increaseswith the amount of data to annotate. Moreover; annotation requires multi-disciplinarycollaboration of researchers; with access to heterogeneous and distributed data sourcesand scientific computations. This paper illustrates our solution to approach this problem bymeans of a case study in agriculture. It shows how our implementation of a framework toautomate the annotation of geospatial data can be used to process real data from remote …,Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Geographic Information Retrieval,2010,7

Analyzing compound object technologies from the 5s perspective,Nádia P Kozievitch; E Fox; RDS TORRES,Abstract There are many applications which need support for compound information. Thus;we need new mechanisms for managing data integration; aids for creating references; linksand annotations; and services for clustering; organizing and reusing compound objects(COs) and their components. Few attempts have been made to formally characterizecompound information; related services; and technologies. We propose the description andinterplay of technologies for handling compound information taking advantage of theformalization proposed by the 5S Framework. This paper:(1) analyzes technologies whichmanage compound information (DCC; Buckets; OAI-ORE);(2) uses 5S formal definitions fordescribing them;(3) presents a case study; illustrating how CO technologies and the 5SFramework can fit together to support exploration of compound information.,Institute of Computing; University of Campinas; Tech.

TIDES—a new descriptor for time series oscillation behavior,Leonardo E Mariote; Claudia Bauzer Medeiros; Ricardo da Silva Torres; Lucas M Bueno,Abstract Sensor networks have increased the amount and variety of temporal data available;requiring the definition of new techniques for data mining. Related research typicallyaddresses the problems of indexing; clustering; classification; summarization; and anomalydetection. There is a wide range of techniques to describe and compare time series; but theyfocus on series' values. This paper concentrates on a new aspect—that of describingoscillation patterns. It presents a technique for time series similarity search; and multipletemporal scales; defining a descriptor that uses the angular coefficients from a linearsegmentation of the curve that represents the evolution of the analyzed series. Thistechnique is generalized to handle co-evolution; in which several phenomena vary at thesame time. Preliminary experiments with real datasets showed that our approach …,Geoinformatica,2011,6

Monorail: A disk-friendly index for huge descriptor databases,Fernando Akune; Eduardo Valle; Ricardo Torres,We propose MONORAIL; an indexing scheme for very large multimedia descriptordatabases. Our index is based on the Hilbert curve; which is able to map the high-dimensional space of those descriptors to a single dimension. Instead of using severalcurves to mitigate boundary effects; we use a single curve with several surrogate points foreach descriptor. Thus; we are able to reduce the random accesses to the bare minimum. In arigorous empirical comparison with another method based on multiple surrogates; oursshows a significant improvement; due to our careful choice of the surrogate points.,Pattern Recognition (ICPR); 2010 20th International Conference on,2010,6
Species identification: fish images with CBIR and annotations.,Uma Murthy; Edward A Fox; Yinlin Chen; Eric Hallerman; Ricardo da Silva Torres; Evandro J Ramos; Tiago RC Falcão,ABSTRACT Fish species identification is critical to the study of fish ecology andmanagement of fisheries. However; learning to identify fish is difficult for Ichthyologystudents. Traditionally; dichotomous keys are used for fish identification. They ask questionsabout the observed specimen; and then; based on the answer; ask more questions until thespecimen is identified. This rigid approach does not accommodate the range of learningstyles actually utilized by Ichthyology students. Further; keys often differ from distinguishingcharacteristics of fishes such as" spinous dorsal fin";" forked tail";" large eye"; etc. This leadsstudents to supplement the use of keys with other methods such as making personal notesand drawings; annotating fish images; and more recently; using fish information websites;such as Fishbase.

Unsupervised distance learning for plant species identification,Jurandy Almeida; Daniel CG Pedronette; Bruna C Alberton; Leonor Patricia C Morellato; Ricardo da S Torres,Phenology is among the most trustworthy indicators of climate change effects on plants andanimals. The recent application of repeated digital photographs to monitor vegetationphenology has provided accurate measures of plant life cycle changes over time. Afundamental requirement for phenology studies refers to the correct recognition ofphenological patterns from plants by taking into account time series associated with theircrowns. This paper presents a new similarity measure for identifying plants based on the useof an unsupervised distance learning scheme; instead of using traditional approachesbased on pairwise similarities. We experimentally show that its use yields considerableimprovements in time-series search tasks. In addition; we also demonstrate how the latefusion of different time series can improve the results on plant species identification.

Nearest neighbors distance ratio open-set classifier,Pedro R Mendes Júnior; Roberto M de Souza; Rafael de O Werneck; Bernardo V Stein; Daniel V Pazinato; Waldir R de Almeida; Otávio AB Penatti; Ricardo da S Torres; Anderson Rocha,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel multiclass classifier for the open-set recognitionscenario. This scenario is the one in which there are no a priori training samples for someclasses that might appear during testing. Usually; many applications are inherently open set.Consequently; successful closed-set solutions in the literature are not always suitable forreal-world recognition problems. The proposed open-set classifier extends upon the Nearest-Neighbor (NN) classifier. Nearest neighbors are simple; parameter independent; multiclass;and widely used for closed-set problems. The proposed Open-Set NN (OSNN) methodincorporates the ability of recognizing samples belonging to classes that are unknown attraining time; being suitable for open-set recognition.

A graph-based ranked-list model for unsupervised distance learning on shape retrieval,Daniel Carlos Guimarães Pedronette; Jurandy Almeida; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract Several re-ranking algorithms have been proposed recently. Some effectiveapproaches are based on complex graph-based diffusion processes; which usually are timeconsuming and therefore inappropriate for real-world large scale shape collections. In thispaper; we introduce a novel graph-based approach for iterative distance learning in shaperetrieval tasks. The proposed method is based on the combination of graphs defined interms of multiple ranked lists. The efficiency of the method is guaranteed by the use of onlytop positions of ranked lists in the definition of graphs that encode reciprocal references.Effectiveness analysis performed in three widely used shape datasets demonstrate that theproposed graph-based ranked-list model yields significant gains (up to+ 55.52%) whencompared with the use of shape descriptors in isolation. Furthermore; the proposed …,Pattern Recognition Letters,2016,4

Our GP-based approach aims at both: learning to expand queries with multimodal information andlearning to compute the “best” ranking for the expanded queries. However; different fromprevious work; the query is only expressed in terms of the visual content; which bringsseveral challenges for this type of application. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of ourmethod; we have collected two datasets containing images of clothing products taken fromdifferent online shops.

Pixel-level tissue classification for ultrasound images,Daniel V Pazinato; Bernardo V Stein; Waldir R de Almeida; Rafael de O Werneck; Pedro R Mendes Júnior; Otávio AB Penatti; Ricardo da S Torres; Fábio H Menezes; Anderson Rocha,Background: Pixel-level tissue classification for ultrasound images; commonly applied tocarotid images; is usually based on defining thresholds for the isolated pixel values. Rangesof pixel values are defined for the classification of each tissue. The classification of pixels isthen used to determine the carotid plaque composition and; consequently; to determine therisk of diseases (eg; strokes) and whether or not a surgery is necessary. The use ofthreshold-based methods dates from the early 2000s but it is still widely used for virtualhistology. Methodology/Principal Findings: We propose the use of descriptors that take intoaccount information about a neighborhood of a pixel when classifying it. We evaluatedexperimentally different descriptors (statistical moments; texture-based; gradient-based;local binary patterns; etc.) on a dataset of five types of tissues: blood; lipids; muscle …,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2016,4

In this scenario; the use of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems has emerged as a promising approach to supportimage searches. The objective of CBIR systems is to retrieve the most similar images in acollection; given a query image; by taking into account image visual properties such astexture; color; and shape. In these systems; the effectiveness of the retrieval processdepends heavily on the accuracy of ranking approaches. Recently; re-ranking approacheshave been proposed to improve the effectiveness of CBIR systems by taking into account therelationships among images.

Unsupervised measures for estimating the effectiveness of image retrieval systems,Daniel Carlos Guimaraes Pedronette; Ricardo da S Torres,The main objective of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems is to retrieve a rankedlist containing the most similar images of a collection given a query image; by taking intoaccount their visual content. Although these systems represent a very promising approach;in many situations is very challenging to assure the quality of returned ranked lists.Supervised approaches rely on training data and information obtained from user interactionsto identify and then improve low-quality results. However; these approaches require a lot ofhuman efforts which can be infeasible for many systems.

On this paper;we focus on the latter application; proposing a Bayesian approach; which allows giving aprobabilistic interpretation to the distances between local descriptors in the feature space.That contrasts with traditional schemes; in which the distances are used to establish asimple unweighted vote count. Near-duplicate detection is demanded for a myriad ofapplications: metadata retrieval in cultural institutions; detection of copyright violations;duplicate elimination in storage; etc. The majority of current solutions are based either onvoting algorithms; which are very precise; but expensive; or on the use of visual dictionaries;which are efficient; but less precise.

Our approaches are characterized by:(1) texture image descriptors based on pairs ofmulti-resolution decomposition methods that encode effectively global and local fingerprintinformation; with similarity measures used for fingerprint matching purposes; and (2) a novelmulti-class object recognition method based on the Optimum Path Forest classifier.Experiments were carried out on the standard NIST-4 dataset aiming to study thediscriminative and scalability capabilities of our approaches. The high classification ratesallow us demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our approaches for characterizing …,Pacific-Rim Symposium on Image and Video Technology,2009,4
From concepts to implementation and visualization: tools from a team-based approach to IR,Uma Murthy; Ricardo da Silva Torres; Edward A Fox; Logambigai Venkatachalam; Seungwon Yang; Marcos A Gonçalves,Abstract Researchers have been studying and developing teaching materials for informationretrieval (IR); such as [3]. Toolkits also have been built that provide hands-on experience tostudents. For example; IR-Toolbox [4] is an effort to close the gap between the students'understanding of IR concepts and real-life indexing and search systems. Such tools mightbe good for helping students in non-technical areas such as in the Library and InformationScience field to develop their conceptual model of search engines. However; they do notcover emerging topics and skills; such as content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and fusionsearch. Although there is open source software (such as those in http://www. searchtools.com/tools/tools-opensource. html) that can be used to teach basic and advanced IR topics;they require a student to have high-level technical knowledge and to spend a long time to …,Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2008,4
Diversity-based interactive learning meets multimodality,Rodrigo Tripodi Calumby; Marcos André Gonçalves; Ricardo da Silva Torres,Abstract In interactive retrieval tasks; one of the main objectives is to maximize the userinformation gain throughout search sessions. Retrieving many relevant items is quiteimportant; but it does not necessarily completely satisfy the user needs. When only relevantnear-duplicate items are retrieved; the amount of different concepts users are able to extractfrom the target collection is very limited. Therefore; broadening the number of conceptspresent in a result set may improve the overall search experience. Diversifying conceptspresent in the retrieved set is one possibility for increasing the information gain in a singlesearch iteration; maximizing the likelihood of including at least some relevant items for eachpossible intent of ambiguous or underspecified queries. Relevance feedback approachesmay also take advantage of diverse results to improve internal machine learning models …,Neurocomputing,2017,3

Rank diffusion for context-based image retrieval,Daniel Carlos Guimarães Pedronette; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract This paper presents an efficient diffusion-based re-ranking approach. The proposedmethod propagates contextual information defined in terms of top-ranked objects of rankedlists in a diffusion process. That makes the method suitable for large scale real-worldcollections. Experiments were conducted considering public image collections; severaldescriptors; and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that the proposed method provides high effectiveness gains with lowcomputational costs.,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval,2016,3
A semi-supervised learning algorithm for relevance feedback and collaborative image retrieval,Daniel Carlos Guimarães Pedronette; Rodrigo T Calumby; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract The interaction of users with search services has been recognized as an importantmechanism for expressing and handling user information needs. One traditional approachfor supporting such interactive search relies on exploiting relevance feedbacks (RF) in thesearching process. For large-scale multimedia collections; however; the user efforts requiredin RF search sessions is considerable. In this paper; we address this issue by proposing anovel semi-supervised approach for implementing RF-based search services. In ourapproach; supervised learning is performed taking advantage of relevance labels providedby users. Later; an unsupervised learning step is performed with the objective of extractinguseful information from the intrinsic dataset structure. Furthermore; our hybrid learningapproach considers feedbacks of different users; in collaborative image retrieval (CIR) …,EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing,2015,3

The proposedrepresentations rely on bags of visual words; successfully used by the computer visioncommunity in visual recognition problems. An important element of the proposedrepresentations is the image sampling with large regions; drastically reducing the executiontime of the image characterization procedure. Throughout an extensive set of experiments;we evaluate the proposed approach against different image descriptors for classifying fourheart view planes. The results show that our approach is effective and efficient for the targetproblem; making it suitable for use in real-time setups.

Unsupervised effectiveness estimation for image retrieval using reciprocal rank information,Daniel Carlos Guimarães Pedronette; Ricardo da S Torres,In this paper; we present an unsupervised approach for estimating the effectiveness ofimage retrieval results obtained for a given query. The proposed approach does not requireany training procedure and the computational efforts needed are very low; since only the top-k results are analyzed. In addition; we also discuss the use of the unsupervised measures intwo novel rank aggregation methods; which assign weights to ranked lists according to theireffectiveness estimation. An experimental evaluation was conducted considering differentdatasets and various image descriptors. Experimental results demonstrate the capacity ofthe proposed measures in correctly estimating the effectiveness of different queries in anunsupervised manner.

Evaluation of parameters for combining multiple textual sources of evidence for Web image retrieval using genetic programming,Patrícia Correia Saraiva; João MB Cavalcanti; Marcos A Gonçalves; Katia C Lage dos Santos; Edleno S de Moura; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract Web image retrieval is a research area that is receiving a lot of attention in the lastfew years due to the growing availability of images on the Web. Since content-based imageretrieval is still considered very difficult and expensive in the Web context; most current large-scale Web image search engines use textual descriptions to represent the content of theWeb images. In this paper we present a study about the usage of genetic programming (GP)to address the problem of image retrieval on the World Wide Web by using textual sources ofevidence and textual queries. We investigate several parameter of choices related to theusage of a framework previously proposed by us. The proposed framework uses GP toprovide a good solution to combine multiple textual sources of evidence associated with theWeb images.

Image and video representations based on visual dictionaries,Otávio AB Penatti; Eduardo Valle; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract—The thesis explores three research topics involving the popular approach used forrepresenting visual content: the visual dictionaries. The first topic concerns the generality ofvisual dictionaries: does a dictionary based on one dataset generalize to another dataset?Our findings create the opportunity to greatly alleviate the burden in generating dictionaries.The second topic is related to the importance of the spatial information of visual words in theimage space for distinguishing types of scenes and objects. We propose an efficient andeffective spatial pooling approach which presents promising results for image retrieval. Andthe third topic refers to the semantic information in the visual dictionary model. We claim thata bag-of-prototypes model; where the prototypes are visual words carrying semantics; ispromising for improving image and video representations. Employing this model; we …,*,2012,3
Evaluation and Recommendation of Saltstone Mixer Auger/Paddles Materials of Construction for Improved Wear Resistance,J Mickalonis; R Torres,EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Wear and corrosion testing were conducted to evaluate alternatematerials of construction for the Saltstone mixer auger and paddles. These componentshave been degraded by wear from the slurry processed in the mixer. Material test optionsincluded PVD coatings (TiN; TiCN; and ZrN); weld overlays (Stellite 12 and Ultimet) andhigher hardness steels and carbides (D2 and tungsten carbide). The corrosion testingdemonstrated that the slurry is not detrimental to the current materials of construction or thenew candidates. The ASTM G75 Miller wear test showed that the high hardness materialsand the Stellite 12 weld overlay provide superior wear relative to the Astralloy and CF8Mstainless steel; which are the current materials of construction; as well as the PVD coatingsand Ultimet.,*,2012,3

Semi-supervised transfer subspace for domain adaptation,Luís AM Pereira; Ricardo da Silva Torres,Abstract Domain shift is defined as the mismatch between the marginal probabilitydistributions of a source (training set) and a target domain (test set). A successful researchline has been focusing on deriving new source and target feature representations to reducethe domain shift problem. This task can be modeled as a semi-supervised domainadaptation. However; without exploiting at the same time the knowledge available on thelabeled source; labeled target; and unlabeled target data; semi-supervised methods areprone to fail. Here; we present a simple and effective Semi-Supervised Transfer Subspace(SSTS) method for domain adaptation. SSTS establishes pairwise constraints between thesource and labeled target data; besides it exploits the global structure of the unlabeled datato build a domain invariant subspace.

Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Genetic-Programming-Based Time Series Similarity Functions,Alexandre E Almeida; Ricardo da S Torres,In several applications; the automatic identification of regions of interest in remote sensingimages is based on the assessment of the similarity of associated time series; ie; two regionsare considered as belonging to the same class if the patterns found in their spectralinformation observed over time are somewhat similar. In this letter; we investigate the use ofa genetic programming (GP) framework to discover an effective combination of time seriessimilarity functions to be used in remote sensing classification tasks. Performed experimentsin a Forest-Savanna classification scenario demonstrated that the GP framework yieldseffective results when compared with the use of traditional widely used similarity functions inisolation.,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017,2

Efficient and effective content-based image retrieval framework for fingerprint databases,Javier A Montoya Zegarra; Neucimar J Leite; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract. Two kinds of fingerprint identification approaches have been proposed in theliterature to reduce the number of one-to-many comparisons during fingerprint imageretrieval; namely; exclusive and continuous classification. Although exclusive classificationapproaches reduce the number of comparisons; they present some shortcomings; includingfingerprint ambiguous classification; and unbalanced fingerprint classification distribution.On the other side; continuous classification approaches have not been further studied. In thiscontext; we propose an original continuous approach to guide the search and the retrieval infingerprint image databases considering both effectiveness and retrieval speed. For thatpurposes; we use feature extraction and indexing methods considering the textural anddirectional information contained in fingerprint images.

Contextual Spaces Re‐Ranking: accelerating the Re‐sort Ranked Lists step on heterogeneous systems,Flávia Pisani; Daniel CG Pedronette; Ricardo da S Torres; Edson Borin,Summary Re-ranking algorithms have been proposed to improve the effectiveness ofcontent-based image retrieval systems by exploiting contextual information encoded indistance measures and ranked lists. In this paper; we show how we improved the efficiencyof one of these algorithms; called Contextual Spaces Re-Ranking (CSRR).

TSS & TSB: Tensor scale descriptors within circular sectors for fast shape retrieval,Anderson M Freitas; Ricardo da S Torres; Paulo AV Miranda,Abstract We propose two novel region-based descriptors for shape-based image retrievaland analysis; which are built upon an extended tensor scale based on the EuclideanDistance Transform (EDT). First the tensor scale algorithm is applied to extract local structurethickness; orientation; and anisotropy as represented by the largest ellipse within ahomogeneous region centered at each image pixel. In this work; we extend the localorientation to 360°. Then; for the first proposed descriptor; named Tensor Scale Sectordescriptor (TSS); the local distributions of relative orientations within circular sectors areused to compose a fixed-length feature vector for a region-based representation. For thesecond method; named Tensor Scale Band descriptor (TSB); we consider histograms ofrelative orientations for each circular concentric band to compose a fixed-length feature …,Pattern Recognition Letters,2016,1

In-line chemical sensor deployment in a tritium plant,JS Wright; RD Torres; B Peters; DT Hope; LL Tovo,Abstract The Savannah River Tritium Plant (TP) relies on well understood but aging sensortechnology for process gas analysis. Although new sensor technologies have been broughtto various readiness levels; the TP has been reluctant to install technologies that have notbeen tested in tritium service. This gap between sensor development and incorporating newtechnologies into practical applications demonstrates fundamental challenges that existwhen transitioning from status quo to state-of-the-art in an extreme environment such as atritium plant. These challenges stem from three root obstacles: 1) The necessity for acomprehensive assessment of process sensing needs and requirements; 2) The lack of apick-list of process-compatible sensor technologies; and 3) The need to test sensors in atritium-contaminated process environment without risking production.

Remote sensing image segmentation and representation through multiscale analysis,Jefersson Alex dos Santos; Ricardo da Silva Torres,Every year; new sensor technologies are being implemented to improve the acquisition ofhigh-resolution remote sensing images (RSIs). With the large amount of data provided bythese sensors; novel computational approaches are constantly required to support thedecision-making process based on RSI analysis. A typical problem is the recognition oftarget regions for land-cover mapping. In this context; the main problems are:(1)classification methods are dependent on the segmentation quality; and (2) the selection ofrepresentative samples for training is a costly process. The samples indicated by the userare not always enough to define the best segmentation scale. Furthermore; the indication ofsamples can be expensive; since it often requires to visit studied places in loco.

Are visual dictionaries generalizable?,Otavio AB Penatti; Eduardo Valle; Ricardo da S Torres,Abstract: Mid-level features based on visual dictionaries are today a cornerstone of systemsfor classification and retrieval of images. Those state-of-the-art representations dependcrucially on the choice of a codebook (visual dictionary); which is usually derived from thedataset. In general-purpose; dynamic image collections (eg; the Web); one cannot have theentire collection in order to extract a representative dictionary. However; based on thehypothesis that the dictionary reflects only the diversity of low-level appearances and doesnot capture semantics; we argue that a dictionary based on a small subset of the data; oreven on an entirely different dataset; is able to produce a good representation; provided thatthe chosen images span a diverse enough portion of the low-level feature space. Ourexperiments confirm that hypothesis; opening the opportunity to greatly alleviate the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1205.2663,2012,1

A Geographic Annotation Service for Biodiversity Systems.,Fabiana B Gil; Nádia P Kozievitch; Ricardo da Silva Torres,Abstract. Biodiversity studies are often based on the use of data associated with fieldobservations. These data are usually associated with a geographic location. Most of existingbiodiversity information systems provides support for storing and querying geographic data.Annotation services; in general; are not supported. This paper presents an annotation Webservice to correlate biodiversity data and geographic information. We use superimposedinformation concepts for constructing a Web service for annotating vector geographic data.The Web service specification includes the definition of a generic API for handlingannotations and the definition of a data model for storing them. The solution was validatedthrough the implementation of a prototype for the biodiversity area considering a potentialusage scenario.,GeoInfo,2010,1

Reasoning for Complex Data: Research Initiatives on Data Science,Ricardo da Silva Torres,Abstract The exponential growth of digital information production and dissemination; as wellas its huge diversification; introduce considerable management and access challenges. Atthe same time; new opportunities have been created by the development and use ofanalysis methods for the discovery of interesting and potentially useful patterns; present inthe data sets. In this lecture; I will introduce research initiatives at Unicamp concerning themanagement of large volumes of Complex Data. The term Complex Data is associated withthe universe of unstructured; semi-structured; and multimodal data; and therefore covers awide variety of data as text; sound; image; video; geographic information; among others.This talk will show the versatility of ongoing research initiatives in three importantapplications: Information Retrieval; Multimedia Classification; and e-Science.,Proceedings of the 21st Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web,2015,*

Simulations of ion acceleration from ultrathin targets with the VEGA petawatt laser,Luca C Stockhausen; Ricardo Torres; Enrique Conejero Jarque,The Spanish Pulsed Laser Centre (CLPU) is a new high-power laser facility for users. Itsmain system; VEGA; is a CPA Ti: Sapphire laser which; in its final phase; will be able toreach petawatt peak powers in pulses of 30 fs with a pulse contrast of 1: 10 10 at 1 ps. Theextremely low level of pre-pulse intensity makes this system ideally suited for studying thelaser interaction with ultrathin targets. We have used the particle-in-cell (PIC) code OSIRIS tocarry out 2D simulations of the acceleration of ions from ultrathin solid targets under theunique conditions provided by VEGA; with laser intensities up to 10 22 Wcm-2 impingingnormally on 5-40 nm thick overdense plasmas; with different polarizations and pre-plasmascale lengths. We show how signatures of the radiation pressure dominated regime; such aslayer compression and bunch formation; are only present with circular polarization.

Investigation of collective electron dynamics in relativistically transparent laser-foil interactions,Ross Gray; David MacLellan; Bruno Gonzalez-Izquierdo; Haydn Powell; David Carroll; Christopher Murphy; Luca Stockhausen; Dean Rusby; Graeme Scott; Robbie Wilson; Nicola Booth; Dan Symes; Steve Hawkes; Ricardo Torres; Marco Borghesi; David Neely; Paul McKenna,Abstract The interaction of an intense laser pulse with a solid target produces high energyelectrons at the target-vacuum boundary. For sufficiently high laser intensities and thintargets; the electrons become relativistic and rapidly expand into vacuum; lowering the peakelectron density. The combined increase in the relativistically-corrected critical density andthe reduction in the target electron density results in the onset of relativistic inducedtransparency (RIT) during the laser pulse; enabling the remainder of the pulse to propagatethrough the target and further interact with the accelerated electrons. We report onmeasurements of the collective dynamics of laser driven electrons in the RIT regime. The 2Dprofile of the beam of accelerated electrons is shown to change from an ellipse alignedalong the laser polarization direction in the case of limited RIT; to a double-lobe structure …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2014,*

A formal approach for the specification of digital complex objects,Ticiana Oniki Toffoli; Nádia Puchalski Kozievitch; Marcos André Gonçalves; Ricardo da Silva Torres,Abstract Complex objects (COs) have surged as a way to integrate different digital resourcesunder a same logical unit in order to facilitate aggregation and reuse. However; there is stilla lack of consensus on precise theoretical foundations for COs; especially regarding designand specification; which compromise their utility and integration with existing software tools.Moreover; there has been little investigation on aspects related to the modeling of COs bythe end user; much due to the lack of appropriate tools for this goal. In this work; we presenta new Digital Library (DL) metamodel specially designed for the CO modeling which isgrounded in formal theoretical specification for COs. More specifically; our goal is two-fold:(i)to indirectly validate our CO formalization by instantiating it within a DL modeling tool--5SGraph; and (ii) to investigate the difficulties of CO modeling and specification by real …,Proceedings of the 19th Brazilian symposium on Multimedia and the web,2013,*
IN-LINE CHEMICAL SENSOR DEPLOYMENT IN A TRITIUM PLANT,L Tovo; J Wright; R Torres; B Peters,Global budget reductions and continuing worldwide austerity measures are pressuringtritium fuel cycle processes; including those at the Savannah River Site (SRS); to be moreefficient; cost effective; and to be more responsive to changing delivery demands; whilemaintaining delivery of high quality material (s) on time. At the same time; growing globaldemand for tritium in fusion energy interests like ITER and the National Ignition Facility; andfor radiological medical fields have pushed the need for tritium processing to new levels.These evolving requirements force operations managers and engineers to have a detailedunderstanding of the capabilities and limitations of the tritium fuel cycle.

A Multiple Labeling-based Optimum-Path Forest for Video Content Classification,Luis AM Pereira; J Paulo Papa; Jurandy Almeida; Ricardo da S Torres; Willian Paraguassu Amorim,Multiple-labeling classification approaches attempt to handle applications that associatemore than one label to a given sample. Since we have an increasing number of systems thatare guided by such assumption; in this paper we have presented a multiple-labelingapproach for the Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) classifier based on the problem transformationmethod. In order to validate our proposal; a multi-labeled video classification dataset hasbeen used to compare OPF against three other classifiers and another variant of the OPFclassifier based on a k-neighborhood. The results have shown the validity of the OPF-basedclassifiers for multi-labeling classification problems.,Graphics; Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI); 2013 26th SIBGRAPI-Conference on,2013,*

Atomic Force Lithography Of Nano Microfluidic Channels For Verification And Monitoring In Aqueous Solutions,R Torres; A Mendez-Torres; P Lam,The growing interest in the physics of fluidic flow in nanoscale channels; as well as thepossibility for high sensitive detection of ions and single molecules is driving thedevelopment of nanofluidic channels. The enrichment of charged analytes due to electricfield-controlled flow and surface charge/dipole interactions along the channel can lead toenhancement of sensitivity and limits-of-detection in sensor instruments. Nuclear materialprocessing; waste remediation; and nuclear non-proliferation applications can greatlybenefit from this capability. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a low-cost alternative forthe machining of disposable nanochannels. The small AFM tip diameter (< 10 nm) canprovide for features at scales restricted in conventional optical and electron-beamlithography.

Image Retrieval based on discrete distributions of distinctive Color and Scale representative Image Regions (CSIR),Jurandy Almeida; Anderson Rocha; Ricardo Torres; Siome Goldenstein,Abstract Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a challenging task. Common techniquesuse only low-level features. However; these solutions can lead to the so-called 'semanticgap'problem: images with high feature similarities may be different in terms of userperception. In this paper; our objective is to retrieve images based on color cues which maypresent some affine transformations. For that; we present CSIR: a new method for comparingimages based on discrete distributions of distinctive color and scale image regions. Wevalidate the technique using images with a large range of viewpoints; partial occlusion;changes in illumination; and various domains.,*,2007,*

Investigation of collective electron dynamics in relativistically transparent laser plasma interactions,RJ Gray; DA MacLellan; B Gonzalez-Izquierdo; HW Powell; R Wilson; P McKenna; LC Stockhausen; R Torres; DC Carroll; GG Scott; DR Rusby; N Booth; DR Symes; SJ Hawkes; D Neely; CD Murphy; M Borghesi,Abstract The collective behaviour of pondermotively-driven electrons in the interaction of anultraintense laser pulse with a relativistically transparent target is investigated bothnumerically and experimentally. The 2D profile of the electrons is found to lengthen alongthe laser polarisation axis in the case of limited transparency. At higher degrees oftransparency a double lobe structure forms in the electron beam in the orthorgonal plane tothe polarisation direction. Numerical results demonstrate good agreement with theexperimentally measured degree of transparency and elucidate the laser-electron dynamicsof the transition to transparency.,*,*,*

On the one hand; medical applications based on PictureArchiving and Communication Systems (PACS) often allow searching images via textual(metadata) descriptions (eg; by patient identification)[2]. On the other hand; content-basedimage/video retrieval systems have been proposed to support medical image retrieval …,*,*,*

Shape Descriptors based on Tensor Scale,Fernanda A Andaló; Ricardo da S Torres; Alexandre X Falcao,Abstract Tensor scale is a morphometric parameter that unifies the representation of localstructure thickness; orientation; and anisotropy; which can be used in several computervision and image processing tasks. We exploit this concept for binary images and proposetwo shape descriptors–Tensor Scale Descriptor with Influence Zones and Tensor ScaleContour Saliences. It also introduces a robust method to compute tensor scale; using agraph-based approach–the image foresting transform. Experimental results are provided;showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods; when compared to other relevantmethods with regard to their use in content-based image retrieval tasks.,*,*,*

9. Um Método Hıbrido de Agrupamento para Re-cuperaçao de Informaçao,Jurandy Almeida; Siome Goldenstein; Ricardo Torres,A evoluçao das tecnologias de informaçao e comunicaçao permitiram a criaçao de grandesrepositórios de dados; aumentando a necessidade de desenvolver sistemas de informaçaoeficientes para gerenciar essas coleçoes. A busca de uma informaçao é uma das tarefasmais importantes que deve ser suportada por esses sistemas. O algoritmo mais simplespara realizar uma consulta é uma busca sequencial. Nesse método; todos os dados saoanalisados sequencialmente. Embora simples; esse método é inviável para grandescoleçoes; uma vez que o tempo gasto para processar uma consulta é proporcional aotamanho do banco [8]. Existem extensivos estudos em técnicas indexaçao e estruturas dedados para acelerar o processo de consulta nesses repositórios de forma que informaçoesrelevantes possam ser encontradas rapidamente [3; 4].

Especificaçao de Modelos de Dados para Bibliotecas Digitais de Objetos Complexos,Nádia P Kozievitch; Ricardo Torres,A necessidade de mecanismos para troca de informaçoes; preservaçao; arquivamento eindexaçao de dados digitais (documentos; imagens; vıdeos; modelos; catálogos;informaçoes geo-referenciadas; séries temporais; etc.) favoreceram o surgimento deBibliotecas Digitais (BD). Esta grande quantidade de dados heterogêneos disponıvel nainternet facilitou a busca pela informaçao e enriqueceu o conceito que já tınhamos dasbibliotecas tradicionais; sem as restriçoes de espaço e tempo. Como exemplos debibliotecas digitais; podemos citar a digitalizaçao de várias bibliotecas tradicionais; como aBiblioteca Digital da Unicamp (http://libdigi. unicamp. br/) e Biblioteca Digital de Oxford(http://www. odl. ox. ac. uk/) e Biblioteca Nacional da França (http://www. bnf. fr/); museus;como o Australian Museums On Line;(http://www. nma. gov. au/AMIS) e outras iniciativas …,Coordenadora do 3o WTD Professora-Instituto de Computaçao-UNICAMP,*,*

Rotation-Invariant and Scale-Invariant Texture Representation for Image Identification and Recognition,Javier A Montoya-Zegarra; Neucimar J Leite; Ricardo da Silva Torres,Abstract. Digital image databases are becoming more widely used due to the rapidadvances in image acquisition and storage mechanisms. The past years have evidencedtherefore a rapid growth of such databases. In this sense; by considering not only theirpopularity; but also their large size; there exists an imminent need to provide users efficientand effective techniques to manage and interact with those collections in real-time. ThisMaster thesis provides a new way to characterize images by exploiting their texture visualcues in an efficient and effective manner. By doing this; image identification and recognitionapplications are facilitated. The papers published as a consequence of the achieved resultsin this study; demonstrate our main contributions.,*,*,*
6. Multimodal Complex Objects,Nádia Puchalski Kozievitch; Ricardo da Silva Torres,In many digital-based applications involving documents; like research; teaching anddiagnosis evolving image; video; catalogs; models; temporal series and geo-referenceddata there is a need for preservation; archiving; indexing; and integration of multimediainformation. The multiple kinds of information contributed to the concept of Digital Libraries(DL): organized collections of digital information; offering services like search; browsing;recommendation among others. These capabilities is being extended to select and annotatemultimedia; link contents; organize information; share and revise information; addressing theconcept of Superimposed Information (SI: information layer that is created over information[5]). From the computational view; a DL is composed of simple components named DigitalObjects (DO).
