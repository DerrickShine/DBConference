Efficiently linking text documents with relevant structured information,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Himanshu Gupta; Prasan Roy; Mukesh Mohania,Abstract Faced with growing knowledge management needs; enterprises are increasinglyrealizing the importance of interlinking critical business information distributed acrossstructured and unstructured data sources. We present a novel system; called EROCS; forlinking a given text document with relevant structured data. EROCS views the structureddata as a predefined set of" entities" and identifies the entities that best match the givendocument. EROCS also embeds the identified entities in the document; effectively creatinglinks between the structured data and segments within the document. Unlike priorapproaches; EROCS identifies such links even when the relevant entity is not explicitlymentioned in the document. EROCS uses an efficient algorithm that performs this taskkeeping the amount of information retrieved from the database at a minimum.

Recursive XML schemas; recursive XML queries; and relational storage: XML-to-SQL query translation,Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Raghav Kaushik; Jeffrey F Naughton,We consider the problem of translating XML queries into SQL when XML documents havebeen stored in an RDBMS using a schema-based relational decomposition. Surprisingly;there is no published XML-to-SQL query translation algorithm for this scenario that handlesrecursive XML schemas. We present a generic algorithm to translate path expressionqueries into SQL in the presence of recursion in the schema and queries. This algorithmhandles a general class of XML-to-relational mappings; which includes all techniquesproposed in literature. Some of the salient features of this algorithm are:(i) It translates a pathexpression query into a single SQL query; irrespective of how complex the XML schemais;(ii) It uses the" with" clause in SQL99 to handle recursive queries even over nonrecursiveschemas;(iii) It reconstructs recursive XML subtrees with a single SQL query and (iv) It …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Decision trees for entity identification: Approximation algorithms and hardness results,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Vinayaka Pandit; Sambuddha Roy; Pranjal Awasthi; Mukesh Mohania,Abstract We consider the problem of constructing decision trees for entity identification froma given relational table. The input is a table containing information about a set of entitiesover a fixed set of attributes and a probability distribution over the set of entities that specifiesthe likelihood of the occurrence of each entity. The goal is to construct a decision tree thatidentifies each entity unambiguously by testing the attribute values such that the averagenumber of tests is minimized. This classical problem finds such diverse applications asefficient fault detection; species identification in biology; and efficient diagnosis in the field ofmedicine. Prior work mainly deals with the special case where the input table is binary andthe probability distribution over the set of entities is uniform. We study the general probleminvolving arbitrary input tables and arbitrary probability distributions over the set of entities …,Proceedings of the twenty-sixth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2007,73
Efficient techniques for document sanitization,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Himanshu Gupta; Prasan Roy; Mukesh K Mohania,Abstract Sanitization of a document involves removing sensitive information from thedocument; so that it may be distributed to a broader audience. Such sanitization is neededwhile declassifying documents involving sensitive or confidential information such ascorporate emails; intelligence reports; medical records; etc. In this paper; we present theERASE framework for performing document sanitization in an automated manner. ERASEcan be used to sanitize a document dynamically; so that different users get different views ofthe same document based on what they are authorized to know. We formalize the problemand present algorithms used in ERASE for finding the appropriate terms to remove from thedocument. Our preliminary experimental study demonstrates the efficiency and efficacy ofthe proposed algorithms.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,66
SMS based interface for FAQ retrieval,Govind Kothari; Sumit Negi; Tanveer A Faruquie; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; L Venkata Subramaniam,Abstract Short Messaging Service (SMS) is popularly used to provide information access topeople on the move. This has resulted in the growth of SMS based Question Answering (QA)services. However automatically handling SMS questions poses significant challenges dueto the inherent noise in SMS questions. In this work we present an automatic FAQ-basedquestion answering system for SMS users. We handle the noise in a SMS query byformulating the query similarity over FAQ questions as a combinatorial search problem. Thesearch space consists of combinations of all possible dictionary variations of tokens in thenoisy query. We present an efficient search algorithm that does not require any training dataor SMS normalization and can handle semantic variations in question formulation. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two reallife datasets.,Proceedings of the Joint Conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the ACL and the 4th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the AFNLP: Volume 2-Volume 2,2009,62
New results on the computability and complexity of points--to analysis,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy,Abstract Given a program and two variables p and q; the goal of points-to analysis is tocheck if p can point to q in some execution of the program. This well-studied problem plays acrucial role in compiler optimization. The problem is known to be undecidable whendynamic memory is allowed. But the result is known only when variables are allowed to bestructures. We extend the result to show that; the problem remains undecidable; even whenonly scalar variables are allowed. Our second result deals with a version of points-toanalysis called flow-insensitive analysis; where one ignores the control flow of the programand assumes that the statements can be executed in any order. The problem is known to beNP-Hard; even when dynamic memory is not allowed and variables are scalar. We showthat when the variables are further restricted to have well-defined data types; the problem …,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,2003,62
Analysis of sampling techniques for association rule mining,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Vinayaka Pandit; Yogish Sabharwal,Abstract In this paper; we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the samplingtechnique for the association rule mining problem. Most of the previous works haveconcentrated only on the empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of sampling for the step offinding frequent itemsets. To the best of our knowledge; a theoretical framework to analyzethe quality of the solutions obtained by sampling has not been studied. Our contributions aretwo-fold. First; we present the notions of ε-close frequent itemset mining and ε-closeassociation rule mining that help assess the quality of the solutions obtained by sampling.Secondly; we show that both the frequent items mining and association rule miningproblems can be solved satisfactorily with a sample size that is independent of both thenumber of transactions size and the number of items.

Competing provers yield improved Karp–Lipton collapse results,Jin-Yi Cai; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Lane A Hemaspaandra; Mitsunori Ogihara,Abstract Via competing provers; we show that if a language A is self-reducible and haspolynomial-size circuits then S 2 A= S 2. Building on this; we strengthen the Kämper–AFKtheorem; namely; we prove that if NP⊆(NP∩ coNP)/poly then the polynomial hierarchycollapses to S 2 NP∩ coNP. We also strengthen Yap's theorem; namely; we prove that ifNP⊆ coNP/poly then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to S 2 NP.

Scalable single source shortest path algorithms for massively parallel systems,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Fabio Checconi; Prakash Murali; Fabrizio Petrini; Yogish Sabharwal,We consider the single-source shortest path (SSSP) problem: given an undirected graphwith integer edge weights and a source vertex $ v $; find the shortest paths from $ v $ to allother vertices. In this paper; we introduce a novel parallel algorithm; derived from theBellman-Ford and Delta-stepping algorithms. We employ various pruning techniques; suchas edge classification and direction-optimization; to dramatically reduce inter-nodecommunication traffic; and we propose load balancing strategies to handle higher-degreevertices. These techniques are particularly effective on power-law graphs; as demonstratedby our extensive performance analysis. In the largest tested configuration; an R-MAT graphwith $2^{38} $ vertices and $2^{42} $ edges on 32;768 Blue Gene/Q nodes; we haveachieved a processing rate of three Trillion Edges Per Second (TTEPS); a four orders of …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2017,38
Complete topology of cells; grains; and bubbles in three-dimensional microstructures,Emanuel A Lazar; Jeremy K Mason; Robert D MacPherson; David J Srolovitz,Abstract We introduce a general; efficient method to completely describe the topology ofindividual grains; bubbles; and cells in three-dimensional polycrystals; foams; and othermulticellular microstructures. This approach is applied to a pair of three-dimensionalmicrostructures that are often regarded as close analogues in the literature: one resultingfrom normal grain growth (mean curvature flow) and another resulting from a randomPoisson-Voronoi tessellation of space. Grain growth strongly favors particular graintopologies; compared with the Poisson-Voronoi model. Moreover; the frequencies of highlysymmetric grains are orders of magnitude higher in the grain growth microstructure than theyare in the Poisson-Voronoi one. Grain topology statistics provide a strong; robustdifferentiator of different cellular microstructures and provide hints to the processes that …,Physical review letters,2012,29

Oblivious symmetric alternation,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Sambuddha Roy,Abstract We introduce a new class O^p_2 as a subclass of the symmetric alternation classS^p_2. An O^p_2 proof system has the flavor of an S^p_2 proof system; but it is morerestrictive in nature. In an S^p_2 proof system; we have two competing provers and a verifiersuch that for any input; the honest prover has an irrefutable certificate. In an O^p_2 proofsystem; we require that the irrefutable certificates depend only on the length of the input; noton the input itself. In other words; the irrefutable proofs are oblivious of the input. For thisreason; we call the new class oblivious symmetric alternation. While this might seem slightlycontrived; it turns out that this class helps us improve some existing results. For instance; weshow that if NP⊂ P/poly then \rmPH=O^p_2; whereas the best known collapse under thesame hypothesis was \rmPH=S^p_2. We also define classes \rmYO^p_2 and \rmNO^p_2 …,Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science,2006,21

On the complexity of join predicates,Jin-Yi Cai; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Raghav Kaushik; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract We consider the complexity of join problems; focusing on equijoins; spatial-overlapjoins; and set-containment joins. We use a graph pebbling model to characterize these joinscombinatorially; by the length of their optimal pebbling strategies and computationally; bythe complexity of discovering these strategies. Our results show that equijoins are theeasiest of all joins; with optimal pebbling strategies that meet the lower bound over all joinproblems and that can be found in linear time. By contrast; spatial-overlap and set-containment joins are the hardest joins; with instances where optimal pebbling strategiesreach the upper bound over all join problems and with the problem of discovering optimalpebbling strategies being NP-complete. For set-containment joins; we show that discoveringthe optimal pebbling is also MAX-SNP-Complete. As a consequence; we show that …,Proceedings of the twentieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2001,20

On the difficulty of finding optimal relational decompositions for xml workloads: A complexity theoretic perspective,Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract A key problem that arises in the context of storing XML documents in relationaldatabases is that of finding an optimal relational decomposition for a given set of XMLdocuments and a given set of XML queries over those documents. While there have been anumber of ad hoc solutions proposed for this problem; to our knowledge this paperrepresents a first step toward formalizing the problem and studying its complexity. It turns outthat to even define what one means by an optimal decomposition; one first needs to specifyan algorithm to translate XML queries to relational queries; and a cost model to evaluate thequality of the resulting relational queries. By examining an interesting problem embedded inchoosing a relational decomposition; we show that choices of different translation algorithmsand cost models result in very different complexities for the resulting optimization …,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,19
Varying bandwidth resource allocation problem with bag constraints,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Vinayaka Pandit; Yogish Sabharwal; Deva P Seetharam,We consider the problem of scheduling jobs on a pool of machines. Each job requiresmultiple machines on which it executes in parallel. For each job; the input specifies releasetime; deadline; processing time; profit and the number of machines required. The totalnumber of machines may be different at different points of time. A feasible solution is asubset of jobs and a schedule for them such that at any timeslot; the total number ofmachines required by the jobs active at the timeslot does not exceed the number ofmachines available at that timeslot. We present an O (log (B max/B min))-approximationalgorithm; where B max and B min are the maximum and minimum available bandwidth(maximum and minimum number of machines available over all the timeslots).

Resource allocation for covering time varying demands,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Amit Kumar; Sambuddha Roy; Yogish Sabharwal,Abstract We consider the problem of allocating resources to satisfy demand requirementsvarying over time. The input specifies a demand for each timeslot. Each resource is specifiedby a start-time; end-time; an associated cost and a capacity. A feasible solution is a multisetof resources such that at any point of time; the sum of the capacities offered by the resourcesis at least the demand requirement at that point of time. The goal is to minimize the total costof the resources included in the solution. This problem arises naturally in many scenariossuch as workforce management; sensor networks; cloud computing; energy managementand distributed computing. We study this problem under the partial cover setting and thezero-one setting. In the former scenario; the input also includes a number k and the goal is tochoose a minimum cost solution that satisfies the demand requirements of at least k …,European Symposium on Algorithms,2011,12

Eachresource is specified by a start-time; finish-time and the capacity of resource available andhas an associated cost; and each job is specified by a start-time; finish-time and the amountof the resource required (demand) during this interval. A feasible solution is a multiset ofresources (ie; multiple units of each resource may be picked) such that at any point of time;the sum of the capacities offered by the resources is at least the total demand of the jobsactive at that point of time. The cost of the solution is the sum of the costs of the resourcesincluded in the solution (taking into account the units of the resources). The goal is to find afeasible solution of minimum cost.

Time-space tradeoff in derandomizing probabilistic logspace,Jin-Yi Cai; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Dieter van Melkebeek,Abstract Nisan showed that any randomized logarithmic space algorithm (running inpolynomial time and with two-sided error) can be simulated by a deterministic algorithm thatruns simultaneously in polynomial time and Θ (log 2 n) space. Subsequently Saks and Zhouimproved the space complexity and showed that a deterministic simulation can be carriedout in space Θ (log 1.5 n). However; their simulation runs in time n Θ (log^{0.5} n). We provea time--space tradeoff that interpolates these two simulations. Specifically; we prove that; forany 0≤ α≤ 0.5; any randomized logarithmic space algorithm (running in polynomial timeand with two-sided error) can be simulated deterministically in time n O (log^{0.5-α} n) andspace O (log^{1.5+ α} n).

Improved algorithms for resource allocation under varying capacity,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Anamitra R Choudhury; Shalmoli Gupta; Sambuddha Roy; Yogish Sabharwal,Abstract We consider the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on a system that offers certainresource; wherein the amount of resource offered varies over time. For each job; the inputspecifies a set of possible scheduling instances; where each instance is given by startingtime; ending time; profit and resource requirement. A feasible solution selects a subset of jobinstances such that at any timeslot; the total requirement by the chosen instances does notexceed the resource available at that timeslot; and at most one instance is chosen for eachjob. The above problem falls under the well-studied framework of unsplittable flow problem(UFP) on line. The generalized notion of scheduling possibilities captures the standardsetting concerned with release times and deadlines.

Each job consists of a set (or bag) of job instances. For each job instance;the input specifies the start time; finish time; bandwidth requirement and profit. Thebandwidth offered by the system varies at different points of time and is specified as part ofthe input.

Finding Irrefutable Certificates for S_2^ p via Arthur and Merlin,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Sambuddha Roy,Abstract We show that $ S_2^ psubseteq P^{prAM} $; where $ S_2^ p $ is the symmetricalternation class and $ prAM $ refers to the promise version of the Arthur-Merlin class $ AM$. This is derived as a consequence of our main result that presents an $ FP^{prAM} $algorithm for finding a small set of``collectively irrefutable certificates''of a given $ S_2 $-typematrix. The main result also yields some new consequences of the hypothesis that $ NP $has polynomial size circuits. It is known that the above hypothesis implies a collapse of thepolynomial time hierarchy ($ PH $) to $ S_2^ psubseteq ZPP^{NP} $(Cai 2007; K" obler andWatanabe 1998).

On the non-approximability of points-to analysis,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Susan Horwitz,Abstract. Determining points-to sets is an important static-analysis problem. Most of theclassic static analyses (used eg; by compilers or in programming environments) rely onknowing which variables might be used or defined by each expression in a program. In thepresence of pointers; the use/def set of an expression like* p=* q can only be determinedgiven (safe) points-to sets for p and q. Previous work has shown that both precise flow-sensitive and precise flow-insensitive pointer analysis is NP-Hard; even when restricted tosingle-procedure programs with no dynamic memory allocation. In this paper; we show thatit is not even possible to compute good approximations to the precise solutions (ie; tocompute points-to sets whose sizes are within a constant factor of the sizes of the precisepoints-to sets) unless P= NP.,Acta Informatica,2002,7

On zero error algorithms having oracle access to one query,Jin-Yi Cai; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy,Abstract It is known that\rm S _ 2^ p ⊆\rm ZPP^ NP (Cai; 2001). The reverse direction ofwhether ZPP NP is contained in\rm S _ 2^ p remains open. We show that if the zero-erroralgorithm is allowed to ask only one query to the NP oracle (for any input and randomstring); then it can be simulated in\rm S _ 2^ p. That is; we prove that\rm S _ 2^ p. Next weconsider whether the above result can be improved as\rm ZPP^ NP 1 ⊆\rm P^ NP and pointout a difficulty in doing so. Via a simple proof; we observe that BPP⊆ ZPP NP 1 (a resultimplicitly proven in some prior work). Thus; achieving the above improvement would implyBPP⊆ P NP; settling a long standing open problem. We then argue that the abovementioned improvement can be obtained for the next level of the polynomial time hierarchy.Namely; we prove that\rm ZPP^ 2^ p 1 ⊆\rm P^ 2^ p 2.

Density functions subject to a co-matroid constraint,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Natwar Modani; Sivaramakrishnan R Natarajan; Sambuddha Roy; Yogish Sabharwal,Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of finding the {\em densest} subset subject to{\em co-matroid constraints}. We are given a {\em monotone supermodular} set function $ f $defined over a universe $ U $; and the density of a subset $ S $ is defined to be $ f (S)/\crd{S} $. This generalizes the concept of graph density. Co-matroid constraints are thefollowing: given matroid $\calM $ a set $ S $ is feasible; iff the complement of $ S $ is {\emindependent} in the matroid. Under such constraints; the problem becomes $\np $-hard. Thespecific case of graph density has been considered in literature under specific co-matroidconstraints; for example; the cardinality matroid and the partition matroid. We show a 2-approximation for finding the densest subset subject to co-matroid constraints. Thus; forinstance; we improve the approximation guarantees for the result for partition matroids in …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.5215,2012,5

One of the formulations considered in this context is the$ k $-anonymization problem: given a table; suppress a minimum number of cells so that inthe transformed table; each row is identical to atleast $ k-1$ other rows. The problem isknown to be NP-hard and MAXSNP-hard; but in the known reductions; the number ofcolumns in the constructed tables is arbitrarily large. However; in practical settings thenumber of columns is much smaller. So; we study the complexity of the practical setting inwhich the number of columns $ m $ is small. We show that the problem is NP-hard; evenwhen the number of columns $ m $ is a constant ($ m= 3$). We also prove MAXSNP-hardness for this restricted version and derive that the problem cannot be approximated …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1004.4729,2010,5
Subgraph counting: Color coding beyond trees,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Michael Kapralov; Prakash Murali; Fabrizio Petrini; Xinyu Que; Yogish Sabharwal; Baruch Schieber,The problem of counting occurrences of query graphs in a large data graph; known assubgraph counting; is fundamental to several domains such as genomics and social networkanalysis. Many important special cases (eg triangle counting) have received significantattention. Color coding is a very general and powerful algorithmic technique for subgraphcounting. Color coding has been shown to be effective in several applications; but scalableimplementations are only known for the special case of tree queries (ie queries of treewidthone). In this paper we present the first efficient distributed implementation for color codingthat goes beyond tree queries: ouralgorithm applies to any query graph of treewidth 2. Sincetree queries can be solved in time linear in the size of the data graph; our contribution is thefirst step into the realm of color codingfor queries that require superlinear worst case …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2016 IEEE International,2016,4

Keyword search over dynamic categorized information,Manish Bhide; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Krithi Ramamritham; Prasan Roy,Consider an information repository whose content is categorized. A data item (in therepository) can belong to multiple categories and new data is continuously added to thesystem. In this paper; we describe a system; CS*; which takes a keyword query and returnsthe relevant top-K categories. In contrast; traditional keyword search returns the top-Kdocuments (ie; data items) relevant to a user query. The need to dynamically categorize newdata and also update the meta-data required for fast responses to user queries posesinteresting challenges. The brute force approach of updating the meta-data by comparingeach new data item with all the categories is impractical due to (i) the large cost involved infinding the categories associated with a data item and (ii) the high rate of arrival of new dataitems. We show that a sampling based approach which provides statistical guarantees on …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,4
On optimizing distributed tucker decomposition for dense tensors,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Jee W Choi; Douglas J Joseph; Xing Liu; Prakash Murali; Yogish Sabharwal; Dheeraj Sreedhar,The Tucker decomposition expresses a given tensor as the product of a small core tensorand a set of factor matrices. Our objective is to develop an efficient distributedimplementation for the case of dense tensors. The implementation is based on the HOOI(Higher Order Orthogonal Iterator) procedure; wherein the tensor-times-matrix product formsthe core routine. Prior work have proposed heuristics for reducing the computational loadand communication volume incurred by the routine. We study the two metrics in a formal andsystematic manner; and design strategies that are optimal under the two fundamentalmetrics. Our experimental evaluation on a large benchmark of tensors shows that theoptimal strategies provide significant reduction in load and volume compared to priorheuristics; and provide up to 7× speed-up in the overall running time.,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS); 2017 IEEE International,2017,3
Time-space tradeoff in derandomizing probabilistic logspace,Jin-Yi Cai; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Dieter van Melkebeek,Abstract Nisan 6 showed that any randomized logarithmic space algorithm (running inpolynomial time and with two-sided error) can be simulated by a deterministic algorithm thatruns simultaneously in polynomial time and Θ (log 2 n) space. Subsequently Saks and Zhou9 improved the space complexity and showed that a deterministic simulation can be carriedout in space Θ (log 1.5 n). However; their simulation runs in time n^Θ(\rmlog^0.5n). Weprove a time-space tradeoff that interpolates these two simulations. Specifically; we provethat; for any 0≤ α≤ 0.5; any randomized logarithmic space algorithm (running in polynomialtime and with two-sided error) can be simulated deterministically in time n^O(log^0.5-αn)and space O (log 1.5+ α n). That is; we prove that BPL⊆ DTISP n^O(log^0.5-αn); O (log 1.5+α n).,Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science,2004,3
The problem of context sensitive string matching,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy,Abstract In the context sensitive string matching problem; we are given a pattern and a text.The pattern is a string over variables and constants and the text is a string of constants. Thegoal is to find if there is a mapping from variables to strings of constants so that on applyingthis mapping to the pattern we get the given text. Languages like Perl and Python supportsuch a sophisticated string matching. The problem is known to be NP-Complete. In thispaper; we consider a weighted version of this problem that checks how close the pattern canbe matched with the text. We show that this variation is MAXSNP-Complete and cannot beapproximated within a factor of 3313/3312. We show that even the restriction; where thepattern consists of variables only; is NP-Complete and MAXSNP-Complete. When thealphabet is bounded; we give an approximation algorithm for this restriction.,Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching,2002,3

In this problem; there are many resources; eachspecified by a capacity; duration; per-use cost; and an availability window comprising of arelease time and a deadline. A resources can be reused multiple times within its availabilitywindow with each use being limited by the duration associated with the resource andincurring cost equal to per-use cost. Different uses of a resource have to be non-overlapping. Given a demand profile; the goal is to cover it by scheduling the resourceswithin their availability windows while minimizing their total cost.

Finding Independent Sets in Unions of Perfect Graphs,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Vinayaka Pandit; Sambuddha Roy; Yogish Sabharwal,Abstract The maximum independent set problem (MaxIS) on general graphs is known to beNP-hard to approximate within a factor of $ n^{1-epsilon} $; for any $ epsilon> 0$. However;there are many``easy" classes of graphs on which the problem can be solved in polynomialtime. In this context; an interesting question is that of computing the maximum independentset in a graph that can be expressed as the union of a small number of graphs from an easyclass. The MaxIS problem has been studied on unions of interval graphs and chordalgraphs. We study the MaxIS problem on unions of perfect graphs (which generalize theabove two classes). We present an $ O (sqrt {n}) $-approximation algorithm when the inputgraph is the union of two perfect graphs.

Arthur and Merlin as oracles,Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Sambuddha Roy,Abstract We study some problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time given oracleaccess to the promise version of the Arthur-Merlin class AM. The main result is that\rmBPP^\rmNP_||⊆\rmP^\rmpr\rmAM_||. An important property of the class\rmP^\rmpr\rmAM_|| is that it can be derandomized as \rmP^\rmpr\rmAM_||=\rmP^\rmNP_||;under a natural hardness hypothesis used for derandomizing the class AM; this directlyfollows from a result due to Miltersen and Vinodchandran 10.

Fast Algorithms for Constrained Graph Density Problems,Venkatesan Chakaravarthy; Neelima Gupta; Aditya Pancholi; Sambuddha Roy,Abstract We consider the question of finding communities in large social networks. Inliterature and practice;“communities” refer to a well-connected subgraph of the entirenetwork. For instance; the notion of graph density has been considered as a reasonablemeasure of a community. Researchers have also looked at the minimum degree of asubgraph as a measure of the connectedness of the community. Typically; a community ismeaningful in the context of a social network if it is of somewhat significant size. Thus; earlierwork has considered the densest graph problem subject to various co-matroid constraints.Most of these algorithms utilize an exact dense subgraph procedure as a subroutine; such asubroutine involves computing maximum flows or solving LPs.

Algorithms for power-aware resource activation,Sonika Arora; Archita Agarwal; Venkatesan T Chakaravarthy; Yogish Sabharwal,We study the problem of minimally activating a resource that is shared by multiple jobs. In apower-aware computing environment; the resource needs to be activated (powered-up) sothat it can service the jobs. Each job specifies an interval during which its needs the servicesof the resource and the duration (time length) for which it requires the resource to be active.Our goal is to activate the resource for a minimum amount of time; while satisfying all thejobs. We study two variants of this problem; the contiguous and the non-contiguous cases. Inthe contiguous case; each job requires that its demand for the resource be serviced with aset of contiguous timeslots whereas in the non-contiguous case; the demand of a job may beserviced with a set of non-contiguous timeslots.

For each job; the input specifies start time; finish timeand profit; the input also specifies the job's requirement for each resource. Each resourcehas a fixed capacity (called bandwidth). A feasible solution is a subset of jobs such that forany timeslot and any resource; the total requirement of the jobs active at the timeslot doesnot exceed the capacity of the resource. The goal is to maximize the profit of the jobsselected. We present an approximation algorithm with provable guarantees and effectiveheuristics for this problem.

Our work extends the following two breakthroughresults on the topic. Firstly; Nisan showed that any randomized algorithm A can be simulateddeterministically with only a quadratic blow-up in space usage. The running time of hissimulation is polynomial in that of A. Secondly; Saks and Zhou designed a simulation thatrequires only sub-quadratic amount of space; but needs time super-polynomial (in therunning time of A). We generalize these results by designing a sequence of simulations withvarying time-space requirements. The above two simulations lie at the two extremes of …,*,2004,*
