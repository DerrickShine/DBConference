XSEarch: A semantic search engine for XML,Sara Cohen; Jonathan Mamou; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract XSEarch; a semantic search engine for XML; is presented. XSEarch has a simplequery language; suitable for a naive user. It returns semantically related documentfragments that satisfy the user's query. Query answers are ranked using extendedinformation-retrieval techniques and are generated in an order similar to the ranking.Advanced indexing techniques were developed to facilitate efficient implementation ofXSEarch. The performance of the different techniques as well as the recall and the precisionwere measured experimentally. These experiments indicate that XSEarch is efficient;scalable and ranks quality results highly.,Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth International Conference on Very Large Databases; Berlin; Germany; 9-12 September; 2003,2003,753
Flexible queries over semistructured data,Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Flexible queries facilitate; in a novel way; easy and concise querying of databasesthat have varying structures. Two different semantics; flexible and semiflexible; areintroduced and investigated. The complexity of evaluating queries under the two semanticsis analyzed. Query evaluation is polynomial in the size of the query; the database and theresult in the following two cases. First; a semiflexible DAG query and a tree database.Second; a flexible tree query and a database that is any graph. Query containment andequivalence are also investigated. For the flexible semantics; query equivalence is alwayspolynomial. For the semiflexible semantics; query equivalence is polynomial for DAGqueries and exponential when the queries have cycles. Under the semiflexible and flexiblesemantics; two databases could be equivalent even when they are not isomorphic …,Proceedings of the twentieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2001,112
Interconnection semantics for keyword search in XML,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Benny Kimelfeld; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract A framework for describing semantic relationships among nodes in XML documentsis presented. In contrast to earlier work; the XML documents may have ID references (ie;they correspond to graphs and not just trees). A specific interconnection semantics in thisframework can be defined explicitly or derived automatically. The main advantage ofinterconnection semantics is the ability to pose queries on XML data in the style of keywordsearch. Several methods for automatically deriving interconnection semantics arepresented. The complexity of the evaluation and the satisfiability problems under the derivedsemantics is analyzed. For many important cases; the complexity is tractable and hence; theproposed interconnection semantics can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,96
Object fusion in geographic information systems,Catriel Beeri; Yaron Kanza; Eliyahu Safra; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Given two geographic databases; a fusion algorithm should produce all pairs ofcorresponding objects (ie; objects that represent the same real-world entity). Four fusionalgorithms; which only use locations of objects; are described and their performance ismeasured in terms of recall and precision. These algorithms are designed to work evenwhen locations are imprecise and each database represents only some of the real-worldentities. Results of extensive experimentation are presented and discussed. The tests showthat the performance depends on the density of the data sources and the degree of overlapamong them. All four algorithms are much better than the current state of the art (ie; the one-sided nearest-neighbor join). One of these four algorithms is best in all cases; at a cost of asmall increase in the running time compared to the other algorithms.,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,94
EquiX Easy Querying in XML Databases.,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yakov A Kogan; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv; Alexander Serebrenik,The Web is explored by many users; but only a few of them have experience in using querylanguages. Thus; one of the greatest challenges; provided by XML; is to create a querylanguage simple enough for the naive user. In this paper; we present EquiX| a powerful andeasy to use query language for XML. The main goal in designing EquiX is to strike the rightbalance between expressive power and simplicity. EquiX has a form-based GUI that isconstructed automatically from the DTDs of XML documents. Query forms are built from wellknown HTML primitives. The result of a query in EquiX is a collection of XML documents;and it is automatically generated from the query without explicit speci cation of the format ofthe result. Knowledge of XML syntax is not required in order to use EquiX. Yet; EquiX is ableto express rather complicated queries; containing quanti cation; negation and …,WebDB (Informal Proceedings),1999,64
Finding corresponding objects when integrating several geo-spatial datasets,Catriel Beeri; Yerach Doytsher; Yaron Kanza; Eliyahu Safra; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract When integrating geo-spatial datasets; a join algorithm is used for finding sets ofcorresponding objects (ie; objects that represent the same real-world entity). Algorithms forjoining two datasets were studied in the past. This paper investigates integration of threedatasets and proposes methods that can be easily generalized to any number of datasets.Two approaches that use only locations of objects are presented and compared. In oneapproach; a join algorithm for two datasets is applied sequentially. In the second approach;all the integrated datasets are processed simultaneously. For the two approaches; joinalgorithms are given and their performances; in terms of recall and precision; are compared.The algorithms are designed to perform well even when locations are imprecise and eachdataset represents only some of the real-world entities.

Location‐based algorithms for finding sets of corresponding objects over several geo‐spatial data sets,Eliyahu Safra; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv; Catriel Beeri; Yerach Doytsher,When integrating geo‐spatial data sets; a join algorithm is used for finding sets ofcorresponding objects (ie; objects that represent the same real‐world entity). This articleinvestigates location‐based join algorithms for integration of several data sets. First;algorithms for integration of two data sets are presented and their performances; in terms ofrecall and precision; are compared. Then; two approaches for integration of more than twodata sets are described. In one approach; all the integrated data sets are processedsimultaneously. In the second approach; a join algorithm for two data sets is appliedsequentially; either in a serial manner; where in each join at least one of the joined data setsis a single source; or in a hierarchical manner; where two join results can be joined. For thetwo approaches; join algorithms are given. The algorithms are designed to perform well …,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2010,45
Querying geo-social data by bridging spatial networks and social networks,Yerach Doytsher; Ben Galon; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Recording the location of people using location-acquisition technologies; such asGPS; allows generating life patterns; which associate people to places they frequently visit.Considering life patterns as edges that connect users of a social network to geographicalentities on a spatial network; enriches the social network; providing an integrated socio-spatial graph. Queries over such graph extract information on users; in correspondence withtheir location history; and extract information on geographical entities in correspondencewith users who frequently visit these entities. In this paper we present the concept of a socio-spatial graph that is based on life patterns; where users are connected to geographicalentities using life-pattern edges. We provide a set of operators that form a query languagesuitable for the integrated data. We consider two implementations of a socio-spatial graph …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location Based Social Networks,2010,43
Interactive route search in the presence of order constraints,Yaron Kanza; Roy Levin; Eliyahu Safra; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract A route search is an enhancement of an ordinary geographic search. Instead ofmerely returning a set of entities; the result is a route that goes via entities that are relevant tothe search. The input to the problem consists of several search queries; and each querydefines a type of geographical entities. When visited; some of the entities succeed insatisfying the user while others fail to do so; however; only the probability of success isknown prior to arrival. The main task is to find a route that visits at least one satisfying entityof each type. In an interactive search; the route is computed in steps. In each step; only thenext entity of the route is given to the user; and after visiting that entity; the user provides afeedback specifying whether the entity satisfies her. This paper investigates interactive routesearch in the presence of order constraints that specify that some types of entities should …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,41

Efficient integration of road maps,Eliyah Safra; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv; Yerach Doytsher,Abstract Integration of two road maps is finding a matching between pairs of objects thatrepresent; in the maps; the same real-world road. Several algorithms were proposed in thepast for road-map integration; however; these algorithms are not efficient and some of themeven require human feedback. Thus; they are not suitable for many important applications(eg; Web services) where efficiency; in terms of both time and space; is crucial. This paperpresents two efficient algorithms for integrating maps in which roads are represented aspolylines. The main novelty of these algorithms is in using only the locations of the endpointsof the polylines rather than trying to match whole lines. Experiments on real-world data aregiven; showing that our approach of integration based on matching merely endpoints isefficient and accurate (that is; it provides high recall and precision).,Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2006,38
EquiX—a search and query language for XML,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yakov Kogan; Yehoshua Sagiv; Werner Nutt; Alexander Serebrenik,Abstract EquiX is a search language for XML that combines the power of querying with thesimplicity of searching. Requirements for such languages are discussed; and it is shown thatEquiX meets the necessary criteria. Both a graph-based abstract syntax and a formalconcrete syntax are presented for EquiX queries. In addition; the semantics is defined andan evaluation algorithm is presented. The evaluation algorithm is polynomial undercombined complexity. EquiX combines pattern matching; quantification; and logicalexpressions to query both the data and meta-data of XML documents. The result of a queryin EquiX is a set of XML documents.

Storing routes in socio-spatial networks and supporting social-based route recommendation,Yerach Doytsher; Ben Galon; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Cellular phones and GPS-based navigation systems allow recording the locationhistory of users; to find places the users frequently visit and routes along which the usersfrequently travel. This provides associations between users and geographic entities.Considering these associations as edges that connect users of a social network togeographical entities on a spatial network yields an integrated socio-spatial network.Queries over a socio-spatial network glean information on users; in correspondence withtheir location history; and retrieve geographical entities in association with the users whofrequently visit these entities. In this paper we present a graph model for socio-spatialnetworks that store information on frequently traveled routes. We present a query languagethat consists of graph traversal operations; aiming at facilitating the formulation of queries …,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location-Based Social Networks,2011,35
Querying incomplete information in semistructured data,Yaron Kanza; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Semistructured data occur in situations where information lacks a homogeneousstructure and is incomplete. Yet; up to now the incompleteness of information has not beenreflected by special features of query languages. Our goal is to investigate the principles ofqueries that allow for incomplete answers. We do not present; however; a concrete querylanguage. Queries over classical structured data models contain a number of variables andconstraints on these variables. An answer is a binding of the variables by elements of thedatabase such that the constraints are satisfied. In the present paper; we loosen this conceptin so far as we allow also answers that are partial; that is; not all variables in the query arebound by such an answer. Partial answers make it necessary to refine the model of queryevaluation. The first modification relates to the satisfaction of constraints: in some …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2002,34
Ad hoc matching of vectorial road networks,Eliyahu Safra; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv; Yerach Doytsher,In integration of road maps modeled as road vector data; the main task is matching pairs ofobjects that represent; in different maps; the same segment of a real-world road. In an adhoc integration; the matching is done for a specific need and; thus; is performed in real time;where only a limited preprocessing is possible. Usually; ad hoc integration is performed aspart of some interaction with a user and; hence; the matching algorithm is required tocomplete its task in time that is short enough for human users to provide feedback to theapplication; that is; in no more than a few seconds. Such interaction is typical of services onthe World Wide Web and to applications in car-navigation systems or in handheld devices.Several algorithms were proposed in the past for matching road vector data; however; thesealgorithms are not efficient enough for ad hoc integration.

Full disjunctions: Polynomial-delay iterators in action,Sara Cohen; Itzhak Fadida; Yaron Kanza; Benny Kimelfeld; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Full disjunctions are an associative extension of the outer-join operator to anarbitrary number of relations. Their main advantage is the ability to maximally combine datafrom different relations while preserving all the original information. An algorithm forefficiently computing full disjunctions is presented. This algorithm is superior to previousones in three ways. First; it is the first algorithm that computes a full disjunction with apolynomial delay between tuples. Hence; it can be implemented as an iterator that producesa stream of tuples; which is important in many cases (eg; pipelined query processing andWeb applications). Second; the total runtime is linear in the size of the output. Third; thealgorithm employs a novel optimization that divides the relation schemes into biconnectedcomponents; uses a separate iterator for each component and applies outerjoins …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,29
On the accuracy of hyper-local geotagging of social media content,David Flatow; Mor Naaman; Ke Eddie Xie; Yana Volkovich; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Social media users share billions of items per year; only a small fraction of which isgeotagged. We present a data-driven approach for identifying non-geotagged content itemsthat can be associated with a hyper-local geographic area by modeling the locationdistributions of n-grams that appear in the text. We explore the trade-off between accuracyand coverage of this method. Further; we explore differences across content received frommultiple platforms and devices; and show; for example; that content shared via differentsources and applications produces significantly different geographic distributions; and that itis preferred to model and predict location for items according to their source. Our findingsshow the potential and the bounds of a data-driven approach to assigning location data toshort social media texts; and offer implications for all applications that use data-driven …,Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2015,26
Heuristic algorithms for route-search queries over geographical data,Yaron Kanza; Eliyahu Safra; Yehoshua Sagiv; Yerach Doytsher,Abstract In a geographical route search; given search terms; the goal is to find an effectiveroute that (1) starts at a given location;(2) ends at a given location; and (3) travels viageographical entities that are relevant to the given terms. A route is effective if it does notexceed a given distance limit whereas the ranking scores of the visited entities; with respectto the search terms; are maximal. This paper introduces route-search queries; suggeststhree semantics for such queries and deals with the problem of efficiently answering queriesunder the different semantics. Since the problem of answering route-search queries is ageneralization of the traveling salesman problem; it is unlikely to have an efficient solution;ie; there is no polynomial-time algorithm that solves the problem (unless P= NP). Hence; inthis work we consider heuristics for the problem. Methods for effectively computing routes …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,26
D2RQ/update: updating relational data via virtual RDF,Vadim Eisenberg; Yaron Kanza,Abstract D2RQ is a popular RDB-to-RDF mapping platform that supports mapping relationaldatabases to RDF and posing SPARQL queries to these relational databases. However;D2RQ merely provides a read-only RDF view on relational databases. Thus; we introduceD2RQ/Update---an extension of D2RQ to enable executing SPARQL/Update statements onthe mapped data; and to facilitate the creation of a read-write Semantic Web.,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,23
Route search over probabilistic geospatial data,Yaron Kanza; Eliyahu Safra; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract In a route search over geospatial data; a user provides terms for specifying types ofgeographical entities that she wishes to visit. The goal is to find a route that (1) starts at agiven location;(2) ends at a given location; and (3) travels via geospatial entities that arerelevant to the provided search terms. Earlier work studied the problem of finding a route thatis effective in the sense that its length does not exceed a given limit; the relevancy of theobjects is as high as possible; and the route visits a single object from each specified type.This paper investigates route search over probabilistic geospatial data. It is shown that thenotion of an effective route requires a new definition and; specifically; two alternativesemantics are proposed. Computing an effective route is more complicated; compared to thenon-probabilistic case; and hence necessitates new algorithms.

Tarsius: A system for traffic-aware route search under conditions of uncertainty,Itsik Hefez; Yaron Kanza; Roy Levin,Abstract This demo presents TARSIUS---a system for traffic-aware route search. In a traffic-aware route search (TARS); the user provides start location; target location and searchterms; which specify types of geographical entities that should be visited along the route. ATARS query may include additional temporal constraints and limitations on the order bywhich entities are visited. The goal is to find the fastest route from the start location to thetarget; via entities of the specified types; while taking into account variations in the travelspeed; due to changes in traffic conditions. Planning a route under conditions of uncertaintyrequires the system to also take into account the possibility that some visited entities will notsatisfy the user requirements so that the route may need to go via several entities of thesame type. In the demonstration we present the system. We demonstrate a web-based …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2011,20
On the correlation between textual content and geospatial locations in microblogs,Irena Grabovitch-Zuyev; Yaron Kanza; Elad Kravi; Barak Pat,Abstract Microblogs allow users to publish geo-tagged posts---short textual messagesassigned to a geographic location. Users send posts from places they visit and discuss anidiosyncratic mixture of personal and general topics. Thus; it is reasonable to assume thatthe locations and the textual content of posts will be unique and will identify the posting user;to some extent. This raises the question whether there is a correlation between the locationsof posts and their content. Are users who are similar from the geospatial perspective (ie; whosend messages from nearby locations) also similar from the textual perspective (ie; sendmessages with similar textual content)? Do posts with similar content have a spatialdistribution similar to that of any random set of posts? We present a study that focuses onthese questions. We provide statistical tests to examine the correlation between textual …,Proceedings of Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2014,19
Efficient; effective and flexible XML retrieval using summaries,Mir Sadek Ali; Mariano Consens; Xin Gu; Yaron Kanza; Flavio Rizzolo; Raquel Stasiu,Abstract Retrieval queries that combine structural constraints with keyword search areplacing new challenges on retrieval systems. This paper presents TReX—a new retrievalsystem for XML. TReX can efficiently return either all the answers to a given query or onlythe top-k answers. In this paper; we discuss our participation in the annual Initiative for theEvaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) workshop in the ad-hoc track. Our main contribution is toinvestigate the use of summaries and the flexibility they provide when dealing with structuralconstraints. We describe algorithms for retrieval using summaries. Experimental results arepresented showing that TReX answers queries efficiently and effectively.,International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval,2006,19
Generating relations from XML documents,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract This paper discusses several mechanisms for creating relations out of XMLdocuments. A relation generator consists of two parts:(1) a tuple of path expressions and (2)an index indicating which path expressions may not be assigned the null value. Evaluating arelation generator involves finding tuples of nodes that satisfy the path expressions and arerelated to one another in a meaningful fashion. Different semantics for evaluation are giventhat take into account the possible presence of incomplete information. The complexity ofgenerating relations from documents is analyzed and evaluation algorithms are described.,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,19
Querying semantically tagged documents on the World-Wide Web,Ziv Bar-Yossef; Yaron Kanza; Yakov Kogan; Yehoshua Sagiv; Werner Nutt,Abstract QUEST is a system for Querying Semantically Tagged documents on the World-Wide Web. The advent of new markup languages; such as xml; facilitates authoring of Webdocuments that contain not just html tags for instructing a browser how to view a document;but also contain objects that represent the semantic structure of the document. When suchdocuments become widely available; more powerful methods to access and queryinformation on the Web will be possible. The QUEST system was designed andimplemented for querying and manipulating documents written in the markup languageohtml. ohtml combines html and objects of the oem data model. QUEST has several newfeatures. First; QUEST can be used to query a combination of hypertext and objectstructures. Second; The results of queries are ohtml pages and thus of the same type as …,International Workshop on Next Generation Information Technologies and Systems,1999,18
TARS: traffic-aware route search,Roy Levin; Yaron Kanza,Abstract In a traffic-aware route search (TARS); the user provides start and target locationsand sets of search terms. The goal is to find the fastest route from the start location to thetarget via geographic entities (points of interest) that correspond to the search terms; whiletaking into account variations in the travel speed due to changes in traffic conditions; and thepossibility that some visited entities will not satisfy the search requirements. A TARS querymay include temporal constraints and order constraints that restrict the order by whichentities are visited. Since TARS generalizes the Traveling-Salesperson Problem; it is an NP-hard problem. Thus; it is unlikely to find a polynomial-time algorithm for evaluating TARSqueries. Hence; we present in this paper three heuristics to answer TARS queries—a localgreedy approach; a global greedy approach and an algorithm that computes a linear …,GeoInformatica,2014,16
Computing a k-route over uncertain geographical data,Eliyahu Safra; Yaron Kanza; Nir Dolev; Yehoshua Sagiv; Yerach Doytsher,Abstract An uncertain geo-spatial dataset is a collection of geo-spatial objects that do notrepresent accurately real-world entities. Each object has a confidence value indicating howlikely it is for the object to be correct. Uncertain data can be the result of operations such asimprecise integration; incorrect update or inexact querying. A k-route; over an uncertain geo-spatial dataset; is a path that travels through the geo-spatial objects; starting at a givenlocation and stopping after visiting k correct objects. A k-route is considered shortest if theexpected length of the route is less than or equal to the expected length of any other k-routethat starts at the given location. This paper introduces the problem of finding a shortest k-route over an uncertain dataset. Since the problem is a generalization of the travelingsalesman problem; it is unlikely to have an efficient solution; ie; there is no polynomial …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,16
Detecting and exploiting near-sortedness for efficient relational query evaluation,Sagi Ben-Moshe; Yaron Kanza; Eldar Fischer; Arie Matsliah; Mani Fischer; Carl Staelin,Abstract Many relational operations are best performed when the relations are stored sortedover the relevant attributes (eg the common attributes in a natural join operation). However;generally relations are not stored sorted because it is expensive to maintain them this way(and impossible whenever there is more than one relevant sort key). Still; many timesrelations turn out to be nearly-sorted; where most tuples are close to their place in the order.This state can result from" leftover sortedness"; where originally sorted relations wereupdated; or were combined into interim results when evaluating a complex query. It can alsoresult from weak correlations between attribute values. Currently; nearly-sorted relations aretreated the same as unsorted relations; and when relational operations are evaluated forthem; a generic algorithm is used. Yet; many operations can be computed more efficiently …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Database Theory,2011,15
An interactive approach to route search,Yaron Kanza; Roy Levin; Eliyahu Safra; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract In a probabilistic route search; there is a start location; a target location; and searchqueries Q 1;...; Q n. Each Q i has an answer set A i consisting of geo-spatial objects and theirprobabilities. The probability of an object o∈ A i specifies the likelihood that o satisfies Q i.The goal is to compute a route that is short and yet has a high probability of satisfying all theQ i. This paper investigates interactive route search. Upon arrival at each object; the userprovides feedback specifying whether the object satisfies its corresponding query. The goalis to compute the next object to be visited; based on the feedback. Several heuristicalgorithms are given and compared experimentally.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,15

Routing methods for multiple geographical entities,*,Routing method for computing routes over uncertain geo-spatial data whereby only uponvisiting the geographic entities it can be determined whether the needed service or productis actually provided and is adequate. When dealing with uncertain data; the returned routemay need to go via several entities of the same type. Another routing method consists offinding an efficient and effective route from a starting point to an ending point going trough apredetermined number of objects; wherein each object represents a geographical entity of aunique type; and each object is selected from a distinct set of similar objects.,*,2013,14
Integrating data from maps on the world-wide web,Eliyahu Safra; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv; Yerach Doytsher,Abstract A substantial amount of data about geographical entities is available on the World-Wide Web; in the form of digital maps. This paper investigates the integration of such data. Athree-step integration process is presented. First; geographical objects are retrieved fromMaps on the Web. Secondly; pairs of objects that represent the same real-world entity; indifferent maps; are discovered and the information about them is combined. Finally; selectedobjects are presented to the user. The proposed process is efficient; accurate (ie; thediscovery of corresponding objects has high recall and precision) and it can be applied toany pair of digital maps; without requiring the existence of specific attributes. For the step ofdiscovering corresponding objects; three new algorithms are presented. These algorithmsmodify existing methods that use only the locations of geographical objects; so that …,International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems,2006,14
Querying socio-spatial networks on the world-wide web,Yerach Doytsher; Ben Galon; Yaron Kanza,Abstract navigation systems; allow users to record their location history. The location historydata can be analyzed to generate life patterns| patterns that associate people to places theyfrequently visit. Accordingly; an SSN is a graph that consists of (1) a social network;(2) aspatial network; and (3) life patterns that connect the users of the social network to locations;ie; to geographical entities in the spatial network. In this paper we present a system thatstores SNN in a graph-based database management system and provides a novel querylanguage; namely SSNQL; for querying the integrated data. The system includes a Web-based graphical user interface that allows presenting the social network; presenting thespatial network and posing SSNQL queries over the integrated data. The user interface alsodepicts the structure of queries for the purpose of debugging and optimization. Our …,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,12
Geosocial search: Finding places based on geotagged social-media posts,Barak Pat; Yaron Kanza; Mor Naaman,Abstract Geographic search--where the user provides keywords and receives relevantlocations depicted on a map--is a popular web application. Typically; such search is basedon static geographic data. However; the abundant geotagged posts in microblogs such asTwitter and in social networks like Instagram; provide contemporary information that can beused to support geosocial search---geographic search based on user activities in socialmedia. Such search can point out where people talk (or tweet) about different topics. Forexample; the search results may show where people refer to``jogging''; to indicate popularjogging places. The difficulty in implementing such search is that there is no natural partitionof the space into``documents''as in ordinary web search. Thus; it is not always clear how topresent results and how to rank and filter results effectively. In this paper; we demonstrate …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,11
Stratified-sampling over social networks using mapreduce,Roy Levin; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Sampling is being used in statistical surveys to select a subset of individuals fromsome population; to estimate properties of the population. In stratified sampling; thesurveyed population is partitioned into homogeneous subgroups and individuals areselected within the subgroups; to reduce the sample size. In this paper we considersampling of large-scale; distributed online social networks; and we show how to deal withcases where several surveys are conducted in parallel---in some surveys it may be desiredto share individuals to reduce costs; while in other surveys; sharing should be minimized;eg; to prevent survey fatigue. A multi-survey stratified sampling is the task of choosing theindividuals for several surveys; in parallel; according to sharing constraints; without a bias. Inthis paper; we present a scalable distributed algorithm; designed for the MapReduce …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,11
Computing full disjunctions,Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Under either the OR-semantics or the weak semantics; the answer to a query oversemistructured data consists of maximal rather than complete matchings; ie; some queryvariables may be assigned null values. In the relational model; a similar effect is achieved bycomputing the full disjunction (rather than the natural join or equijoin) of the given relations.It is shown that under either the OR-semantics or the weak semantics; query evaluation hasa polynomial-time complexity in the size of the query; the database and the result. It is alsoshown that the evaluation of full disjunctions is reducible to query evaluation under the weaksemantics and hence can be done in polynomial time in the size of the input and the output.Complexity results are also given for two related problems. One is evaluating a projection ofthe full disjunction and the other is evaluating the set of all tuples in the full disjunction …,Proceedings of the twenty-second ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2003,11
SQL4X: A flexible query language for XML and relational databases,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract SQL4X; a powerful language for simultaneously querying both relational and XMLdatabases is presented. Using SQL4X; one can create both relations and XML documentsas query results. Thus; SQL4X can be thought of as an integration language. In order toallow easy integration of XML documents with varied structures; SQL4X uses flexiblesemantics when querying XML. SQL4X is also a powerful query language. It can expressquantification; negation; aggregation; grouping and path expressions. Datalog 4 x and Tree-Datalog 4 x; extensions of Datalog; are defined as elegant abstract models for SQL4Xqueries.

Compact representation of GPS trajectories over vectorial road networks,Ranit Gotsman; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Many devices nowadays record traveling routes; of users; as sequences of GPSlocations. With the growing popularity of smartphones; millions of such routes are generatedeach day; and many routes have to be stored locally on the device or transmitted to a remotedatabase. It is; thus; essential to encode the sequences; to decrease the volume of thestored or transmitted data. In this paper we study the problem of coding routes over avectorial road network (map); where GPS locations can be associated with vertices or withroad segments. We consider a three-step process of dilution; map-matching and coding. Wepresent two methods to code routes. The first method represents the given route as asequence of greedy paths. We provide two algorithms to generate a greedy-path code for asequence of n vertices on the map. The first algorithm has O (n) time complexity; and the …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,9
City nexus: Discovering pairs of jointly-visited locations based on geo-tagged posts in social networks,Yaron Kanza; Elad Kravi; Uri Motchan,Abstract Recently; there is a rapid growth in the use of microblogs; such as Twitter; and ofsocial networks; such as Instagram; to publish geo-tagged posts that indicate the location ofthe user at the time when the message is sent. This provides abundant geospatial data thatcan be analyzed to understand the behavior of masses of people; in particular in urban.Such analysis can improve and facilitate the work of urban planners and of policy makers;eg; when deciding where to add transportation routes or public institutes. In thisdemonstration; we present a system that utilizes geo-tagged posts to discover places thatwere jointly visited by many people. We present the management and the analysis of thedata; to illustrate the feasibility of the approach and to indicate new research questions inthis domain.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,8
A Dilution-matching-encoding compaction of trajectories over road networks,Ranit Gotsman; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Many devices nowadays record traveled routes as sequences of GPS locations.With the growing popularity of smartphones; millions of such routes are generated each day;and many routes have to be stored locally on the device or transmitted to a remote database.It is; thus; essential to encode the sequences; in order to decrease the volume of the storedor transmitted data. In this paper we study the problem of encoding routes over a vectorialroad network (map); where GPS locations can be associated with vertices or with roadsegments.

Concurrent and robust topological map matching,Roy Levin; Elad Kravi; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Offline map matching is a process of associating a sequence of GPS locationreadings measured with a device held by a traveling user; to the real-world roads that werepresumably traveled by the user. The main goals in map matching are (1) to provide anassociation which is as accurate as possible with respect to actual traveled roads; and (2) tocompute the matching as efficiently as possible. We describe our implementation of a mapmatching algorithm that enables parallel computation of the matching; being developed aspart of the ACM SIGSPATIAL CUP 2012 contest; and we present the results of anexperimental evaluation over the data of the contest. We show that our algorithm is efficientand robust in the sense that it maintains a high level of accuracy even when the samplingrate is low.,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,7
Wiser: a web-based interactive route search system for smartphones,Roi Friedman; Itsik Hefez; Yaron Kanza; Roy Levin; Eliyahu Safra; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Many smartphones; nowadays; use GPS to detect the location of the user; and canuse the Internet to interact with remote location-based services. These two capabilitiessupport online navigation that incorporates search. In this demo we presents WISER---asystem for Web-based Interactive Search en Route. In the system; users perform routesearch by providing (1) a target location; and (2) search terms that specify types ofgeographic entities to be visited. The task is to find a route that minimizes the travel distancefrom the initial location of the user to the target; via entities of the specified types. However;planning a route under conditions of uncertainty requires the system to take into account thepossibility that some visited entities will not satisfy the search requirements; so that the routemay need to go via several entities of the same type. In an interactive search; the user …,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,7
Ruby on semantic web,Vadim Eisenberg; Yaron Kanza,The impedance mismatch problem that occurs when relational data is being processed byobject-oriented (OO) programs; also occurs when OO programs process RDF data; on theSemantic Web. The impedance mismatch problem stems from the inherent differencesbetween RDF and the data model of OO languages. In this paper; we illustrate a solution tothis problem. Essentially; we modify an OO language so that RDF individuals become first-class citizens in the language; and objects of the language become first-class citizens inRDF. Three important benefits that follow from this modification are:(1) it becomes natural touse the language as a persistent programming language;(2) the language supports implicitintegration of data from multiple data sources; and (3) SPARQL queries and inference canbe applied to objects during the run of a program. This demo presents such a modified …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,7
Authorization-transparent access control for XML under the non-Truman model,Yaron Kanza; Alberto O Mendelzon; Renée J Miller; Zheng Zhang,Abstract In authorization-transparent access control; user queries are formulated against thedatabase schema rather than against authorization views that transform and hide data. TheTruman and the Non-Truman are two approaches to authorization transparency where in aTruman model; queries that violate the access restrictions are modified transparently by thesystem to only reveal accessible data; while in a Non-Truman model; such queries arerejected. The advantage of a Non-Truman model is that the semantics of user queries is notchanged by the access-control mechanism. This work presents an access-controlmechanism for XML; under the Non-Truman model. Security policies are specified asparameterized rules formulated using XPath. The rules specify relationships betweenelements; that should be concealed from users. Hence; not only elements; but also edges …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,7
Towards Model-Free SLAM Using a Single Laser Range Scanner for Helicopter MAV,Chen Friedman; Inderjit Chopra; Svetlana Potyagaylo; Omri Rand; Yaron Kanza,Operation in GPS denied environments is imperative for a variety of mission scenariosincluding surveillance; search and rescue; and biological chemical agent detection usingunmanned vehicles. These mission scenarios require accurate position information andmapping capability of the operational area. For an unmanned Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV);assuming position information is given (GPS; beacons etc.); on board sensory data (eg laserscanner) can be combined to build a map (since the position information input isindependent of sensor's readings). On the other hand; if the map is known a priori; the MAVcan position itself inside the known map using sensory data and appropriate tools (such asscan matching). These techniques are quite robust as the map is known and serves as adeterministic anchor in the estimation process. However; when both the map and position …,AIAA Guidance; Navigation; and Control Conference (GNC 2011),2011,6
Searcher in a strange land: Understanding web search from familiar and unfamiliar locations,Elad Kravi; Eugene Agichtein; Ido Guy; Yaron Kanza; Avihai Mejer; Dan Pelleg,Abstract With mobile devices; web search is no longer limited to specific locations. Peopleconduct search from practically anywhere; including at home; at work; when traveling andwhen on vacation. How should this influence search tools and web services? In this paper;we argue that information needs are affected by the familiarity of the environment. Toformalize this idea; we propose a new contextualization model for activities on the web. Themodel distinguishes between a search from a familiar place (F-search) and a search from anunfamiliar place (U-search). We formalize the notion of familiarity; and propose a method toidentify familiar places. An analysis of a query log of millions of users; demonstrates thedifferences between search activities in familiar and in unfamiliar locations.

Incomplete Answers for Queries over Semistructured Data.,Yaron Kanza; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Semistructured data are inherently incomplete and their structure does not complywith a strict schema. A query language has to take this into account and allow answers to beincomplete. This paper presents a model of queries over semistructured data that allows forincomplete answers; ie; answers in which not all the variables of the query are bound. Wede ne a simple data model that is similar to OEM PGMW95]. For this data model we presentthe concept of a query language based on constraints. The paper describes the di erentconstraints that are used in the query and the di erent phases needed for evaluating them.We propose the concept of maximal answers that are obtained by matching a maximalportion of the database graph with the query constraints. Maximal matchings and constraintsthat can be evaluated over partial data give us the ability to retrieve partial answers when …,KRDB,1999,5
An online marketplace for geosocial data,Yaron Kanza; Hanan Samet,Abstract When recording their GPS trajectories or posting geo-tagged content on socialnetworks; people produce social spatio-temporal data that can be stored and shared;namely geosocial data. Much of these spatio-temporal data can be used by organizationsand applications; for statistical analysis or to provide services that are based on data. Byletting people sell the data they produce; to different consumers; both sides can benefit.Thus; we present here a visionary idea of a geosocial marketplace where people andorganizations can sell; buy and exchange geosocial data; that is; trade with spatio-temporaldata pertaining people. We discuss the involved challenges; such as how to define supplyand demand; pricing data; privacy issues and measuring the amount of data beingexchanged. We explain the importance of the approach and its applicability. We believe …,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,4
Managing Socio-spatial Data as Large Graphs,Yerach Doytsher; Ben Galon; Yaron Kanza,ABSTRACT A socio-spatial graph is a combination of a social network with a spatialnetwork. In such graph; the social network contains information on users and about thesocial relationships among these users. The spatial network contains information ongeographic entities and about the spatial relationships among these entities. Users areassociated with geographic locations using life-pattern edges. The life pattern edgessynopsize the location history of people; and accordingly; connect individuals to places theyfrequently visit. Such graphs are used to provide information on people; while taking intoaccount the spatial whereabout of individuals; and to provide information on geographicalentities; in correspondence with their social aspects; ie; according to the people visited inthese entities. Thus; socio-spatial graphs are important analytic tools; however; when they …,International Workshop on Large Scale Network Analysis (LSNA 2012),2012,4
Searching in an XML corpus using content and structure,Yiftah Ben-Aharon; Sara Cohen; Yael Grumbach; Yaron Kanza; Jonathan Mamou; Yehoshua Sagiv; Benjamin Sznajder; Efrat Twito,ABSTRACT This paper presents a system for XML retrieval. The approach consists of avariety of Information Retrieval techniques augmented with the ability to give weights todifferent fragments of a document; based on the tags. Specifically; term frequencies; inversedocument frequencies; proximity among occurrences ofkeywords; and similarity betweenkeywords and words from the given document; are used. Each technique has beenimplemented as a separate ranker and the final ranking is done by merging the results of thevarious rankers. 1. INTRODUCTION An XML document has a structure in addition to content;and an XML search engine should be capable of taking advantage of the structure in orderto improve the quality (ie; precision and recall) of the results.

Location-based distance measures for geosocial similarity,Yaron Kanza; Elad Kravi; Eliyahu Safra; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract This article investigates the problem of geosocial similarity among users of onlinesocial networks; based on the locations of their activities (eg; posting messages orphotographs). Finding pairs of geosocially similar users or detecting that two sets oflocations (of activities) belong to the same user has important applications in privacyprotection; recommendation systems; urban planning; and public health; among others. It isexplained and shown empirically that common distance measures between sets of locationsare inadequate for determining geosocial similarity. Two novel distance measures betweensets of locations are introduced. One is the mutually nearest distance that is based oncomputing a matching between two sets. The second measure uses a quad-tree index. It ishighly scalable but incurs the overhead of creating and maintaining the index. Algorithms …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2017,3
A personalized GeoSocial app for surviving an earthquake,Shlomo Bekhor; Sara Cohen; Yerach Doytsher; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Earthquakes are sudden; cause huge damage to extensive areas; and maynegatively affect the lives of millions of people. Thus; it is crucial to develop a system thatcan help people survive an earthquake and recover from its aftereffects. In this paper wepresent a vision of a smartphone app; called EAGA (earthquake alerter and guidance app);that will guide both victims and rescue workers; by leveraging probabilistic geosocialinformation collected before the event; during the earthquake and in its aftermath. The apphas four modes of operation. In standby mode; EAGA collects data about users; theirregularly visited locations and their social relations. In alert mode; EAGA warns of animpending earthquake; based on data collected from a variety of sensors and fromgovernment warning systems. It also provides initial guidance to the user during the onset …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on the Use of GIS in Emergency Management,2015,3
Interactive traffic-aware route search on smartphones,Roy Levin; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Route search is an application for planning an efficient route via points of interestspecified by search terms. Essentially; the search requires to find the fastest route; from thelocation of the user to a specified destination; through geographical entities whose type isindicated by the search terms; eg; a route via a" Coffee Shop" and a" Pharmacy". To thatend; it is essential to take into account traffic conditions and temporal constraints; such asopening and closing hours of institutes and businesses. We assume that the search isapplied under conditions of uncertainty where a user may discover that she is unsatisfiedwith the visited entity only upon arrival at the point of interest. Thus; it may be required to visitseveral entities of the same type till discovering one that satisfies the user. In an interactivesearch; the user provides feedback after visiting an entity; to indicate when there is no …,Proceedings of the First ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Mobile Geographic Information Systems,2012,3
Self Managing Top-k (Summary; Keyword) Indexes in XML Retrieval,Mariano P Consens; Xin Gu; Yaron Kanza; Flavio Rizzolo,Retrieval queries that combine structural constraints with keyword search represent asignificant challenge to XML data management systems. Queries are expected to beanswered as efficiently and effectively as in traditional keyword search; while satisfyingadditional constraints. Several XML-retrieval systems support answering queriesexhaustively by storing both structural indexes and a keyword index. Other systems answertop-k queries efficiently by constructing indexes in which keyword scores; for some structuralelements; are stored in relevance order; enabling approaches such as the thresholdalgorithm (TA). In this paper we describe TReX an XML retrieval system that can exploitmultiple structural summaries (including newly defined ones). TReX can also self-managesmall; redundant; indexes to speed up the evaluation of workloads of top-k queries. The …,Data Engineering Workshop; 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,3
Uncertainty in geosocial data: friend or foe?,Yaron Kanza,Abstract In data management; uncertainty and lack of information are commonly consideredas hurdles to overcome. But when it comes to management of geosocial data; where datacan be used to associate people with geographic locations they visited; uncertainty isfrequently not just an obstacle but also a desired feature. Uncertainty and lack of information---such as knowing only approximate locations of users or knowing only some of thelocations users visited---may reduce the accuracy of data analysis. They; however; may bedesired; or even required; for keeping user privacy; and for using data that otherwise wouldnot have been collected and used. Due to the heterogeneity of geosocial data; uncertainty isprevalent in geosocial applications; and should not be overlooked. In this paper; we discusssome of the causes of uncertainty in geosocial data management. We elaborate on some …,SIGSPATIAL Special,2016,2
HealthGIS 2012 workshop report: the First ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on the Use of GIS in Public Health,Daniel W Goldberg; Peter Bak; James L Horey; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Public health and public healthcare are important social issues with deepimplications for government administrations and with large effect on individual standards ofliving. In many countries; healthcare institutions are being pushed to their limit by an agingpopulation and increased urbanization (which may lead to additional health issues such aspollution). Many of these challenges have strong geospatial components. For example; GIStechniques may be used to determine spatial correlates of health. In addition; the ability todetect and record the location history of individuals and groups using cellular phonescoupled with the ability to analyze and visually present large amounts of geospatial data canbe harnessed to advance health-related applications.

Computing the top-k maximal answers in a join of ranked lists,Mirit Shalem; Yaron Kanza,Abstract Complex search tasks that utilize information from several data sources; areanswered by integrating the results of distinct basic search queries. In such integration; eachbasic query returns a ranked list of items; and the main task is to compute the join of theselists; returning the top-k combinations. Computing the top-k join of ranked lists has beenstudied extensively for the case where the answer comprises merely completecombinations. However; a join is a lossy operation; and over heterogeneous data sourcessome highly-ranked items; from the results of the basic queries; may not appear in anycombination. Yet; such items and the partial combinations in which they appear may still berelevant answers and should not be discarded categorically. In this paper we consider a joinwhere combinations are padded by nulls for missing items. A combination is maximal if it …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,2
Authorization-Based Access Control for XML,Yaron Kanza; Alberto O Mendelzon; Renée J Miller; Zheng Zhang,Abstract. Fine-grained access control for XML supports the specification and enforcement ofsecurity policies on elements rather than at the level of the entire document. Parameterizedaccess control allows modifying the security according to the user and the environment.Traditionally; views are used in database system to support fine-grained and parameterizedaccess control. But over XML; views are complicated; lack an efficient maintenancemechanism and suffer from the absence of a comprehensive query-rewriting set of rules.This work presents an authorization mechanism in which a security policy for XML isspecified as parameterized rules formulated using XPath. The rules specify relationships;between elements; that should be concealed from users. The access control mechanismauthorizes only valid queries; ie; queries that do not disclose information on concealed …,*,2005,2
Select-project queries over XML documents,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract This paper discusses evaluation of select-project (SP) queries over an XMLdocument. A SP query consists of two parts:(1) a conjunction of conditions on values oflabels (called the selection) and (2) a series of labels whose values should be outputed(called the projection). Query evaluation involves finding tuples of nodes that have the labelsmentioned in the query and are related to one another other in a meaningful fashion.Several different semantics for query evaluation are given in this paper. Some of thesesemantics also take into account the possible presence of incomplete information. Thecomplexity of query evaluation is analyzed and evaluation algorithms are described.,International Workshop on Next Generation Information Technologies and Systems,2002,2

Location corroborations by mobile devices without traces,Yaron Kanza,Abstract A location corroboration of a person is a proof; in the form of a digital record;indicating that this person was at a particular place at a given time. That is; given a user u; alocation l and a time t; a location corroboration is a certified evidence that u was at location lat time t. Such corroborations can be used in legal procedures; help solving personaldisputes or enable services that rely on knowing with certainty the location of a user at agiven time. A corroboration without traces means that the user location is not stored in anypublic server or in any other public entity; to protect the user privacy. In this paper we presentthe problem of producing a location corroboration without traces; using a mobile device; andwe discuss possible solutions to it.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,1
External sorng on flash storage: reducing cell wearing and increasing efficiency by avoiding intermediate writes,Yaron Kanza; Hadas Yaari,Abstract This paper studies the problem of how to conduct external sorting on flash driveswhile avoiding intermediate writes to the disk. The focus is on sort in portable electronicdevices; where relations are only larger than the main memory by a small factor; and on sortas part of distributed processes where relations are frequently partially sorted. In such cases;sort algorithms that refrain from writing intermediate results to the disk have threeadvantages over algorithms that perform intermediate writes. First; on devices in which readoperations are much faster than writes; such methods are efficient and frequently outperformMerge Sort. Secondly; they reduce flash cell degradation caused by writes. Thirdly; they canbe used in cases where there is not enough disk space for the intermediate results. Novelsort algorithms that avoid intermediate writes to the disk are presented.

On optimality-ratio and coverage in ranking of joined search results,Mirit Shalem; Yaron Kanza,Abstract In complex search tasks; it is often required to pose several basic search queries;join the answers to these queries; where each answer is given as a ranked list of items; andreturn a ranked list of combinations. However; the join result may include too manyrepetitions of items; and hence; frequently the entire join is too large to be useful. This canbe solved by choosing a small subset of the join result. The focus of this paper is on how tochoose this subset. We propose two measures for estimating the quality of result sets;namely; coverage and optimality ratio. Intuitively; maximizing the coverage aims at includingin the result as many as possible appearances of items in their optimal combination; andmaximizing the optimality ratio means striving to have each item appearing only in itsoptimal combination; ie; only in the most highly ranked combination that contains it.

Methods for determining the locationof the helicopter; during the flight; are presented. The methodology is based on a lightweightlaser range finder as a sole onboard sensor. The sensor reading interpretation arecombined with various path planning algorithms according to the vehicle-environment sizeratio. Two different environments are studied: a tight environment where travel distances andobstacle dimensions are in the order of the rotor diameter; and an open environment whereobstacles are much larger than the rotor diameters. For each environment; two cases areconsidered: a case where the map of the environment is entirely known a priory; and a casewhere obstacles are discovered during the flight.,Proceedings of the American Helicopter Society 66Th Annual Forum; Phoenix; AZ; USA,2010,1
Oblivious queries over data with irregular structure,Yaron Kanza,Abstract In traditional q uery languages; formulating q ueries re q uires an exact knowledgeof the schema.

Mind the Gaps (and Bumps): Statistical Smoothing of Spatiotemporal Streams,Philip E Brown; Tamraparni Dasu; Yaron Kanza; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Spatiotemporal streams are prone to data quality issues such as missing;duplicated and delayed data when data generating sensors malfunction; data transmissionsexperience problems; or when data is stored or processed improperly. However; manyimportant real-time applications rely on the continuous availability of stream values; eg; tomonitor traffic flow; resource usage; weather phenomena; etc. Other non real-timeapplications that support continuous or offline historical analytics also require high qualitydata to avoid producing misleading output such as false positives; erroneous conclusionsand decisions. In this paper; we propose the use of nonparametric (data-driven; distributionfree) statistical methods to provide an uninterrupted stream of high-quality spatiotemporaldata to real-time applications even when the raw stream suffers data quality issues.

Geotagging IP Packets for Location-Aware Software-Defined Networking in the Presence of Virtual Network Functions,Tamraparni Dasu; Yaron Kanza; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract A substantial portion of global telecommunication is based on the Internet Protocol(IP); where IP packets are routed from a source host to a destination host via acommunication network. While there is some loose connection between IP addresses andgeospatial locations; associating packets to geographic coordinates merely according to IPaddresses is hard; and often infeasible in real-time; given the rapidity and prodigiousvolume of packet traffic via routers and switches. This obstructs using geospatial informationabout the origin; destination; or route of IP packets or flows.

To deploy;maintain; and troubleshoot such networks; it is essential to understand how networkelements such as servers; switches; virtual machines; and virtual network functions areconnected to one another; and to be able to discover communication paths between them.For network maintenance applications such as troubleshooting and service qualitymanagement it is also essential to understand how connections change over time; and beable to pose time-travel queries to retrieve information about past network states. With theindustry-wide move to SDNs and virtualized network functions [13]; maintaining theseinventory databases becomes a critical issue. We represent a communication networkinventory as a graph where the nodes are network entities and edges represent …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,*
Emotion Maps based on Geotagged Posts in the Social Media,Yerach Doytsher; Ben Galon; Yaron Kanza,ABSTRACT Emotions influence people's behavior in a profound way. Feelings likehappiness; hope; fear; boredom; anger; anxiety or relaxation affect the way people behaveand interact with one another. However; there is often a strong correlation between theenvironment and the way people feel; eg; the emotions associated with a hospital aretypically very different from those associated with an amusement park or a promenade. Theaim of an emotion map is to represent and depict interrelationships between emotions andgeographic locations. Such maps can provide answers to various questions about howpeople feel at various places or at different times of the day. They can facilitate a search forplaces where people express a certain emotion. In this paper; we introduce a new approachof creating emotion maps from a large collection of geotagged socialmedia posts. We …,*,2017,*
Distance Measures for Detecting Geo-Social Similarity,Yaron Kanza; Elad Kravi; Eliyahu Safra; Yehoshua Sagiv,This paper investigates the problem of geo-social similarity among users of online socialnetworks; based on the locations of their activities (eg; posting messages or photographs).Finding pairs of geo-socially similar users or detecting that two sets of locations (of activities)belong to the same user has important applications in privacy protection; recommendationsystems; urban planning; public health; etc. It is explained and shown empirically thatcommon distance measures between sets of locations are inadequate for determining geo-social similarity. Two novel distance measures between sets of locations are introduced.One is the mutually nearest distance that is based on computing a matching between twosets. The second measure uses a quad-tree index. It is highly scalable; but incurs theoverhead of creating and maintaining the index. Algorithms with optimization techniques …,*,2017,*
Combined geo-social search: computing top-k join queries over incomplete information,Yaron Kanza; Mirit Shalem,Abstract Geo-social data sets; which fuse the social and the geospatial facets of data; arevibrant data sources that associate people and activities with locations. In a combined geo-social search; several search queries are posed over geospatial and social data sources; orover data sources with both geospatial and social facets; and the search results; provided asranked lists of items; are integrated by associating matching items; yielding combinations.Each combination has a score which is a function of the scores of the items it comprises; andthe goal is to compute the k combinations with the highest score; that is; the top-kcombinations. However; since geo-social data sources are heterogeneous; data items maynot have matching items in all the ranked lists. Such items cannot be included in completecombinations. Hence; we study the approach where combinations are padded by nulls for …,GeoInformatica,2017,*
Nepal: a path query language for communication networks,Theodore Johnson; Yaron Kanza; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Vladislav Shkapenyuk,Abstract Communication networks are typically large; dynamic and extremely complicated.To deploy; maintain; and trouble-shoot such networks; it is essential to understand hownetwork elements---such as servers; switches; virtual machines; and virtual networkfunctions---are connected to one another; and be able to discover communication pathsbetween them. It is also essential to understand how connections change over time; and beable to pose time-travel queries to retrieve information about past network states. Thisproblem is becoming more acute with the advent of software defined networks; wherenetwork functions are virtualized and managed in a cloud infrastructure. We represent acommunication network inventory as a graph where the nodes are network entities andedges represent relationships between them; eg hosted-on; communicates-with; etc …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Network Data Analytics,2016,*

TARSIUS: A System for Traffic-Aware Route Search under Conditions of Uncertainty (Demo Paper),Itsik Hefez; Yaron Kanza; Roy Levin,ABSTRACT This demo presents TARSIUS—a system for traffic-aware route search. In atraffic-aware route search (TARS); the user provides start location; target location and searchterms; which specify types of geographical entities that should be visited along the route. ATARS query may include additional temporal constraints and limitations on the order bywhich entities are visited. The goal is to find the fastest route from the start location to thetarget; via entities of the specified types; while taking into account variations in the travelspeed; due to changes in traffic conditions. Planning a route under conditions of uncertaintyrequires the system to also take into account the possibility that some visited entities will notsatisfy the user requirements so that the route may need to go via several entities of thesame type. In the demonstration we present the system. We demonstrate a web-based …,*,2011,*

A Persistent Programming Language for the Semantic Web,Vadim Eisenberg; Yaron Kanza,ABSTRACT The impedance mismatch problem that occurs when relational data is beingused by object-oriented (OO) programs; also occurs when OO programs process RDF data;on the Semantic Web. The impedance mismatch problem is caused by the differencesbetween RDF and the data model of OO languages. In this paper; we present a solution tothis problem. Essentially; we modify the OO languages so that RDF resources will becomefirst-class citizens in the OO languages; and objects of OO languages will become first-classcitizens in RDF. Three important benefits that follow from this modification are:(1) it becomesnatural to use the language as a persistence programming language;(2) the languagesupports implicit integration of data from multiple data sources; and (3) SPARQL queries andinference can be applied to objects during the run of a program. We present principles of …,*,*,*

Semantics and Algorithms for Queries with Incomplete Answers over Semistructured Data,Yaron Kanza; Werner Nutty; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Semistructured data occur in situations where information lacks a homogeneousstructure and is incomplete. Yet; up to now the incompleteness of information has not beenre ected by special features of query languages. Our goal is to investigate the principles ofqueries that allow for incomplete answers. We do not present; however; a concrete querylanguage. Queries over classical structured data models contain a number of variables andconstraints on these variables. An answer is a binding of the variables by elements of thedatabase such that the constraints are satis ed. In the present paper; we loosen this conceptin so far as we allow also answers that are partial; that is; not all variables in the query arebound by such an answer. Partial answers make it necessary to re ne the model of queryevaluation. The rst modi cation relates to the satisfaction of constraints: under some …,*,*,*
