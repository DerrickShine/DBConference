Monitoring k-nearest neighbor queries over moving objects,Xiaohui Yu; Ken Q Pu; Nick Koudas,Many location-based applications require constant monitoring of k-nearest neighbor (k-NN)queries over moving objects within a geographic area. Existing approaches to this problemhave focused on predictive queries; and relied on the assumption that the trajectories of theobjects are fully predictable at query processing time. We relax this assumption; andpropose two efficient and scalable algorithms using grid indices. One is based on indexingobjects; and the other on queries. For each approach; a cost model is developed; and adetailed analysis along with the respective applicability is presented. The object-indexingapproach is further extended to multi-levels to handle skewed data. We show byexperiments that our grid-based algorithms significantly outperform R-tree-based solutions.Extensive experiments are also carried out to study the properties and evaluate the …,Data Engineering; 2005.

ARSA: a sentiment-aware model for predicting sales performance using blogs,Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Due to its high popularity; Weblogs (or blogs in short) present a wealth ofinformation that can be very helpful in assessing the general public's sentiments andopinions. In this paper; we study the problem of mining sentiment information from blogs andinvestigate ways to use such information for predicting product sales performance. Based onan analysis of the complex nature of sentiments; we propose Sentiment PLSA (S-PLSA); inwhich a blog entry is viewed as a document generated by a number of hidden sentimentfactors. Training an S-PLSA model on the blog data enables us to obtain a succinctsummary of the sentiment information embedded in the blogs. We then present ARSA; anautoregressive sentiment-aware model; to utilize the sentiment information captured by S-PLSA for predicting product sales performance.

Modeling and predicting the helpfulness of online reviews,Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,Online reviews provide a valuable resource for potential customers to make purchasedecisions. However; the sheer volume of available reviews as well as the large variations inthe review quality present a big impediment to the effective use of the reviews; as the mosthelpful reviews may be buried in the large amount of low quality reviews. The goal of thispaper is to develop models and algorithms for predicting the helpfulness of reviews; whichprovides the basis for discovering the most helpful reviews for given products. We first showthat the helpfulness of a review depends on three important factors: the reviewer's expertise;the writing style of the review; and the timeliness of the review. Based on the analysis ofthose factors; we present a nonlinear regression model for helpfulness prediction. Ourempirical study on the IMDB movie reviews dataset demonstrates that the proposed …,Data mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE international conference on,2008,209
Mining online reviews for predicting sales performance: A case study in the movie domain,Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Posting reviews online has become an increasingly popular way for people to expressopinions and sentiments toward the products bought or services received. Analyzing thelarge volume of online reviews available would produce useful actionable knowledge thatcould be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. In this paper; weconduct a case study in the movie domain; and tackle the problem of mining reviews forpredicting product sales performance. Our analysis shows that both the sentimentsexpressed in the reviews and the quality of the reviews have a significant impact on thefuture sales performance of products in question.

Automatic detection of rumor on Sina Weibo,Fan Yang; Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu; Min Yang,Abstract The problem of gauging information credibility on social networks has receivedconsiderable attention in recent years. Most previous work has chosen Twitter; the world'slargest micro-blogging platform; as the premise of research. In this work; we shift the premiseand study the problem of information credibility on Sina Weibo; China's leading micro-blogging service provider. With eight times more users than Twitter; Sina Weibo is more of aFacebook-Twitter hybrid than a pure Twitter clone; and exhibits several importantcharacteristics that distinguish it from Twitter. We collect an extensive set of microblogswhich have been confirmed to be false rumors based on information from the official rumor-busting service provided by Sina Weibo. Unlike previous studies on Twitter where thelabeling of rumors is done manually by the participants of the experiments; the official …,MDS '12 Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Mining Data Semantics,2012,120
Combining integrated sampling with SVM ensembles for learning from imbalanced datasets,Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu; Jimmy Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Abstract Learning from imbalanced datasets is difficult. The insufficient information that isassociated with the minority class impedes making a clear understanding of the inherentstructure of the dataset. Most existing classification methods tend not to perform well onminority class examples when the dataset is extremely imbalanced; because they aim tooptimize the overall accuracy without considering the relative distribution of each class. Inthis paper; we study the performance of SVMs; which have gained great success in manyreal applications; in the imbalanced data context. Through empirical analysis; we show thatSVMs may suffer from biased decision boundaries; and that their prediction performancedrops dramatically when the data is highly skewed. We propose to combine an integratedsampling technique; which incorporates both over-sampling and under-sampling; with an …,Information processing & management,2011,89
Keyword query cleaning,Ken Q Pu; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Unlike traditional database queries; keyword queries do not adhere to predefinedsyntax and are often dirty with irrelevant words from natural languages. This makes accurateand efficient keyword query processing over databases a very challenging task. In thispaper; we introduce the problem of query cleaning for keyword search queries in a databasecontext and propose a set of effective and efficient solutions. Query cleaning involvessemantic linkage and spelling corrections of database relevant query words; followed bysegmentation of nearby query words such that each segment corresponds to a high qualitydata term. We define a quality metric of a keyword query; and propose a number ofalgorithms for cleaning keyword queries optimally. It is demonstrated that the basic optimalquery cleaning problem can be solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. We …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,61
Hashed samples: selectivity estimators for set similarity selection queries,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Xiaohui Yu; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract We study selectivity estimation techniques for set similarity queries. A wide varietyof similarity measures for sets have been proposed in the past. In this work we concentrateon the class of weighted similarity measures (eg; TF/IDF and BM25 cosine similarity andvariants) and design selectivity estimators based on a priori constructed samples. First; westudy the pitfalls associated with straightforward applications of random sampling; and arguethat care needs to be taken in how the samples are constructed; uniform random samplingyields very low accuracy; while query sensitive realtime sampling is more expensive thanexact solutions (both in CPU and I/O cost). We show how to build robust samples a priori;based on existing synopses for distinct value estimation. We prove the accuracy of ourtechnique theoretically; and verify its performance experimentally.

Query segmentation using conditional random fields,Xiaohui Yu; Huxia Shi,Abstract A growing mount of available text data are being stored in relational databases;giving rise to an increasing need for the RDBMSs to support effective text retrieval. In thispaper; we address the problem of keyword query segmentation; ie; how to group nearbykeywords in a query into segments. This operation can greatly benefit both the quality andthe efficiency of the subsequent search operations. Compared with previous work; theproposed approach is based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF); and provides aprincipled statistical model that can be learned from query logs and easily adapt to userpreferences. Extensive experiments on two real datasets confirm the effectiveness theefficiency of the proposed approach.,Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Keyword Search on Structured Data,2009,39

Collaborative filtering with aspect-based opinion mining: A tensor factorization approach,Yuanhong Wang; Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu,Collaborative filtering (CF) aims to produce user specific recommendations based on otherusers' ratings of items. Most existing CF methods rely only on users' overall ratings of items;ignoring the variety of opinions users may have towards different aspects of the items. Usingthe movie domain as a case study; we propose a framework that is able to capture users'opinions on different aspects from the textual reviews; and use that information to improvethe effectiveness of CF. This framework has two components; an opinion mining componentand a rating inference component. The former extracts and summarizes the opinions onmultiple aspects from the reviews; generating ratings on the various aspects. The lattercomponent; on the other hand; infers the overall ratings of items based on the aspect ratings;which forms the basis for item recommendation. Our core contribution is in the proposal of …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,24
Riding the tide of sentiment change: sentiment analysis with evolving online reviews,Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu; Aijun An; Xiangji Huang,Abstract The last decade has seen a rapid growth in the volume of online reviews. A greatdeal of research has been done in the area of opinion mining; aiming at analyzing thesentiments expressed in those reviews towards products and services. Most of the suchwork focuses on mining opinions from a collection of reviews posted during a particularperiod; and does not consider the change in sentiments when the collection of reviewsevolve over time. In this paper; we fill in this gap; and study the problem of developingadaptive sentiment analysis models for online reviews. Given the success of latent semanticmodeling techniques; we propose two adaptive methods to capture the evolving sentiments.As a case study; we also investigate the possibility of using the extracted adaptive patternsfor sales prediction. Our proposal is evaluated on an IMDB dataset consisting of reviews …,World Wide Web,2013,23
A quality-aware model for sales prediction using reviews,Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Abstract Writing and publishing reviews online has become an increasingly popular way forpeople to express opinions and sentiments. Analyzing the large volume of online reviewsavailable can produce useful knowledge that are of interest to vendors and other parties.Prior studies in the literature have shown that online reviews have a significant correlationwith the sales of products; and therefore mining the reviews could help predict the salesperformance of relevant products. However; those studies fail to consider one importantfactor that may significantly affect the accuracy of the prediction; ie; the quality of the reviews.In this paper; we propose a regression model that explicitly takes into account the qualityfactor; and discusses how this quality information can be predicted when it is not readilyavailable. Experimental results on a movie review dataset confirm the effectiveness of the …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,22
Nlpmm: A next location predictor with markov modeling,Meng Chen; Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract In this paper; we solve the problem of predicting the next locations of the movingobjects with a historical dataset of trajectories. We present a Next Location Predictor withMarkov Modeling (NLPMM) which has the following advantages:(1) it considers bothindividual and collective movement patterns in making prediction;(2) it is effective evenwhen the trajectory data is sparse;(3) it considers the time factor and builds models that aresuited to different time periods. We have conducted extensive experiments in a real dataset;and the results demonstrate the superiority of NLPMM over existing methods.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2014,20
Scalable distributed processing of K nearest neighbor queries over moving objects,Ziqiang Yu; Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu; Ken Q Pu,Central to many applications involving moving objects is the task of processing k-nearestneighbor (k-NN) queries. Most of the existing approaches to this problem are designed forthe centralized setting where query processing takes place on a single server; it is difficult; ifnot impossible; for them to scale to a distributed setting to handle the vast volume of dataand concurrent queries that are increasingly common in those applications. To address thisproblem; we propose a suite of solutions that can support scalable distributed processing ofk-NN queries. We first present a new index structure called Dynamic Strip Index (DSI); whichcan better adapt to different data distributions than exiting grid indexes. Moreover; it can benaturally distributed across the cluster; therefore lending itself well to distributed processing.We further propose a distributed k-NN search (DKNN) algorithm based on DSI.

HelpMeter: a nonlinear model for predicting the helpfulness of online reviews,Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,With the flourish of the Internet; online review mining has attracted a lot of attention from theresearch community. However; compared to various well-studied sentiment analysis andopinion summarization problems; less effort has been made to analyze the quality of onlinereviews. The objective of this paper is to fill in this gap by automatically evaluating the"helpfulness" of reviews and consequently developing novel models to identify the mosthelpful reviews for a particular product. In particular; based on a thorough analysis of variousfactors that may affect the review quality; we propose HelpMeter; a nonlinear regressionmodel for helpfulness prediction. Some preliminary experiments were conducted on a moviereview data set; and the performance results confirm the superiority of the proposed method.,Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology; 2008.

Mining moving patterns for predicting next location,Meng Chen; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu,Abstract Next location prediction has been an essential task for many location basedapplications such as targeted advertising. In this paper; we present three basic models totackle the problem of predicting next locations: the Global Markov Model that uses allavailable trajectories to discover global behaviors; the Personal Markov Model that focuseson mining the individual patterns of each moving object; and the Regional Markov Modelthat clusters the trajectories to mine the similar movement patterns. The three models areintegrated with linear regression in different ways. We then seek to further improve theaccuracy of prediction by considering the time factor; with a focus on clustering thetrajectories in different time periods; and present three methods to train the time-awaremodels to mine periodic patterns. Therefore; our proposed models have the following …,Information Systems,2015,14
Sentence-level sentiment analysis in the presence of modalities,Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu; Bing Liu; Zhongshuai Chen,Abstract This paper studies sentiment analysis of sentences with modality. The aim is todetermine whether opinions expressed in sentences with modality are positive; negative orneutral. Modality is commonly used in text. In a typical corpus; there are around 18% ofsentences with modality. Due to modality's special characteristics; the sentiment it bears maybe hard to determine. For example; in the sentence; this cellphone would be perfect if it hasa bigger screen; the speaker is negative about this phone although there is a typicallypositive opinion word “perfect” in this sentence. This paper first presents a linguistic analysisof modality; and then identifies some features to train a support vector machine classifier todetermine the sentiment orientation in such sentences. Experimental results on sentenceswith modality extracted from the reviews of four different products are given to illustrate …,International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics,2014,14
MeanKS: Meaningful keyword search in relational databases with complex schema,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Nick Cercone; Parke Godfrey; Jaroslaw Szlichta; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Keyword search in relational databases was introduced in the last decade to assistusers who are not familiar with a query language; the schema of the database; or the contentof the data. An answer is a join tree of tuples that contains the query keywords. Whensearching a database with a complex schema; there are potentially many answers to thequery. Therefore; ranking answers based on their relevance is crucial in this context. Priorwork has addressed relevance based on the size of the answer or the IR scores of thetuples. However; this is not sufficient when searching a complex schema. We demonstrateMeanKS; a new system for meaningful keyword search over relational databases. Thesystem first captures the user's interest by determining the roles of the keywords. Then; ituses schema-based ranking to rank join trees that cover the keyword roles. This uses the …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,13
CI-Rank: Ranking keyword search results based on collective importance,Xiaohui Yu; Huxia Shi,Keyword search over databases; popularized by keyword search in WWW; allows ordinaryusers to access database information without the knowledge of structured query languagesand database schemas. Most of the previous studies in this area use IR-style ranking; whichfail to consider the importance of the query answers. In this paper; we propose CI-RANK; anew approach for keyword search in databases; which considers the importance ofindividual nodes in a query answer and the cohesiveness of the result structure in abalanced way. CI-RANK is built upon a carefully designed model call Random Walk withMessage Passing that helps capture the relationships between different nodes in the queryanswer.

Continuous KNN join processing for real-time recommendation,Chong Yang; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu,The explosive growth of user-generated contents in social networking websites necessitatesthe recommendation functionality that can push to the user the content that he/she is mostlikely to be interested in. Such recommendation should happen in real-time as new contentsbecome available; because" freshness" is an important consideration in people's content-consumption behavior. Representing users and contents as feature vectors in a high-dimensional space; we can essentially cast the problem of real-time recommendations asthe problem of computing the list of k nearest neighbors of each user; which we call kNNjoin. Given the vast volume of contents and users; the biggest challenge is how tocontinuously update the kNN join results as new contents arrive. Existing methods forincremental kNN join on data streams suffer from the" curse of dimensionality" and high in …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,11

Meaningful keyword search in relational databases with large and complex schema,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Nick Cercone; Parke Godfrey; Jaroslaw Szlichta; Xiaohui Yu,Keyword search over relational databases offers an alternative way to SQL to query andexplore databases that is effective for lay users who may not be well versed in SQL or thedatabase schema. This becomes more pertinent for databases with large and complexschemas. An answer in this context is a join tree spanning tuples containing the query'skeywords. As there are potentially many answers to the query; and the user is often onlyinterested in seeing the top-k answers; how to rank the answers based on their relevance isof paramount importance. We focus on the relevance of join as the fundamental means torank answers. We devise means to measure relevance of relations and foreign keys in theschema over the information content of the database. This can be done offline with no needfor external models.

Hadooprsync,Jiaran Zhang; Xiaohui Yu; You Li; Liwei Lin,Cloud storage has become increasingly popular due to its convenience; cost-effectivenessand scalability. It provides the basis for a slate of file hosting services; which offer users theability to synchronize their files between the servers and their devices. Naive filesynchronization; however; requires the whole file to be transmitted to all other locations(servers; devices) whenever the file is updated in one location. This leads to massive wasteof bandwidth and significant delays in propagating the update. We propose a method calledHadoopRsync; which is capable of performing incremental update of files instead oftransmitting them in entirety. This method is based on the rsync utility originally proposed forfile synchronization between computers; but the scenario under consideration is significantlydifferent from that for rsync in that in the cloud storage context; files are distributedly …,Cloud and Service Computing (CSC); 2011 International Conference on,2011,10
Apparatus; system; and method for performing fast approximate computation of statistics on query expressions,*,An apparatus; system; and method are disclosed for performing fast approximatecomputation of statistics on query expressions in order to improve query optimization withina database management system by accurately and quickly estimating the sizes ofintermediate query results. This is accomplished by analyzing a query for join instruction andidentifying a fact table and a dimension table within those join instructions. Then; frequencystatistics corresponding to distinct values of within the fact table are retrieved from a catalogtable. Those frequency statistics are used in combination with a full scan of the dimensiontable accurately and quickly estimate frequency statistics for an expected join between thefact table and dimension table. The estimated frequency statistics corresponding to theexpected join may then be used in such operations as query optimization.,*,2009,10
An adaptive model for probabilistic sentiment analysis,Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Aijun An,Online reviews; which are getting increasingly prevalent with the rapid growth of Web 2.0;have been shown to be second only to``word-of-mouth''in terms of influencing purchasedecisions. It is therefore imperative to analyze them and distill useful knowledge that couldbe of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. Previous studies haveconfirmed that the sentiments expressed in the online reviews are strongly correlated withthe sales performance of products. In particular; a model called ARSA has been proposedfor predicting sales performance using a model called S-PLSA. In this paper; we build uponthat work; and present an adaptive sentiment analysis model called S-PLSA+; which notonly can capture the hidden sentiment factors in the reviews; but has the capability to beincrementally updated as more data become available.

Towards estimating the number of distinct value combinations for a set of attributes,Xiaohui Yu; Calisto Zuzarte; Kenneth C Sevcik,Abstract Accurately and efficiently estimating the number of distinct values for some attribute(s) or sets of attributes in a data set is of critical importance to many database operations;such as query optimization and approximation query answering. Previous work has focusedon the estimation of the number of distinct values for a single attribute and most existingwork adopts a data sampling approach. This paper addresses the equally important issue ofestimating the number of distinct value combinations for multiple attributes which we callCOLSCARD (for COLumn Set CARDinality). It also takes a different approach that usesexisting statistical information (eg; histograms) available on the individual attributes to assistestimation. We start with cases where exact frequency information on individual attributes isavailable; and present a pair of lower and upper bounds on COLSCARD that are …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,8
Predicting next locations with object clustering and trajectory clustering,Meng Chen; Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Next location prediction is of great importance for many location based applications.In many cases; understanding the similarity between objects and the similarity betweentrajectories may lead to more accurate predictions. In this paper; we propose two novelmodels exploiting these two types of similarities respectively. The first model; named object-clustered Markov model (object-MM); first clusters similar objects based on their spatiallocalities; and then builds variable-order Markov models with the trajectories of objects in thesame cluster. The second model; named trajectory-clustered Markov model (tra-MM);considers the similarity between trajectories; and clusters the trajectories to form the trainingset used in building the Markov models. The two models are integrated to produce the finalnext location predictor (objectTra-MM).

Pollux: Towards scalable distributed real-time search on microblogs,Liwei Lin; Xiaohui Yu; Nick Koudas,Abstract The last few years have witnessed a meteoric rise of microblogging platforms; suchas Twitter and Tumblr. The sheer volume of the microblog data and its highly dynamic naturepresent unique technical challenges for the platforms that provide search services. Inparticular; the search service must provide real-time response to queries; and continuouslyupdate the results as new microblogs are posted. Conventional approaches either cannotkeep up with the high update rate; or cannot scale well to handle the large volume of data.We propose Pollux; a system that provides distributed real-time indexing and search serviceon microblogs.

HASE: a hybrid approach to selectivity estimation for conjunctive predicates,Xiaohui Yu; Nick Koudas; Calisto Zuzarte,Abstract Current methods for selectivity estimation fall into two broad categories; synopsis-based and sampling-based. Synopsis-based methods; such as histograms; incur minimaloverhead at query optimization time and thus are widely used in commercial databasesystems. Sampling-based methods are more suited for ad-hoc queries; but often involvehigh I/O cost because of random access to the underlying data. Though both methods servethe same purpose of selectivity estimation; their interaction in the case of selectivityestimation for conjuncts of predicates on multiple attributes is largely unexplored. Our workaims at taking the best of both worlds; by making consistent use of synopses and sampleinformation when they are both present. To achieve this goal; we propose HASE; a novelestimation scheme based on a powerful mechanism called generalized raking. We …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,6

Mining frequent co-occurrence patterns across multiple data streams.,Ziqiang Yu; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Wenzhu Li; Jian Pei,ABSTRACT This paper studies the problem of mining frequent co-occurrence patternsacross multiple data streams; which has not been addressed by existing works. Co-occurrence pattern in this context refers to the case that the same group of objects appearconsecutively in multiple streams over a short time span; signaling tight correlationsbetween these objects. The need for mining such patterns in real-time arises in a variety ofapplications ranging from crime prevention to location-based services to event discovery insocial media. Since the data streams are usually fast; continuous; and unbounded; existingmethods on mining frequent patterns requiring more than one pass over the data cannot bedirectly applied. Therefore; we propose DIMine and CooMine; two algorithms to discoverfrequent co-occurrence patterns across multiple data streams. DIMine is an Apriori-style …,EDBT,2015,5

Existing solutions based relationaldatabase systems cannot effectively manage and process such large volume of data; norcan they provide support for efficient and scalable support for either analytical tasks or tasksrequiring response in real-time. To address these challenges; we have developed theGrandLand Traffic Data Processing Platform (GLPlatform) to provide distributed; scalableprocessing of traffic surveillance data.,Big Data (BigData Congress); 2014 IEEE International Congress on,2014,5
Csr+-tree: Cache-conscious indexing for high-dimensional similarity search,Junfeng Dong; Xiaohui Yu,In this paper; we propose a novel index structure; the CSR+-tree; to support efficient high-dimensional similarity search in main memory. We introduce quantized bounding spheres(QBSs) that approximate bounding spheres (BSs) or data points. We analyze the respectivepros and cons of both QBSs and the previously proposed quantized bounding rectangles(QBRs); and take the best of both worlds by carefully incorporating both of them into theCSR+-tree. We further propose a novel distance computation scheme that eliminates theneed for decompressing QBSs or QBRs; which results in significant cost savings. Wepresent an extensive experimental evaluation and analysis of the CSR+-tree; and compareits performance against that of other representative indexes in the literature. Our resultsshow that the CSR+-tree consistently outperforms other index structures.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007. SSBDM'07. 19th International Conference on,2007,5
Collaborative filtering with weighted opinion aspects,Chong Yang; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Yanping Nie; Yuanhong Wang,Abstract Collaborative filtering (CF) aims to produce recommendations based on otherusers' ratings to an item. Most existing CF methods rely on the overall ratings an item hasreceived. However; these ratings alone sometimes cannot provide sufficient information tounderstand users' behaviors. For example; a user giving a high rating may indicate that heloves the item as a whole; however; it is still likely that he dislikes some particular aspects atthe same time. In addition; users tend to place different emphases on different aspects whenreaching an overall rating. This emphasis on aspects may even vary from users to items; andhas a significant impact on a user's final decision. To make a better understanding of auser'behavior and generate a more accurate recommendation; we propose a framework thatincorporates both user opinions and preferences on different aspects. This framework is …,Neurocomputing,2016,4
Efficient duplication free and minimal keyword search in graphs,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,Keyword search over a graph searches for a subgraph that contains a set of querykeywords. A problem with most existing keyword search methods is that they may produceduplicate answers that contain the same set of content nodes (ie; nodes containing a querykeyword) although these nodes may be connected differently in different answers. Thus;users may be presented with many similar answers with trivial differences. In addition; someof the nodes in an answer may contain query keywords that are all covered by other nodesin the answer. Removing these nodes does not change the coverage of the answer but canmake the answer more compact. The answers in which each content node contains at leastone unique query keyword are called minimal answers in this paper. We define the problemof finding duplication-free and minimal answers; and propose algorithms for finding such …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,4
Fast determination of pyrethroid pesticides in tobacco by GC-MS-SIM coupled with modified QuEChERS sample preparation procedure,Yan Gao; Ying Sun; Chunzhu Jiang; Xi Yu; Yuanpeng Wang; Hanqi Zhang; Daqian Song,抄録 An analytical method was developed for the extraction and determination of pyrethroidpesticide residues in tobacco. The modified QuEChERS (Quick; Easy; Cheap; Effective;Rugged and Safe) method was applied for preparing samples. In this study; methyl cyanide(MeCN)-saturated salt aqueous was used as the two-phase extraction solvent for the firsttime; and a vortex shaker was used for the simultaneous shaking and concentration of theanalytes. The effects of experimental parameters on extraction and clean-up efficiency wereinvestigated and optimized. The analytes were determined by gas chromatography–massspectrometry–selected ion monitoring (GC-MS-SIM). The obtained recoveries of the analytesat three different fortification levels were 76.85–114.1% and relative standard deviations(RSDs) were lower than 15.7%.

Alternative query optimization for workload management,Zahid Abul-Basher; Yi Feng; Parke Godfrey; Xiaohui Yu; Mokhtar Kandil; Danny Zilio; Calisto Zuzarte,Abstract Systems with heavy workloads run many queries concurrently. Modern databaseworkloads—as those incurred by business intelligence applications—involve ad-hoc; highlycomplex; expensive queries. While query plans are optimized individually; the workloadoverall is not. Plans running together incur resource contention; resulting in sub-optimalperformance. To address this; we introduce the idea of alternative-objective queryoptimization. Multiple query plans for the same query are generated; each optimized for analternative resource usage. At runtime; the workload manager then can choose the plan forthe query that works best for runtime conditions. This balances the system load; reducingcontention; to increase overall workload throughput.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2012,4
Keyword query cleaning with query logs,Lei Gao; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu,Abstract Keyword queries over databases are often dirty with some irrelevant or incorrectwords; which has a negative impact on the efficiency and accuracy of keyword queryprocessing. In addition; the keywords in a given query often form natural segments. Forexample; the query “Tom Hanks Green Mile” can be considered as consisting of twosegments;“Tom Hanks” and “Green Mile”. The goal of keyword query cleaning is to identifythe optimal segmentation of the query; with semantic linkage and spelling corrections alsoconsidered. Query cleaning not only helps obtaining queries of higher quality; but alsoimproves the efficiency of query processing by reducing the search space. The seminal workalong this direction by Pu and Yu does not consider the role of query logs in performingquery cleaning. Query logs contain user-issued queries together with the segmentations …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2011,4

Reasoning about approximate match query results,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Xiaohui Yu,Join techniques deploying approximate match predicates are fundamental data cleaningoperations. A variety of predicates have been utilized to quantify approximate match in suchoperations and some have been embedded in a declarative data cleaning framework.These techniques return pairs of tuples from both relations; tagged with a score; signifyingthe degree of similarity between the tuples in the pair according to the specific approximatematch predicate. In this paper; we consider the problem of estimating various parameters onthe output of declarative approximate join algorithms for planning purposes. Such algorithmsare highly time consuming; so precise knowledge of the result size as well as its scoredistribution is a pressing concern. This knowledge aids decisions as to which operations aremore promising for identifying highly similar tuples; which is a key operation for data …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Reviews are not equally important: Predicting the helpfulness of online reviews,Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Online reviews provide a valuable resource for potential customers to makepurchase decisions. However; the sheer volume of available reviews as well as the largevariations in the review quality present a big impediment to the effective use of the reviews;as the most helpful reviews may be buried in the large amount of reviews of low qualities.The goal of this paper is to develop models and algorithms for predicting the helpfulness ofreviews; which provides the basis for discovering the most helpful reviews for givenproducts. We first show that the helpfulness of a review depends on three important factors:the reviewer's expertise; the writing style of the review; and the timeliness of the review.Based on the analysis of those factors; we present HelpMeter; a nonlinear regression modelfor helpfulness prediction.

Sharpe ratio-oriented active trading: A learning approach,Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu; Jiqing Han,Abstract Portfolio offers an effective way for managing investment risk through diversification.The key issue in portfolio management is how to determine the weight (portion) of eachasset in the portfolio; so as to achieve high profit with low risk over a certain period oftrading. We propose a learning-based trading strategy for portfolio management; which aimsat maximizing the Sharpe Ratio by actively reallocating wealth among assets. The tradingdecision is formulated as a non-linear function of the latest realized asset returns; and thefunction can be approximated by a neural-network. Two methods based on supervisedlearning to train the network are proposed. Experiments show that the proposed tradingstrategy outperforms the static Sharpe Ratio trading method.,Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2002,3

VColor: A practical vertex-cut based approach for coloring large graphs,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Bingsheng He; Shuigeng Zhou; Ruzhi Xu; Xiaohui Yu,Graph coloring is a fundamental NP-hard problem in graph theory. It has a wide range ofreal applications; such as Operations Research; Communication Network; ComputationalBiology and Compiler Optimization. Notable efforts have been spent on designing itsapproximation algorithms. Halldrsson proposed the algorithm (denoted as SampleIS) withthe current best known approximation ratio. However; its time complexity is O (| G| 3); where|G| is the number of vertices of a graph G. It is clear that SampleIS is not practical for largegraphs. In this paper; we propose a practical vertex-cut based coloring technique (VColor)for coloring large graphs. First; we partition G into k connected components (CCs) of a smallsize s by removing a vertex-cut component (VCC). For each CC; we apply our novel coloringalgorithm; based on maximal independent set enumeration.

Weighted aspect-based collaborative filtering,YanPing Nie; Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Existing work on collaborative filtering (CF) is often based on the overall ratings theitems have received. However; in many cases; understanding how a user rates each aspectof an item may reveal more detailed information about her preferences and thus may lead tomore effective CF. Prior work has studied extracting/quantizing sentiments on differentaspects from the reviews; based on which the unknown overall ratings are inferred.However; in that work; all the aspects are treated equally; while in reality; different users tendto place emphases on difference aspects when reaching the overall rating. For example;users may give a high rating to a movie just for its plot despite its mediocre performances.This emphasis on aspects varies for different users and different items.

Study on fluorescence spectral behavior of trimethoxyphenylflurone with gallium in microemulsion,XD Wang; HQ Yu; Qin Wei; Hua-Jun Chen; Bin Du; XH Zhao,Abstract In the present paper; the fluorescence spectral behavior of gallium withtrimethoxyphenylflurone (TM-PF) in microemulsion was studied. In the buffer medium of HAc-NaAc at pH 4.95; the fluorescence intensity is in proportion to the concentration of gallium(III) in the range of 0-0.045 microg x mL (-1). The CTMAB microemulsion was efficiently usedto enhance the sensibility and stability of the system; and the limits of detection were 1.2 ng xmL (-1). The coexistent metal ions can be separated and gallium can be enriched by theextraction of butyl acetate; greatly improving the selectivity and sensibility of the system. Themethod possesses high sensitivity as well as high selectivity. It can be used to determinetrace amount of gallium in ore samples successfully.,Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi= Guang pu,2006,1
Three-dimensional numerical simulation of oblique wave action on vertical walls,Li Benxia; Yu Xiping; Yu Yuxiu,英文摘要: A three-dimensional numerical model based on the potential theory wasdeveloped to study the oblique wave action on vertical walls. A source term inside thedomain was used to generate incident waves and outgoing waves were dissipated bysponge layers and transmitted by radiation boundaries. The finite difference method wasused to solve the governing equations and boundary conditions in the regular transformeddomain in σ-coordinate. Satisfactory agreements between the numerical predictions andexperimental results of wave force were obtained. It is concluded that the maximum waveforce acting on the vertical walls is induced by the obliquely incident waves rather than thenormally incident waves.,海洋学报 (中文版),2006,1
Analysis of the Crowd Degree of Building for Communities Based on High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensed Images,CHENG Chengqi YU Xin GUO Shide; MA Ting,The crowd degree of buildings is a very important aspect for the assessment ofenvironmental quality of urban communities. Remote sensing imagery with high spatialresolution provides more detailed spatial information about land covers and makes itpossible to assess the quality of communities in detailed scale. Four factors were proposedto assess the crowd degree of buildings based on the combination of high spatial resolutionimagery and some fundamental principles including estate and geo-statistics methods. Fivetypical communities in Xiamen City were selected to demonstrate the application of thoseindices. Results suggested that these indices could describe the building crowd degree fromdifferent aspects; and it provided a new approach in assessing environmental quality ofcommunity through high spatial resolution remote sensed data.,*,2005,1

Piecewise Linear Histograms for Selectivity Estimation,Xiaohui Yu; Ada Fu,Abstract Selectivity estimation of queries is of critical importance to query optimization. Inorder to get accurate estimations; database management systems must maintain statistics tocapture the underlying data distribution. Histograms are extensively used in commercialdatabase systems for this purpose. Most current histogram techniques make the assumptionthat all values in a single bucket appear with the same frequency; which rarely holds true inpractice. In this paper; we propose a new type of histograms called piecewise linearhistograms. Frequencies of attribute values in a bucket of the piecewise linear histogram is tby a line using linear least squares regression; and the coe cients are stored as synopsis ofthe underlying data distribution. Moreover; since nding the best partition of the domain intobuckets is an NP-hard problem; we propose a heuristic to e ciently determine the …,International Symposium on Information Systems and Engineering (ISE’2001),2001,1

A non-dualistic unified field theory of gravitation; electromagnetism and spin,Yu Xin,Abstract The wisdom of classicalunified field theories in the conceptual framework of Weyl;Eddington; Einstein and Schrödinger has often been doubted and in particular there doesnot appear to be any empirical reason why the Einstein-Maxwell (EM) theory needs to begeometrized. The crux of the matter is; however not whether the EM theory is aestheticallysatisfactory but whether it answers all the modern questions within the classical context. Inparticular; the EM theory does not provide a classical platform from which the Dirac equationcan be derived in the way Schrödinger's equation is derived from classical mechanics viathe energy equation and the Correspondence Principle. The present paper presents a non-dualistic unified field theory (UFT) in the said conceptual framework as propounded by MATonnelat.

ID Repair for Trajectories with Transition Graphs,Xingcan Cui; Xiaohui Yu; Xiaofang Zhou; Jiong Guo,In many surveillance applications; capture devices are set on fixed locations to track entities;leading to valuable spatio-temporal trajectories. However; sometimes the IDs of the entitiesin these trajectories are incorrectly identified due to various reasons (eg; illuminationconditions and partial occlusion). Since very often the movements of the entities areconstrained by certain restrictions imposed by the application (eg; vehicles must move alongthe given road network); we consider how to repair the erroneous IDs using transitiongraphs derived from such restrictions. Roughly speaking; the occurrence of erroneous IDscan cause a valid trajectory to be broken into trajectory fragments that violate somemovement constraints imposed by the transition graph; and we aim to repair them byrewriting the IDs and merging the fragments. This problem is practically challenging since …,*,2018,*
Sliding Window Top-K Monitoring over Distributed Data Streams,Ben Chen; Zhijin Lv; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu,Abstract Most of the traditional top-k algorithms are based on a single-server setting. Theymay be highly inefficient and/or cause huge communication overhead when applied to adistributed system environment. Therefore; the problem of top-k monitoring in distributedenvironments has been intensively investigated recently. This paper studies how to monitorthe top-k data objects with the largest aggregate numeric values from distributed datastreams within a fixed-size monitoring window W; while minimizing communication costacross the network. We propose a novel algorithm; which adaptively reallocates numericvalues of data objects among distributed nodes by assigning revision factors when localconstraints are violated and keeps the local top-k result at distributed nodes in line with theglobal top-k result. We also develop a framework that combines a distributed data stream …,Data Science and Engineering,2017,*
LCE: A Location Category Embedding Model for Predicting the Category Labels of POIs,Yue Wang; Meng Chen; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu,Abstract The proliferation of location-based social networks; makes it possible to recordhuman mobility using an array of points-of-interest (POIs). Exploring the semantic meaningsof POIs can be of great importance to many urban computing applications; eg; personalizedroute recommendation and user trajectory clustering. Nonetheless; such information is notalways available in practice. This paper aims at predicting the category labels; which willprovide a succinct summarization of POIs. In particular; we first propose a Location CategoryEmbedding (LCE) model; which projects user POIs and their associated category labels intothe same vector space; and then identify the POIs' most related category labels according totheir similarities. To capture the influence that might affect users' moving behavior; LCEconsiders sequential pattern; personal preference; and temporal influence; and further …,International Conference on Neural Information Processing,2017,*

CoDS: Co-training with Domain Similarity for Cross-Domain Image Sentiment Classification,Linlin Zhang; Meng Chen; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu,Abstract Classifying images according to the sentiments expressed therein has a wide rangeof applications; such as sentiment-based search or recommendation. Most existing methodsfor image sentiment classification approach this problem by training general classifiersbased on certain visual features; ignoring the discrepancies across domains. In this paper;we propose a novel co-training method with d omain s imilarity (CoDS) for cross-domainimage sentiment classification in social applications. The key idea underlying our approachis to use both the images and the corresponding textual comments when training classifiers;and to use the labeled data of one domain to make sentiment classification for the images ofanother domain through co-training. We compute image/text similarity between the sourcedomain and the target domain and set the weighting of the corresponding classifiers to …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2016,*
Repair Singleton IDs on the Fly,Xingcan Cui; Xiaohui Yu; De Guo,Abstract Tracking moving entities at predefined locations plays an essential role in manysurveillance related applications. Occasionally; the IDs of those entities are incorrectlyrecorded due to various reasons such as errors in recognition. Such errors need to berepaired on the fly as those IDs are often involved in some time-sensitive query processingor data analysis tasks. In this paper; we address a specific case where the errors result insingleton IDs; ie; IDs that appear only once during a specific period of time and thus couldbe safely presumed to be erroneous. The repair of the IDs is based on constraints posed bythe data itself (eg; constraints posed by the road network). We present a tracking treestructure to index the candidate repairs for each singleton ID; which enables repairing of theIDs on the fly.

Towards Efficient KNN Joins on Data Streams,Chong Yang; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu,We study the problem of efficient processing of kNN joins over high-dimensional datastreams; which is an operation required by many big data applications. Specifically; we areconcerned with the continuous evaluation of a set of k nearest neighbor queries Q onstreams of high-dimensional items at consecutive snapshots of those streams. While onepossible solution is to evaluate the kNN joins starting from scratch at each snapshot; it is tooexpensive for large volumes of data we encounter in big data applications. We consider thedata stream on a time window and maintain the join results for Q at every snapshot in mainmemory. Our approach to this problem is to build indexes on Q; and only update the resultsof the queries affected by the changes in the streams at each snapshot.

DDSN: Duplicate detection to reduce both storage and bandwidth consumption,Jiaran Zhang; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Liwei Lin,As highly centralized storage facilities are gaining popularity; duplicate detection becomes acritical problem. Traditional methods focus on reducing the storage space consumption;however; for network storage system with remote clients; the network overhead cannot beignored; especially when the system is accessed over WAN. We propose a new duplicatedetection method and implement a network file system prototype called DDSN based on thisnew method. It can reach the same performance in terms of storage space consumption asthe state-of-the-art sliding blocking method. Meanwhile; our method overcomes its drawbackthat the whole file needs to be transmitted over the network; and therefore saves massivebandwidth for duplicate data.

In this book; we study three cardinality estimation problems in thecontexts of query optimization and data cleaning; and propose a set of new techniques toaddress the challenges arising therein. We first consider the problem of estimating thenumber of distinct value combinations for a set of attributes. We propose an estimator thatutilizes the knowledge of marginal distributions of individual attributes; and establish upperand lower bounds on the estimate. In the second part of the book; we propose HASE; ahybrid approach to selectivity estimation.

Fast approximate computation of statistics on views,Calisto Zuzarte; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Accurate estimation of the sizes of intermediate query results (cardinalityestimation) is of critical importance to plan costing in query optimization. The commonpractice in current commercial database systems such as IBM DB2 Universal Database(DB2 UDB) is to derive the cardinality estimates from base-table statistics. However; thisapproach often suffers from simplifying yet unrealistic assumptions that have to be madeabout the underlying data (for example; different attributes are independently distributed).Ways for exploiting statistics on query expressions (or; statistics on views; or SITs) havebeen proposed to improve the accuracy of cardinality estimation. We propose a novelmethod for efficient computation of SITs for joins. In particular; we are concerned withstatistics on join queries involving large fact tables and relatively small dimension tables …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,*

Overexpression of Bak induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase through up-regulating expression of p27KIP1 in HCC-9204 cell line,LI Jiang; WANG Wen-Liang; YU Xin-Xin; YANG Xin-Ke; Hou Yun-De,The Id family (Idl-Id4) of helix-loop-helix proteins act as negative regulators of basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that drive cell lineage commitment and differentiationin diverse cell types. In general; tissue-specific bHLH proteins form heterodimers with theubiquitously expressed bHLH proteins and activate the expression of specific genescarrying an E-box regulatory motif. Id proteins lack a basic region and act as dominant-negative antagonists of the bHLH transcription factors by forming heterodimers that areunable to bind DNA. We have previously shown that Id2 and Id3 undergo cell cycledependent phosphorylation at a serine residue (Ser5) within a consensus target site forcyclin-dependent kinases (EMBO J. 1 6 332-342; 1997).

Measurement of the complete fusion excitation function for the 16 O+ 12 C reaction,Sufang Wang; Jiwen Zheng; Guoxing Liu,The complete fusion excitation function has been measured for the 16 O+ 12 C reaction inthe energy range of 50-90 MeV with a position sensitive ΔE-E telescope system. It is foundthat the complete fusion excitation function is not smooth and exhibits some structures. Thepeak position of the fluctuations correspond to 26.0; 31.0 and 36.4 MeV in the center of masssystem. The experimental results are discussed and compared with that obtained inprevious works,Gaoneng Wuli Yu He Wuli,1992,*
A novel coal feeder for production of low sulfur fuel,Soon-Jai Khang; L Lin; TC Keener; P Yeh,ABSTRACT A dual-screw feeder was designed for desulfurization of coal. This reactorcontains two screw tubes; the inner tube acting as a coal pyrolizer and the outer tube actingas a desulfurizer with hot calcined lime pellets or other renewable sorbent pellets. Theobjective of this project is to study the feasibility of an advanced concept of desulfurizationand possibly some denitrification in this coal feeder. In this year; two basic studies havebeen performed: 1) the desulfurization and 2) the denitrification due to mild pyrolysis.Specifically; the following tasks have been performed: 1) Setting up the Dual-Screw reactor;2) Determination of the pyrolysis product and the sulfur distribution in char; tar and gasbased on experimental data; 3) Study of the devolatilization; the desulfurization kinetics andthe denitrification kinetics and obtaining the basic kinetic parameters; 4) Study of the …,*,1991,*
Photoemission studies of Pd/D system with high deuterium content,Liu Zhenxiang; Xie Kan; Qi Shangxue; Cao Jianming; Li Nan; Yu Xingnan; Lin Zhangda,Abstract The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of Pd/D system (includingabsorption at high pressure) with various D contents were measured. The D absorptioninduced a new peak centered at about 6eV below E f; which seems to derive from thehybridized states of deuterium and Pd electronic states. Its intensity increases with Dcontent; only part of the D atoms in the Pd lattice are ionized at high D content.,Chinese Physics Letters,1990,*
Measurement of fission fragment angular distribution in heavy-ions induced reaction,Guoxing Liu; Keliang Chen; Jiwen Zheng; Sufang Wang; Xingping Bai; Xian Yu; Zhiguo Fan,The angular distributions of fission fragments for a series of compound nuclei formed in thebombardment of 181 Ta; 197 Au; Pb and 209 Bi by 12 C ions and in the bomardment ofnatural lead by 14 N ions were measued with mica track detectors and gold surface barrierdetectors. It is shown that all experimental data for the fission fragment angular distributionscan be fitted by the statistical scission model of fission fragment angular distribution,Physica Energiae Fortis et Physica Nuclearis,1989,*
Meaningful Keyword Search over Databases with Complex Schema,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Parke Godfrey; Jaroslaw Szlichta; Xiaohui Yu,Much of the world's high-quality data stays under lock and key in relational databases. Accessis gained through relational query languages such as SQL. However; a lay user—anyone whodoes not know SQL or who is not well versed in the given schema—is effectively locked out[1; 4]. As the schemas of the datasets that organizations field become more complex; we all effectivelybecome lay users. Keyword search has recently been used for extracting information from relationaldatabases. An answer to the query is a set of tuples from the database that cover the keywordsof the query; and a natural structure (ie; a tree from the database's schema) that spans thosetuples. An important issue in keyword search is to score answers for relevance. Prior work hasaddressed relevance. In [3]; a simplistic solution of scoring relevance as the reciprocal of thenumber of edges in an answer's tree was proposed. In [2]; the authors apply information …,*,*,*

Meaningful Keyword Search in RDBMS,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Parke Godfrey; Jaroslaw Szlichta; Xiaohui Yu,ABSTRACT Keyword search over relational databases offers an alterna- tive way to SQL to queryand explore databases that is effective for lay users who may not be well versed in SQL or thedatabase schema. This becomes more pertinent for databases with large and complexschemas. An answer in this context is a join tree spanning tuples containing the query'skeywords. As there are potentially many answers to the query; and the user is often only interestedin seeing the top-k answers; how to rank the answers based on their relevance is of paramountimportance. We focus on the relevance of join as the fundamental means to rank answers. Wedevise means to measure rel- evance of relations and foreign keys in the schema over the informationcontent of the database. This can be done of- fline with no need for external models. We comparethe proposed measures against a gold standard we derive from a real workload over …,*,*,*
