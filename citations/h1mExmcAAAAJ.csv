Spacetwist: Managing the trade-offs among location privacy; query performance; and query accuracy in mobile services,Man Lung Yiu; Christian S Jensen; Xuegang Huang; Hua Lu,In a mobile service scenario; users query a server for nearby points of interest but they maynot want to disclose their locations to the service. Intuitively; location privacy may beobtained at the cost of query performance and query accuracy. The challenge addressed ishow to obtain the best possible performance; subjected to given requirements for locationprivacy and query accuracy. Existing privacy solutions that use spatial cloaking employcomplex server query processing techniques and entail the transmission of large quantitiesof intermediate result. Solutions that use transformation-based matching generally fall shortin offering practical query accuracy guarantees. Our proposed framework; calledSpaceTwist; rectifies these shortcomings for k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries. Starting witha location different from the user's actual location; nearest neighbors are retrieved …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,380
Skyline queries against mobile lightweight devices in MANETs,Zhiyong Huang; Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,Skyline queries are well suited when retrieving data according to multiple criteria. Whilemost previous work has assumed a centralized setting this paper considers skyline queryingin a mobile and distributed setting; where each mobile device is capable of holding only aportion of the whole dataset; where devices communicate through mobile ad hoc networks;and where a query issued by a mobile user is interested only in the user's local area;although a query generally involves data stored on many mobile devices due to the storagelimitations. We present techniques that aim to reduce the costs of communication amongmobile devices and reduce the execution time on each single mobile device. For the former;skyline query requests are forwarded among mobile devices in a deliberate way; such thatthe amount of data to be transferred is reduced. For the latter; specific optimization …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,214
Pad: privacy-area aware; dummy-based location privacy in mobile services,Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract Location privacy in mobile services has the potential to become a serious concernfor service providers and users. Existing privacy protection techniques that use k-anonymityconvert an original query into an anonymous query that contains the locations of multipleusers. Such techniques; however; generally fail in offering guaranteed large privacy regionsat reasonable query processing costs. In this paper; we propose the PAD approach that iscapable of offering privacy-region guarantees. To achieve this; PAD uses so-called dummylocations that are deliberately generated according to either a virtual grid or circle. Thesecover a user's actual location; and their spatial extents are controlled by the generationalgorithms. The PAD approach only requires a lightweight server-side front-end in order for itto be integrated into an existing client/server mobile service system. In addition; query …,MobiDE,2008,170
Graph model based indoor tracking,Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Bin Yang,The tracking of the locations of moving objects in large indoor spaces is important; as itenables a range of applications related to; eg; security and indoor navigation and guidance.This paper presents a graph model based approach to indoor tracking that offers a uniformdata management infrastructure for different symbolic positioning technologies; eg;Bluetooth and RFID. More specifically; the paper proposes a model of indoor space thatcomprises a base graph and mappings that represent the topology of indoor space atdifferent levels. The resulting model can be used for one or several indoor positioningtechnologies. Focusing on RFID-based positioning; an RFID specific reader deploymentgraph model is built from the base graph model. This model is then used in severalalgorithms for constructing and refining trajectories from raw RFID readings. Empirical …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09.

Continuous skyline queries for moving objects,Zhiyong Huang; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,The literature on skyline algorithms has so far dealt mainly with queries of static query pointsover static data sets. With the increasing number of mobile service applications and users;however; the need for continuous skyline query processing has become more pressing. Acontinuous skyline query involves not only static dimensions; but also the dynamic one. Inthis paper; we examine the spatiotemporal coherence of the problem and propose acontinuous skyline query processing strategy for moving query points. First; we distinguishthe data points that are permanently in the skyline and use them to derive a search bound.Second; we investigate the connection between the spatial positions of data points and theirdominance relationship; which provides an indication of where to find changes in the skylineand how to maintain the skyline continuously. Based on the analysis; we propose a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,144
Parallel distributed processing of constrained skyline queries by filtering,Bin Cui; Hua Lu; Quanqing Xu; Lijiang Chen; Yafei Dai; Yongluan Zhou,Skyline queries are capable of retrieving interesting points from a large data set according tomultiple criteria. Most work on skyline queries so far has assumed a centralized storage;whereas in practice relevant data are often distributed among geographically scattered sites.In this work; we tackle constrained skyline queries in large-scale distributed environmentswithout the assumption of any overlay structures; and propose a novel algorithm namedPaDSkyline (Parallel Distributed Skyline query processing). PaDSkyline significantlyshortens the response time by performing parallel processing over site groups produced bya partition algorithm. Within each group; it locally optimizes the query processing overdistributed sites. It also drastically enhances the network transmission efficiency byperforming early reduction of skyline candidates with deliberately selected multiple …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Probabilistic threshold k nearest neighbor queries over moving objects in symbolic indoor space,Bin Yang; Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The availability of indoor positioning renders it possible to deploy location-basedservices in indoor spaces. Many such services will benefit from the efficient support for knearest neighbor (kNN) queries over large populations of indoor moving objects. However;existing kNN techniques fall short in indoor spaces because these differ from Euclidean andspatial network spaces and because of the limited capabilities of indoor positioningtechnologies. To contend with indoor settings; we propose the new concept of minimalindoor walking distance (MIWD) along with algorithms and data structures for distancecomputing and storage; and we differentiate the states of indoor moving objects based on apositioning device deployment graph; utilize these states in effective object indexingstructures; and capture the uncertainty of object locations. On these foundations; we study …,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on extending database technology,2010,83
Indexing the trajectories of moving objects in symbolic indoor space,Christian Jensen; Hua Lu; Bin Yang,Abstract Indoor spaces accommodate large populations of individuals. With appropriateindoor positioning; eg; Bluetooth and RFID; in place; large amounts of trajectory data resultthat may serve as a foundation for a wide variety of applications; eg; space planning; wayfinding; and security. This scenario calls for the indexing of indoor trajectories. Based on anappropriate notion of indoor trajectory and definitions of pertinent types of queries; the paperproposes two R-tree based structures for indexing object trajectories in symbolic indoorspace. The RTR-tree represents a trajectory as a set of line segments in a space spanned bypositioning readers and time. The TP 2 R-tree applies a data transformation that yields arepresentation of trajectories as points with extension along the time dimension. The paperdetails the structure; node organization strategies; and query processing algorithms for …,Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,70
Hybrid indoor positioning with wi-fi and bluetooth: Architecture and performance,Artur Baniukevic; Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu,Reliable indoor positioning is an important foundation for emerging indoor location basedservices. Most existing indoor positioning proposals rely on a single wireless technology; eg;Wi-Fi; Bluetooth; or RFID. A hybrid positioning system combines such technologies andachieves better positioning accuracy by exploiting the different capabilities of the differenttechnologies. In a hybrid system based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth; the former works as the maininfrastructure to enable fingerprint based positioning; while the latter (via hotspot devices)partitions the indoor space as well as a large Wi-Fi radio map. As a result; the Wi-Fi basedonline position estimation is improved in a divide-and-conquer manner. We study threeaspects of such a hybrid indoor positioning system. First; to avoid large positioning errorscaused by similar reference positions that are hard to distinguish; we design a …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,67
Two ellipse-based pruning methods for group nearest neighbor queries,Hongga Li; Hua Lu; Bo Huang; Zhiyong Huang,Abstract Group nearest neighbor (GNN) queries are a relatively new type of operations inspatial database applications. Different from a traditional kNN query which specifies a singlequery point only; a GNN query has multiple query points. Because of the number of querypoints and their arbitrary distribution in the data space; a GNN query is much more complexthan a kNN query. In this paper; we propose two pruning strategies for GNN queries whichtake into account the distribution of query points. Our methods employ an ellipse toapproximate the extent of multiple query points; and then derive a distance or minimumbounding rectangle (MBR) using that ellipse to prune intermediate nodes in a depth-firstsearch via an R $^* $-tree. These methods are also applicable to the best-first traversalparadigm. We conduct extensive performance studies. The results show that the …,Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international workshop on Geographic information systems,2005,66
Improving Wi-Fi Based Indoor Positioning Using Bluetooth Add-Ons,Artur Baniukevic; Dovydas Sabonis; Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu,Location-Based Services (LBSs) constitutes one of the most popular classes of mobileservices. However; while current LBSs typically target outdoor settings; we lead large partsof our lives indoors. The availability of easy-to-use and low-cost indoor positioning servicesis essential in also enabling indoor LBSs. Existing indoor positioning services typically use asingle technology such as Wi-Fi; RFID or Bluetooth. Wi-Fi based indoor positioning isrelatively easy to deploy; but does often not offer good positioning accuracy. In contrast; theuse of RFID or Bluetooth for positioning requires considerable investments in equipment inorder to ensure good positioning accuracy. Motivated by these observations; we propose ahybrid approach to indoor positioning. In particular; we introduce Bluetooth hotspots into anindoor space with an existing Wi-Fi infrastructure such that better positioning is achieved …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2011 12th IEEE International Conference on,2011,55
Indoor—A New Data Management Frontier,Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Bin Yang,Abstract Much research has been conducted on the management of outdoor moving objects.In contrast; relatively little research has been conducted on indoor moving objects. Theindoor setting differs from outdoor settings in important ways; including the following two.First; indoor spaces exhibit complex topologies. They are composed of entities that areunique to indoor settings; eg; rooms and hallways that are connected by doors. As a result;conventional Euclidean distance and spatial network distance are inapplicable in indoorspaces. Second; accurate; GPS-like positioning is typically unavailable in indoor spaces.Rather; positioning is achieved through the use of technologies such as Bluetooth; Infrared;RFID; or Wi-Fi. This typically results in much less reliable and accurate positioning. Thispaper covers some preliminary research that explicitly targets an indoor setting …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull,2010,53
A unified model for stable and temporal topic detection from social media data,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Hua Lu; Yuxin Huang; Junjie Yao,Web 2.0 users generate and spread huge amounts of messages in online social media.Such user-generated contents are mixture of temporal topics (eg; breaking events) andstable topics (eg; user interests). Due to their different natures; it is important and useful todistinguish temporal topics from stable topics in social media. However; such adiscrimination is very challenging because the user-generated texts in social media are veryshort in length and thus lack useful linguistic features for precise analysis using traditionalapproaches. In this paper; we propose a novel solution to detect both stable and temporaltopics simultaneously from social media data. Specifically; a unified user-temporal mixturemodel is proposed to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics. To improve this model'sperformance; we design a regularization framework that exploits prior spatial information …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,51
Discovering strong skyline points in high dimensional spaces,Zhenjie Zhang; Xinyu Guo; Hua Lu; Anthony KH Tung; Nan Wang,Abstract Current interests in skyline computation arise due to their relation to preferencequeries. Since it is guaraneed that a skyline point will not lose out in all dimensions whencompared to any other point in the data set; this means that for each skyline point; thereexists a set of weight assignments to the dimensions such that the point will become the topuser preference. We believe that the usefulness of skyline points is not limited to suchapplication and can be extended to data analysis and knowledge discovery as well.However; since the skyline of high dimensional datasets (which are common in dataanalysis applications) can contain too many points; various means must be developed tofilter off the less interesting skyline points in high dimensions. In this paper; we will proposealgorithms to find a set of interesting skyline points called strong skyline points.

iSky: Efficient and progressive skyline computing in a structured P2P network,Lijiang Chen; Bin Cui; Hua Lu; Linhao Xu; Quanqing Xu,An interesting problem in peer-based data management is efficient support for skylinequeries within a multiattribute space. A skyline query retrieves from a set of multidimensionaldata points a subset of interesting points; compared to which no other points are better.Skyline queries play an important role in multi-criteria decision making and user preferenceapplications. In this paper; we address the skyline computing problem in a structured P2Pnetwork. We exploit the iMinMax (θ) transformation to map high-dimensional data points to 1-dimensional values. All transformed data points are then distributed on a structured P2Pnetwork called BATON; where all peers are virtually organized as a balanced binary searchtree. Subsequently; a progressive algorithm is proposed to compute skyline in the distributedP2P network. Further; we propose an adaptive skyline filtering technique to reduce both …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008. ICDCS'08. The 28th International Conference on,2008,49
Constrained skyline query processing against distributed data sites,Lijiang Chen; Bin Cui; Hua Lu,The skyline of a multidimensional point set is a subset of interesting points that are notdominated by others. In this paper; we investigate constrained skyline queries in a large-scale unstructured distributed environment; where relevant data are distributed amonggeographically scattered sites. We first propose a partition algorithm that divides all datasites into incomparable groups such that the skyline computations in all groups can beparallelized without changing the final result. We then develop a novel algorithm frameworkcalled PaDSkyline for parallel skyline query processing among partitioned site groups. Wealso employ intragroup optimization and multifiltering technique to improve the skyline queryprocesses within each group. In particular; multiple (local) skyline points are sent togetherwith the query as filtering points; which help identify unqualified local skyline points early …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,47
Efficient Skyline Computation in MapReduce.,Kasper Mullesgaard; Jens Laurits Pederseny; Hua Lu; Yongluan Zhou,ABSTRACT Skyline queries are useful for finding interesting tuples from a large data setaccording to multiple criteria. The sizes of data sets are constantly increasing and thearchitecture of back-ends are switching from single-node environments to non-conventionalparadigms like MapReduce. Despite the usefulness of skyline queries; existing works onskyline computation in MapReduce do not take full advantage of parallelism but still runsignificant parts serially. In this paper; we propose a novel approach to compute skylinesefficiently in MapReduce. We design a grid partitioning scheme to divide the data space intopartitions; and employ a bitstring to represent the partitions. The bitstring is efficientlyobtained in MapReduce; and it clearly helps prune partitions (and tuples) that cannot haveskyline tuples. Based on the grid partitioning; we propose two MapReduce algorithms to …,EDBT,2014,45
Location privacy techniques in client-server architectures,Christian Jensen; Hua Lu; Man Yiu,Abstract A typical location-based service returns nearby points of interest in response to auser location. As such services are becoming increasingly available and popular; locationprivacy emerges as an important issue. In a system that does not offer location privacy; usersmust disclose their exact locations in order to receive the desired services. We view locationprivacy as an enabling technology that may lead to increased use of location-basedservices. In this chapter; we consider location privacy techniques that work in traditionalclient-server architectures without any trusted components other than the client's mobiledevice. Such techniques have important advantages. First; they are relatively easy toimplement because they do not rely on any trusted third-party components. Second; theyhave potential for wide application; as the client-server architecture remains dominant for …,Privacy in Location-Based Applications,2009,45
A foundation for efficient indoor distance-aware query processing,Hua Lu; Xin Cao; Christian S Jensen,Indoor spaces accommodate large numbers of spatial objects; eg; points of interest (POIs);and moving populations. A variety of services; eg; location-based services and securitycontrol; are relevant to indoor spaces. Such services can be improved substantially if theyare capable of utilizing indoor distances. However; existing indoor space models do notaccount well for indoor distances. To address this shortcoming; we propose a datamanagement infrastructure that captures indoor distance and facilitates distance-awarequery processing. In particular; we propose a distance-aware indoor space model thatintegrates indoor distance seamlessly. To enable the use of the model as a foundation forquery processing; we develop accompanying; efficient algorithms that compute indoordistances for different indoor entities like doors as well as locations.

Scalable continuous range monitoring of moving objects in symbolic indoor space,Bin Yang; Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Indoor spaces accommodate large populations of individuals. The continuousrange monitoring of such objects can be used as a foundation for a wide variety ofapplications; eg; space planning; way finding; and security. Indoor space differs fromoutdoor space in that symbolic locations; eg; rooms; rather than Euclidean positions orspatial network locations are important. In addition; positioning based on presence sensingdevices; rather than; eg; GPS; is assumed. Such devices report the objects in their activationranges. We propose an incremental; query-aware continuous range query processingtechnique for objects moving in this setting. A set of critical devices is determined for eachquery; and only the observations from those devices are used to continuously maintain thequery result. Due to the limitations of the positioning devices; queries contain certain and …,Proceeding of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,44
Design and analysis of a ranking approach to private location-based services,Man Lung Yiu; Christian S Jensen; Jesper Møller; Hua Lu,Abstract Users of mobile services wish to retrieve nearby points of interest without disclosingtheir locations to the services. This article addresses the challenge of optimizing the queryperformance while satisfying given location privacy and query accuracy requirements. Thearticle's proposal; SpaceTwist; aims to offer location privacy for k nearest neighbor (kNN)queries at low communication cost without requiring a trusted anonymizer. The solution canbe used with a conventional DBMS as well as with a server optimized for location-basedservices. In particular; we believe that this is the first solution that expresses the server-sidefunctionality in a single SQL statement. In its basic form; SpaceTwist utilizes well-knownincremental NN query processing on the server. When augmented with a server-sidegranular search technique; SpaceTwist is capable of exploiting relaxed query accuracy …,ACM TODS,2011,43
Ranking spatial data by quality preferences,M Yiu; Hua Lu; Nikos Mamoulis; Michail Vaitis,A spatial preference query ranks objects based on the qualities of features in their spatialneighborhood. For example; using a real estate agency database of flats for lease; acustomer may want to rank the flats with respect to the appropriateness of their location;defined after aggregating the qualities of other features (eg; restaurants; cafes; hospital;market; etc.) within their spatial neighborhood. Such a neighborhood concept can bespecified by the user via different functions. It can be an explicit circular region within a givendistance from the flat. Another intuitive definition is to assign higher weights to the featuresbased on their proximity to the flat. In this paper; we formally define spatial preferencequeries and propose appropriate indexing techniques and search algorithms for them.Extensive evaluation of our methods on both real and synthetic data reveals that an …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2011,40
S-GRID: A versatile approach to efficient query processing in spatial networks,Xuegang Huang; Christian Jensen; Hua Lu; Simonas Šaltenis,Abstract Mobile services is emerging as an important application area for spatio-temporaldatabase management technologies. Service users are often constrained to a spatialnetwork; eg; a road network; through which points of interest; termed data points; areaccessible. Queries that implement services will often concern data points of some specifictype; eg; Thai restaurants or art museums. As a result; the relatively few data points arerelevant to a query in comparison to the number of network edges; meaning that queries; eg;k nearest-neighbor queries; must access large portions of the network. Existing queryprocessing techniques pre-compute distances between data points and network vertices forimproving the performance. However; pre-computation becomes problematic when thenetwork or data points must be updated; possibly concurrently with the querying; and if …,Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,38
Spatio-temporal joins on symbolic indoor tracking data,Hua Lu; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,To facilitate a variety of applications; positioning systems are deployed in indoor settings.For example; Bluetooth and RFID positioning are deployed in airports to support real-timemonitoring of delays as well as off-line flow and space usage analyses. Such deploymentsgenerate large collections of tracking data. Like in other data management applications;joins are indispensable in this setting. However; joins on indoor tracking data call for noveltechniques that take into account the limited capabilities of the positioning systems as wellas the specifics of indoor spaces. This paper proposes and studies probabilistic; spatio-temporal joins on historical indoor tracking data. Two meaningful types of join are defined.They return object pairs that satisfy spatial join predicates either at a time point or during atime interval. The predicates considered include “same X;” where X is a semantic region …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,30
An RFID and particle filter-based indoor spatial query evaluation system,Jiao Yu; Wei-Shinn Ku; Min-Te Sun; Hua Lu,Abstract People spend a significant amount of time in indoor spaces (eg; office buildings;subway systems; etc.) in their daily lives. Therefore; it is important to develop efficient indoorspatial query algorithms for supporting various location-based applications. However; indoorspaces differ from outdoor spaces because users have to follow the indoor floor plan for theirmovements. In addition; positioning in indoor environments is mainly based on sensingdevices (eg; RFID readers) rather than GPS devices. Consequently; we cannot applyexisting spatial query evaluation techniques devised for outdoor environments for this newchallenge. Because particle filters can be employed to estimate the state of a system thatchanges over time using a sequence of noisy measurements made on the system; in thisresearch; we propose the particle filter-based location inference method as the basis for …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,29
Efficient skyline computation in structured peer-to-peer systems,Bin Cui; Lijiang Chen; Linhao Xu; Hua Lu; Guojie Song; Quanqing Xu,An increasing number of large-scale applications exploit peer-to-peer network architectureto provide highly scalable and flexible services. Among these applications; datamanagement in peer-to-peer systems is one of the interesting domains. In this paper; weinvestigate the multidimensional skyline computation problem on a structured peer-to-peernetwork. In order to achieve low communication cost and quick response time; we utilize theiMinMax (\theta) method to transform high-dimensional data to one-dimensional value anddistribute the data in a structured peer-to-peer network called BATON. Thereafter; wepropose a progressive algorithm with adaptive filter technique for efficient skylinecomputation in this environment. We further discuss some optimization techniques for thealgorithm; and summarize the key principles of our algorithm into a query routing protocol …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,28
Finding top-k local users in geo-tagged social media data,Jinling Jiang; Hua Lu; Bin Yang; Bin Cui,Social network platforms and location-based services are increasingly popular in people'sdaily lives. The combination of them results in location-based social media where peopleare connected not only through the friendship in the social network but also by theirgeographical locations in reality. This duality makes it possible to query and make use ofsocial media data in novel ways. In this work; we formulate a novel and useful problemcalled top-k local user search (TkLUS for short) from tweets with geo-tags. Given a locationq; a distance r; and a set of keywords W; the TkLUS query finds the top-k users who haveposted tweets relevant to the desired keywords in W at a place within the distance r from q.TkLUS queries are useful in many application scenarios such as friend recommendation;spatial decision; etc. We design a set of techniques to answer such queries efficiently …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,25
Flexible and Efficient Resolution of Skyline Query Size Constraints,Hua Lu; C Jensen; Zhenjie Zhang,Given a set of multidimensional points; a skyline query returns the interesting points that arenot dominated by other points. It has been observed that the actual cardinality (s) of a skylinequery result may differ substantially from the desired result cardinality (k); which hasprompted studies on how to reduce s for the case where k<; s. This paper goes further byaddressing the general case where the relationship between k and s is not knownbeforehand. Due to their complexity; the existing pointwise ranking and set-widemaximization techniques are not well suited for this problem. Moreover; the former oftenincurs too many ties in its ranking; and the latter is inapplicable for k>; s. Based on theseobservations; the paper proposes a new approach; called skyline ordering; that forms askyline-based partitioning of a given data set such that an order exists among the …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2010,25
City-scale social event detection and evaluation with taxi traces,Wangsheng Zhang; Guande Qi; Gang Pan; Hua Lu; Shijian Li; Zhaohui Wu,Abstract A social event is an occurrence that involves lots of people and is accompanied byan obvious rise in human flow. Analysis of social events has real-world importance becauseevents bring about impacts on many aspects of city life. Traditionally; detection and impactmeasurement of social events rely on social investigation; which involves considerablehuman effort. Recently; by analyzing messages in social networks; researchers can alsodetect and evaluate country-scale events. Nevertheless; the analysis of city-scale events hasnot been explored. In this article; we use human flow dynamics; which reflect the socialactiveness of a region; to detect social events and measure their impacts. We first extracthuman flow dynamics from taxi traces.

Efficient distance-aware query evaluation on indoor moving objects,Xike Xie; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Indoor spaces accommodate large parts of people's life. The increasing availability of indoorpositioning; driven by technologies like Wi-Fi; RFID; and Bluetooth; enables a variety ofindoor location-based services (LBSs). Efficient indoor distance-aware queries on indoormoving objects play an important role in supporting and boosting such LBSs. However; thedistance-aware query evaluation on indoor moving objects is challenging because:(1)indoor spaces are characterized by many special entities and thus render distancecalculation very complex;(2) the limitations of indoor positioning technologies createinherent uncertainties in indoor moving objects data.

Understanding the meaning of a shifted sky: a general framework on extending skyline query,Zhenjie Zhang; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Skyline queries are often used on data sets in multi-dimensional space for manydecision-making applications. Traditionally; an object p is said to dominate another object qif; for all dimensions; it is no worse than q and is better on at least one dimension. Therefore;the skyline of a data set consists of all objects not dominated by any other object. To bettercater to application requirements such as controlling the size of the skyline or handling datasets that are not well-structured; various works have been proposed to extend the definitionof skyline based on variants of the dominance relationship. In view of the proliferation ofvariants; in this paper; a generalized framework is proposed to guide the extension ofskyline query from conventional definition to different variants.

Efficient and scalable continuous skyline monitoring in two-tier streaming settings,Hua Lu; Yongluan Zhou; Jonas Haustad,Abstract Two-tier streaming settings are a typical dynamic environment where continuousskylines represent an important semantic indicator for multiple attributes. To monitor skylinesover the dynamic data in such settings; one needs to continuously update the skyline queryresults in order to reflect the new data values. This paper tackles the problem of continuousskyline monitoring on a central query server over dynamic data from multiple data sites.Simply sending the updates of tuple values to the server is cost-prohibitive. Therefore; wepropose an approach that allows the central server to collaborate with the data sites tomonitor the possible skyline changes. By doing so; the processing load is distributed over allthe data sites instead of only on the central server. Furthermore; this collaborative approachminimizes the bandwidth consumption between the server and the data sites; which is …,Information Systems,2013,22
Efficient spatial keyword search in trajectory databases,Gao Cong; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Dongxiang Zhang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: An increasing amount of trajectory data is being annotated with text descriptions tobetter capture the semantics associated with locations. The fusion of spatial locations andtext descriptions in trajectories engenders a new type of top-$ k $ queries that take intoaccount both aspects. Each trajectory in consideration consists of a sequence of geo-spatiallocations associated with text descriptions. Given a user location $\lambda $ and a keywordset $\psi $; a top-$ k $ query returns $ k $ trajectories whose text descriptions cover thekeywords $\psi $ and that have the shortest match distance. To the best of our knowledge;previous research on querying trajectory databases has focused on trajectory data withoutany text description; and no existing work has studied such kind of top-$ k $ queries ontrajectories.

KSQ: Top-k similarity query on uncertain trajectories,Chunyang Ma; Hua Lu; Lidan Shou; Gang Chen,Similarity search on spatiotemporal trajectories has a wide range of applications. Most ofexisting research focuses on certain trajectories. However; trajectories often are uncertaindue to various factors; for example; hardware limitations and privacy concerns. In this paper;we introduce p-distance; a novel and adaptive measure that is able to quantify thedissimilarity between two uncertain trajectories. Based on this measure of dissimilarity; wedefine top-k similarity query (KSQ) on uncertain trajectories. A KSQ returns the k trajectoriesthat are most similar to a given trajectory in terms of p-distance. To process such queriesefficiently; we design UTgrid for indexing uncertain trajectories and develop queryprocessing algorithms that make use of UTgrid for effective pruning. We conduct anextensive experimental study on both synthetic and real data sets. The results indicate …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,18
Spatiotemporal data cleansing for indoor RFID tracking data,Asif Iqbal Baba; Hua Lu; Xike Xie; Torben Bach Pedersen,The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is increasingly being deployed in indoor trackingsystems; eg; airport baggage monitoring. However; the “dirtiness” in raw RFID readingshinder the progress of applying meaningful high level applications that range frommonitoring to analysis. Hence; it is indispensable to cleansing RFID data in such systems. Inthis paper; we focus on two quality aspects in raw indoor RFID data: temporal redundancyand spatial ambiguity. The former refers to the large number of repeated readings for thesame object and the same RFID reader during a period of time. The latter refers to theundetermined whereabouts of an object due to multiple readings by different readerssimultaneously.

A data warehouse solution for analyzing rfid-based baggage tracking data,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Hua Lu,Today; airport baggage handling is far from perfect. Baggage goes on the wrong flights; isleft behind; or gets lost; which costs a lot of money for the airlines; as well as frustration forthe passengers. To remedy the situation; we present a data warehouse (DW) solution forstoring and analyzing spatio-temporal Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) baggagetracking data. Analysis of this data can yield interesting results on baggage flow; the causesof baggage mishandling; and the parties responsible for the mishandling (airline; airport;handler;...); which can ultimately lead to improved baggage handling quality.

Planning unobstructed paths in traffic-aware spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Jiajun Liu; Kai Zheng; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Route planning and recommendation have received significant attention in recentyears. In this light; we study a novel problem of planning unobstructed paths in traffic-awarespatial networks (TAUP queries) to avoid potential traffic congestions. We propose twoprobabilistic TAUP queries:(1) a time-threshold query like “what is the path from the check-indesk to the flight SK 1217 with the minimum congestion probability to take at most 45minutes?”; and (2) a probability-threshold query like “what is the fastest path from the check-in desk to the flight SK 1217 whose congestion probability is less than 20%?”. These queriesare mainly motivated by indoor space applications; but are also applicable in outdoorspaces. We believe that these queries are useful in some popular applications; such asplanning unobstructed paths for VIP bags in airports and planning convenient routes for …,GeoInformatica,2015,13
Web phishing detection based on page spatial layout similarity,Weifeng Zhang; Hua Lu; Baowen Xu; Hongji Yang,Abstract Web phishing is becoming an increasingly severe security threat in the webdomain. Effective and efficient phishing detection is very important for protecting web usersfrom loss of sensitive private information and even personal properties. One of the keys ofphishing detection is to efficiently search the legitimate web page library and to find thosepage that are the most similar to a suspicious phishing page. Most existing phishingdetection methods are focused on text and/or image features and have paid very limitedattention to spatial layout characteristics of web pages. In this paper; we propose a novelphishing detection method that makes use of the informative spatial layout characteristics ofweb pages. In particular; we develop two different options to extract the spatial layoutfeatures as rectangle blocks from a given web page. Given two web pages; with their …,Informatica,2013,13
Handling false negatives in indoor RFID data,Asif Iqbal Baba; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Xike Xie,The Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is a useful technology for object tracking andmonitoring systems in indoor environments; eg; Airport baggage tracking. Nevertheless; thedata produced by RFID tracking is inherently uncertain and contains errors. In order tosupport meaningful high-level applications including queries and analyses over RFID data;it is necessary to cleanse raw RFID data. In this paper; we focus on false negatives in rawindoor RFID tracking data. False negatives occur when a moving object passes thedetection range of an RFID reader but the reader fails to produce any readings. Weinvestigate the topology of indoor spaces as well as the deployment of RFID readers; andpropose the transition probabilities that capture how likely objects move from one RFIDreader to another. We organize such probabilities; together with the characteristics of …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,12
Identifying Typical Movements among Indoor Objects--Concepts and Empirical Study,Laura Radaelli; Dovydas Sabonis; Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen,With the proliferation of mobile computing; positioning systems are becoming available thatenable indoor location-based services. As a result; indoor tracking data is also becomingavailable. This paper puts focus on one use of such data; namely the identification of typicalmovement patterns among indoor moving objects. Specifically; the paper presents a methodfor the identification of movement patterns. Leveraging concepts from sequential patternmining; the method takes into account the specifics of spatial movement and; in particular;the specifics of tracking data that captures indoor movement. For example; the paper'sproposal supports spatial aggregation and utilizes the topology of indoor spaces to achievebetter performance. The paper reports on empirical studies with real and synthetic data thatoffer insights into the functional and computational aspects of its proposal.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,12
C-Cube: Elastic continuous clustering in the cloud,Zhenjie Zhang; Hu Shu; Zhihong Chong; Hua Lu; Yin Yang,Continuous clustering analysis over a data stream reports clustering results incrementally asupdates arrive. Such analysis has a wide spectrum of applications; including trafficmonitoring and topic discovery on microblogs. A common characteristic of streamingapplications is that the amount of workload fluctuates; often in an unpredictable manner. Onthe other hand; most existing solutions for continuous clustering assume either a centralserver; or a distributed setting with a fixed number of dedicated servers. In other words; theyare not ELASTIC; meaning that they cannot dynamically adapt to the amount ofcomputational resources to the fluctuating workload. Consequently; they incur considerablewaste of resources; as the servers are under-utilized when the amount of workload is low.This paper proposes C-Cube; the first elastic approach to continuous streaming clustering …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,12
Scalable evaluation of trajectory queries over imprecise location data,Xike Xie; Man L Yiu; Reynold Cheng; Hua Lu,Trajectory queries; which retrieve nearby objects for every point of a given route; can beused to identify alerts of potential threats along a vessel route; or monitor the adjacentrescuers to a travel path. However; the locations of these objects (eg; threats; succours) maynot be precisely obtained due to hardware limitations of measuring devices; as well ascomplex natures of the surroundings. For such data; we consider a common model; wherethe possible locations of an object are bounded by a closed region; called “impreciseregion”. Ignoring or coarsely wrapping imprecision can render low query qualities; andcause undesirable consequences such as missing alerts of threats and poor responserescue time. Also; the query is quite time-consuming; since all points on the trajectory areconsidered. In this paper; we study how to efficiently evaluate trajectory queries over …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,11
Managing evolving uncertainty in trajectory databases,Hoyoung Jeung; Hua Lu; Saket Sathe; Man Lung Yiu,Modern positioning technologies enable collecting trajectories from moving objects acrossdifferent locations over time; typically containing time-varying measurement errors ofpositioning systems. Unfortunately; current models on uncertain trajectories are incapable ofcapturing dynamically changing uncertainty in trajectory data; and lack the support of recentprogress made in improving localization accuracy. In order to tackle these problems; weaddress three important issues centric to uncertain trajectory management. First; we proposea flexible trajectory modeling approach that takes into account model-inferred actualpositions; time-varying uncertainty; and nondeterministic uncertainty ranges. Second; wedevelop three estimators that effectively infer evolving densities of trajectory data. Last; wepresent an efficient mechanism to evaluate probabilistic range queries on those evolving …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,11
On Computing Farthest Dominated Locations,Hua Lu; M Yiu,In reality; spatial objects (eg; hotels) not only have spatial locations but also have qualityattributes (eg; price; star). An object p is said to dominate another one p'; if p is no worsethan p'with respect to every quality attribute and p is better on at least one quality attribute.Traditional spatial queries (eg; nearest neighbor; closest pair) ignore quality attributes;whereas conventional dominance-based queries (eg; skyline) neglect spatial locations.Motivated by these observations; we propose a novel query by combining spatial and qualityattributes together meaningfully. Given a set of (competitors') spatial objects P; a set of(candidate) locations L; and a quality vector ψ as design competence (for L); the farthestdominated location (FDL) query retrieves the location s∈ L such that the distance to itsnearest dominating object in P is maximized. FDL queries are suitable for various spatial …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2011,11
Continuous skyline monitoring over distributed data streams,Hua Lu; Yongluan Zhou; Jonas Haustad,Abstract To monitor skylines over dynamic data; one needs to continuously update theskyline query results in order to reflect the new data values. This paper tackles the problemof continuous skyline monitoring on a central query server over dynamic data from multipledata sites. Simply sending the updates of tuple values to the server is cost-prohibitive.Therefore; we propose an approach where the central server collaborates with the data sitesto monitor the possible skyline changes. By doing so; the processing load is distributed overall the nodes instead of only on the central server. Furthermore; the approach can minimizethe bandwidth consumption between the server and the data sites; which is often critical in awidely distributed environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal isefficient and effective.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2010,11
Finding dense locations in indoor tracking data,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Hua Lu,Finding the dense locations in large indoor spaces is very useful for getting overloadedlocations; security; crowd management; indoor navigation; and guidance. Indoor trackingdata can be very large and are not readily available for finding dense locations. This paperpresents a graph-based model for semi-constrained indoor movement; and then uses this tomap raw tracking records into mapping records representing object entry and exit times inparticular locations. Then; an efficient indexing structure; the Dense Location Time Index(DLT-Index) is proposed for indexing the time intervals of the mapping table; along withassociated construction; query processing; and pruning techniques. The DLT-Index supportsvery efficient aggregate point queries; interval queries; and dense location queries.

Collaborative spatial data sharing among mobile lightweight devices,Zhiyong Huang; Christian Jensen; Hua Lu; Beng Ooi,Abstract Mobile devices are increasingly being equipped with wireless peer-to-peer (P2P)networking interfaces; rendering the sharing of data among mobile devices feasible andbeneficial. In comparison to the traditional client/server wireless channel; the P2P channelshave considerably higher bandwidth. Motivated by these observations; we propose acollaborative spatial data sharing scheme that exploits the P2P capabilities of mobiledevices. Using carefully maintained routing tables; this scheme enables mobile devices notonly to use their local storage for query processing; but also to collaborate with nearbymobile peers to exploit their data. This scheme is capable of reducing the cost of thecommunication between mobile clients and the server as well as the query response time.The paper details the design of the data sharing scheme; including its routing table …,Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,10
Capturing hotspots for constrained indoor movement,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Hua Lu,Abstract Finding the hotspots in large indoor spaces is very important for getting overloadedlocations; security; crowd management; indoor navigation and guidance. The tracking datacoming from indoor tracking are huge in volume and not readily available for findinghotspots. This paper presents a graph-based model for constrained indoor movement thatcan map the tracking records into mapping records which represent the entry and exit timesof an object in a particular location. Then it discusses the hotspots extraction technique fromthe mapping records.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2013,8
Finding traffic-aware fastest paths in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Xike Xie,Abstract Route planning and recommendation have received significant attention in recentyears. In this light; we propose and investigate the novel problem of finding traffic-awarefastest paths (TAFP query) in spatial networks by considering the related traffic conditions.Given a sequence of user specified intended places O q and a departure time t; TAFP findsthe fastest path connecting O q in order to guarantee that moving objects (eg; travelers andbags) can arrive at the destination in time. This type of query is mainly motivated by indoorspace applications; but is also applicable in outdoor space; and we believe that it may bringimportant benefits to users in many popular applications; such as tracking VIP bags inairports and recommending convenient routes to travelers. TAFP is challenged by twodifficulties:(i) how to model the traffic awareness practically; and (ii) how to evaluate TAFP …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,8
Modeling of traffic-aware travel time in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Xike Xie,Route evaluation and optimization have received significant attention in recent years. In thislight; we propose and investigate a novel problem of estimating the travel time (TTE query)for a user specified path by considering the related traffic conditions. Given a query path anda departure time; TTE query finds the estimated travel time along this path. We believe thatthis type of query may bring important benefits to users in many popular applications; suchas travel route evaluation and optimization; and route planning and recommendation. Toaddress the TTE problem in a convincing approach; we construct a traffic-aware spatialnetwork G pt (V; E) by analysing uncertain trajectory data of moving objects. Based on G pt(V; E); we define two novel types of TTE queries: TTE ep for an exact query path; and TTE lpfor a loose query path.

Upgrading uncompetitive products economically,Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen,The skyline of a multidimensional point set consists of the points that are not dominated byother points. In a scenario where product features are represented by multidimensionalpoints; the skyline points may be viewed as representing competitive products. A productprovider may wish to upgrade uncompetitive products to become competitive; but wants totake into account the upgrading cost. We study the top-k product upgrading problem. Givena set P of competitor products; a set T of products that are candidates for upgrade; and anupgrading cost function f that applies to T; the problem is to return the k products in T thatcan be upgraded to not be dominated by any products in P at the lowest cost. This problemis non-trivial due to not only the large data set sizes; but also to the many possibilities forupgrading a product.

Finding Frequently Visited Indoor POIs Using Symbolic Indoor Tracking Data.,Hua Lu; Chenjuan Guo; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT Indoor tracking data is being amassed due to the deployment of indoorpositioning technologies. Analysing such data discloses useful insights that are otherwisehard to obtain. For example; by studying tracking data from an airport; we can identify theshops and restaurants that are most popular among passengers. In this paper; we study twoquery types for finding frequently visited Points of Interest (POIs) from symbolic indoortracking data. The snapshot query finds those POIs that were most frequently visited at agiven time point; whereas the interval query finds such POIs for a given time interval. Atypical example of symbolic tracking is RFID-based tracking; where an object with an RFIDtag is detected by an RFID reader when the object is in the reader's detection range.

A journey from IFC files to indoor navigation,Mikkel Boysen; Christian de Haas; Hua Lu; Xike Xie,Abstract In many scenarios; people have to walk through unfamiliar indoor spaces such aslarge airports; office buildings; commercial centers; etc. As a result; indoor navigation is ofrealistic importance and great potential. Existing indoor space models for indoor navigationassume that relevant indoor space information is already available and precise in the model-specific format (s). However; such information; eg; indoor topology that is indispensable toindoor navigation; is only implicitly (and even imprecisely) hidden in industry standards likethe Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) that describe building projects. This paper ismotivated to bridge the apparent gap between industry standards and indoor navigation. Inparticular; we propose an effective method to construct indoor topology by carefullyprocessing IFC files. We also refine an existing method that decomposes large and/or …,International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems,2014,7
A graph model for false negative handling in indoor RFID tracking data,Asif Iqbal Baba; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Xike Xie,Abstract The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) emerges to be one of the keytechnologies to modernize object tracking and monitoring systems in indoor environments;eg; airport baggage tracking. Although RFID has advantages over alternative identificationtechnologies; the raw RFID data produced is inherently uncertain and contains errors. Thedirty nature of raw RFID data hinders the progress of applying meaningful high-levelapplications that range from querying to analyzing. Therefore; cleansing RFID data is a highnecessity. In this paper; we focus on handling one of the main aspects of raw RFID data;namely; false negatives; which occurs when a moving object passes the detection range ofan RFID reader but the reader fails to produce any readings.

Vip-tree: an effective index for indoor spatial queries,Zhou Shao; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; David Taniar; Hua Lu,Abstract Due to the growing popularity of indoor location-based services; indoor datamanagement has received significant research attention in the past few years. However; weobserve that the existing indexing and query processing techniques for the indoor space donot fully exploit the properties of the indoor space. Consequently; they provide below parperformance which makes them unsuitable for large indoor venues with high queryworkloads. In this paper; we propose two novel indexes called Indoor Partitioning Tree (IP-Tree) and Vivid IP-Tree (VIP-Tree) that are carefully designed by utilizing the properties ofindoor venues. The proposed indexes are lightweight; have small pre-processing cost andprovide near-optimal performance for shortest distance and shortest path queries.

Constructing indoor navigation systems from digital building information,Mikkel Boysen; Christian de Haas; Hua Lu; Xike Xie; Aiste Pilvinyte,Indoor navigation is very useful in reality. An indoor navigation system requires anappropriate indoor model that represents the indoor space entities as well as topology andsupports indoor distance computation. Indoor distance computation differs significantly fromits outdoor counterpart; due to the indoor space characteristics. On the other hand;information about an indoor space is described in digital building information (DBI) formatslike the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). In such formats; geometric representation ofentities is the focus but the topology is only implicit or even incomplete. Thus; constructingindoor navigation systems faces two major technical challenges: 1) indoor distancecomputation; 2) indoor space model creation from raw DBI. This paper presents a prototypesystem that addresses these two challenges. The system provides functions to process …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,6
Towards a unified model of outdoor and indoor spaces,Sari Haj Hussein; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Geographic information systems traditionally dealt with only outdoor spaces. Inrecent years; indoor spatial information systems have started to attract attention partly due tothe increasing use of receptor devices (eg; RFID readers or wireless sensor networks) inboth outdoor and indoor spaces. Applications that employ these devices are expected tospan uniformly and supply seamless functionality in both outdoor and indoor spaces. Whatmakes this impossible is the current absence of a unified account of these two types ofspaces both in terms of modeling and reasoning about the models. This paper presents aunified model of outdoor and indoor spaces and receptor deployments in these spaces. Themodel is expressive; flexible; and invariant to the segmentation of a space plan; and thereceptor deployment policy. It is focused on partially constrained outdoor and indoor …,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,6
Snapshot density queries on location sensors,Xuegang Huang; Hua Lu,Abstract Density queries are of practical importance in many mobility related applications. Inthis paper; we employ the location sensors; which are placed in a geographical area andcan only detect the amount of objects moving in vicinity; to estimate the dense regions ofobjects. Our approach partitions the region of interest into subregions; and deploys in eachsubregion both location sensors and a processing node that issues and answers densityqueries. Three algorithms are proposed to process density queries on those processingnodes. Their accuracy and efficiency are empirically evaluated.,Proceedings of the 6th ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2007,6
Top-k neighborhood dominating query,Xike Xie; Hua Lu; Jinchuan Chen; Shuo Shang,Abstract In many real-life applications; spatial objects are associated with multiple non-spatial attributes. For example; a hotel may have price and rating in addition to itsgeographic location. In traditional spatial databases; spatial objects are often ranked solelybased on their distance to a given query location; eg; in a nearest neighbor search. Inanother line of research; domination based skyline queries are used to return best objectsaccording to multi-criteria on non-spatial attributes. In this paper; we study how to rankspatial objects with respect to their non-spatial attributes within their spatial neighborhoods.To enable a general ranking; we design a ranking function that inherits the advantages ofdominance relationship and integrates them with spatial proximity. Further; we propose aneffective index structure; and a branch and bound solution that executes the ranking …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,5
Distributed; concurrent range monitoring of spatial-network constrained mobile objects,Hua Lu; Zhiyong Huang; Christian Jensen; Linhao Xu,Abstract The ability to continuously monitor the positions of mobile objects is important inmany applications. While most past work has been set in Euclidean spaces; the mobileobjects relevant in many applications are constrained to spatial networks. This paperaddresses the problem of range monitoring of mobile objects in this setting; in which networkdistance is concerned. An architecture is proposed where the mobile clients and a centralserver share computation; the objective being to obtain scalability by utilizing the capabilitiesof the clients. The clients issue location reports to the server; which is in charge of datastoring and query processing. The server associates each range monitoring query with thenetwork-edge portions it covers. This enables incremental maintenance of each query; and italso enables shared maintenance of concurrent queries by identifying the overlaps …,Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,5
Learning-based cleansing for indoor RFID data,Asif Iqbal Baba; Manfred Jaeger; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Wei-Shinn Ku; Xike Xie,Abstract RFID is widely used for object tracking in indoor environments; eg; airport baggagetracking. Analyzing RFID data offers insight into the underlying tracking systems as well asthe associated business processes. However; the inherent uncertainty in RFID data;including noise (cross readings) and incompleteness (missing readings); pose challenges tohigh-level RFID data querying and analysis. In this paper; we address these challenges byproposing a learning-based data cleansing approach that; unlike existing approaches;requires no detailed prior knowledge about the spatio-temporal properties of the indoorspace and the RFID reader deployment. Requiring only minimal information about RFIDdeployment; the approach learns relevant knowledge from raw RFID data and uses it tocleanse the data. In particular; we model raw RFID readings as time series that are …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,4

Typed intervals enrich the data representation and support applications involvingdifferent kinds of intervals. Given a query time and type; the system reports k intervals thatintersect the time; contain the type and have the largest weight. We develop a new structureto manage typed intervals based on the standard interval tree and propose efficient queryalgorithms.

A skylining approach to optimize influence and cost in location selection,Juwei Shi; Hua Lu; Jiaheng Lu; Chengxuan Liao,Abstract Location-selection problem underlines many spatial decision-making applications.In this paper; we study an interesting location-selection problem which can find manyapplications such as banking outlet and hotel locations selections. In particular; given anumber of spatial objects and a set of location candidates; we select some locations whichmaximize the influence but minimize the cost. The influence of a location is defined by thenumber of spatial objects within a given distance; and the cost of a location is indicated bythe minimum payment for such location; which is measured by quality vectors. We show thata straightforward extension of a skyline approach is inefficient; as it needs to compute theinfluence and cost for all the location candidates relying on many expensive range queries.To overcome this weakness; we extend the Branch and Bound Skyline (BBS) method with …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,2

The great indoors: A data management frontier,Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu,Much of the research on data management for moving objects has assumed an outdoorsetting in which objects move in Euclidean space (possibly constrained) or some form ofspatial network and in which GPS or GPS-like positioning is assumed explicitly or implicitly.That body of research provides part of an enabling foundation for the growing Location-Based Services industry. However; we lead large parts of our lives in indoor spaces: homes;office buildings; shopping and leisure facilities; and collective transportation infrastructures.The latter may be large: For example; each day in 2009; London Heathrow Airport; UK hadon average 180;000 passengers; and the Tokyo Subway (Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway);Japan delivered a daily average of 8.7 million passenger rides in 2008.

Top-k Taxi Recommendation in Realtime Social-Aware Ridesharing Services,Xiaoyi Fu; Jinbin Huang; Hua Lu; Jianliang Xu; Yafei Li,Abstract Ridesharing has been becoming increasingly popular in urban areas worldwide forits low cost and environment friendliness. In this paper; we introduce social-awareness intorealtime ridesharing services. In particular; upon receiving a user's trip request; the serviceranks feasible taxis in a way that integrates detour in time and passengers' cohesion insocial distance. We propose a new system framework to support such a social-aware taxi-sharing service. It provides two methods for selecting candidate taxis for a given trip request.The grid-based method quickly goes through available taxis and returns a relatively largercandidate set; whereas the edge-based method takes more time to obtain a smallercandidate set. Furthermore; we design techniques to speed up taxi route scheduling for agiven trip request.

Finding dense locations in symbolic indoor tracking data: modeling; indexing; and processing,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Hua Lu,Abstract Finding the dense locations in large indoor spaces is very useful for manyapplications such as overloaded area detection; security control; crowd management; indoornavigation; and so on. Indoor tracking data can be enormous and are not immediately readyfor finding dense locations. This paper presents two graph-based models for constrainedand semi-constrained indoor movement; respectively; and then uses the models to map rawtracking records into mapping records that represent object entry and exit times in particularlocations. Subsequently; an efficient indexing structure called Hierarchical Dense LocationTime Index (HDLT-Index) is proposed for indexing the time intervals of the mapping table;along with index construction; query processing; and pruning techniques.

Online risk prediction for indoor moving objects,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Toon Calders; Hua Lu,Technologies such as RFID and Bluetooth have received considerable attention for trackingindoor moving objects. In a time-critical indoor tracking scenario such as airport baggagehandling; a bag has to move through a sequence of locations until it is loaded into theaircraft. Inefficiency or inaccuracy at any step can make the bag risky; ie; the bag may bedelayed at the airport or sent to a wrong airport. In this paper; we propose a novelprobabilistic approach for predicting the risk of an indoor moving object in real-time. Wepropose a probabilistic flow graph (PFG) and an aggregated probabilistic flow graph (APFG)that capture the historical object transitions and the durations of the transitions. In thegraphs; the probabilistic information is stored in a set of histograms. Then we use the flowgraphs for obtaining a risk score of an online object and use it for predicting its riskiness …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2016 17th IEEE International Conference on,2016,1

Daisy: the center for data-intensive systems at Aalborg University,Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Simonas Šaltenis; Bent Thomsen; Lone Leth Thomsen; Kristian Torp,The history of the Center for Data-intensive Systems (Daisy)(daisy. aau. dk) at AalborgUniversity dates back to the late 1980'es where Christian S. Jensen was hired as a Ph. D.student and outposted to the University of Maryland. After having graduated in 1991; he washired as an assistant professor and started to build up a database group. The main researchtopic was initially temporal data management [38; 65]; including temporal data models;temporal query languages such as TSQL2; and temporal query processing techniques; inclose collaboration with Richard T. Snodgrass at the University of Arizona. In the mid1990'es; new faculty members and Ph. D. students joined; followed by accelerated growthtowards the end of the 1990'es. During this period; two additional research topics emerged;namely data warehousing/multidimensional databases and spatio-temporal data …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2013,1
Identifying the most influential user preference from an assorted collection,Hua Lu; Linhao Xu,Abstract A conventional skyline query requires no query point; and usually employs a MIN orMAX annotation only to prefer smaller or larger values on each dimension. A relative skylinequery; in contrast; is issued with a combination of a query point and a set of preferenceannotations for all involved dimensions. Due to the relative dominance definition in a relativeskyline query; there exist various such combinations which we call as user preferences. It isalso often interesting to identify from an assorted user preference collection the mostinfluential preference that leads to the largest relative skyline. We call such a problem themost influential preference query. In this paper we propose a complete set of techniques tosolve such novel and useful problems within a uniform framework. We first formalize differentpreference annotations that can be imposed on a dimension by a relative skyline query …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2010,1

Identifying the Most Endangered Objects from Spatial Datasets,Hua Lu; Man Yiu,Abstract Real-life spatial objects are usually described by their geographic locations (eg;longitude and latitude); and multiple quality attributes. Conventionally; spatial data arequeried by two orthogonal aspects: spatial queries involve geographic locations only;skyline queries are used to retrieve those objects that are not dominated by others on allquality attributes. Specifically; an object pi is said to dominate another object pj if pi is noworse than pj on all quality attributes and better than pj on at least one quality attribute. Inthis paper; we study a novel query that combines both aspects meaningfully. Given twospatial datasets P and S; and a neighborhood distance δ; the most endangered object query(MEO) returns the object s∈ S such that within the distance δ from s; the number of objectsin P that dominate s is maximized. MEO queries appropriately capture the needs that …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2009,1
Towards Efficient and Flexible KNN Query Processing in Real-Life Road Networks,Yang Lu; Bin Cui; Jiakui Zhao; Hua Lu; Jialie Shen,Along with the developments of mobile services; effectively modeling road networks andefficiently indexing and querying network constrained objects has become a challengingproblem. In this paper; we first introduce a road network model which captures real-life roadnetworks better than previous models. Then; based on the proposed model; we propose anovel index named the RNG (Road Network Grid) index for accelerating KNN queries andcontinuous KNN queries over road network constrained data points. In contrast toconventional methods; speed limitations and blocking information of roads are included intothe RNG index; which enables the index to support both distance-based and time-basedKNN queries and continuous KNN queries. Our work extends previous ones by taking intoaccount more practical scenarios; such as complexities in real-life road networks and time …,Web-Age Information Management; 2008. WAIM'08.

In Search of Indoor Dense Regions: An Approach Using Indoor Positioning Data,Huan Li; Hua Lu; Lidan Shou; Gang Chen; Ke Chen,As people spend significant parts of daily lives indoors; it is useful and important to measureindoor densities and find the dense regions in many indoor scenarios like spacemanagement and security control. In this paper; we propose a data-driven approach thatfinds top-$ k $ indoor dense regions by using indoor positioning data. Such data is obtainedby indoor positioning systems working at a relatively low frequency; and the reportedlocations in the data are discrete; from a preselected location set that does not continuouslycover the entire indoor space. When a search is triggered; the object positioning informationis already out-of-date and thus object locations are uncertain. To this end; we first integrateobject location uncertainty into the definitions for counting objects in an indoor region andcomputing its density. Subsequently; we conduct a thorough analysis of the location …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2018,*
Efficiently answer top-k queries on typed intervals,Jianqiu Xu; Hua Lu,Abstract Consider a database consisting of a set of tuples; each of which contains aninterval; a type and a weight. These tuples are called typed intervals and used to supportapplications involving diverse intervals. In this paper; we study top-k queries on typedintervals. The query reports k intervals intersecting the query time; containing a particulartype and having the largest weight. The query time can be a point or an interval. Further; wedefine top-k continuous queries that return qualified intervals at each time point during thequery interval. To efficiently answer such queries; a key challenge is to build an indexstructure to manage typed intervals. Employing the standard interval tree; we build thestructure in a compact way to reduce the I/O cost; and provide analytically derivedpartitioning methods to manage the data. Query algorithms are proposed to support point …,Information Systems,2017,*
Risk Detection and Prediction from Indoor Tracking Data,Tanvir Ahmed; Toon Calders; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Technologies such as RFID and Bluetooth have received considerable attention fortracking indoor moving objects. In a time-critical indoor tracking scenario such as airportbaggage handling; a bag has to move through a sequence of locations until it is loaded intothe aircraft. Inefficiency or inaccuracy at any step can make the bag risky; ie; the bag may bedelayed at the airport or sent to a wrong airport. In this paper; we discuss a risk detectionand a risk prediction method for such kinds of indoor moving objects. We propose a datamining methodology for detecting risk factors from RFID baggage tracking data. The factorsshould identify potential issues in the baggage management. The paper presents theessential steps for pre-processing the unprocessed raw tracking data and discusses how todeal with the class imbalance problem present in the data set.

Cleansing indoor RFID tracking data,Asif Iqbal Baba; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Manfred Jaeger,Abstract The Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been increasinglydeployed in indoor environments for object tracking and monitoring. However; the uncertaincharacteristics of RFID data; including noise and incompleteness hinder RFID data queryingand analysis at higher levels. Hence; it is of paramount importance to cleanse the RFID datafor such applications. This paper introduces our comprehensive research on cleansing RFIDdata in indoor settings. We focus on two inherent errors in such RFID data: false positives(unexpected cross readings) and false negatives (missing readings). In our proposed graphmodel based approach; we design a probabilistic distance-aware graph to represent theindoor topology; the deployment of RFID readers and their sensing parameters. We alsoaugment the graph with transition probabilities that capture how likely objects move from …,SIGSPATIAL Special,2017,*
GVoS: A General System for Near-Duplicate Video-Related Applications on Storm,Jiawei Jiang; Yunhai Tong; Hua Lu; Bin Cui; Kai Lei; Lele Yu,Abstract The exponential increase of online videos greatly enriches the life of users but alsobrings huge numbers of near-duplicate videos (NDVs) that seriously challenge the videowebsites. The video websites entail NDV-related applications such as detection of copyrightviolation; video monitoring; video re-ranking; and video recommendation. Since theseapplications adopt different features and different processing procedures due to diversescenarios; constructing separate and special-purpose systems for them incurs considerablecosts on design; implementation; and maintenance. In this article; we propose a generalNDV system on Storm (GVoS)—a popular distributed real-time stream processing platform—to simultaneously support a wide variety of video applications. The generality of GVoS isachieved in two aspects. First; we extract the reusable components from various …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2017,*
Finding Influential Local Users with Similar Interest from Geo-Tagged Social Media Data,Jinling Jiang; Hua Lu; Pengfei Li; Gang Pan; Xike Xie,Geo-tagged social media data provides abundant resources for people in need of localinformation. In this paper; we study how to find the top-k influential local users from geo-tagged social media data who have interests similar to a query. Such local users can be ofparticular importance for a variety of activities from events organizing to online advertising.We formulate the problem as Top-k Influential Similar Local Query (TkISL) and provide acomplete set of techniques for solving it. To effectively manage the social media users; wedesign three hybrid user profiling techniques; an indexing tree; and an upper bound query-user similarity that enables efficient pruning in query processing. To process TkISL queries;we propose a baseline method and a more efficient improved method. The former directlyuses the indexing tree and the upper bound for pruning; whereas the latter speeds up the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2017 18th IEEE International Conference on,2017,*
Crowdsourcing Based Evaluation of Ranking Approaches for Spatial Keyword Querying,Jinpeng Chen; Hua Lu; Ilkcan Keles; Christian S Jensen,Spatial keyword querying has attracted considerable research efforts in the past few years. Aprototypical query takes a location and keywords as arguments and returns the k objects thatscore the highest according to a ranking function. While different scoring functions havebeen used; how to compare different ranking functions for spatial keyword querying stillremains an open question with little investigation. We propose a crowdsourcing-basedapproach to evaluate and compare ranking functions for spatial keyword search. Given tworanking functions f 1 and f 2; we use a matrix to model all possible binary questionsregarding the different results produced by f 1 and f 2. We propose a multi-step process toreduce the number of binary questions; identifying the most important questions to ask.Further; we design a crowdsourcing model that obtains the answers to those important …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2017 18th IEEE International Conference on,2017,*
Expert team finding for review assignment,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Hua Lu; Lei Zhao,The peer-review process is the most widely accepted standard for validating products ofresearchers within the scientific community. It is also adopted by funding agencies. Anessential component of peer-review is to find a certain number of experts to review aresearch paper or a grant proposal. Previous work mainly focuses on finding experts withthe necessary expertise relevant to the paper or proposal while ignoring the diversity in theselected reviewers; which potentially leads to the conflict of interest (COI). In this paper; wepropose a novel and unified framework that takes three major key factors into account forreviewer assignment: importance; diversity and expertise coverage of a group of reviewers.Our framework selects a panel of reviewers that not only cover all topics of a submission butalso reduce various potential COIs.

Cleansing indoor RFID data using regular expressions,Asif Iqbal Baba; Hua Lu; Wei-Shinn Ku; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)-based object tracking is increasinglydeployed and used in indoor environments such as airports; shopping malls; etc. However;the inherent noise in the raw RFID data makes it difficult to support queries and analyses onthe data. In this paper; we propose an RFID data cleansing based on regular expressions.We generate the regular expressions in an automaton that captures all possible indoorpaths from the spatial and temporal aspects of indoor space and deployed readers. Giventhe raw data of an object; the proposed matching algorithm finds all the matching pathsusing the automaton.

Outdoor-indoor space: unified modeling and shortest path search,Søren Kejser Jensen; Jens Thomas Vejlby Nielsen; Hua Lu; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract Graph models are widely used for representing the topology of outdoor space (O-Space) and indoor space (I-Space). However; existing models neglect the intersectionbetween O-Space and I-Space; only allowing for computations such as shortest path andnearest neighbor queries in either O-Space or I-Space; separately. In this paper; we presenttwo different outdoor-indoor space (OI-Space) models allowing queries to operate on a mixof both spaces. The first model keeps the distinct nature of the two spaces intact by havingexplicit connections between outdoor and indoor spaces. The second model abstracts thisdistinction away; and provides a unified model of outdoor-indoor space. For each model; wepresent an algorithm that is able to span the two types of spaces to return the real shortestpath between two arbitrary points.

Indoor data management,Hua Lu; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,A large part of modern life is lived indoors such as in homes; offices; shopping malls;universities; libraries and airports. However; almost all of the existing location-basedservices (LBS) have been designed only for outdoor space. This is mainly because theglobal positioning system (GPS) and other positioning technologies cannot accuratelyidentify the locations in indoor venues. Some recent initiatives have started to cross thistechnical barrier; promising huge future opportunities for research organizations;government agencies; technology giants; and enterprizing start-ups-to exploit the potentialof indoor LBS. Consequently; indoor data management has gained significant researchattention in the past few years and the research interest is expected to surge in theupcoming years.

Our framework consists of two phases: In the offlinephase; we cluster photos labeled with Wi-Fi and gyro sensor data according to a learneddistance metric. Photos in each cluster form a" co-scene". We further select a few frequentlyappearing keypoints in each co-scene as" useful keypoints"(UKPs). In the online phase;when a query is issued; only UKPs from the nearest co-scene are selected; andsubsequently we infer extrinsic camera parameters with multiple view geometry (MVG)technique. Experimental results show that our framework is effective and efficient to supportcalibration.,Adjunct Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers,2015,*

Trajectory Possible Nearest Neighbor Queries over Imprecise Location Da,Xike Xie; Man Lung Yiu; Reynold Cheng; Hua Lu,Abstract Trajectory queries; which retrieve nearby objects for every point of a given route;can be used to identify alerts of potential threats along a vessel route; or monitor theadjacent rescuers to a travel path. However; the locations of these objects (eg; threats;succours) may not be precisely obtained due to hardware limitations of measuring devices;as well as complex natures of the surroundings. For such data; we consider a commonmodel; where the possible locations of an object are bounded by a closed region; called“imprecise region”. Ignoring or coarsely wrapping imprecision can render low queryqualities; and cause undesirable consequences such as missing alerts of threats and poorresponse rescue time. Also; the query is quite time-consuming; since all points on thetrajectory are considered. In this paper; we study how to efficiently evaluate trajectory …,History,*,*

Skyline Ordering: A Flexible Framework for Efficient Resolution of Size,Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract Given a set of multi-dimensional points; a skyline query returns the interestingpoints that are not dominated by other points. It has been observed that the actual cardinality(s) of a skyline query result may differ substantially from the desired result cardinality (k);which has prompted studies on how to reduce s for the case where k< s. This paper goesfurther by addressing the general case where the relationship between k and s is not knownbeforehand. Due to their complexity; the existing pointwise ranking and set-widemaximization techniques are not well suited for this problem. Moreover; the former oftenincurs too many ties in its ranking; and the latter is inapplicable for k> s. Based on theseobservations; the paper proposes a new approach; called skyline ordering; that forms askyline-based partitioning of a given data set; such that an order exists among the …,History,*,*

Unified Modeling and Reasoning in Outdoor and Indoor Spaces,Sari Haj Hussein; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract In recent years; indoor spatial data management has started to attract attentionpartly due to the increasing use of receptor devices (eg; RFID readers; and wireless sensornetworks) in both outdoor and indoor spaces. Applications that employ these devices areexpected to span uniformly and supply seamless functionality in both outdoor and indoorspaces. What makes this impossible is the current absence of a unified account of these twotypes of spaces both in terms of modeling and reasoning about the models. This paperreviews and extends a recent unified model of outdoor and indoor spaces and receptordeployments in these spaces. The extended model enables modelers to capture variousinformation pieces from the physical world.
