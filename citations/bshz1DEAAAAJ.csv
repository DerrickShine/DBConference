A demonstration of spatialhadoop: An efficient mapreduce framework for spatial data,Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents SpatialHadoop as the first full-fledged MapReduce frameworkwith native support for spatial data. SpatialHadoop is a comprehensive extension to Hadoopthat pushes spatial data inside the core functionality of Hadoop. SpatialHadoop runs existingHadoop programs as is; yet; it achieves order (s) of magnitude better performance thanHadoop when dealing with spatial data. SpatialHadoop employs a simple spatial high levellanguage; a two-level spatial index structure; basic spatial components built inside theMapReduce layer; and three basic spatial operations: range queries; k-NN queries; andspatial join. Other spatial operations can be similarly deployed in SpatialHadoop.

NADEEF: a commodity data cleaning system,Michele Dallachiesa; Amr Ebaid; Ahmed Eldawy; Ahmed Elmagarmid; Ihab F Ilyas; Mourad Ouzzani; Nan Tang,Abstract Despite the increasing importance of data quality and the rich theoretical andpractical contributions in all aspects of data cleaning; there is no single end-to-end off-the-shelf solution to (semi-) automate the detection and the repairing of violations wrt a set ofheterogeneous and ad-hoc quality constraints. In short; there is no commodity platformsimilar to general purpose DBMSs that can be easily customized and deployed to solveapplication-specific data quality problems. In this paper; we present NADEEF; an extensible;generalized and easy-to-deploy data cleaning platform. NADEEF distinguishes between aprogramming interface and a core to achieve generality and extensibility. The programminginterface allows the users to specify multiple types of data quality rules; which uniformlydefine what is wrong with the data and (possibly) how to repair it through writing code that …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,138

Sindbad: a location-based social networking system,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Justin J Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents Sindbad; a location-based social networking system. Sindbadsupports three new services beyond traditional social networking services; namely; location-aware news feed; location-aware recommender; and location-aware ranking. These newservices not only consider social relevance for its users; but they also consider spatialrelevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad; implementedwith PostgreSQL and Google Maps API; are demonstrated through user (ie; web/phone) andsystem analyzer GUI interfaces; respectively.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,52
Real-time street parking availability estimation,Bo Xu; Ouri Wolfson; Jie Yang; Leon Stenneth; S Yu Philip; Peter C Nelson,Real-time parking availability information is important in urban areas; and if available couldreduce congestion; pollution; and gas consumption. In this paper; we present a softwaresolution called PhonePark for detecting the availability of on-street parking spaces.

Pigeon: A spatial mapreduce language,Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel,With the huge amounts of spatial data collected everyday; MapReduce frameworks; such asHadoop; have become a common choice to analyze big spatial data for scientists andpeople from industry. Users prefer to use high level languages; such as Pig Latin; to dealwith Hadoop for simplicity. Unfortunately; these languages are designed for primitive non-spatial data and have no support for spatial data types or functions. This demonstrationpresents Pigeon; a spatial extension to Pig which provides spatial functionality in Pig.Pigeon is implemented through user defined functions (UDFs) making it easy to use andcompatible with all recent versions of Pig.

Spatial partitioning techniques in SpatialHadoop,Ahmed Eldawy; Louai Alarabi; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract SpatialHadoop is an extended MapReduce framework that supports globalindexing that spatial partitions the data across machines providing orders of magnitudespeedup; compared to traditional Hadoop. In this paper; we describe seven alternativepartitioning techniques and experimentally study their effect on the quality of the generatedindex and the performance of range and spatial join queries. We found that using a 1%sample is enough to produce high quality partitions. Also; we found that the total area ofpartitions is a reasonable measure of the quality of indexes when running spatial join. Thisstudy will assist researchers in choosing a good spatial partitioning technique in distributedenvironments.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,37
Trekking through siberia: Managing cold data in a memory-optimized database,Ahmed Eldawy; Justin Levandoski; Per-Åke Larson,Abstract Main memories are becoming sufficiently large that most OLTP databases can bestored entirely in main memory; but this may not be the best solution. OLTP workloadstypically exhibit skewed access patterns where some records are hot (frequently accessed)but many records are cold (infrequently or never accessed). It is still more economical tostore the coldest records on secondary storage such as flash. This paper introduces Siberia;a framework for managing cold data in the Microsoft Hekaton main-memory databaseengine. We discuss how to migrate cold data to secondary storage while providing aninterface to the user to manipulate both hot and cold data that hides the actual data location.We describe how queries of different isolation levels can read and modify data stored in bothhot and cold stores without restriction while minimizing number of accesses to cold …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,37

Collecting real traffic datasets is tedious as itusually takes a significant amount of time and effort. Alternatively; many researchers opt togenerate synthetic traffic data using existing traffic generation tools; eg; Brinkhoff andBerlinMOD. Unfortunately; existing road network traffic generators require significant amountof time and effort to install; configure; and run. Moreover; it is not trivial to generate trafficdata in arbitrary spatial regions using existing traffic generators.

Flexible and extensible preference evaluation in database systems,Justin J Levandoski; Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel; Mohamed E Khalefa,Abstract Personalized database systems give users answers tailored to their personalpreferences. While numerous preference evaluation methods for databases have beenproposed (eg; skyline; top-k; k-dominance; k-frequency); the implementation of thesemethods at the core of a database system is a double-edged sword. Core implementationprovides efficient query processing for arbitrary database queries; however; this approach isnot practical since each existing (and future) preference method requires implementationwithin the database engine. To solve this problem; this article introduces FlexPref; aframework for extensible preference evaluation in database systems.

Several previous graph clustering algorithms fall short of handlingmassive and streaming graphs because they are centralized; they need to know the entiregraph beforehand and are not incremental; or they incur an excessive computationaloverhead. Our algorithm's fundamental building block is called graph reservoir sampling.We maintain a reservoir sample of the edges as the graph changes while satisfying certaindesired properties like bounding number of clusters or cluster-sizes.

RecBench: benchmarks for evaluating performance of recommender system architectures,Justin J Levandoski; Michael D Ekstrand; Michael J Ludwig; Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel; John T Riedl,ABSTRACT Traditionally; recommender systems have been “hand-built”; implemented ascustom applications hard-wired to a particular recommendation task. Recently; the databasecommunity has begun exploring alternative DBMS-based recommender systemarchitectures; whereby a database both stores the recommender system data (eg; ratingsdata and the derived recommender models) and generates recommendations using SQLqueries.

The Quill Distributed Analytics Library and Platform,Badrish Chandramouli; Raul Castro Fernandez; Jonathan Goldstein; Ahmed Eldawy; Abdul Quamar,ABSTRACT This technical report introduces Quill (stands for a quadrillion tuples per day); alibrary and distributed platform for relational and temporal analytics over large datasets inthe cloud. Quill exposes a new abstraction for parallel datasets and computation; calledSharded-Streamable. This abstraction provides the ability to express efficient distributedphysical query plans that are transferable; ie; movable from offline to real-time and viceversa. ShardedStreamable decouples incremental query logic specification; a small but richset of data movement operations; and keying; this allows Quill to express a broad space ofplans with complex querying functionality; while leveraging existing temporal libraries suchas Trill. Quill's layered architecture provides a careful separation of responsibilities withindependently useful components; while retaining high performance. We built Quill for the …,*,2016,3
Spatial coding-based approach for partitioning big spatial data in Hadoop,Xiaochuang Yao; Mohamed F Mokbel; Louai Alarabi; Ahmed Eldawy; Jianyu Yang; Wenju Yun; Lin Li; Sijing Ye; Dehai Zhu,Abstract Spatial data partitioning (SDP) plays a powerful role in distributed storage andparallel computing for spatial data. However; due to skew distribution of spatial data andvarying volume of spatial vector objects; it leads to a significant challenge to ensure bothoptimal performance of spatial operation and data balance in the cluster. To tackle thisproblem; we proposed a spatial coding-based approach for partitioning big spatial data inHadoop. This approach; firstly; compressed the whole big spatial data based on spatialcoding matrix to create a sensing information set (SIS); including spatial code; size; countand other information. SIS was then employed to build spatial partitioning matrix; which wasused to spilt all spatial objects into different partitions in the cluster finally. Based on ourapproach; the neighbouring spatial objects can be partitioned into the same block. At the …,Computers & Geosciences,2017,2

Experimental evaluation of selectivity estimation on big spatial data,Harry Chasparis; Ahmed Eldawy,Abstract With the tremendous volume of spatial datasets; there is an increasing need toprocess and analyze spatial data. One of the fundamental spatial queries is the selectivityestimation problem where users want to quickly estimate the total number of records in agiven query range. While there have been several approaches to solve this problem for bigdata; there is no systematic evaluation and comparison for these techniques. In this work; weexperimentally examine three of the most widely used techniques for selectivity estimation;namely; sampling; uniform binning; and non-uniform binning. This evaluation will be a basisfor deciding when to use each of these techniques based on the application requirements.Furthermore; we study the trade-off between memory usage; preprocessing overhead;online query time and the accuracy of the results.

Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad areimplemented with PostgreSQL and Google Maps API. Both a web and android phoneapplications are built on top of Sindbad for better interaction with the system users.,Proceedings of the 5th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location-Based Social Networks,2012,1

High Performance Query Processing and Data Analytics,*,High performance query processing and data analytics can be performed acrossarchitecturally diverse scales; such as single core; multi-core and/or multi-nodes. The highperformance query processing and data analytics can include a separation of querycomputation; keying data; and data movement and parallel computation; thereby enhancingthe capabilities of the query processing and data analytics; while allowing the specificationof complex forms of data parallel computation that may execute across real-time and offline.The decoupling of data movement and parallel computation; as described herein canimprove query processing and data analytics speed; can provide for the optimization ofsearches in a plurality of computing environments; and can provide the ability to searchthrough a larger space of execution plans.,*,2017,*
Sphinx: Empowering Impala for Efficient Execution of SQL Queries on Big Spatial Data,Ahmed Eldawy; Ibrahim Sabek; Mostafa Elganainy; Ammar Bakeer; Ahmed Abdelmotaleb; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This paper presents Sphinx; a full-fledged open-source system for big spatial datawhich overcomes the limitations of existing systems by adopting a standard SQL interface;and by providing a high efficient core built inside the core of the Apache Impala system.Sphinx is composed of four main layers; namely; query parser; indexer; query planner; andquery executor. The query parser injects spatial data types and functions in the SQLinterface of Sphinx. The indexer creates spatial indexes in Sphinx by adopting a two-layeredindex design. The query planner utilizes these indexes to construct efficient query plans forrange query and spatial join operations. Finally; the query executor carries out these planson big spatial datasets in a distributed cluster. A system prototype of Sphinx running on realdatasets shows up-to three orders of magnitude performance improvement over plain …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2017,*
Large Scale Analytics of Vector+ Raster Big Spatial Data,Ahmed Eldawy; Lyuye Niu; David Haynes; Zhiba Su,ABSTRACT Significant increases in the volume of big spatial data have driven researchersand practitioners to build specialized systems to process and analyze this data. Existingefforts focus on either big raster data; eg; remote sensing data or medical images; or bigvector data; eg; geotagged tweets or trajectories. However; when raster and vector data mix;one dataset must be converted to the other representation requiring vector-to-raster or raster-to-vector transformation before processing; which is extremely inefficient for large datasets.In this paper; we advocate a third approach that mixes the raw representations of both vectorand raster data in the query processor. As a case study; we apply this to the zonal statisticsproblem; which computes the statistics over a raster layer for each polygon in a vector layer.We propose a novel method; called Scanline method; which does not require a …,*,2017,*
Spatial Join with Hadoop,Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel,In a traditional spatial join query; the input consists of two sets of geometries; R and S; and ajoin predicate Â (eg; overlaps; touches; or contains); while the output is every pair of recordshr; si; where r 2 R; s 2 S; and the join predicate Â is true for hr; si. The spatial join query inHadoop is similar to the traditional query with two main differences. First; the input sets arecontained in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) files which are stored as blocksdistributed among a set of nodes. Second; the query processing is done throughMapReduce where the program is mainly expressed as two functions; map and reduce. Themap function maps each input record to a set of intermediate key-value pairs hk; vi; while thereduce function groups them by the key and processes each group to produce the finalanswer. The use of HDFS and the MapReduce programming make it challenging to adopt …,*,2017,*
Method and system for querying and visualizing satellite data,*,Aspects of the disclosure provide a method of satellite data service. The method includesreceiving a dataset of values that are measurements of a parameter at a temporal point forlocations on the earth; organizing the values according to spatial layers in an aggregatespatio-temporal index system to form an aggregate tree associated with the temporal point;and updating temporal layers in the aggregate spatio-temporal index system in response tothe aggregate tree. Further; the method includes receiving a query specifying the parameter;a temporal range and a spatial range; filtering; according to the aggregate spatio-temporalindex system; in the temporal layers and the spatial layers to select aggregate nodes; andgenerating an answer to the query based on the selected aggregate nodes.,*,2016,*
Quill: efficient; transferable; and rich analytics at scale,Badrish Chandramouli; Raul Castro Fernandez; Jonathan Goldstein; Ahmed Eldawy; Abdul Quamar,Abstract This paper introduces Quill (stands for a quadrillion tuples per day); a library anddistributed platform for relational and temporal analytics over large datasets in the cloud.Quill exposes a new abstraction for parallel datasets and computation; calledShardedStreamable. This abstraction provides the ability to express efficient distributedphysical query plans that are transferable; ie; movable from offline to real-time and viceversa. ShardedStreamable decouples incremental query logic specification; a small but richset of data movement operations; and keying; this allows Quill to express a broad space ofplans with complex querying functionality; while leveraging existing temporal libraries suchas Trill. Quill's layered architecture provides a careful separation of responsibilities withindependently useful components; while retaining high performance. We built Quill for the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,*
Parallel Algorithms for Summing Floating-Point Numbers,Michael T Goodrich; Ahmed Eldawy,Abstract The problem of exactly summing n floating-point numbers is a fundamental problemthat has many applications in large-scale simulations and computational geometry.Unfortunately; due to the round-off error in standard floating-point operations; this problembecomes very challenging. Moreover; all existing solutions rely on sequential algorithmswhich cannot scale to the huge datasets that need to be processed. In this paper; we provideseveral efficient parallel algorithms for summing n floating point numbers; so as to produce afaithfully rounded floating-point representation of the sum. We present algorithms in PRAM;external-memory; and MapReduce models; and we also provide an experimental analysis ofour MapReduce algorithms; due to their simplicity and practical efficiency.,Proceedings of the 28th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures,2016,*
SpatialHadoop: A MapReduce Framework for Big Spatial Data,Ahmed Eldawy,Abstract There has been a recent explosion in the amounts of spatial data produced byseveral devices such as smart phones; satellites; space telescopes; medical devices; amongothers. This variety of such spatial data makes it widely used across important applicationssuch as brain simulations; identifying cancer clusters; tracking infectious disease; drugaddiction; simulating climate changes; and event detection and analysis. While there areseveral distributed systems that are designed to handle Big Data in general; eg; Hadoop;Hive; Spark; and Impala; they all fall short in supporting spatial data efficiently. As a result;there are great research efforts in either extending these systems or building new systems toefficiently support Big Spatial Data.,*,2016,*
