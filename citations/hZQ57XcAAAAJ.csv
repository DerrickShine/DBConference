The MADlib analytics library: or MAD skills; the SQL,Joseph M Hellerstein; Christoper Ré; Florian Schoppmann; Daisy Zhe Wang; Eugene Fratkin; Aleksander Gorajek; Kee Siong Ng; Caleb Welton; Xixuan Feng; Kun Li; Arun Kumar,Abstract MADlib is a free; open-source library of in-database analytic methods. It provides anevolving suite of SQL-based algorithms for machine learning; data mining and statistics thatrun at scale within a database engine; with no need for data import/export to other tools. Thegoal is for MADlib to eventually serve a role for scalable database systems that is similar tothe CRAN library for R: a community repository of statistical methods; this time written withscale and parallelism in mind. In this paper we introduce the MADlib project; including thebackground that led to its beginnings; and the motivation for its open-source nature. Weprovide an overview of the library's architecture and design patterns; and provide adescription of various statistical methods in that context. We include performance andspeedup results of a core design pattern from one of those methods over the Greenplum …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,235
Towards a unified architecture for in-RDBMS analytics,Xixuan Feng; Arun Kumar; Benjamin Recht; Christopher Ré,Abstract The increasing use of statistical data analysis in enterprise applications has createdan arms race among database vendors to offer ever more sophisticated in-databaseanalytics. One challenge in this race is that each new statistical technique must beimplemented from scratch in the RDBMS; which leads to a lengthy and complexdevelopment process. We argue that the root cause for this overhead is the lack of a unifiedarchitecture for in-database analytics. Our main contribution in this work is to take a steptowards such a unified architecture. A key benefit of our unified architecture is thatperformance optimizations for analytics techniques can be studied generically instead of anad hoc; per-technique fashion. In particular; our technical contributions are theoretical andempirical studies of two key factors that we found impact performance: the order data is …,SIGMOD 2012,2012,114
Materialization optimizations for feature selection workloads,Ce Zhang; Arun Kumar; Christopher Ré,Abstract There is an arms race in the data management industry to support statisticalanalytics. Feature selection; the process of selecting a feature set that will be used to build astatistical model; is widely regarded as the most critical step of statistical analytics. Thus; weargue that managing the feature selection process is a pressing data managementchallenge. We study this challenge by describing a feature selection language and asupporting prototype system that builds on top of current industrial R-integration layers. Fromour interactions with analysts; we learned that feature selection is an interactive human-in-the-loop process; which means that feature selection workloads are rife with reuseopportunities. Thus; we study how to materialize portions of this computation using not onlyclassical database materialization optimizations but also methods that have not …,SIGMOD 2014,2014,69
Hazy: Making it easier to build and maintain big-data analytics,Arun Kumar; Feng Niu; Christopher Ré,The challenges are also tremendous. For one; more and more data comes in diverse forms:text; audio; video; OCR (optical character recognition); sensor data; etc. While existing data managementsystems predominantly assume that data has rigid; precise semantics; increasingly more data(albeit valuable) contains imprecision or inconsistency. For another; the proliferation ofever-evolving algorithms to gain insights from data (under names including machinelearning; data mining; and statistical analysis) can often be daunting to a developer with a particulardata set and specific goals: the developer not only has to keep up with the state of the art; butalso must expend significant development effort in experimenting with different algorithms …Many state-of-the-art approaches to both of these challenges are largely statistical and combinerich databases with software driven by statistical analysis and machine learning …,Communications of the ACM,2013,68

The spectacular successes ofthese trained systems have been among the most notable in all of computing and havegenerated excitement in health care; finance; energy; and general business. But buildingthem can be challenging; even for computer scientists with PhD-level training. If thesesystems are to have a truly broad impact; building them must become easier. We exploreone crucial pain point in the construction of trained systems: feature engineering. Given thesheer size of modern datasets; feature developers must (1) write code with few effectiveclues about how their code will interact with the data and (2) repeatedly endure long …,CIDR 2013,2013,67
Learning Generalized Linear Models Over Normalized Data,Arun Kumar; Jeffrey Naughton; Jignesh M Patel,Abstract Enterprise data analytics is a booming area in the data management industry. Manycompanies are racing to develop toolkits that closely integrate statistical and machinelearning techniques with data management systems. Almost all such toolkits assume that theinput to a learning algorithm is a single table. However; most relational datasets are notstored as single tables due to normalization. Thus; analysts often perform key-foreign keyjoins before learning on the join output. This strategy of learning after joins introducesredundancy avoided by normalization; which could lead to poorer end-to-end performanceand maintenance overheads due to data duplication. In this work; we take a step towardsenabling and optimizing learning over joins for a common class of machine learningtechniques called generalized linear models that are solved using gradient descent …,SIGMOD 2015,2015,46
Energy-efficient mobile data collection in wireless sensor networks with delay reduction using wireless communication,Arun K Kumar; Krishna M Sivalingam,In a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN); battery power is a limited resource on the sensornodes. Hence; the amount of power consumption by the nodes determines the node andnetwork lifetime. This in turn has an impact on the connectivity and coverage of the network.One way to reduce power consumed is to use a special Mobile Data Collector (MDC) fordata gathering; instead of multi-hop data transmission to the sink. The MDC collects the datafrom the nodes and transfers it to the sink. Various kinds of MDC approaches have beenexplored for different assumptions and constraints. But in all the models proposed; the datalatency is usually high; due to the slow speed of the mobile nodes. In this paper; we proposea new model of mobile data collection that reduces the data latency significantly.

To Join or Not to Join? Thinking Twice about Joins before Feature Selection,Arun Kumar; Jeffrey Naughton; Jignesh M. Patel; Xiaojin Zhu,Abstract Closer integration of machine learning (ML) with data processing is a booming areain both the data management industry and academia. Almost all ML toolkits assume that theinput is a single table; but many datasets are not stored as single tables due tonormalization. Thus; analysts often perform key-foreign key joins to obtain features from allbase tables and apply a feature selection method; either explicitly or implicitly; with the aimof improving accuracy. In this work; we show that the features brought in by such joins canoften be ignored without affecting ML accuracy significantly; ie; we can" avoid joins safely."We identify the core technical issue that could cause accuracy to decrease in some casesand analyze this issue theoretically. Using simulations; we validate our analysis andmeasure the effects of various properties of normalized data on accuracy. We apply our …,SIGMOD 2016,2016,21
Feature selection in enterprise analytics: a demonstration using an R-based data analytics system,Pradap Konda; Arun Kumar; Christopher Ré; Vaishnavi Sashikanth,Abstract Enterprise applications are analyzing ever larger amounts of data using advancedanalytics techniques. Recent systems from Oracle; IBM; and SAP integrate R with a dataprocessing system to support richer advanced analytics on large data. A key step inadvanced analytics applications is feature selection; which is often an iterative process thatinvolves statistical algorithms and data manipulations. From our conversations with datascientists and analysts at enterprise settings; we observe three key aspects about featureselection. First; feature selection is performed by many types of users; not just data scientists.Second; high performance is critical to perform feature selection processes on large data.Third; the provenance of the results and steps in feature selection processes needs to betracked for purposes of transparency and auditability.

Probabilistic management of OCR data using an RDBMS,Arun Kumar; Christopher Ré,Abstract The digitization of scanned forms and documents is changing the data sources thatenterprises manage. To integrate these new data sources with enterprise data; the currentstate-of-the-art approach is to convert the images to ASCII text using optical characterrecognition (OCR) software and then to store the resulting ASCII text in a relationaldatabase. The OCR problem is challenging; and so the output of OCR often contains errors.In turn; queries on the output of OCR may fail to retrieve relevant answers. State-of-the-artOCR programs; eg; the OCR powering Google Books; use a probabilistic model thatcaptures many alternatives during the OCR process. Only when the results of OCR arestored in the database; do these approaches discard the uncertainty. In this work; wepropose to retain the probabilistic models produced by OCR process in a relational …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,9
Data Management in Machine Learning: Challenges; Techniques; and Systems,Arun Kumar; Matthias Boehm; Jun Yang,Abstract Large-scale data analytics using statistical machine learning (ML); popularly calledadvanced analytics; underpins many modern data-driven applications. The datamanagement community has been working for over a decade on tackling data management-related challenges that arise in ML workloads; and has built several systems for advancedanalytics. This tutorial provides a comprehensive review of such systems and analyzes keydata management challenges and techniques. We focus on three complementary lines ofwork:(1) integrating ML algorithms and languages with existing data systems such asRDBMSs;(2) adapting data management-inspired techniques such as query optimization;partitioning; and compression to new systems that target ML workloads; and (3) combiningdata management and ML ideas to build systems that improve ML lifecycle-related tasks …,SIGMOD Tutorial,2017,7
Demonstration of Santoku: Optimizing Machine Learning over Normalized Data,Arun Kumar; Mona Jalal; Boqun Yan; Jeffrey Naughton; Jignesh M. Patel,Abstract Advanced analytics is a booming area in the data management industry and a hotresearch topic. Almost all toolkits that implement machine learning (ML) algorithms assumethat the input is a single table; but most relational datasets are not stored as single tablesdue to normalization. Thus; analysts often join tables to obtain a denormalized table. Also;analysts typically ignore any functional dependencies among features because ML toolkitsdo not support them. In both cases; time is wasted in learning over data with redundancy.We demonstrate Santoku; a toolkit to help analysts improve the performance of ML overnormalized data. Santoku applies the idea of factorized learning and automatically decideswhether to denormalize or push ML computations through joins. Santoku also exploitsdatabase dependencies to provide automatic insights that could help analysts with …,VLDB 2015,2015,7
Towards Linear Algebra over Normalized Data,Lingjiao Chen; Arun Kumar; Jeffrey Naughton; Jignesh Patel,Abstract Providing machine learning (ML) over relational data is a mainstream requirementfor data analytics systems. While almost all ML tools require the input data to be presentedas a single table; many datasets are multi-table. This forces data scientists to join thosetables first; which often leads to data redundancy and runtime waste. Recent works on"factorized" ML mitigate this issue for a few specific ML algorithms by pushing ML throughjoins. But their approaches require a manual rewrite of ML implementations. Suchpiecemeal methods create a massive development overhead when extending such ideas toother ML algorithms. In this paper; we show that it is possible to mitigate this overhead byleveraging a popular formal algebra to represent the computations of many ML algorithms:linear algebra. We introduce a new logical data type to represent normalized data and …,VLDB,2017,4
Distributed and scalable pca in the cloud,Arun Kumar; Nikos Karampatziakis; Paul Mineiro; Markus Weimer; V Narayanan,Abstract Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular technique with manyapplications. Recent randomized PCA algorithms scale to large datasets but face abottleneck when the number of features is also large. We propose to mitigate this issueusing a composition of structured and unstructured randomness within a randomized PCAalgorithm. Initial experiments using a large graph dataset from Twitter show promisingresults. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by implementing it both on Hadoop;and a more flexible platform named REEF.,NIPS BigLearn Workshop,2013,3
Bolt-on Differential Privacy for Scalable Stochastic Gradient Descent-based Analytics,Xi Wu; Fengan Li; Arun Kumar; Kamalika Chaudhuri; Somesh Jha; Jeffrey Naughton,Abstract While significant progress has been made separately on analytics systems forscalable stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and private SGD; none of the major scalableanalytics frameworks have incorporated differentially private SGD. There are two inter-related issues for this disconnect between research and practice:(1) low model accuracydue to added noise to guarantee privacy; and (2) high development and runtime overheadof the private algorithms. This paper takes a first step to remedy this disconnect andproposes a private SGD algorithm to address both issues in an integrated manner. Incontrast to the white-box approach adopted by previous work; we revisit and use theclassical technique of output perturbation to devise a novel``bolt-on''approach to privateSGD. While our approach trivially addresses (2); it makes (1) even more challenging. We …,ACM SIGMOD,2017,2
Flexible multimedia content retrieval using InfoNames,Arun Kumar; Ashok Anand; Aditya Akella; Athula Balachandran; Vyas Sekar; Srinivasan Seshan,Abstract Multimedia content is a dominant fraction of Internet usage today. At the same time;there is significant heterogeneity in video presentation modes and operating conditions ofInternet-enabled devices that access such content. Users are often interested in the content;rather than the specific sources or the formats. The host-centric format of the current Internetdoes not support these requirements naturally. Neither do the recent data-centric namingproposals; since they rely on naming content based on raw byte-level hashing schemes. Weargue that to meet these requirements; enabling content retrieval mechanisms to name andquery directly for the underlying information is a good way forward. In addition to decouplingcontent from available sources and transfer protocols; these" information-aware names" orInfoNames explicitly decouple the information from content presentation factors as well …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2011,2

A Survey of the Existing Landscape of ML Systems,Arun Kumar; Robert McCann; Jeffrey Naughton; Jignesh M. Patel,1. INTRODUCTION We present a detailed survey of the existing land- scape of ML systems. Wecategorize the existing and proposed ML systems into six major categories: (1) Packages of MLImplementations; (2) Systems with a Linear Algebra-based Language; (3) Model ManagementSystems; (4) Systems for Feature En- gineering; (5) Systems for Algorithm Selection; and (6)Systems for Parameter Tuning. For each cate- gory (or sub-category; wherever applicable); wedis- cuss a few prominent examples from both research and practice. Note that it is possible fora sys- tem to belong to more than one category; since it could potentially have multiple simultaneousgoals. Our categorization is not intended to be exhaustive. Rather; we aim to give a high-levelpicture of the kinds of functionalities that have been considered; and underscore the gaps thatexist to motivate our vision [26].

Are Key-Foreign Key Joins Safe to Avoid when Learning High-Capacity Classifiers?,Vraj Shah; Arun Kumar; Xiaojin Zhu,ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) over relational data is a booming area of datamanagement. While there is a lot of work on scalable and fast ML systems; little work hasaddressed the pains of sourcing data for ML tasks. Real-world relational databases typicallyhave many tables (often; dozens) and data scientists often struggle to even obtain all tablesfor joins before ML. In this context; Kumar et al. showed recently that key-foreign keydependencies (KFKDs) between tables often lets us avoid such joins without significantlyaffecting prediction accuracy–an idea they called “avoiding joins safely.” While initiallycontroversial; this idea has since been used by multiple companies to reduce the burden ofdata sourcing for ML. But their work applied only to linear classifiers. In this work; we verify iftheir results hold for three popular high-capacity classifiers: decision trees; non-linear …,VLDB,2018,*
Model-based Pricing: Do Not Pay for More than What You Learn!,Lingjiao Chen; Paraschos Koutris; Arun Kumar,Abstract While a lot of work has focused on improving the efficiency; scalability; and usabilityof machine learning (ML); little work has studied the cost of data acquisition for ML-basedanalytics. Datasets are already being bought and sold in marketplaces for various tasks;including ML. But current marketplaces force users to buy such data in whole or as fixedsubsets without any awareness of the ML tasks they are used for. This leads to sub-optimalchoices and missed opportunities for both data sellers and buyers. In this paper; we outlineour vision for a formal and practical pricing framework we call model-based pricing that aimsto resolve such issues. Our key observation is that ML users typically need only as muchdata as needed to meet their accuracy goals; which leads to novel trade-offs between price;accuracy; and runtimes. We explain how this raises interesting new research questions at …,SIGMOD 2017 DEEM Workshop,2017,*

Cerebro: A System to Manage Deep Learning for Relational Data Analytics,Arun Kumar,Deep learning aka deep neural networks (DNNs) are pushing the state of the art in AI taskssuch as image and speech recognition [3]. Leading Web companies are betting big onDNNs. Beyond all the hype; a key question remains: Will deep learning transform relationaldata analytics; which is critical for multi-billion dollar tasks like customer churn prediction inenterprise domains? Machine learning (ML) over relational data systems is a major focus ofour community; thus; this is an existential question for this line of work. Conversations withdata scientists at many enterprise companies revealed that there is indeed broad interest inDNNs; but there are at least two major non-economic challenges to their adoption. First;unlike multimedia; relational data typically have interpretable features. Preservinginterpretability is key for business purposes but DNNs obscure it. Fortunately; ML folks are …,CIDR,2017,*
Learning Over Joins,Arun Kumar,Abstract Advanced analytics using machine learning (ML) is increasingly critical for a widevariety of data-driven applications that underpin the modern world. Many real-world datasetshave multiple tables with key-foreign key relationships; but most ML toolkits force datascientists to join them into a single table before using ML. This process of" learning afterjoins" introduces redundancy in the data; which results in storage and runtime inefficiencies;as well as data maintenance headaches for data scientists. To mitigate these issues; thisdissertation introduces the paradigm of" learning over joins;" which includes two orthogonaltechniques: avoiding joins physically and avoiding joins logically. The former shows how topush ML computations through joins to the base tables; which improves runtimeperformance without affecting ML accuracy. The latter shows that in many cases; it is …,*,2016,*
