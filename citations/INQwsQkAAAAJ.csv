Linked data-the story so far,Christian Bizer; Tom Heath; Tim Berners-Lee,The term “Linked Data” refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connectingstructured data on the Web. These best practices have been adopted by an increasingnumber of data providers over the last three years; leading to the creation of a global dataspace containing billions of assertions—the Web of Data. In this article; the authors presentthe concept and technical principles of Linked Data; and situate these within the broadercontext of related technological developments. They describe progress to date in publishingLinked Data on the Web; review applications that have been developed to exploit the Web ofData; and map out a research agenda for the Linked Data community as it moves forward.,International journal on semantic web and information systems,2009,4834
Dbpedia: A nucleus for a web of open data,Sören Auer; Christian Bizer; Georgi Kobilarov; Jens Lehmann; Richard Cyganiak; Zachary Ives,Abstract DBpedia is a community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia andto make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticatedqueries against datasets derived from Wikipedia and to link other datasets on the Web toWikipedia data. We describe the extraction of the DBpedia datasets; and how the resultinginformation is published on the Web for human-and machine-consumption. We describesome emerging applications from the DBpedia community and show how website authorscan facilitate DBpedia content within their sites. Finally; we present the current status ofinterlinking DBpedia with other open datasets on the Web and outline how DBpedia couldserve as a nucleus for an emerging Web of open data.,*,2007,2945
Linked data: Evolving the web into a global data space,Tom Heath; Christian Bizer,Abstract The World Wide Web has enabled the creation of a global information spacecomprising linked documents. As the Web becomes ever more enmeshed with our dailylives; there is a growing desire for direct access to raw data not currently available on theWeb or bound up in hypertext documents. Linked Data provides a publishing paradigm inwhich not only documents; but also data; can be a first class citizen of the Web; therebyenabling the extension of the Web with a global data space based on open standards-theWeb of Data. In this Synthesis lecture we provide readers with a detailed technicalintroduction to Linked Data. We begin by outlining the basic principles of Linked Data;including coverage of relevant aspects of Web architecture. The remainder of the text isbased around two main themes-the publication and consumption of Linked Data …,Synthesis lectures on the semantic web: theory and technology,2011,2240
DBpedia-A crystallization point for the Web of Data,Christian Bizer; Jens Lehmann; Georgi Kobilarov; Sören Auer; Christian Becker; Richard Cyganiak; Sebastian Hellmann,Abstract The DBpedia project is a community effort to extract structured information fromWikipedia and to make this information accessible on the Web. The resulting DBpediaknowledge base currently describes over 2.6 million entities. For each of these entities;DBpedia defines a globally unique identifier that can be dereferenced over the Web into arich RDF description of the entity; including human-readable definitions in 30 languages;relationships to other resources; classifications in four concept hierarchies; various facts aswell as data-level links to other Web data sources describing the entity. Over the last year;an increasing number of data publishers have begun to set data-level links to DBpediaresources; making DBpedia a central interlinking hub for the emerging Web of Data.Currently; the Web of interlinked data sources around DBpedia provides approximately …,Web Semantics: science; services and agents on the world wide web,2009,1934

Named graphs; provenance and trust,Jeremy J Carroll; Christian Bizer; Pat Hayes; Patrick Stickler,Abstract The Semantic Web consists of many RDF graphs nameable by URIs. This paperextends the syntax and semantics of RDF to cover such Named Graphs. This enables RDFstatements that describe graphs; which is beneficial in many Semantic Web applicationareas. As a case study; we explore the application area of Semantic Web publishing: NamedGraphs allow publishers to communicate assertional intent; and to sign their graphs;information consumers can evaluate specific graphs using task-specific trust policies; andact on information from those Named Graphs that they accept. Graphs are trusted dependingon: their content; information about the graph; and the task the user is performing. Theextension of RDF to Named Graphs provides a formally defined framework to be afoundation for the Semantic Web trust layer.,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,664
The berlin sparql benchmark,Christian Bizer; Andreas Schultz,ABSTRACT The SPARQL Query Language for RDF and the SPARQL Protocol for RDF areimplemented by a growing number of storage systems and are used within enterprise andopen Web settings.

Linked data on the web (LDOW2008),Christian Bizer; Tom Heath; Kingsley Idehen; Tim Berners-Lee,Abstract The Web is increasingly understood as a global information space consisting notjust of linked documents; but also of Linked Data. More than just a vision; the resulting Webof Data has been brought into being by the maturing of the Semantic Web technology stack;and by the publication of an increasing number of datasets according to the principles ofLinked Data. The Linked Data on the Web (LDOW2008) workshop brings togetherresearchers and practitioners working on all aspects of Linked Data. The workshop providesa forum to present the state of the art in the field and to discuss ongoing and future researchchallenges. In this workshop summary we will outline the technical context in which LinkedData is situated; describe developments in the past year through initiatives such as theLinking Open Data community project; and look ahead to the workshop itself.,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web,2008,456
Silk-A Link Discovery Framework for the Web of Data.,Julius Volz; Christian Bizer; Martin Gaedke; Georgi Kobilarov,ABSTRACT The Web of Data is built upon two simple ideas: Employ the RDF data model topublish structured data on the Web and to set explicit RDF links between entities withindifferent data sources. This paper presents the Silk–Link Discovery Framework; a tool forfinding relationships between entities within different data sources. Data publishers can useSilk to set RDF links from their data sources to other data sources on the Web. Silk features adeclarative language for specifying which types of RDF links should be discovered betweendata sources as well as which conditions entities must fulfill in order to be interlinked. Linkconditions may be based on various similarity metrics and can take the graph aroundentities into account; which is addressed using a path-based selector language.

D2r server-publishing relational databases on the semantic web,Christian Bizer; Richard Cyganiak,Abstract D2R Server is a tool for publishing the content of relational databases on theSemantic Web. Database content is mapped to RDF by a declarative mapping whichspecifies how resources are identified and how property values are generated fromdatabase content. Based on this mapping; D2R Server allows Web agents to retrieve RDFand XHTML representations of resources and to query non-RDF databases using theSPARQL query language over the SPARQL protocol. The generated representations arerichly interlinked on RDF and XHTML level in order to enable browsers and crawlers tonavigate database content.,Poster at the 5th international semantic web conference,2006,402
Executing SPARQL queries over the web of linked data,Olaf Hartig; Christian Bizer; Johann-Christoph Freytag,Abstract The Web of Linked Data forms a single; globally distributed dataspace. Due to theopenness of this dataspace; it is not possible to know in advance all data sources that mightbe relevant for query answering. This openness poses a new challenge that is notaddressed by traditional research on federated query processing. In this paper we presentan approach to execute SPARQL queries over the Web of Linked Data. The main idea of ourapproach is to discover data that might be relevant for answering a query during the queryexecution itself. This discovery is driven by following RDF links between data sources basedon URIs in the query and in partial results. The URIs are resolved over the HTTP protocolinto RDF data which is continuously added to the queried dataset. This paper describesconcepts and algorithms to implement our approach using an iterator-based pipeline. We …,International Semantic Web Conference,2009,366

We cover the work of BBC Programmes and BBC Musicbuilding Linked Data sites for all music and programmes related brands; and we describeexisting projects; ongoing development; and further research we are doing in a jointcollaboration between the BBC; Freie Universität Berlin and Rattle Research in order to useDBpedia as the controlled vocabulary and semantic backbone for the whole BBC.,European Semantic Web Conference,2009,315
The emerging web of linked data,Christian Bizer,The paper discusses the semantic Web and Linked Data. The classic World Wide Web isbuilt upon the idea of setting hyperlinks between Web documents. These hyperlinks are thebasis for navigating and crawling the Web. Technologically; the core idea of Linked Data isto use HTTP URLs not only to identify Web documents; but also to identify arbitrary realworld entities. Data about these entities is represented using the Resource DescriptionFramework (RDF). Whenever a Web client resolves one of these URLs; the correspondingWeb server provides an RDF/XML or RDFa description of the identified entity. Thesedescriptions can contain links to entities described by other data sources. The Web of LinkedData can be seen as an additional layer that is tightly interwoven with the classic documentWeb.

Adoption of the linked data best practices in different topical domains,Max Schmachtenberg; Christian Bizer; Heiko Paulheim,Abstract The central idea of Linked Data is that data publishers support applications indiscovering and integrating data by complying to a set of best practices in the areas oflinking; vocabulary usage; and metadata provision. In 2011; the State of the LOD Cloudreport analyzed the adoption of these best practices by linked datasets within differenttopical domains. The report was based on information that was provided by the datasetpublishers themselves via the datahub. io Linked Data catalog. In this paper; we revisit andupdate the findings of the 2011 State of the LOD Cloud report based on a crawl of the Webof Linked Data conducted in April 2014. We analyze how the adoption of the different bestpractices has changed and present an overview of the linkage relationships betweendatasets in the form of an updated LOD cloud diagram; this time not based on information …,International Semantic Web Conference,2014,293

This paperextends the syntax and semantics of RDF to cover such named graphs. This enables RDFstatements that describe graphs; which is beneficial in many Semantic Web applicationareas. Named graphs are given an abstract syntax; a formal semantics; an XML syntax; anda syntax based on N3. SPARQL is a query language applicable to named graphs. A specificapplication area discussed in detail is that of describing provenance information.

Fresnel: A browser-independent presentation vocabulary for RDF,Emmanuel Pietriga; Christian Bizer; David Karger; Ryan Lee,Abstract Semantic Web browsers and other tools aimed at displaying RDF data to end usersare all concerned with the same problem: presenting content primarily intended for machineconsumption in a human-readable way. Their solutions differ but in the end address thesame two high-level issues; no matter the underlying representation paradigm: specifying (i)what information contained in RDF models should be presented (content selection) and (ii)how this information should be presented (content formatting and styling). However; eachtool currently relies on its own ad hoc mechanisms and vocabulary for specifying RDFpresentation knowledge; making it difficult to share and reuse such knowledge acrossapplications. Recognizing the general need for presenting RDF content to users andwanting to promote the exchange of presentation knowledge; we designed Fresnel as a …,International Semantic Web Conference,2006,220
Quality-driven information filtering using the WIQA policy framework,Christian Bizer; Richard Cyganiak,Abstract Web-based information systems; such as search engines; news portals; andcommunity sites; provide access to information originating from numerous informationproviders. The quality of provided information varies as information providers have differentlevels of knowledge and different intentions. Users of web-based systems are thereforeconfronted with the increasingly difficult task of selecting high-quality information from thevast amount of web-accessible information. How can information systems support users todistinguish high-quality from low-quality information? Which filtering mechanisms can beused to suppress low-quality information? How can filtering decisions be explained to theuser? This article identifies information quality problems that arise in the context of web-based systems; and gives an overview of quality indicators as well as information quality …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2009,201

Sieve: linked data quality assessment and fusion,Pablo N Mendes; Hannes Mühleisen; Christian Bizer,Abstract The Web of Linked Data grows rapidly and already contains data originating fromhundreds of data sources. The quality of data from those sources is very diverse; as valuesmay be out of date; incomplete or incorrect. Moreover; data sources may provide conflictingvalues for a single real-world object. In order for Linked Data applications to consume datafrom this global data space in an integrated fashion; a number of challenges have to beovercome. One of these challenges is to rate and to integrate data based on their quality.However; quality is a very subjective matter; and finding a canonic judgement that is suitablefor each and every task is not feasible.,Proceedings of the 2012 Joint EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2012,192

Interlinking open data on the web,Chris Bizer; Tom Heath; Danny Ayers; Yves Raimond,Abstract. A fundamental prerequisite of the Semantic Web is the existence of large amountsof meaningfully interlinked RDF data on the Web. The W3C SWEO community projectLinking Open Data has made various open datasets available on the Web as RDF; anddeveloped automated mechanisms to interlink them with RDF statements. Collectively; thedatasets currently consist of over one billion triples. We believe that large scale interlinkingwill demonstrate the value of the Semantic Web compared to more centralized approachessuch as Google Base5. This paper outlines the work to date and describes theaccompanying demonstration. A functioning Semantic Web is predicated on the availabilityof large amounts of data as RDF; not in isolated islands but as a Web of interlinked datasets.To date this prerequisite has not been widely met; leading to criticism of the broader …,Demonstrations track; 4th european semantic web conference; innsbruck; austria,2007,123

Type inference on noisy rdf data,Heiko Paulheim; Christian Bizer,Abstract Type information is very valuable in knowledge bases. However; most large openknowledge bases are incomplete with respect to type information; and; at the same time;contain noisy and incorrect data. That makes classic type inference by reasoning difficult. Inthis paper; we propose the heuristic link-based type inference mechanism SDType; whichcan handle noisy and incorrect data. Instead of leveraging T-box information from theschema; SDType takes the actual use of a schema into account and thus is also robust tomisused schema elements.,International Semantic Web Conference,2013,106
LDspider: An open-source crawling framework for the Web of Linked Data,Robert Isele; Jürgen Umbrich; Christian Bizer; Andreas Harth,Abstract. The Web of Linked Data is growing and currently consists of several hundredinterconnected data sources altogether serving over 25 billion RDF triples to the Web. Whathas hampered the exploitation of this global dataspace up till now is the lack of an open-source Linked Data crawler which can be employed by Linked Data applications to localize(parts of) the dataspace for further processing. With LDSpider; we are closing this gap in thelandscape of publicly available Linked Data tools. LDSpider traverses the Web of LinkedData by following RDF links between data items; it supports different crawling strategies andallows crawled data to be stored either in files or in an RDF store.,9th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2010),2010,105
Faceted wikipedia search,Rasmus Hahn; Christian Bizer; Christopher Sahnwaldt; Christian Herta; Scott Robinson; Michaela Bürgle; Holger Düwiger; Ulrich Scheel,Abstract Wikipedia articles contain; besides free text; various types of structured informationin the form of wiki markup. The type of wiki content that is most valuable for search areWikipedia infoboxes; which display an article's most relevant facts as a table of attribute-value pairs on the top right-hand side of the Wikipedia page. Infobox data is not used byWikipedia's own search engine. Standard Web search engines like Google or Yahoo alsodo not take advantage of the data. In this paper; we present Faceted Wikipedia Search; analternative search interface for Wikipedia; which facilitates infobox data in order to enableusers to ask complex questions against Wikipedia knowledge. By allowing users to queryWikipedia like a structured database; Faceted Wikipedia Search helps them to truly exploitWikipedia's collective intelligence.,International Conference on Business Information Systems,2010,104

Silk server-adding missing links while consuming linked data,Robert Isele; Anja Jentzsch; Christian Bizer,Abstract. The Web of Linked Data is built upon the idea that data items on the Web areconnected by RDF links. Sadly; the reality on the Web shows that Linked Data sources setsome RDF links pointing at data items in related data sources; but they clearly do not setRDF links to all data sources that provide related data. In this paper; we present Silk Server;an identity resolution component; which can be used within Linked Data applicationarchitectures to augment Web data with additional RDF links. Silk Server is designed to beused with an incoming stream of RDF instances; produced for example by a Linked Datacrawler. Silk Server matches the RDF descriptions of incoming instances against a local setof known instances and discovers missing links between them. Based on this assessment;an application can store data about newly discovered instances in its repository or fuse …,Proceedings of the First International Conference on Consuming Linked Data-Volume 665,2010,99

The R2R Framework: Publishing and Discovering Mappings on the Web.,Christian Bizer; Andreas Schultz,Abstract: The promise of the Web of Linked Data is to enable client applications to discovernew data sources by following RDF links at run-time and to smoothly integrate data fromthese sources. Linked Data sources use different vocabularies to describe the same type ofobjects. It is also common practice to mix terms from different widely used vocabularies withproprietary terms. Thus Linked Data applications need to apply mappings to translate Webdata to their local schema before doing any sophisticated data processing. Maintaining alocal or central set of mappings that cover all Linked Data sources is likely to be impossibledue to the size and dynamics of the Web of Linked Data. Thus this paper propagates adistributed; pay-as-you-go integration approach where data publishers; vocabularymaintainers and third parties may publish expressive mappings on the Web.

Efficient Multidimensional Blocking for Link Discovery without losing Recall.,Robert Isele; Anja Jentzsch; Christian Bizer,ABSTRACT Over the last three years; an increasing number of data providers have startedto publish structured data according to the Linked Data principles on the Web. The resultingWeb of Data currently consists of over 28 billion RDF triples. As the Web of Data grows;there is an increasing need for link discovery tools which scale to very large datasets. Inrecord linkage; many partitioning methods have been proposed which substantially reducethe number of required entity comparisons. Unfortunately; most of these methods either leadto a decrease in recall or only work on metric spaces. We propose a novel blocking methodcalled Multi-Block which uses a multidimensional index in which similar objects are locatednear each other. In each dimension the entities are indexed by a different propertyincreasing the efficiency of the index significantly. In addition; it guarantees that no false …,WebDB,2011,89

Many existing methods for matching entities rely on explicit linkage rules;which specify the conditions which must hold true for two entities in order to be interlinked.As writing good linkage rules by hand is a non-trivial problem; the burden to generate linksbetween data sources is still high. In order to reduce the effort and expertise required to writelinkage rules; we present the ActiveGenLink algorithm which combines geneticprogramming and active learning to generate expressive linkage rules interactively. TheActiveGenLink algorithm automates the generation of linkage rules and only requires theuser to confirm or decline a number of link candidates. ActiveGenLink uses a query …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2013,81
Deployment of rdfa; microdata; and microformats on the web–a quantitative analysis,Christian Bizer; Kai Eckert; Robert Meusel; Hannes Mühleisen; Michael Schuhmacher; Johanna Völker,Abstract More and more websites embed structured data describing for instance products;reviews; blog posts; people; organizations; events; and cooking recipes into their HTMLpages using markup standards such as Microformats; Microdata and RDFa. Thisdevelopment has accelerated in the last two years as major Web companies; such asGoogle; Facebook; Yahoo!; and Microsoft; have started to use the embedded data withintheir applications. In this paper; we analyze the adoption of RDFa; Microdata; andMicroformats across the Web. Our study is based on a large public Web crawl dating fromearly 2012 and consisting of 3 billion HTML pages which originate from over 40 millionwebsites. The analysis reveals the deployment of the different markup standards; the maintopical areas of the published data as well as the different vocabularies that are used …,International Semantic Web Conference,2013,73
Graph structure in the web---revisited: a trick of the heavy tail,Robert Meusel; Sebastiano Vigna; Oliver Lehmberg; Christian Bizer,Abstract Knowledge about the general graph structure of the World Wide Web is importantfor understanding the social mechanisms that govern its growth; for designing rankingmethods; for devising better crawling algorithms; and for creating accurate models of itsstructure. In this paper; we describe and analyse a large; publicly accessible crawl of theweb that was gathered by the Common Crawl Foundation in 2012 and that contains over 3.5billion web pages and 128.7 billion links. This crawl makes it possible to observe theevolution of the underlying structure of the World Wide Web within the last 10 years: weanalyse and compare; among other features; degree distributions; connectivity; averagedistances; and the structure of weakly/strongly connected components. Our analysis showsthat; as evidenced by previous research; some of the features previously observed by …,Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World Wide Web,2014,72
Using context-and content-based trust policies on the semantic web,Christian Bizer; Radoslaw Oldakowski,Abstract The current discussion about a future Semantic Web trust architecture is focused onreputational trust mechanisms based on explicit trust ratings. What is often overlooked is thefact that; besides of ratings; huge parts of the application-specific data published on theSemantic Web are also trust relevant and therefore can be used for flexible; fine-grainedtrust evaluations. In this poster we propose the usage of context-and content-based trustmechanisms and outline a trust architecture which allows the formulation of subjective andtask-specific trust policies as a combination of reputation-; context-and content-based trustmechanisms.,Proceedings of the 13th international World Wide Web conference on Alternate track papers & posters,2004,69

The webdatacommons microdata; rdfa and microformat dataset series,Robert Meusel; Petar Petrovski; Christian Bizer,Abstract In order to support web applications to understand the content of HTML pages anincreasing number of websites have started to annotate structured data within their pagesusing markup formats such as Microdata; RDFa; Microformats. The annotations are used byGoogle; Yahoo!; Yandex; Bing and Facebook to enrich search results and to display entitydescriptions within their applications. In this paper; we present a series of publiclyaccessible Microdata; RDFa; Microformats datasets that we have extracted from three largeweb corpora dating from 2010; 2012 and 2013. Altogether; the datasets consist of almost 30billion RDF quads. The most recent of the datasets contains amongst other data over 211million product descriptions; 54 million reviews and 125 million postal addresses originatingfrom thousands of websites. The availability of the datasets lays the foundation for further …,International Semantic Web Conference,2014,67
Improving the quality of linked data using statistical distributions,Heiko Paulheim; Christian Bizer,Abstract Linked Data on the Web is either created from structured data sources (such asrelational databases); from semi-structured sources (such as Wikipedia); or fromunstructured sources (such as text). In the latter two cases; the generated Linked Data willlikely be noisy and incomplete. In this paper; we present two algorithms that exploit statisticaldistributions of properties and types for enhancing the quality of incomplete and noisyLinked Data sets: SDType adds missing type statements; and SDValidate identifies faultystatements. Neither of the algorithms uses external knowledge; ie; they operate only on thedata itself. We evaluate the algorithms on the DBpedia and NELL knowledge bases;showing that they are both accurate as well as scalable. Both algorithms have been used forbuilding the DBpedia 3.9 release: With SDType; 3.4 million missing type statements have …,International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS),2014,67
Learning expressive linkage rules using genetic programming,Robert Isele; Christian Bizer,Abstract A central problem in data integration and data cleansing is to find entities indifferent data sources that describe the same real-world object. Many existing methods foridentifying such entities rely on explicit linkage rules which specify the conditions thatentities must fulfill in order to be considered to describe the same real-world object. In thispaper; we present the GenLink algorithm for learning expressive linkage rules from a set ofexisting reference links using genetic programming. The algorithm is capable of generatinglinkage rules which select discriminative properties for comparison; apply chains of datatransformations to normalize property values; choose appropriate distance measures andthresholds and combine the results of multiple comparisons using non-linear aggregationfunctions. Our experiments show that the GenLink algorithm outperforms the state-of-the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,64
LDIF-linked data integration framework,Andreas Schultz; Andrea Matteini; Robert Isele; Christian Bizer; Christian Becker,Abstract. The LDIF-Linked Data Integration Framework can be used within Linked Dataapplications to translate heterogeneous data from the Web of Linked Data into a clean localtarget representation while keeping track of data provenance. LDIF provides an expressivemapping language for translating data from the various vocabularies that are used on theWeb into a consistent; local target vocabulary. LDIF includes an identity resolutioncomponent which discovers URI aliases in the input data and replaces them with a singletarget URI based on user-provided matching heuristics. For provenance tracking; the LDIFframework employs the Named Graphs data model. This paper describes the architecture ofthe LDIF framework and presents a performance evaluation of a life science use case.,Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Consuming Linked Data-Volume 782,2011,64
Linked data-the story so far,Christian Bizer; Tom Heath; Tim Berners-Lee; AP Sheth,ABSTRACT The term “Linked Data” refers to a set of best practices for publishing andconnecting structured data on the Web. These best practices have been adopted by anincreasing number of data providers over the last three years; leading to the creation of aglobal data space containing billions of assertions—the Web of Data. In this article; theauthors present the concept and technical principles of Linked Data; and situate these withinthe broader context of related technological developments. They describe progress to datein publishing Linked Data on the Web; review applications that have been developed toexploit the Web of Data; and map out a research agenda for the Linked Data community as itmoves forward.,Semantic services; interoperability and web applications: emerging concepts,2011,64
Learning linkage rules using genetic programming,Robert Isele; Christian Bizer,Abstract. An important problem in Linked Data is the discovery of links between entitieswhich identify the same real world object. These links are often generated based onmanually written linkage rules which specify the condition which must be fulfilled for twoentities in order to be interlinked. In this paper; we present an approach to automaticallygenerate linkage rules from a set of reference links. Our approach is based on geneticprogramming and has been implemented in the Silk Link Discovery Framework. It is capableof generating complex linkage rules which compare multiple properties of the entities andemploy data transformations in order to normalize their values. Experimental results showthat it outperforms a genetic programming approach for record deduplication recentlypresented by Carvalho et. al.

Enabling tailored therapeutics with linked data,Anja Jentzsch; Oktie Hassanzadeh; Christian Bizer; Bo Andersson; Susie Stephens,ABSTRACT Advances in the biological sciences are allowing pharmaceutical companies tomeet the health care crisis with drugs that are more suitable for preventive and tailoredtreatment; thereby holding the promise of enabling more cost effective care with greaterefficacy and reduced side effects. However; this shift in business model increases the needfor companies to integrate data across drug discovery; drug development; and clinicalpractice. This is a fundamental shift from the approach of limiting integration activities tofunctional areas. The Linked Data approach holds much potential for enabling suchconnectivity between data silos; thereby enabling pharmaceutical companies to meet theurgent needs in society for more tailored health care.

Silk-generating rdf links while publishing or consuming linked data,Anja Jentzsch; Robert Isele; Christian Bizer,Abstract. The central idea of the Web of Data is to interlink data items using RDF links.However; in practice most data sources are not sufficiently interlinked with related datasources. The Silk Link Discovery Framework addresses this problem by providing tools togenerate links between data items based on user-provided link specifications. It can be usedby data publishers to generate links between data sets as well as by Linked Data consumersto augment Web data with additional RDF links. In this poster we present the Silk LinkDiscovery Framework and report on two usage examples in which we employed Silk togenerate links between two data sets about movies as well as to find duplicate persons in astream of data items that is crawled from the Web.,9th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC’10),2010,54

Mining the web of linked data with rapidminer,Petar Ristoski; Christian Bizer; Heiko Paulheim,Abstract Lots of data from different domains are published as Linked Open Data (LOD).While there are quite a few browsers for such data; as well as intelligent tools for particularpurposes; a versatile tool for deriving additional knowledge by mining the Web of LinkedData is still missing. In this system paper; we introduce the RapidMiner Linked Open Dataextension. The extension hooks into the powerful data mining and analysis platformRapidMiner; and offers operators for accessing Linked Open Data in RapidMiner; allowingfor using it in sophisticated data analysis workflows without the need for expert knowledge inSPARQL or RDF. The extension allows for autonomously exploring the Web of Data byfollowing links; thereby discovering relevant datasets on the fly; as well as for integratingoverlapping data found in different datasets.

Matching HTML tables to DBpedia,Dominique Ritze; Oliver Lehmberg; Christian Bizer,Abstract Millions of HTML tables containing structured data can be found on the Web. Withtheir wide coverage; these tables are potentially very useful for filling missing values andextending cross-domain knowledge bases such as DBpedia; YAGO; or the GoogleKnowledge Graph. As a prerequisite for being able to use table data for knowledge baseextension; the HTML tables need to be matched with the knowledge base; meaning thatcorrespondences between table rows/columns and entities/schema elements of theknowledge base need to be found. This paper presents the T2D gold standard formeasuring and comparing the performance of HTML table to knowledge base matchingsystems.

Detecting errors in numerical linked data using cross-checked outlier detection,Daniel Fleischhacker; Heiko Paulheim; Volha Bryl; Johanna Völker; Christian Bizer,Abstract Outlier detection used for identifying wrong values in data is typically applied tosingle datasets to search them for values of unexpected behavior. In this work; we insteadpropose an approach which combines the outcomes of two independent outlier detectionruns to get a more reliable result and to also prevent problems arising from natural outlierswhich are exceptional values in the dataset but nevertheless correct. Linked Data isespecially suited for the application of such an idea; since it provides large amounts of dataenriched with hierarchical information and also contains explicit links between instances. Ina first step; we apply outlier detection methods to the property values extracted from a singlerepository; using a novel approach for splitting the data into relevant subsets. For the secondstep; we exploit owl: sameAs links for the instances to get additional property values and …,International Semantic Web Conference,2014,30

Data mining with background knowledge from the web,Heiko Paulheim; Petar Ristoski; Evgeny Mitichkin; Christian Bizer,Abstract Many data mining problems can be solved better if more background knowledge isadded: predictive models can become more accurate; and descriptive models can revealmore interesting findings. However; collecting and integrating background knowledge istedious manual work. In this paper; we introduce the RapidMiner Linked Open DataExtension; which can extend a dataset at hand with additional attributes drawn from theLinked Open Data (LOD) cloud; a large collection of publicly available datasets on varioustopics. The extension contains operators for linking local data to open data in the LOD cloud;and for augmenting it with additional attributes.

A Large DataBase of Hypernymy Relations Extracted from the Web.,Julian Seitner; Christian Bizer; Kai Eckert; Stefano Faralli; Robert Meusel; Heiko Paulheim; Simone Paolo Ponzetto,Abstract Hypernymy relations (those where an hyponym term shares a “isa” relationship withhis hypernym) play a key role for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks; egontology learning; automatically building or extending knowledge bases; or word sensedisambiguation and induction. In fact; such relations may provide the basis for theconstruction of more complex structures such as taxonomies; or be used as effectivebackground knowledge for many word understanding applications. We present a publiclyavailable database containing more than 400 million hypernymy relations we extracted fromthe CommonCrawl web corpus. We describe the infrastructure we developed to iterate overthe web corpus for extracting the hypernymy relations and store them effectively into a largedatabase.

Profiling the potential of web tables for augmenting cross-domain knowledge bases,Dominique Ritze; Oliver Lehmberg; Yaser Oulabi; Christian Bizer,Abstract Cross-domain knowledge bases such as DBpedia; YAGO; or the GoogleKnowledge Graph have gained increasing attention over the last years and are starting to bedeployed within various use cases. However; the content of such knowledge bases is farfrom being complete; far from always being correct; and suffers from deprecation (iepopulation numbers become outdated after some time). Hence; there are efforts to leveragevarious types of Web data to complement; update and extend such knowledge bases. Asource of Web data that potentially provides a very wide coverage are millions of relationalHTML tables that are found on the Web.

Benchmarking the performance of linked data translation systems,Carlos R Rivero; Andreas Schultz; Christian Bizer; David Ruiz Cortés,Linked Data sources on the Web use a wide range of different vocabularies to representdata describing the same type of entity. For some types of entities; like people orbibliographic record; common vocabularies have emerged that are used by multiple datasources. But even for representing data of these common types; different user communitiesuse different competing common vocabularies.

A large public corpus of web tables containing time and context metadata,Oliver Lehmberg; Dominique Ritze; Robert Meusel; Christian Bizer,The Web contains vast amounts of HTML tables. Most of these tables are used for layoutpurposes; but a small subset of the tables is relational; meaning that they contain structureddata describing a set of entities [2]. As these relational Web tables cover a very wide rangeof different topics; there is a growing body of research investigating the utility of Web tabledata for completing cross-domain knowledge bases [6]; for extending arbitrary tables withadditional attributes [7; 4]; as well as for translating data values [5]. The existing researchshows the potentials of Web tables. However; comparing the performance of the differentsystems is difficult as up till now each system is evaluated using a different corpus of Webtables and as most of the corpora are owned by large search engine companies and arethus not accessible to the public. In this poster; we present a large public corpus of Web …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web,2016,17
Dbpedia-a linked data hub and data source for web and enterprise applications,Georgi Kobilarov; Christian Bizer; Sören Auer; Jens Lehmann,ABSTRACT The DBpedia project has extracted a rich knowledge base from Wikipedia andserves this knowledge base as Linked Data on the Web. DBpedia's knowledge basecurrently provides 274 million pieces of information about 2.6 million concepts. As DBpediacovers a wide range of domains and has a high degree of conceptual overlap with variousopenlicense datasets that are already available on the Web; an increasing number of datapublishers has started to set data links from their data sources to DBpedia; making DBpediaone of the central interlinking hubs of the emerging Web of Data. This paper gives anoverview about the DBpedia project and describes how application developers can makeuse of DBpedia knowledge within their applications.,Programme Chairs,2009,17

Experiments with wikipedia cross-language data fusion,Eugenio Tacchini; Andreas Schultz; Christian Bizer,Abstract. There are currently Wikipedia editions in 264 different languages. Each of theseeditions contains infoboxes that provide structured data about the topic of the article in whichan infobox is contained. The content of infoboxes about the same topic in different Wikipediaeditions varies in completeness; coverage and quality. This paper examines the hypothesisthat by extracting infobox data from multiple Wikipedia editions and by fusing the extracteddata among editions it should be possible to complement data from one edition withpreviously missing values from other editions and to increase the overall quality of theextracted dataset by choosing property values that are most likely correct in case ofinconsistencies among editions. We will present a software framework for fusing RDFdatasets based on different conflict resolution strategies. We will apply the framework to …,Workshop on Scripting and Development,2009,16

Semantic Web publishing using named graphs,Jeremy J Carroll; Christian Bizer; Patrick Hayes; Patrick Stickler,Abstract. The Semantic Web consists of many RDF graphs nameable by URIs. This paperextends the syntax and semantics of RDF to cover such Named Graphs. This enables RDFstatements that describe graphs; which is beneficial in many Semantic Web applicationareas. In this paper; we explore the application area of Semantic Web publishing: NamedGraphs allow publishers to communicate assertional intent; and to sign their graphs;information consumers can evaluate specific graphs using task-specific trust policies; andact on information from those Named Graphs that they accept. Graphs are trusted dependingon: their content; information about the graph; and the task the user is performing. Theextension of RDF to Named Graphs provides a formally defined framework to be afoundation for the Semantic Web trust layer.,Proceedings of the 2004 International Conference on Trust; Security; and Reputation on the Semantic Web-Volume 127,2004,16
Active learning of expressive linkage rules for the web of data,Robert Isele; Anja Jentzsch; Christian Bizer,Abstract The amount of data that is available as Linked Data on the Web has grown rapidlyover the last years. However; the linkage between data sources remains sparse as settingRDF links means effort for the data publishers. Many existing methods for generating theselinks rely on explicit linkage rules which specify the conditions which must hold true for twoentities in order to be interlinked. As writing good linkage rules by hand is a non-trivialproblem; the burden to generate links between data sources is still high. In order to reducethe effort and required expertise to write linkage rules; we present an approach whichcombines genetic programming and active learning for the interactive generation ofexpressive linkage rules. Our approach automates the generation of a linkage rule and onlyrequires the user to confirm or decline a number of example links. The algorithm …,International Conference on Web Engineering,2012,15

Integrating product data from websites offering microdata markup,Petar Petrovski; Volha Bryl; Christian Bizer,Abstract Large numbers of websites have started to markup their content using standardssuch as Microdata; Microformats; and RDFa. The marked-up content elements comprisedescriptions of people; organizations; places; events; products; ratings; and reviews. Thisdevelopment has accelerated in last years as major search engines such as Google; Bingand Yahoo! use the markup to improve their search results. Embedding semantic markupfacilitates identifying content elements on webpages. However; the markup is mostly not asfine-grained as desirable for applications that aim to integrate data from large numbers ofwebsites.

Gathering Alternative Surface Forms for DBpedia Entities.,Volha Bryl; Christian Bizer; Heiko Paulheim,Abstract. Wikipedia is often used a source of surface forms; or alternative reference stringsfor an entity; required for entity linking; disambiguation or coreference resolution tasks.Surface forms have been extracted in a number of works from Wikipedia labels; redirects;disambiguations and anchor texts of internal Wikipedia links; which we complement withanchor texts of external Wikipedia links from the Common Crawl web corpus. We tackle theproblem of quality of Wikipedia-based surface forms; which has not been raised before. Wecreate the gold standard for the dataset quality evaluation; which reveales the surprisinglylow precision of the Wikipedia-based surface forms. We propose filtering approaches thatallowed boosting the precision from 75% to 85% for a random entity subset; and from 45% tomore than 65% for the subset of popular entities.

Exploiting microdata annotations to consistently categorize product offers at web scale,Robert Meusel; Anna Primpeli; Christian Meilicke; Heiko Paulheim; Christian Bizer,Abstract Semantically annotated data; using markup languages like RDFa and Microdata;has become more and more publicly available in the Web; especially in the area of e-commerce. Thus; a large amount of structured product descriptions are freely available andcan be used for various applications; such as product search or recommendation. However;little efforts have been made to analyze the categories of the available product descriptions.Although some products have an explicit category assigned; the categorization schemesvary a lot; as the products originate from thousands of different sites. This heterogeneitymakes the use of supervised methods; which have been proposed by most previous works;hard to apply.

A Search Join takes as inputa local table; a corpus of heterogeneous Web tables; and a description of the attributes thatshould be added to the local table. The challenges that Search Joins need to handle arethreefold: 1. Determine the set of the top-k Web tables which are beneficial candidates forthe join operation; 2. Join the local table with the top-k candidate tables given no externalknowledge about key attributes; 3.

Matching web tables to DBpedia-a feature utility study,Dominique Ritze; Christian Bizer,ABSTRACT Relational HTML tables on the Web contain data describing a multitude ofentities and covering a wide range of topics. Thus; web tables are very useful for fillingmissing values in cross-domain knowledge bases such as DBpedia; YAGO; or the GoogleKnowledge Graph. Before web table data can be used to fill missing values; the tables needto be matched to the knowledge base in question. This involves three matching tasks: table-to-class matching; rowto-instance matching; and attribute-to-property matching. Variousmatching approaches have been proposed for each of these tasks. Unfortunately; theexisting approaches are evaluated using different web table corpora. Each individualapproach also only exploits a subset of the web table and knowledge base features that arepotentially helpful for the matching tasks. These two shortcomings make it difficult to …,context,2017,4
Web table column categorisation and profiling,Oliver Lehmberg; Christian Bizer,Abstract Relational tables collected from HTML pages (" web tables") are used for a varietyof tasks including table extension; knowledge base completion; and data transformation.Most of the existing algorithms for these tasks assume that the data in the tables has the formof binary relations; ie; relates a single entity to a value or to another entity. Our exploration ofa large public corpus of web tables; however; shows that web tables contain a large fractionof non-binary relations which will likely be misinterpreted by the state-of-the-art algorithms.In this paper; we propose a categorisation scheme for web table columns whichdistinguishes the different types of relations that appear in tables on the Web and may helpto design algorithms which better deal with these different types.

The data in thesetables covers a multitude of topics and is thus very useful for complementing or validatingcross-domain knowledge bases; such as DBpedia; YAGO; or the Google Knowledge Graph.A large fraction of the data in these knowledge bases is time-dependent; meaning that thecorrectness of an attribute value depends on a point in time. Fusing data from web tables inorder to determine correct values for time-dependent attributes is challenging as most webtables do not contain timestamp information. A possibility to deal with this sparsity is toexploit timestamps which appear in different locations on the web page around the table. Butas these timestamps might not apply to the web table value in question; this approachintroduces noise. This paper investigates the extent to which the performance of data …,Proceedings of the 19th International Workshop on Web and Databases,2016,4

The WDC gold standards for product feature extraction and product matching,Petar Petrovski; Anna Primpeli; Robert Meusel; Christian Bizer,Abstract Finding out which e-shops offer a specific product is a central challenge for buildingintegrated product catalogs and comparison shopping portals. Determining whether twooffers refer to the same product involves extracting a set of features (product attributes) fromthe web pages containing the offers and comparing these features using a matchingfunction. The existing gold standards for product matching have two shortcomings:(i) theyonly contain offers from a small number of e-shops and thus do not properly cover theheterogeneity that is found on the Web.(ii) they only provide a small number of genericproduct attributes and therefore cannot be used to evaluate whether detailed productattributes have been correctly extracted from textual product descriptions. To overcomethese shortcomings; we have created two public gold standards: The WDC Product …,International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies,2016,3

Stitching web tables for improving matching quality,Oliver Lehmberg; Christian Bizer,Abstract HTML tables on web pages (" web tables") cover a wide variety of topics. Data fromweb tables can thus be useful for tasks such as knowledge base completion or ad hoc tableextension. Before table data can be used for these tasks; the tables must be matched to therespective knowledge base or base table. The challenges of web table matching are thehigh heterogeneity and the small size of the tables. Though it is known that the majority ofweb tables are very small; the gold standards that are used to compare web table matchingsystems mostly consist of larger tables. In this experimental paper; we evaluate T2K Match; aweb table to knowledge base matching system; and COMA; a standard schema matchingtool; using a sample of web tables that is more realistic than the gold standards that werepreviously used. We find that both systems fail to produce correct results for many of the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,2

The Web is developing from a medium for publishing textualdocuments into a medium for sharing structured data. This trend is fueled on the one handby the adoption of the Linked Data principles by a growing number of data providers. On theother hand; large numbers of websites have started to semantically mark up the content oftheir HTML pages and thus also contribute to the wealth of structured data available on theWeb. The 9th Workshop on Linked Data on the Web aims to stimulate discussion and furtherresearch into the challenges of publishing; consuming; and integrating structured data fromthe Web as well as mining knowledge from the global Web of Data.,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web,2016,2

Estimating missing temporal meta-information using Knowledge-Based-Trust,Yaser Oulabi; Christian Bizer,Abstract. A large number of HTML Tables on the Web contain relational data which can beused to augment knowledge bases such as DB-pedia; Yago; or Wikidata. A large part of thisdata is time-dependent; ie; the correctness of a fact depends on a specific temporal scope. Inorder to use this data for knowledge base augmentation; we need temporal meta-information. Existing methods rely on timestamps within the table itself or its context astemporal meta-information. Yet; the relationship between these timestamps and data withina table is often unclear. Additionally; timestamps are rather sparse; and there are many webtables for which no timestamps exist. Knowledge-Based-Trust (KBT) uses the overlap withground-truth to estimate the trustworthiness of a dataset. This paper introduces Timed-KBT;which overcomes the dependence on sparse and possibly misinterpreted timestamps by …,Proc. of the 3rd Int. Workshop on Knowledge Discovery on the WEB; KDWeb,2017,1

One common social problem at an event in which people do not personally knowall of the other participants is the natural tendency for cliques to form and for discussions tohappen between people who only already know each other. This places a limit on thepossibility for people to make interesting new acquaintances. Encouraging users to socializewith people they don't know by revealing to them hidden surprising links could help toimprove the diversity of interactions at an event. The goal of this paper is to propose amethod for detecting” surprising” relationships between people attending an event.

Extracting attribute-value pairs from product specifications on the web,Petar Petrovski; Christian Bizer,Abstract Comparison shopping portals integrate product offers from large numbers of e-shops in order to support consumers in their buying decisions. Product offers often consist ofa title and a free-text product description; both describing product attributes that areconsidered relevant by the specific vendor. In addition; product offers might containstructured or semi-structured product specifications in the form of HTML tables and HTMLlists. As product specifications often cover more product attributes than free-text descriptions;being able to extract attribute-value pairs from these specifications is a critical prerequisitefor achieving good results in tasks such as product matching; product categorisation; facetedproduct search; and product recommendation.

Data and Web Science Group,Heiko Paulheim; Sven Hertling,Linked Open Data 1 is a collection of freely accessible; machine interpretable data on theweb. It uses semantic web standards like RDF for data representation (Bizer et al.; 2009). Asof today; there are several hundred datasets from various domains; encompassing generalknowledge as well as specific domains such as government; geographic; and life sciencedata; scientific publications; and media (Schmachtenberg et al.; 2014). A detailed list ofdatasets that are available as Linked Open Data can be obtained at http://lodcloud. net/.,*,*,*
Treating Non-RDF Databases as Virtual RDF Graphs,Christian Bizer; Andy Seaborne,It will be crucial for many real-world Semantic Web applications to be able to access thecontent of non-RDF relational databases; used by most legacy systems; without having toreplicate the whole database into RDF. This poster presents D2RQ; a declarative languageto describe mappings between application-specific relational database schemata and RDF-S/OWL ontologies. Using D2RQ; Semantic Web applications can:• query a non-RDFdatabase using the• access information in a non-RDF database RDQL query languageusing the Jena model API• publish the content of a non-RDF data-• do RDFS and OWLinferencing over the base on the Semantic Web using the content of a non-RDF databaseusing the RDF Net API Jena ontology API,*,*,*
Exploring the Application Potential of Relational Web Tables,Christian Bizer,The Web contains large amounts of HTML tables. Most of these tables are used for layoutpurposes; but a small subset of the tables is relational; meaning that they contain structureddata describing a set of entities [1]. Relational web tables cover a wide range of topics andthere is a growing body of research investigating the utility of web table data for applicationssuch as complementing cross-domain knowledge bases [2]; extending arbitrary tables withadditional attributes [13; 4]; and translating data values [9]. Until recently; most of theresearch around web tables originated from the large search engine companies as theywere the only ones having access to large web crawls and thus were able to extract webtable corpora from the crawls. This situation has changed in 2012 with the University ofMannheim [7] and in 2014 with the Dresden University of Technology [3] starting to extract …,*,*,*

On the mammary chain of 28 bitches with mammary tumours anultrasonographic examination was done before surgery. The results of this examinationwere compared with the results of the palpatoric; pathologic-anatomical and histologicalexamination. The bitches were patients of the clinic and policlinic for small animals at theFree University Berlin. Unilateral-; and in one case bilateral mastectomie was carried outbetween March and December 1998. In one case; only the 4th caudal abdominal mammarygland and the 5th inguinal mammary gland were surgically removed from both mammarychains; in one other case only one mammary gland with a tumour and in a third case onlythe suspicious tumour were surgically removed.

3.2 Data Integration in Global Data Spaces,Christian Bizer,The idea of Data Spaces [1] as a new abstraction for large-scale data management hasbeen around for quite some time but the development of concrete methods for integratingdata from such spaces was still hampered by the lack of good testbeds that enableresearchers to employ their methods in large-scale; real-world settings. This situation haschanged in the last years with the emergence of two global public data spaces: The Web ofHTML-embedded Data and the Web of Linked Data. 1. Web of HTML-embedded Data [2; 3;4]: This data space consists of all web sites that embed structured data into their HTMLpages using markup formats such as RDFa; Microdata or Microformats. A recent analysis 1of the Common Crawl; a large web corpus consisting of around 3 billion pages; showed that12.3% of all web pages embed structured data.

Expert Report on Data Linking,Christian Bizer,A recurrent problem with the way research data is stored; processed; and accessed is thatscientific work environments; as well as research data infrastructures; remain isolatedsolutions that focus on data from specific disciplines or data produced within specificgeographic regions like the European Union or the United States. Moreover; scientific workenvironments and research data infrastructures are based on a wide range of differenttechnical architectures; this hampers the exchange of data between systems. In most cases;the research data infrastructures that are currently in operation remain isolated data silosthat supply scientists with the data the systems were designed to deliver; but do not allowscientists to discover all data that is available world-wide on a topic or to discover data onrelated topics provided by a different data infrastructure.

How to Publish Linked Data on the Web-Proposal for a Half-day Tutorial at ISWC2008,Tom Heath; Michael Hausenblas; Chris Bizer; Richard Cyganiak,Abstract. The Web is increasingly understood as a global information space consisting notjust of linked documents; but also of Linked Data. The Linked Data principles provide a basisfor realizing this Web of Data; or Semantic Web. Since early 2007 numerous data sets havebeen published on the Web according to these principles; in domains as broad as music;books; geographical information; films; people; events; reviews and photos. In combinationthese data sets consist of over 2 billion RDF triples; interlinked by more than 3 million triplesthat cross data sets. As this Web of Linked Data continues to grow; and an increasingnumber of applications are developed that exploit these data sets; there is a growing needfor data publishers; researchers; developers and Web practitioners to understand LinkedData principles and practice.
