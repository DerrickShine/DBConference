Response history analyses are carried outon a nonlinear frame model. Probability distributions are assumed for the ground motionIntensity Measure (IM) taken as the linear 5% damped elastic spectral acceleration at thefundamental period of the structure. Part of the framework of the so-called PerformanceBased Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) methodology developed by the Pacific EarthquakeEngineering Research (PEER) Center is used in this study. This paper has two mainobjectives. The first objective is to perform a probabilistic demand analysis of an existingbuilding conditional on the ground motion IM. The second objective is to use the results …,Structural Safety,2013,30
Tsunami loadings on structures: Review and analysis,Harry Yeh; Andre R Barbosa; Harrison Ko; Jessica G Cawley,Abstract The 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami has altered our traditional concepts forestimating loadings on structures. Prior to this event; we generally understood thatreinforced concrete structures–those often used for critical coastal facilities–could withstandtsunami actions. This is no longer the case. Many concrete buildings and coastal protectivestructures (seawalls; coastal dykes and the like) failed due to the 2011 Tsunami. In thispaper; the existing design guidelines are reviewed. We point out that some of the force-estimation methods recommended in the guidelines are rational; while others are not. Thenwe introduce a methodology to evaluate building's global stability emphasizing the effect ofbuoyant force. Buoyancy reduces the net structural body force; thereby reducing therestoring forces to resist sliding and overturning failures. Buoyancy force is an upward …,Coastal Engineering Proceedings,2014,24
Deterioration modeling of steel moment resisting frames using finite-length plastic hinge force-based beam-column elements,Filipe LA Ribeiro; Andre R Barbosa; Michael H Scott; Luis C Neves,Abstract The use of empirically calibrated moment-rotation models that account for strengthand stiffness deterioration of steel frame members is paramount in evaluating theperformance of steel structures prone to collapse under seismic loading. These deteriorationmodels are typically used as zero-length springs in a concentrated plasticity formulation;however; a calibration procedure is required when they are used to represent the moment-curvature (M− χ) behavior in distributed plasticity formulations because the resulting moment-rotation (M− θ) response depends on the element integration method. A plastic hingeintegration method for using deterioration models in force-based elements is developed andvalidated using flexural stiffness modifications parameters to recover the exact solution forlinear problems while ensuring objective softening response. To guarantee accurate …,Journal of Structural Engineering,2014,21
Uncertainty analysis of system identification results obtained for a seven‐story building slice tested on the UCSD‐NEES shake table,Babak Moaveni; Andre R Barbosa; Joel P Conte; François M Hemez,ABSTRACT A full-scale seven-story reinforced concrete building section/slice was tested onthe Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) shake table at the University ofCalifornia San Diego during the period of October 2005 to January 2006. Three output-onlysystem identification methods were used to extract the modal parameters (naturalfrequencies; damping ratios; and mode shapes) of the test structure at different damagestates. In this study; the performance of these system identification methods is investigated intwo cases:(Case I) when these methods are applied to the measured dynamic response ofthe structure and (Case II) when these methods are applied to the dynamic response of thestructure simulated using a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model thereof. In bothcases; the uncertainty/variability of the identified modal parameters due to the variability …,Structural Control and Health Monitoring,2014,21
Application of reliability-based robustness assessment of steel moment resisting frame structures under post-mainshock cascading events,Filipe LA Ribeiro; André R Barbosa; Luís C Neves,Abstract This paper proposes a reliability-based framework for quantifying structuralrobustness considering the occurrence of a major earthquake (mainshock) and subsequentcascading hazard events; such as aftershocks that are triggered by the mainshock. Theseevents can significantly increase the probability of failure of buildings; especially forstructures that are damaged during the mainshock. The application of the proposedframework is exemplified through three numerical case studies. The case studiescorrespond to three SAC steel moment frame buildings of three; nine; and 20 stories; whichwere designed to pre-Northridge codes and standards. Two-dimensional nonlinear finite-element models of the buildings are developed with the Open System for EarthquakeEngineering Simulation framework (OpenSees); using a finite length plastic hinge beam …,Journal of Structural Engineering,2014,21

Simplified vector-valued probabilistic seismic hazard analysis and probabilistic seismic demand analysis: Application to the 13-story NEHRP reinforced concrete fra...,André R Barbosa,Abstract A comprehensive and rigorous probabilistic methodology for performance-basedearthquake engineering (PBEE) has been under development under the auspice of thePacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center over the past thirteen years. Theprobabilistic estimation of the seismic demand is an important part of the PBEE methodologyand consists of a two-step procedure: probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA); andprobabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA). Two shortcomings are identified in pastapplications of the PBEE methodology:(i) the use of a single; or scalar; ground motionintensity measure (IM) which is typically taken as the 5% damped linear spectralacceleration; S a (T 1); at the fundamental period of the structure; and (ii) the use of testbedapplications based on two-dimensional (2-D) finite element (FE) models (eg; 2-D frame …,*,2011,16
Viability of hybrid poplar in ANSI approved cross-laminated timber applications,Anthonie Kramer; Andre R Barbosa; Arijit Sinha,Abstract The development of cross-laminated timber (CLT) technology has opened up newopportunities for low-density hardwood species; which have traditionally not been rated asconstruction-grade materials for structural engineering applications. Several characteristicsof CLT; namely thermal performance; seismic behavior; and speed of construction; haveraised interest among designers. The CLT technology has recently been used for residentialand nonresidential multistory buildings and it has been identified as one of the ways ofachieving tall timber building construction. As CLT gains acceptance in the industry; low-density wood species; not specified in current ANSI standards; need to be investigated forpotentially successful use in CLT panels.

Tax lot data; Google Street View; and field reconnaissancesurveys were used to classify the buildings in Seaside and to correlate building typologieswith existing fragility curves according to the construction material; number of stories; andbuilding seismic design level based on the date of construction. A fragility analysis was usedto estimate the damage probability of buildings for 500-; 1000-; and 2500-year exceedanceprobabilities conditioned on a full-rupture CSZ event.

Application of lean construction concepts to manage the submittal process in AEC projects,Ana Catarina VMF Pestana; Thaís da CL Alves; André R Barbosa,Abstract Office processes are repetitive; common to multiple projects; involve multiplespecialists; and are necessary to support the work of trades. Not much attention has beengiven to the management of office-related processes in the architecture; engineering; andconstruction (AEC) literature despite their importance in supporting core activities in thisindustry. Anecdotal evidence provided by industry practitioners and research carried out bythe authors suggest that these processes lack transparency (eg; actual durations areunknown; indicators are not used to manage the process) and suffer from low reliability; thatis; planned times do not reflect the reality and are often underestimated. Aiming to addressthis gap in the literature; this paper presents a two-phase study carried out to investigate thesubmittal process in a construction company using lean construction concepts and tools …,Journal of Management in Engineering,2013,9

The building had a masonry-infilled reinforced concrete framewhich was severely damaged during the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake. The concentration ofdamage in the west end of the first story indicates that the frame exhibited torsional responseto the ground excitation. The authors visited the structure 2 months after the earthquake;collected LiDAR scans; and recorded the ambient vibrations of the damaged structure. TheLiDAR data has been used to create a three-dimensional point cloud of the building whichhas allowed the identification of the locations and geometry of the major cracks but also themeasurement of the permanent deformations of the building. The structure was alsoinstrumented with four unidirectional accelerometers on every floor; two at opposite …,*,2016,8
Seismic performance of high-strength steel RC bridge columns,Andre R Barbosa; Tim Link; David Trejo,Abstract This paper presents the results of a testing program developed to assess theperformance of circular RC bridge columns constructed with ASTM A706 Grade 80 [550]high-strength steel (HSS) reinforcement. Two pairs of columns were tested (four columns intotal). The columns were subjected to lateral cyclic loading to determine the effects of steelreinforcement grade (yield strength) and of moment–shear span ratio on columnperformance. Each pair consisted of one column constructed with Grade 80 [550] HSSreinforcement and a control column constructed with Grade 60 [420] reinforcement. The firstpair had a moment–shear span ratio of six (6); and the second pair had a moment–shearspan ratio of three (3). All four columns were designed to have similar nominal bending-moment capacities. Results indicate that the columns constructed with Grade 80 [550] …,Journal of Bridge Engineering,2015,8
Methodology for development of physics-based tsunami fragilities,Navid Attary; John W van de Lindt; Vipin U Unnikrishnan; Andre R Barbosa; Daniel T Cox,Abstract Tsunamis affect coastal regions around the world; resulting in fatalities andcatastrophic damage to communities. Fragility functions form the basis of most risk andresilience analyses at the individual structure level; thereby allowing physical infrastructurecomponents to be included at the community level. For tsunami loading; the vast majority offragilities that have been developed are based on postevent observations in the field; whichare usually specific to the site of the event. In this paper; a methodology to generate physics-based tsunami fragility functions is proposed; using vector intensity measures; such astsunami flow depth and flow velocity and several combinations thereof. The proposedmethodology relies on Monte Carlo Simulation for consideration of material uncertaintiesand includes epistemic uncertainties in the tsunami force calculation.

SSI-Bridge: soil-bridge interaction during long-duration earthquake motions,Andre R Barbosa; H Benjamin Mason; Kyle Romney; More Hall,16. Abstract The seismic response of a complete soil-bridge system during shallow; crustaland subduction zone earthquakes is the topic of this report. Specifically; the effects ofearthquake duration on the seismic performance of soil-bridge systems are examined. Thistopic is important; because many bridges worldwide are located in tectonic regionscharacterized by a subducting plate boundary; where high-intensity; long-durationearthquake motions are possible. To date; the effects of earthquake duration are not widelyconsidered during seismic design of bridges. In this report; a model of a soil-bridge system isdeveloped in the finite element framework OpenSees. The soilbridge system is subjected toearthquake motions of varying durations using the direct method.

Modeling framework for soil-bridge system response during sequential earthquake and tsunami loading,Trevor Carey; H Benjamin Mason; Andre R Barbosa; Michael H Scott,ABSTRACT Numerous bridge structures on Japan's eastern coast were damaged by theintense ground motion and subsequent tsunami caused by the 2011 Great East Japanearthquake. Damage to bridge systems during this multi-hazard event consisted of twocomponents: long duration ground shaking and tsunami inundation forces. Determining theextent of damage from each hazard is difficult because bridge assessment typically cannotbe performed between the earthquake motion and tsunami attack. Herein; a comprehensivemulti-hazard framework is proposed to simulate the contemporaneous damage from longduration ground shaking; and tsunami inundation for a typical coastal bridge. The frameworkconsiders soil-structure interaction; fluid-structure interaction; and ground motion timeduration effects when estimating bridge damage.

Uncertainty analysis of identified damping ratios in nonlinear dynamic systems,Babak Moaveni; Andre R Barbosa; Marios Panagiotou; Joel P Conte; Jose I Restrepo,ABSTRACT Obtaining accurate estimates of damping parameters from experimentalmeasurements of structures has been a challenge in the civil engineering community. Ingeneral; the confidence level on the identified damping is much lower than that of theidentified natural frequencies and mode shape components. Most system identificationmethods are based on linear system and control theories; while in reality most structuresbehave nonlinearly as the amplitude of the input force they are subjected to increases.When these linear system identification methods are applied to nonlinear structuralresponse; dynamic properties of an equivalent linear system are obtained. This equivalentlinear system will have similar response time history and input energy.

The accuracy ofcalibrated models using different data features and modeling assumptions is studied bycomparing the time and frequency responses of the models with the exact simulated ones.Simplified nonlinear finite element models of the shear wall building are calibrated so thatthe misfit between the considered response data features of the models and the structure isminimized. A refined FE model of the test structure; which was calibrated manually to matchthe shake table test data; is used instead of the real structure for this performance evaluationstudy.

Probabilistic Seismic and Tsunami Hazard Analysis Conditioned on a Megathrust Rupture of the Cascadia Subduction Zone,Hyoungsu Park; Daniel T Cox; Mohammad Shafiqual Alam; Andre R Barbosa,This paper presents a framework for a probabilistic hazard assessment for the multi-hazardseismic and tsunami phenomena (PSTHA). For this work; we consider a full-rupture eventalong the Cascadia Subduction Zone and apply the methodology to the study area ofSeaside; Oregon; along the US Pacific Northwest coast. In this work; we show that theannual exceedance probabilities (AEP) of the tsunami intensity measures (IM) arequalitatively dissimilar to the IMs of the seismic ground motion in the study area. Specifically;the spatial gradients for the tsunami IM are much stronger across the length scale of the cityowing to the physical differences of energy dissipation of the two mechanisms.

Tsunamis effects in man-made environment,Harry Yeh; Andre Barbosa; Benjamin H Mason,Tsunamis are water waves created by an impulsive disturbance in the ocean. A majority oftsunamis are generated by a coseismic ocean floor displacement (ie; earthquake-inducedseafloor rupture). Less common generation mechanisms are subaerial or submarinelandslides; volcanic activity; or; even more rarely; meteorite impact. To generate a tsunami;the earthquake must have a large magnitude (likewise; landsliding and volcanic activitymust be significant to generate a tsunami). Because tsunami generation occurs when largespans of the seafloor displace (ie; seafloor displacement of hundreds of kilometers);tsunamis' wavelengths are longer than the ocean depth. Tsunami wave heights are small(typically less than 1 meter high) in deep water; but the waves increase in height as theyadvance onto the continental shelf and approach the shore. The increase in wave height …,*,2014,3

Torsional load transfer of drilled shaft foundations,Qiang Li; Armin W Stuedlein; Andre R Barbosa,Abstract Drilled shaft foundations commonly experience torsional loads; in addition to axialand lateral loading. Such cases include loads on mast arm traffic sign and signal poles; orseismically induced inertial loading of foundations supporting skewed or curved bridges.Despite the prevalence of drilled shafts; the understanding of the actual resistance to torsionprovided by these deep foundation elements is not well established. To help address thisgap in knowledge; two instrumented drilled shafts were constructed to evaluate the torsionalcapacity and load transfer at full scale. Both monotonic quasi-static and cyclic loading testswere performed. The imposed rotation and corresponding torque was monitored using stringpotentiometers and load cells; respectively.

Response verification of a reinforced concrete bearing wall building located in an area of high seismic hazard,Marios Panagiotou; Geonwoo Kim; Andre Barbosa; José I Restrepo,This report discusses the results of an investigation performed to evaluate the seismicresponse of the draft example of a 7-story bearing wall reinforced concrete residentialbuilding proposed as a design model by the Portland Cement Association (PCA); thereaftertermed the PCA building. The building is that described by PCA (2006) for a region of highseismicity. The bearing walls were designed and detailed for the combined effects of gravityand lateral forces. This report is focused on the seismic shear force demand on the walls.The study considers the effect of the effective flange width as well as the effect of unintendedcoupling between walls through the slab. It is noted that these two effects were found to havean important contribution on the shear force demand in the 7-story building slice tested atUCSD on the Large High-Performance Outdoor Shake Table (Panagiotou and Restrepo …,Rep. prepared for the Portland Cement Association,2009,2

Rapid visual assessment;ambient vibration testing; and ground-based lidar (GBL) showed that these buildingssuffered damage ranging from light to severe; where damage occurred in both structural andnonstructural elements; but was most prevalent in nonstructural masonry infills. Finite-element structural analyses of selected buildings corroborate field observations of onlymodest structural damage. The lack of severe structural damage in this relatively limitedclass of engineered medium-to-high rise RC infill frame buildings illustrates the impact ofmodern seismic design standards and stands in stark contrast to the severe damage and …,Earthquake Spectra,2017,1

Effects of ground-motion duration on the response of a 9-story steel frame building,Andre R Barbosa; Filipe LA Ribeiro; Luis C Neves,ABSTRACT Subduction zone earthquake motions present a significant hazard in NorthernCalifornia and the Pacific Northwest; as well as other parts of the world. Compared toshallow crustal earthquake motions; subduction zone earthquake motions present longerduration and lower frequency content. As a consequence; the response of structuressubjected to these two types of ground motions can be expected to be considerably different.However; current design codes were calibrated considering only crustal motions; and theincreased vulnerability of existing and new structures to subduction zone earthquakes islargely unknown. In the present paper; the performance of a steel moment resisting framebuilding structure is studied under subduction zone earthquake motions and shallow crustalearthquake motions.

Seismic Robustness Assessment of Code Compliant Steel Moment Resisting Frame Under Seismic Triggered Sequences of Events,Filipe LA Ribeiro; Luís C Neves; André R Barbosa,SUMMARY: Earthquakes cannot be seen as isolated hazard events. High intensityearthquakes usually lead to secondary hazard events; such as fire; blasts; aftershocks andtsunamis; whose consequences have significant impact on life safety in post-mainshock riskscenarios. These secondary events that follow major earthquakes are not considered incodes. In this study; a probabilistic framework for evaluation of the structural safety undersequences of events is presented. After quantifying the structural safety; considering twospecific seismic triggered sequences of events; and comparing it to that associated with themainshock alone; a measure of the structural robustness to cascading events can bedefined; independently of current life safety requirements present in codes.

Development of Physics-Based Tsunami Fragility Functions Considering Structural Member Failures,Mohammad S Alam; Andre R Barbosa; Michael H Scott; Daniel T Cox; John W van de Lindt,Abstract A probabilistic framework is presented for the development of physics andsimulation-based parametrized tsunami fragility functions for structures accounting forstructural member failures. The proposed framework is general and accounts for materialand geometric sources of uncertainty and makes use of nonlinear finite-element structuralmodels and the first-order second-moment (FOSM) reliability method. The application of theframework is illustrated with the development of parametrized fragility functions for anexample reinforced concrete moment frame building designed to recent United Statescodes. Results indicate that explicit consideration of structural member failures is ofparamount importance because the fragility functions based on global failure criteria that donot account for member failures tend to overpredict damage state capacities.

Influence of ground motion duration on damage index-based fragility assessment of a plan-asymmetric non-ductile reinforced concrete building,Andre Belejo; Andre R Barbosa; Rita Bento,Abstract The role of ground motion duration on the seismic performance of buildingstructures remains unclear. This paper presents results on the effects of ground motionduration on the seismic behaviour of a 3-D plan-asymmetric reinforced concrete building. Athree-story reinforced concrete building tested in Europe is used as a case study. Anonlinear model of the building with fibre-section distributed inelasticity displacement-basedbeam-column elements is subjected to two ground motion sets:(1) long-duration bi-directional earthquake ground motions; and (2) short-duration bi-directional earthquakeground motions. A new ground motion selection procedure is proposed to isolate the effectof duration on the structural response and on damage assessment. For comparative studies;long-and short-duration ground motions are selected so that they have similar response …,Engineering Structures,2017,*
Seismic assessment of a heavy-timber frame structure with ring-doweled moment-resisting connections,L.G. Rodrigues; J.M. Branco; L.A.C Neves; A.R. Barbosa,Abstract The performance of heavy-timber structures in earthquakes depends strongly onthe inelastic behavior of the mechanical connections. Nevertheless; the nonlinear behaviorof timber structures is only considered in the design phase indirectly through the use of an R-factor or aq-factor; which reduces the seismic elastic response spectrum. To improve theestimation of this; the seismic performance of a three-story building designed with ring-doweled moment resisting connections is analyzed here. Connections and members weredesigned to fulfill the seismic detailing requirements present in Eurocode 5 and Eurocode 8for high ductility class structures. The performance of the structure is evaluated through aprobabilistic approach; which accounts for uncertainties in mechanical properties ofmembers and connections.

Effect of High-Strength Reinforcement Steel on Shear Friction Behavior,Andre R Barbosa; David Trejo; Drew Nielson,Abstract Current bridge provisions limit the contribution of the reinforcing steel in concreteshear interface design to a yield strength of 420 MPa (60 ksi). Because of this; the higheryield strength of high-strength steel (HSS) reinforcing bars cannot currently be used indesign. Only a limited number of tests have been performed to characterize the shear frictionresistance of members containing HSS; and results from these tests indicate that using thefull HSS reinforcing bar yield stress capacity could overestimate the shear interface capacityof the specimens. However; shear friction design using HSS reinforcement at its yieldstrength; if shown viable; could provide constructability benefits. In this work; the effect ofHSS reinforcement on concrete–concrete shear interface capacity is investigated.

Assessment of Soil Arching Factor for Retaining Wall Pile Foundations,Andre R Barbosa; Scott A Ashford; Henry B Mason; Andre FV Belejo,Despite the prevalence of the soldier piles retaining wall systems as temporary and evenpermanent shoring systems along state highways; relatively little is known on the effect ofthe foreslope bench width and the slope inclination on the arching capability factor used indesign codes and standards. A review of literature indicated that no full-scale tests wereconducted for soldier pile systems and only a few components have been modeledanalytically; often using 2-D analyses that cannot capture the complex 3-D behavior of thearching behavior in active and passive regions of soldier pile retaining wall systems.

The strategies considered were (1) precasting reinforcedconcrete columns;(2) constructing columns with concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs); and (3)constructing columns with higher-strength steel (GR 80). The precast column strategy wasfurthered by conducting test of precast column to cast-in-place drilled shaft connections anddeveloping a strut-and-tie model to proportion such connections. The strategy of usingCFSTs was furthered by conducting tests of a variety of connections; which then providedthe basis for design recommendations.

Numerical modeling of URM infill walls retrofitted with embedded reinforcing steel,Rajendra Soti; Andre R Barbosa; Andreas Stavridis,ABSTRACT Unreinforced masonry (URM) infill walls present a serious threat to communitiesin earthquake prone regions because they typically exhibit brittle and catastrophic failures.These failures have been observed in the aftermath of recent earthquakes such as the 2010Haiti (Mw 7.0) and the 2010 Maule Chile (Mw 8.8). As cost is typically the main hindrance toseismically performing these URM walls; there is therefore a pressing need for developingcost-effective retrofit strategies. The main goal of this study is to propose a solution forseismic retrofit of URM infill walls by providing embedded horizontal and/or verticalreinforcing steel into the pre-cut grooves. To investigate the feasibility of the proposedretrofitting technique; a nonlinear finite element model is developed which simulates theperformance of the infill walls before and after retrofitting.

Mainshock–Aftershock Interaction Diagram for a 3D Plan-Asymmetric Structure,A Belejo; A Barbosa,The main objective of this paper is to present an application of a methodology fordevelopment of mainshock-aftershock interaction diagrams. A mainshock-aftershockinteraction diagram corresponds to a capacity curve that shows the aftershock spectralaccelerations at a fundamental period of the structure that lead to the structure to fail after thestructure has been subjected to a mainshock; which did not lead to failure. In this context;failure is to be read as “exceeding a given limit state”; which can correspond to a servicelevel or ultimate limit state. This mainshock-aftershock curve is denoted as a capacityinteraction diagram; or interaction diagram in short; since any pair of spectral accelerationsthat fall within the interaction diagram is a non-failure point; while any point falling outside ofthis curve is a failure point. The methodology used to develop the mainshock-aftershock …,*,*,*

FRAGILITY AND LOSS ASSESSMENT OF PRE-NORTHRIDGE STEEL MOMENT FRAMES USING THE OPENSEES FRAMEWORK,Filipe LA Ribeiro; André R Barbosa; Luís C Neves,ABSTRACT In steel moment resisting frame structures; beams; columns; and connectionscan experience large strains and sustain strength and stiffness deterioration during intenseearthquake ground motion shaking. In this paper; bilinear models accounting for strengthand stiffness deterioration of both beams and beam-column connections are studied. Beamsare modeled using finite-length plastic hinge beam-column elements while the connectionbehavior is modeled using zero-length springs. Columns are modeled using fiber-sectiondistributed plasticity elements to account for axial load and bending moment interaction. Twoapplication examples are presented using OpenSees. Results obtained with the proposedmodeling approach are compared with an idealized model assuming rigid connections.Results in this work show that consideration of brittle beam-column connections leads to …,*,*,*
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF STEEL MOMENT FRAMES SUBJECTED TO STRUCTURAL FIRE USING THE OPENSEES FRAMEWORK,Filipe LA Ribeiro; Rúben P Rosário; André R Barbosa; Luís C Neves,ABSTRACT A large number of variables are involved in the simulation of structural fireresponse. As a consequence; structural fire analysis may be extremely costly. This studyaims at identifying the most important variables affecting the response of steel structuresunder and immediately after being subjected to structural fire loading. Two case studyexamples are presented; which use the thermal tools of the Open System for EarthquakeEngineering Simulation (OpenSees) framework. A Tornado Diagram Analysis is used toevaluate the sensitivity of the response to loading and material parameters. Results indicatethat the uncertainty in structural fire load density tends to be the most relevant parameterinfluencing maximum and residual deformations.,*,*,*

NUMERICAL STUDY OF URM INFILLED REINFORCED CONCRETE FRAME RETROFITTED WITH EMBEDDED REINFORCING STEEL,Rajendra SOTI; Andre R BARBOSA; Andreas STAVRIDIS,ABSTRACT Unreinforced masonry (URM) infill walls are widely used in regions with highseismicity around the world. When subjected to seismic loading; the failure of these walls isoften catastrophic as these walls typically exhibit brittle failures. These catastrophic failureshave been observed since earthquakes in the 1930s and also in the aftermath of recentearthquakes such as the 2010 Haiti (Mw 7.0); the 2010 Maule Chile (Mw 8.8); and the 2010and 2011 Darfield and Christchurch New Zealand earthquakes (Mw 7.1 and Mw 6.3;respectively). All the failures observed should be reason enough for retrofitting of URM andURM infill RC frames; but the cost is typically the main hindrance to seismically upgradingthese URM walls. Thus; there still is a pressing need for developing cost-effective retrofitstrategies. A simple and cost-effective retrofit solution for URM infill walls is proposed …,*,*,*
Reliability-based robustness assessment of structures subjected to aftershock hazard events,FLA Ribeiro; AR Barbosa; LC Neves,ABSTRACT: A contribution to the definition and assessment of structural robustness ofstructures subjected to multiple (cascading) hazards is presented. The focus is placed onreliability of ductile steel moment-resisting frame structures subjected to an initial earthquake(mainshock) followed by an aftershock; without time for structural repairs and retrofits. In thiscontext; a structure is defined as more robust if it has an increased capacity to sustain themainshock induced damage and is thus less susceptible to collapse under subsequenthazards. Measures of robustness that make use of the reliability index of the undamagedand the damaged structure are used to quantify and compare the robustness of 3-; 9-; and20-story buildings designed under the SAC Steel Project. These buildings are modeled inOpenSees and subjected to mainshock-aftershock sequences. The results obtained …,*,*,*
PRELIMINARY PROPOSAL FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING FOR FIRE FOLLOWING EARTHQUAKE,AR Barbosa; LC Neves2 F Ribeiro,ABSTRACT The problem of fire following large earthquake raises significant concerns inearthquake prone areas. The evaluation of the occurrence and consequences of firesfollowing earthquakes are a highly nonlinear and uncertain problem. The purpose of thispaper is to report the ground work that the authors have been developing on the topic ofperformance-based assessment of building structures due to fire following earthquakecascading hazard. The paper presents a probabilistic framework for performance-basedstructural engineering (PBSE) that is currently under development and which includesearthquake performance assessment and fire performance assessment; namely in thespecial case of fire following earthquakes. The probabilistic framework presented can beseen as an extension of the performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) …,*,*,*
IMPROVING THE SEISMIC PERFORMANCE OF DIAGRID STEEL STRUCTURES USING FRICTION MASS DAMPER,Garlan Ramadhan; André R Barbosa,ABSTRACT The steel diagrid structural system is a recent load bearing and lateral resistingstructural system for tall building structures that is relatively unexplored in the western UnitedStates. One possible reason for the little use of diagrid systems in earthquake prone regionsis the lack of guidelines and application examples illustrating the design and analysis ofthese structures. In this work; a prototype building with 72 stories is used as an example forwhich the design and analysis of the diagrid system is performed. Friction mass dampers areprovided at the top of the building to mitigate the possible large displacement and baseshear demands that these structures may undergo under seismic events. Using a nonlinearfinite element model of the mass damper; which is connected to a linear model of thebuilding structure; the effectiveness of the friction mass damper system is studied. The …,*,*,*
