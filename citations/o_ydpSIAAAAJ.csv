Hydrolysis of PBLG; which was found during the ester exchange reactionunder low ratios of alcohol to the repeat units of PBLG; was thoroughly investigated; andcould be successfully depressed by addition of certain amount of benzyl alcohol to thereaction system. Click chemistry reactions of the azidized or propargylated copolymers; thiol–ene reaction of the allyllated copolymer were taken successfully; indicating that thefunctional groups on the copolymers were still reactive.

The Y-shaped copolymer and its precursors were characterized by 1 H NMR; FT-IR; GPC; WAXDand DSC measurements. The self-assembly of the PLLA 2-b-PBLG copolymer in tolueneand benzyl alcohol was examined.

The structure and characteristics ofBSA-mPEG conjugates were thoroughly investigated. There were about two PEG chainsconjugated onto each BSA molecule as determined by matrix-assisted laserdesorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis. The intrinsic nonspecific bindingability of BSA was used for adsorption and sustained release of both rifampicn and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The helical structures of BSA were preserved to a large extent aftermodification and drug adsorption on BSA was confirmed via circular dichroismspectroscopy.

However; most injectable bone implants arenot suitable for the treatment of CBF because of their weak tissue adhesion strengths andminimal osteoinduction. Citrate has been recently reported to promote bone formationthrough enhanced bioceramic integration and osteoinductivity. Herein; a novel injectablecitrate-based mussel-inspired bioadhesive hydroxyapatite (iCMBA/HA) bone substitute wasdeveloped for CBF treatment.

Surface acoustic waves grant superior spatial control of cells embedded in hydrogel fibers,James P Lata; Feng Guo; Jinshan Guo; Po‐Hsun Huang; Jian Yang; Tony Jun Huang,Tools thus far used to pattern cells within; or on top of; scaffolds have utilized optical forces;magnetic forces; hydrodynamic forces; dielectrophoretic forces; biomolecular/chemicalcoatings; or alterations of substrate pattern; geometry; and porosity.[8] One of the mostpromising innovations for cellular control in a scaffold environment is through microfluidiccoaxial flow. This method controls the flow characteristics of a polymer solution; usuallyalginate with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins; and has the ability to code different celltypes within a single 200 µm fiber.[9] However; the spatial control of cells is poor.

Citrate was recently recognized to play an indispensablerole in enhancing osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity; and promoting bone formation. Toaddress the material challenges in spinal fusion surgery; we have synthesized mechanicallyrobust and fast degrading citrate-based polymers by incorporating N-methyldiethanolamine(MDEA) into clickable poly (1; 8-octanediol citrates)(POC-click); referred to as POC-M-click.The obtained POC-M-click were fabricated into POC-M-click–HA matchstick scaffolds byforming composites with hydroxyapatite (HA) for interbody spinal fusion in a rabbit model.Spinal fusion was analyzed by radiography; manual palpation; biomechanical testing …,Journal of Materials Chemistry B,2015,6
