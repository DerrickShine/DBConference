Efficient Similarity Joins for Near Duplicate Detection,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang,Abstract With the increasing amount of data and the need to integrate data from multipledata sources; one of the challenging issues is to identify near-duplicate records efficiently. Inthis article; we focus on efficient algorithms to find a pair of records such that their similaritiesare no less than a given threshold. Several existing algorithms rely on the prefix filteringprinciple to avoid computing similarity values for all possible pairs of records. We proposenew filtering techniques by exploiting the token ordering information; they are integrated intothe existing methods and drastically reduce the candidate sizes and hence improve theefficiency. We have also studied the implementation of our proposed algorithm in stand-alone and RDBMS-based settings. Experimental results show our proposed algorithms canoutperform previous algorithms on several real datasets.,ACM Transaction on Database Systems,2011,562

Holistic twig joins on indexed XML documents,Haifeng Jiang; Wei Wang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,XML is emerging as a de facto standard for information exchange over the Internet. AlthoughXML documents could have rather complex internal structures; they can generally modeledas ordered trees. Finding all the occurrences of a twig pattern specified by a selectionpredicate on multiple elements in an XML document is a core operation for efficientevaluation of XML queries. Holistic twig join algorithms were proposed as an optimalsolution when the twig pattern only involves ancestor-descendant relationships. The chapteraddresses the problem of efficient processing of holistic twig joins on all/partly indexed XMLdocuments. It proposes an algorithm that utilizes available indices on element sets. While itcan be shown analytically that the proposed algorithm is as efficient as the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of worst case I/O and CPU cost; experimental results on …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,404
Efficient computation of the skyline cube,Yidong Yuan; Xuemin Lin; Qing Liu; Wei Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Qing Zhang,Abstract Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for multi-criteria decisionmaking; data mining and visualization; and user-preference queries. In this paper. weconsider the problem of efficiently computing a SKYCUBE; which consists of skylines of allpossible non-empty subsets of a given set of dimensions. While existing skyline computationalgorithms can be immediately extended to computing each skyline query independently;such" shared-nothing" algorithms are inefficient. We develop several computation sharingstrategies based on effectively identifying the computation dependencies among multiplerelated skyline queries. Based on these sharing strategies; two novel algorithms; Bottom-Upand Top-Down algorithms; are proposed to compute SKYCUBE efficiently. Finally; ourextensive performance evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the sharing strategies. It is …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,369
Spark: top-k keyword query in relational databases,Yi Luo; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the increasing amount of text data stored in relational databases; there is ademand for RDBMS to support keyword queries over text data. As a search result is oftenassembled from multiple relational tables; traditional IR-style ranking and query evaluationmethods cannot be applied directly.

XR-Tree: Indexing XML data for efficient structural joins,Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Wei Wang; Beng Chin Ooi,XML documents are typically queried with a combination of value search and structuresearch. While querying by values can leverage traditional database technologies;evaluating structural relationship; specifically parent-child or ancestor-descendantrelationship; between XML element sets has imposed a great challenge on efficient XMLquery processing. We propose XR-tree; namely; XML region tree; which is a dynamicexternal memory index structure specially designed for strictly nested XML data. The uniquefeature of XR-tree is that; for a given element; all its ancestors (or descendants) in anelement set indexed by an XR-tree can be identified with optimal worst case I/O cost. Wethen propose a new structural join algorithm that can evaluate the structural relationshipbetween two XR-tree indexed element sets by effectively skipping ancestors and …,Data Engineering; 2003.

Stabbing the sky: Efficient skyline computation over sliding windows,Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan; Wei Wang; Hongjun Lu,We consider the problem of efficiently computing the skyline against the most recent Nelements in a data stream seen so far. Specifically; we study the n-of-N skyline queries; thatis; computing the skyline for the most recent n (/spl forall/n/spl les/N) elements. Firstly; wedeveloped an effective pruning technique to minimize the number of elements to be kept. Itcan be shown that on average storing only O (log/sup d/N) elements from the most recent Nelements is sufficient to support the precise computation of all n-of-N skyline queries in a d-dimension space if the data distribution on each dimension is independent. Then; a novelencoding scheme is proposed; together with efficient update techniques; for the storedelements; so that computing an n-of-N skyline query in a d-dimension space takes O (log N+s) time that is reduced to O (d log log N+ s) if the data distribution is independent; where s …,Data Engineering; 2005.

Condensed cube: An effective approach to reducing data cube size,Wei Wang; Jianlin Feng; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Pre-computed data cube facilitates OLAP (on-line analytical processing). It is well-knownthat data cube computation is an expensive operation. While most algorithms have beendevoted to optimizing memory management and reducing computation costs; less work hasaddressed a fundamental issue: the size of a data cube is huge when a large base relationwith a large number of attributes is involved. In this paper; we propose a new concept; calleda condensed data cube. The condensed cube is of much smaller size than a complete non-condensed cube. More importantly; it is a fully pre-computed cube without compression;and; hence; it requires neither decompression nor further aggregation when answeringqueries. Several algorithms for computing a condensed cube are proposed. Results ofexperiments on the effectiveness of condensed data cube are presented; using both …,Data Engineering; 2002.

Ed-Join: an efficient algorithm for similarity joins with edit distance constraints,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract There has been considerable interest in similarity join in the research communityrecently. Similarity join is a fundamental operation in many application areas; such as dataintegration and cleaning; bioinformatics; and pattern recognition. We focus on efficientalgorithms for similarity join with edit distance constraints. Existing approaches are mainlybased on converting the edit distance constraint to a weaker constraint on the number ofmatching q-grams between pair of strings. In this paper; we propose the novel perspective ofinvestigating mismatching q-grams. Technically; we derive two new edit distance lowerbounds by analyzing the locations and contents of mismatching q-grams. A new algorithm;Ed-Join; is proposed that exploits the new mismatch-based filtering methods; it achievessubstantial reduction of the candidate sizes and hence saves computation time.

Path materialization revisited: an efficient storage model for XML data,Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Wei Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract XML is emerging as a new major standard for representing data on the world wideweb. Several XML storage models have been proposed to store XML data in differentdatabase management systems. The unique feature of model-mapping-based approachesis that no DTD information is required for XML data storage. In this paper; we present a newmodel-mapping-based storage model; called XParent. Unlike the existing work on model-mapping-based approaches that emphasized on converting XML documents to/fromdatabase schema and translation of XML queries into SQL queries; in this paper; we focusourselves on the effectiveness of storage models in terms of query processing. We study thekey issues that affect query performance; namely; storage schema design (storing XML dataacross multiple tables) and path materialization (storing path information in databases) …,Australian Computer Science Communications,2002,171
Top-k set similarity joins,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Haichuan Shang,Similarity join is a useful primitive operation underlying many applications; such as nearduplicate Web page detection; data integration; and pattern recognition. Traditional similarityjoins require a user to specify a similarity threshold. In this paper; we study a variant of thesimilarity join; termed top-k set similarity join. It returns the top-k pairs of records ranked bytheir similarities; thus eliminating the guess work users have to perform when the similaritythreshold is unknown before hand. An algorithm; topk-join; is proposed to answer top-ksimilarity join efficiently. It is based on the prefix filtering principle and employs tight upperbounding of similarity values of unseen pairs. Experimental results demonstrate theefficiency of the proposed algorithm on large-scale real datasets.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,162
Efficient processing of XML twig queries with OR-predicates,Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Wei Wang,Abstract An XML twig query; represented as a labeled tree; is essentially a complexselection predicate on both structure and content of an XML document. Twig query matchinghas been identified as a core operation in querying tree-structured XML data. A number ofalgorithms have been proposed recently to process a twig query holistically. Thosealgorithms; however; only deal with twig queries without OR-predicates. A straightforwardapproach that first decomposes a twig query with OR-predicates into multiple twig querieswithout OR-predicates and then combines their results is obviously not optimal in mostcases. In this paper; we study novel holistic-processing algorithms for twig queries with OR-predicates without decomposition. In particular; we present a merge-based algorithm forsorted XML data and an index-based algorithm for indexed XML data. We show that …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,148

Bloom histogram: path selectivity estimation for XML data with updates,Wei Wang; Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Cost-based XML query optimization calls for accurate estimation of the selectivity ofpath expressions. Some other interactive and internet applications can also benefit fromsuch estimations. While there are a number of estimation techniques proposed in theliterature; almost none of them has any guarantee on the estimation accuracy within a givenspace limit. In addition; most of them assume that the XML data are more or less static; ie;with few updates. In this paper; we present a framework for XML path selectivity estimation ina dynamic context. Specifically; we propose a novel data structure; bloom histogram; toapproximate XML path frequency distribution within a small space budget and to estimatethe path selectivity accurately with the bloom histogram. We obtain the upper bound of itsestimation error and discuss the trade-offs between the accuracy and the space limit.

Efficient approximate entity extraction with edit distance constraints,Wei Wang; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin; Chengqi Zhang,Abstract Named entity recognition aims at extracting named entities from unstructured text. Arecent trend of named entity recognition is finding approximate matches in the text withrespect to a large dictionary of known entities; as the domain knowledge encoded in thedictionary helps to improve the extraction performance. In this paper; we study the problemof approximate dictionary matching with edit distance constraints. Compared to existingstudies using token-based similarity constraints; our problem definition enables us tocapture typographical or orthographical errors; both of which are common in entity extractiontasks yet may be missed by token-based similarity constraints. Our problem is technicallychallenging as existing approaches based on q-gram filtering have poor performance due tothe existence of many short entities in the dictionary.

AFOPT: An efficient implementation of pattern growth approach,Guimei Liu; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wang Wei; Xiangye Xiao,Abstract In this paper; we revisit the frequent itemset mining (FIM) problem and focus onstudying the pattern growth approach. Existing pattern growth algorithms differ in severaldimensions:(1) item search order;(2) conditional database representation;(3) conditionaldatabase construction strategy; and (4) tree traversal strategy. They adopted differentstrategies on these dimensions. Several adaptive algorithms were proposed to try to findgood strategies for general situations. In this paper; we described the implementationtechniques of an adaptive pattern growth algorithm; called AFOPT; which demonstratedgood performance on all tested datasets. We also extended the algorithm to mine closedand maximal frequent itemsets. Comprehensive experiments were conducted todemonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.,Proceedings of the ICDM workshop on frequent itemset mining implementations,2003,117
PBiTree coding and efficient processing of containment joins,Wei Wang; Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,We address issue related to containment join processing in tree-structured data such asXML documents. A containment join takes two sets of XML node elements as input andreturns pairs of elements such that the containment relationship holds between them. Whilethere are previous algorithms for processing containment joins; they require both elementsets either sorted or indexed. We propose a novel and complete containment queryprocessing framework based on a new coding scheme; PBiTree code. The PBiTree codeallows us to determine the ancestor-descendant relationship between two elements fromtheir PBiTree-based codes efficiently. We present algorithms in the framework that areoptimized for various combinations of settings. In particular; the newly proposed partitioningbased algorithms can process containment joins efficiently without sorting or indexes …,Data Engineering; 2003.

Probabilistic reverse nearest neighbor queries on uncertain data,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang; Wenjie Zhang; Jian Pei,Uncertain data are inherent in various important applications and reverse nearest neighbor(RNN) query is an important query type for many applications. While many different types ofqueries have been studied on uncertain data; there is no previous work on answering RNNqueries on uncertain data. In this paper; we formalize probabilistic reverse nearest neighborquery that is to retrieve the objects from the uncertain data that have higher probability thana given threshold to be the RNN of an uncertain query object. We develop an efficientalgorithm based on various novel pruning approaches that solves the probabilistic RNNqueries on multidimensional uncertain data. The experimental results demonstrate that ouralgorithm is even more efficient than a sampling-based approximate algorithm for most ofthe cases and is highly scalable.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,111

Efficient processing of XML path queries using the disk-based F&B index,Wei Wang; Haifeng Jiang; Hongzhi Wang; Xuemin Lin; Hongjun Lu; Jianzhong Li,Abstract With the proliferation of XML data and applications on the Internet; efficient XMLquery processing techniques are in great demand. Answering queries using XML indexes isa natural approach. A number of XML indexes have been proposed in the literature: amongthem; F&B Index is one powerful index as it is the smallest index that answers all twigqueries. However; an F&B Index suffers from the following two problems:(1) it was originallyproposed as a memory-based index while its size is usually large in practice and (2)answering queries using an F&B Index is not fully optimized. These problems limit thebenefits and even applications of F&B Indexes in practice. In this paper; we propose a highlyoptimized disk organization method for an F&B Index; the result is a disk-based F&B Indexwith good clustering properties. In addition; novel query processing algorithms exploiting …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,108

A large amount of work has been reported on XML storage models and queryprocessing techniques. However; few works have addressed issues of XML queryoptimization. In this paper; we report our study on one of the challenges in XML queryoptimization: containment join size estimation. Containment join is well accepted as animportant operation in XML query processing. Estimating the size of its results is no doubtessential to generate efficient XML query processing plans. We propose two models; theinterval model and the position model; and a set of estimation methods based on these twomodels. Comprehensive performance studies were conducted.

User's time spent on video capturing; editing; uploading; searching; and viewinghas boosted to an unprecedented level. The massive publishing and sharing of videos hasgiven rise to the existence of an already large amount of near-duplicate content. Thisimposes urgent demands on near-duplicate video retrieval as a key role in novel tasks suchas video search; video copyright protection; video recommendation; and many more.

Top-k keyword search over probabilistic XML data,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Rui Zhou; Wei Wang,Despite the proliferation of work on XML keyword query; it remains open to support keywordquery over probabilistic XML data. Compared with traditional keyword search; it is far moreexpensive to answer a keyword query over probabilistic XML data due to the considerationof possible world semantics. In this paper; we firstly define the new problem of studying top-kkeyword search over probabilistic XML data; which is to retrieve k SLCA results with the khighest probabilities of existence. And then we propose two efficient algorithms. The firstalgorithm PrStack can find k SLCA results with the k highest probabilities by scanning therelevant keyword nodes only once. To further improve the efficiency; we propose a secondalgorithm EagerTopK based on a set of pruning properties which can quickly pruneunsatisfied SLCA candidates. Finally; we implement the two algorithms and compare their …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,78
Efficient exact edit similarity query processing with the asymmetric signature scheme,Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Yifei Lu; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Given a query string Q; an edit similarity search finds all strings in a databasewhose edit distance with Q is no more than a given threshold t. Most existing methodanswering edit similarity queries rely on a signature scheme to generate candidates giventhe query string. We observe that the number of signatures generated by existing methods isfar greater than the lower bound; and this results in high query time and index spacecomplexities. In this paper; we show that the minimum signature size lower bound is t+ 1. Wethen propose asymmetric signature schemes that achieve this lower bound. We developefficient query processing algorithms based on the new scheme. Several dynamicprogramming-based candidate pruning methods are also developed to further speed up theperformance.

Lazy updates: An efficient technique to continuously monitoring reverse knn,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Wei Wang; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of continuous monitoring of reverse k nearestneighbor queries. Existing continuous reverse nearest neighbor monitoring techniques aresensitive towards objects and queries movement. For example; the results of a query are tobe recomputed whenever the query changes its location. We present a framework forcontinuous reverse k nearest neighbor queries by assigning each object and query with arectangular safe region such that the expensive recomputation is not required as long as thequery and objects remain in their respective safe regions. This significantly improves thecomputation cost. As a by-product; our framework also reduces the communication cost inclient-server architectures because an object does not report its location to the server unlessit leaves its safe region or the server sends a location update request. We also conduct a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,60
Continuous monitoring of distance based range queries,M Cheema; Ljiljana Brankovic; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Wei Wang,Given a positive value r; a distance-based range query returns the objects that lie within thedistance r of the query location. In this paper; we focus on the distance-based range queriesthat continuously change their locations in a euclidean space. We present an efficient andeffective monitoring technique based on the concept of a safe zone. The safe zone of aquery is the area with a property that while the query remains inside it; the results of thequery remain unchanged. Hence; the query does not need to be reevaluated unless itleaves the safe zone. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose a technique based onpowerful pruning rules and a unique access order which efficiently computes the safe zoneand minimizes the I/O cost. 2) We theoretically determine and experimentally verify theexpected distance a query moves before leaving the safe zone and; for majority of …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2011,54
Suggestion of promising result types for XML keyword search,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Rui Zhou; Wei Wang,Abstract Although keyword query enables inexperienced users to easily search XMLdatabase with no specific knowledge of complex structured query languages or XML dataschemas; the ambiguity of keyword query may result in generating a great number of resultsthat may be classified into different types. For users; each result type implies a possiblesearch intention. To improve the performance of keyword query; it is desirable to efficientlywork out the most relevant result type from the data to be retrieved. Several recent researchworks have focused on this interesting problem by using data schema information or pure IR-style statical information. However; this problem is still open due to some requirements.(1)The data to be retrieved may not contain schema information;(2) Relevant result typesshould be efficiently computed before keyword query evaluation;(3) The correlation …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,53
Multi-guarded safe zone: An effective technique to monitor moving circular range queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ljiljana Brankovic; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Wei Wang,Given a positive value r; a circular range query returns the objects that lie within the distancer of the query location. In this paper; we study the circular range queries that continuouslychange their locations. We present an efficient and effective technique to monitor suchmoving range queries by utilising the concept of a safe zone. The safe zone of a query is thearea with a property that while the query remains inside it; the results of the query remainunchanged. Hence; the query does not need to be re-evaluated unless it leaves the safezone. The shape of the safe zone is defined by the so-called guard objects. The cost ofchecking whether a query lies in the safe zone takes k distance computations; where k is thenumber of the guard objects.

Connected substructure similarity search,Haichuan Shang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wei Wang,Abstract Substructure similarity search is to retrieve graphs that approximately contain agiven query graph. It has many applications; eg; detecting similar functions among chemicalcompounds. The problem is challenging as even testing subgraph containment between twographs is NP-complete. Hence; existing techniques adopt the filtering-and-verificationframework with the focus on developing effective and efficient techniques to remove non-promising graphs. Nevertheless; existing filtering techniques may be still unable toeffectively remove many" low" quality candidates. To resolve this; in this paper we propose anovel indexing technique; GrafD-Index; to index graphs according to their" distances" tofeatures.

Term graph model for text classification,Wei Wang; Diep Bich Do; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Most existing text classification methods (and text mining methods at large) arebased on representing the documents using the traditional vector space model. We arguethat important information; such as the relationship among words; is lost. We propose a termgraph model to represent not only the content of a document but also the relationship amongthe keywords. We demonstrate that the new model enables us to define new similarityfunctions; such as considering rank correlation based on PageRank-style algorithms; for theclassification purpose.

We propose a novel form of inverted lists for keywords whichinclude IDs of nodes that directly or indirectly contain a given keyword. We propose a familyof efficient algorithms that are based on the set intersection operation for both semantics. Weshow that the problem of SLCA/ELCA computation becomes finding a set of nodes thatappear in all involved inverted lists and satisfy certain conditions. We also propose severaloptimization techniques to further improve the query processing performance. We haveconducted extensive experiments with many alternative methods.

In this paper; we study the problem of efficiently computing top-k dominating querieson uncertain data. We first formally define the problem. Then; we develop an efficient;threshold-based algorithm to compute the exact solution. To overcome some inherentcomputational deficiency in an exact computation; we develop an efficient randomizedalgorithm with an accuracy guarantee. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that bothalgorithms are quite efficient; while the randomized algorithm is quite scalable against dataset sizes; object areas; k values; etc. The randomized algorithm is also highly accurate in …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,47
Efficient Graph Similarity Joins with Edit Distance Constraints,Xiang Zhao; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang,Graphs are widely used to model complicated data semantics in many applications inbioinformatics; chemistry; social networks; pattern recognition; etc. A recent trend is totolerate noise arising from various sources; such as erroneous data entry; and find similaritymatches. In this paper; we study the graph similarity join problem that returns pairs of graphssuch that their edit distances are no larger than a threshold. Inspired by the q-gram idea forstring similarity problem; our solution extracts paths from graphs as features for indexing. Weestablish a lower bound of common features to generate candidates. An efficient algorithm isproposed to exploit both matching and mismatching features to improve the filtering andverification on candidates. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm significantly outperformsexisting approaches with extensive experiments on publicly available datasets.,ICDE 2012,2012,46
A highly optimized algorithm for continuous intersection join queries over moving objects,Rui Zhang; Jianzhong Qi; Dan Lin; Wei Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Given two sets of moving objects with nonzero extents; the continuous intersectionjoin query reports every pair of intersecting objects; one from each of the two moving objectsets; for every timestamp. This type of queries is important for a number of applications; eg;in the multi-billion dollar computer game industry; massively multiplayer online games likeWorld of Warcraft need to monitor the intersection among players' attack ranges and renderplayers' interaction in real time. The computational cost of a straightforward algorithm or analgorithm adapted from another query type is prohibitive; and answering the query in realtime poses a great challenge. Those algorithms compute the query answer for either toolong or too short a time interval; which results in either a very large computation cost peranswer update or too frequent answer updates; respectively. This observation motivates …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,44

Approximate range–sum query answering on data cubes with probabilistic guarantees,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Wei Wang,Abstract Approximate range aggregate queries are one of the most frequent and usefulkinds of queries for Decision Support Systems (DSS); as they are widely used in many dataanalysis tasks. Traditionally; sampling-based techniques have been proposed to tackle thisproblem. However; their effectiveness degrade when the underlying data distribution isskewed. Another approach based on the outlier management can limit the effect of dataskews but fails to address other requirements of approximate range aggregate queries; suchas error guarantees and query processing efficiency. In this paper; we present a techniquethat provides approximate answers to range aggregate queries on OLAP data cubesefficiently; with theoretical guarantees on the errors. Our basic idea is to build different datastructures to manage outliers and the rest of the data. Carefully chosen outliers are …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2007,41
VChunkJoin: An Efficient Algorithm for Edit Similarity Joins,Wei Wang; Jianbin Qin; Xiao Chuan; Xuemin Lin; H Shen,Similarity joins play an important role in many application areas; such as data integrationand cleaning; record linkage; and pattern recognition. In this paper; we study efficientalgorithms for similarity joins with an edit distance constraint. Currently; the most prevalentapproach is based on extracting overlapping grams from strings and considering onlystrings that share a certain number of grams as candidates. Unlike these existingapproaches; we propose a novel approach to edit similarity join based on extractingnonoverlapping substrings; or chunks; from strings. We propose a class of chunkingschemes based on the notion of tail-restricted chunk boundary dictionary. A new algorithm;VChunkJoin; is designed by integrating existing filtering methods and several new filtersunique to our chunk-based method.

Efficient error-tolerant query autocompletion,Chuan Xiao; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Koji Tsuda; Kunihiko Sadakane,Abstract Query autocompletion is an important feature saving users many keystrokes fromtyping the entire query. In this paper we study the problem of query autocompletion thattolerates errors in users' input using edit distance constraints. Previous approaches indexdata strings in a trie; and continuously maintain all the prefixes of data strings whose editdistance from the query are within the threshold. The major inherent problem is that thenumber of such prefixes is huge for the first few characters of the query and is exponential inthe alphabet size. This results in slow query response even if the entire query approximatelymatches only few prefixes. In this paper; we propose a novel neighborhood generation-based algorithm; IncNGTrie; which can achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup overexisting methods for the error-tolerant query autocompletion problem. Our proposed …,Proceedings of VLDB,2013,34
Nova: A novel and efficient framework for finding subgraph isomorphism mappings in large graphs,Ke Zhu; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Gaoping Zhu; Wei Wang,Abstract Considerable efforts have been spent in studying subgraph problem. Traditionalsubgraph containment query is to retrieve all database graphs which contain the querygraph g. A variation to that is to find all occurrences of a particular pattern (the query) in alarge database graph. We call it subgraph matching problem. The state of art solution to thisproblem is GADDI. In this paper; we will propose a more efficient index and algorithm toanswer subgraph matching problem. The index is based on the label distribution ofneighbourhood vertices and it is structured as a multi-dimensional vector signature. A novelalgorithm is also proposed to further speed up the isomorphic enumeration process. Thisalgorithm attempts to maximize the computational sharing. It also attempts to predict someenumeration state is impossible to lead to a final answer by eagerly pruning strategy. We …,Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,34
String similarity measures and joins with synonyms,Jiaheng Lu; Chunbin Lin; Wei Wang; Chen Li; Haiyong Wang,Abstract A string similarity measure quantifies the similarity between two text strings forapproximate string matching or comparison. For example; the strings" Sam" and" Samuel"can be considered similar. Most existing work that computes the similarity of two strings onlyconsiders syntactic similarities; eg; number of common words or q-grams. While these areindeed indicators of similarity; there are many important cases where syntactically differentstrings can represent the same real-world object. For example;" Bill" is a short form of"William". Given a collection of predefined synonyms; the purpose of the paper is to exploresuch existing knowledge to evaluate string similarity measures more effectively andefficiently; thereby boosting the quality of string matching. In particular; we first present anexpansion-based framework to measure string similarities efficiently while considering …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,32
AP-Tree: Efficiently Support Continuous Spatial-Keyword Queries over Stream,Xiang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang,We investigate the problem of processing a large amount of continuous spatial-keywordqueries over streaming data; which is essential in many applications such as location-basedrecommendation and advertising; thanks to the proliferation of geo-equipped devices andthe ensuing location-based social media applications. For example; a location-based e-coupon system may allow potentially millions of users to register their continuous spatial-keyword queries (eg; interests in nearby sales) by specifying a set of keywords and a spatialregion; the system then delivers each incoming spatial-textual object (eg; a geo-tagged e-coupon) to all the matched queries (ie; users) whose spatial and textual requirements aresatisfied. While there are several prior approaches aiming at providing efficient queryprocessing techniques for the problem; their approaches belong to spatial-first indexing …,ICDE 2015,2015,28
XClean: Providing valid spelling suggestions for XML keyword queries,Yifei Lu; Wei Wang; Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu,An important facility to aid keyword search on XML data is suggesting alternative querieswhen user queries contain typographical errors. Query suggestion thus can improve users'search experience by avoiding returning empty result or results of poor qualities. In thispaper; we study the problem of effectively and efficiently providing quality query suggestionsfor keyword queries on an XML document. We illustrate certain biases in previous work andpropose a principled and general framework; XClean; based on the state-of-the-artlanguage model. Compared with previous methods; XClean can accommodate differenterror models and XML keyword query semantics without losing rigor.

HmSearch: An Efficient Hamming Distance Query Processing Algorithm,Xiaoyang Zhang; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Yifang Sun; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract Hamming distance measures the number of dimensions where two vectors havedifferent values. In applications such as pattern recognition; information retrieval; anddatabases; we often need to efficiently process Hamming distance query; which retrievesvectors in a database that have no more than k Hamming distance from a given queryvector. Existing work on efficient Hamming distance query processing has some of thefollowing limitations; such as only applicable to tiny error threshold values; unable to dealwith vectors where the value domain is large; or unable to attain robust performance in thepresence of data skew. In this paper; we propose HmSearch; an efficient query processingmethod for Hamming distance queries that addresses the above-mentioned limitations.

Locating motifs in time-series data,Zheng Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin; Hongjun Lu; Wei Wang,Abstract Finding motifs in time-series is proposed to make clustering of time-seriessubsequences meaningful; because most existing algorithms of clustering time-seriessubsequences are reported meaningless in recent studies. The existing motif findingalgorithms emphasize the efficiency at the expense of quality; in terms of the number of time-series subsequences in a motif and the total number of motifs found. In this paper; weformalize the problem as a continuous top-k motif balls problem in an m-dimensional space;and propose heuristic approaches that can significantly improve the quality of motifs withreasonable overhead; as shown in our experimental studies.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2005,23
Efficient query processing for XML keyword queries based on the IDList index,Junfeng Zhou; Zhifeng Bao; Wei Wang; Jinjia Zhao; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Keyword search over XML data has attracted a lot of research efforts in the lastdecade; where one of the fundamental research problems is how to efficiently answer agiven keyword query wrt a certain query semantics. We found that the key factor resulting inthe inefficiency for existing methods is that they all heavily suffer from the common-ancestor-repetition problem. In this paper; we propose a novel form of inverted list; namely the IDList;the IDList for keyword k consists of ordered nodes that directly or indirectly contain k. Wethen show that finding keyword query results based on the smallest lowest commonancestor and exclusive lowest common ancestor semantics can be reduced to ordered setintersection problem; which has been heavily optimized due to its application in areas suchas information retrieval and database systems.

Reverse k Nearest Neighbors Query Processing: Experiments and Analysis.,Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Wei Lin; Xuemin; Wang,Abstract Given a set of users; a set of facilities and a query facility q; a reverse k nearestneighbors (RkNN) query returns every user u for which the query is one of its k closestfacilities. RkNN queries have been extensively studied under a variety of settings and manysophisticated algorithms have been proposed to answer these queries. However; theexisting experimental studies suffer from a few limitations. For example; some studiesestimate the I/O cost by charging a fixed penalty per I/O and we show that this may bemisleading. Also; the existing studies either use an extremely small buffer or no buffer at allwhich puts some algorithms at serious disadvantage. We show that the performance ofthese algorithms is significantly improved even when a small buffer (containing 100 pages)is used. Finally; in each of the existing studies; the proposed algorithm is mainly …,Proceedings of the VLDB endowment,2015,21

Quantile-based KNN over multi-valued objects,Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ying Zhang; Wei Wang,K Nearest Neighbor search has many applications including data mining; multi-media;image processing; and monitoring moving objects. In this paper; we study the problem ofKNN over multi-valued objects. We aim to provide effective and efficient techniques toidentify KNN sensitive to relative distributions of objects. We propose to use quantiles tosummarize relative-distribution-sensitive K nearest neighbors. Given a query Q and aquantile φ∈(0; 1]; we firstly study the problem of efficiently computing K nearest objectsbased on a φ-quantile distance (eg median distance) from each object to Q. The secondproblem is to retrieve the K nearest objects to Q based on overall distances in the “bestpopulation”(with a given size specified by φ-quantile) for each object. While the first problemcan be solved in polynomial time; we show that the 2nd problem is NP-hard. A set of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,16

Batch mode active learning for multi-label image classi-  cation with informative label correlation mining,B. Zhang; Y. Wang; Wei Wang,The performances of supervised learning techniques on image classification problemsheavily rely on the quality of their training images. But the acquisition of high quality trainingimages requires significant efforts from human annotators. In this paper; we propose a novelmulti-label batch model active learning (MLBAL) approach that allows the learning algorithmto actively select a batch of informative example-label pairs from which it learns at eachlearning iteration; so as to learn accurate classifiers with less annotation efforts. Unlikeexisting methods; the proposed approach fines the active selection granularity from exampleto example-label pair; and takes into account the informative label correlations for activelearning. And the empirical studies demonstrate its effectiveness.,WACV 2012,2012,10
PrefIndex: an efficient supergraph containment search technique,Gaoping Zhu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Wei Wang; Haichuan Shang,Abstract Graphs are prevailingly used in many applications to model complex datastructures. In this paper; we study the problem of supergraph containment search. To avoidthe NP-complete subgraph isomorphism test; most existing works follow the filtering-verification framework and select graph-features to build effective indexes; which filter falseresults (graphs) before conducting the costly verification. However; searching featuresmultiple times in the query graphs yields huge redundant computation; which leads to theemergence of the computation-sharing framework. This paper follows the roadmap ofcomputation-sharing framework to efficiently process supergraph containment queries.Firstly; database graphs are clustered into disjoint groups for sharing the computation costwithin each group.

Top-Down XML Keyword Query Processing,Junfeng Zhou; Wei Wang; Ziyang Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xian Tang; Yifei Lu; Yukun Li,Efficiently answering XML keyword queries has attracted much research effort in the lastdecade. The key factors resulting in the inefficiency of existing methods are the common-ancestor-repetition (CAR) and visiting-useless-nodes (VUN) problems. To address the CARproblem; we propose a generic top-down processing strategy to answer a given keywordquery wrt LCA/SLCA/ELCA semantics. By “top-down”; we mean that we visit all commonancestor (CA) nodes in a depth-first; left-to-right order; by “generic”; we mean that ourmethod is independent of the query semantics. To address the VUN problem; we propose touse child nodes; rather than descendant nodes to test the satisfiability of a node $ v $ wrt thegiven semantics. We propose two algorithms that are based on either traditional invertedlists or our newly proposed LLists to improve the overall performance.

Selectivity Estimation On Streaming Spatio-Textual Data Using Local Correlations,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang,Abstract In this paper; we investigate the selectivity estimation problem for streaming spatio-textual data; which arises in many social network and geo-location applications. Specifically;given a set of continuously and rapidly arriving spatio-textual objects; each of which isdescribed by a geo-location and a short text; we aim to accurately estimate the cardinality ofa spatial keyword query on objects seen so far; where a spatial keyword query consists of asearch region and a set of query keywords. To the best of our knowledge; this is the firstwork to address this important problem. We first extend two existing techniques to solve thisproblem; and show their limitations.

Most existing methodsanswering edit similarity queries employ schemes to generate string subsequences assignatures and generate candidates by set overlap queries on query and data signatures. Inthis article; we show that for any such signature scheme; the lower bound of the minimumnumber of signatures is τ &plus; 1; which is lower than what is achieved by existing methods.We then propose several asymmetric signature schemes; that is; extracting differentnumbers of signatures for the data and query strings; which achieve this lower bound. Abasic asymmetric scheme is first established on the basis of matching q-chunks and q-gramsbetween two strings.

However;there are many applications in which elements in a set may be uncertain due to variousreasons. Existing work on modeling such probabilistic sets and computing their similaritiessuffers from huge model sizes or significant similarity evaluation cost; and hence is onlyapplicable to small probabilistic sets. In this paper; we propose a simple yet expressivemodel that supports many applications where one probabilistic set may have thousands ofelements. We define two types of similarities between two probabilistic sets using thepossible world semantics; they complement each other in capturing the similaritydistributions in the cross product of possible worlds.

Answering approximate range aggregate queries on OLAP data cubes with Probabilistic Guarantees,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Wei Wang; Ugo Matrangolo,Abstract Approximate range aggregate queries are one of the most frequent and usefulkinds of queries for Decision Support Systems (DSS). Traditionally; sampling-basedtechniques have been proposed to tackle this problem. However; its effectiveness willdegrade when the underlying data distribution is skewed.

Similarity joins as stronger metric operations,Wei Wang,Abstract Similarity joins between two sets of records return pairs of records whose similarityis no less than a given threshold. More specifically; consider two sets of records; R and S; asimilarity function sim (.;.) and a threshold t; a similarity join between R and S is defined as{(r; s)|(r; s)∈ R x S; sim (r; s)≥ t}. A similarity join is a generalization of the traditional equalityjoin commonly found in database systems. A variant of the similarity join is to use a distancethreshold to replace the similarity threshold. It is generally expected that the similaritythreshold is close to the maximum possible value (usually 1.0); and the distance threshold isclose to the minimum possible value (usually 0). For example; we may find near-duplicatedocuments in a document repository using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.9; or we mayfind pairs of incorrectly spelt queries and their correct versions in a query log with an edit …,SIGSPATIAL Special,2010,5
Keyword search on relational databases,Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Yi Luo,Recent years have seen increasing interest in the search technology. For example; searchengines like Google have become the dominant avenue of obtaining information from theInternet. One of the factors that led to the success of search engines is that they adopt thekeyword-based search paradigm: users submit keywords to search engines and a rankedlist of relevant documents is returned. This enables even unsophisticated users to obtaininformation without detailed knowledge of the database schema or query languages. Whiletraditional relational database systems (RDBMSs) store the majority amount of the world'senterprise data; they provide only limited support for keyword search. Specifically; they onlysearch for single tuples that match all the query keywords. A few recent studies haverecognized the need to dynamically grouping the individual matching tuples to form …,Network and Parallel Computing Workshops,2007,5
Local Similarity Search for Unstructured Text,Pei Wang; Chuan Xiao; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Xiaoyang Zhang; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract With the growing popularity of electronic documents; replication can occur for manyreasons. People may copy text segments from various sources and make modifications. Inthis paper; we study the problem of local similarity search to find partially replicated text.Unlike existing studies on similarity search which find entirely duplicated documents; ourtarget is to identify documents that approximately share a pair of sliding windows which differby no more than τ tokens. Our problem is technically challenging because for slidingwindows the tokens to be indexed are less selective than entire documents; rendering setsimilarity join-based algorithms less efficient. Our proposed method is based onenumerating token combinations to obtain signatures with high selectivity. In order to strike abalance between signature and candidate generation; we partition the token universe …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,4

Top-down keyword query processing on xml data,Junfeng Zhou; Xingmin Zhao; Wei Wang; Ziyang Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Efficiently answering XML keyword queries has attracted much research effort in thelast decade. One key factors resulting in the inefficiency of existing methods are the common-ancestor-repetition (CAR) and visiting-useless-nodes (VUN) problems. In this paper; wepropose a generic top-down processing strategy to answer a given keyword query wrtLCA/SLCA/ELCA semantics. By top-down; we mean that we visit all common ancestor (CA)nodes in a depth-first; left-to-right order; thus avoid the CAR problem; by generic; we meanthat our method is independent of the labeling schemes and query semantics. We show thatthe satisfiability of a node v wrt the given semantics can be determined by v's child nodes;based on which our methods avoid the VUN problem. We propose two algorithms that arebased on either traditional inverted lists or our newly proposed LLists to improve the …,CIKM 2013,2013,4
Online learning for PLSA-based visual recognition,Jie Xu; Getian Ye; Yang Wang; Wei Wang; Jun Yang,Abstract Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) is one of the latent topic models andit has been successfully applied to visual recognition tasks. However; PLSA models havebeen learned mainly in batch learning; which can not handle data that arrives sequentially.In this paper; we propose a novel on-line learning algorithm for learning the parameters ofPLSA. Our contributions are two-fold:(i) an on-line learning algorithm that learns theparameters of a PLSA model from incoming data;(ii) a codebook adaptation algorithm thatcan capture the full characteristics of all the features during the learning. Experimentalresults demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can handle sequentially arriving data thatbatch PLSA learning cannot cope with; and its performance is comparable with that of thebatch PLSA learning on visual recognition.,Computer Vision–ACCV 2010,2010,4

As the existing similarity search techniques are not applicable; a noveland efficient algorithm is developed in this paper to approach the problem. The R-tree basedalgorithm consists of two steps: feature evaluation and similarity search. Our performanceevaluation demonstrates that the algorithm is very efficient for large spatial datasets.,WAIM 2005,2005,4
Efficient Maximum Closeness Centrality Group Identification,Chen Chen; Wei Wang; Xiaoyang Wang,Abstract As a key concept in the social networks; closeness centrality is widely adopted tomeasure the importance of a node. Many efficient algorithms are developed in the literatureto find the top-k closeness centrality nodes. In most of the previous work; nodes are treatedas irrelevant individuals for a top-k ranking. However; in many applications; it is required tofind a set of nodes that is the most important as a group. In this paper; we extend the conceptof closeness centrality to a set of nodes. We aim to find a set of k nodes that has the largestcloseness centrality as a whole. We show that the problem is NP-hard; and prove that theobjective function is monotonic and submodular. Therefore; the greedy algorithm can returna result with 1-1/e approximation ratio. In order to handle large graphs; we propose abaseline sampling algorithm (BSA). We further improve the sampling approach by …,Australasian Database Conference,2016,3

Multiple-instance learning from multiple perspectives: Combining models for multiple-instance learning,B. Zhang; Y.

Due to its flexible annotation mechanism; MILhas been naturally utilized on a variety of computer vision problems. And numerous modelshave been proposed; each of which is ingeniously designed to catch certain characteristicsof MIL. However different models only perform well on certain tasks; and furtherimprovement can hardly be achieved. In this paper; we propose a framework that combinesmultiple complementary models for solving MIL. Multiple-kernel learning as well as boostingbased ensemble learning are utilized to achieve optimal combination.

Learning top-k transformation rules,Sunanda Patro; Wei Wang,Abstract Record linkage identifies multiple records referring to the same entity even if theyare not bit-wise identical. It is thus an essential technology for data integration and datacleansing. Existing record linkage approaches are mainly relying on similarity functionsbased on the surface forms of the records; and hence are not able to identify complexcoreference records. This seriously limits the effectiveness of existing approaches. In thiswork; we propose an automatic method to extract top-k high quality transformation rulesgiven a set of possibly coreferent record pairs. We propose an effective algorithm thatperforms careful local analyses for each record pair and generates candidate rules; thealgorithm finally chooses top-k rules based on a scoring function. We have conductedextensive experiments on real datasets; and our proposed algorithm has substantial …,Database and Expert Systems Applications,2011,3

AB-Index: An Efficient Adaptive Index for Branching XML Queries,Bo Zhang; Wei Wang; Xiaoling Wang; Aoying Zhou,Abstract Query-adaptive XML indexing has been proposed and shown to be an efficient wayto accelerate XML query processing; because it dynamically adapts to the workload.However; existing adaptive index lack of support for branching queries; and also with lowefficiency for query processing and adaptation operations. In this paper; we propose a newAdaptive index for Branching queries; which is named as AB-Index. It is designed to supportXML path queries with branching predicates. Efficient index construction; query processing;and index adaptation algorithms are proposed for AB-Index. In the experiments; theproposed index is demonstrated to outperform the state-of-the-art approach in the area ofadaptive index in terms of query and adaptation efficiencies.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,3
Efficient computation of k-medians over data streams under memory constraints,Zhi-Hong Chong; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zhen-Jie Zhang; Xue-Min Lin; Wei Wang; Ao-Ying Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of efficiently computing k-medians over high-dimensional and high speed data streams. The focus of this paper is on the issue ofminimizing CPU time to handle high speed data streams on top of the requirements of highaccuracy and small memory. Our work is motivated by the following observation: the existingalgorithms have similar approximation behaviors in practice; even though they makenoticeably different worst case theoretical guarantees. The underlying reason is that in orderto achieve high approximation level with the smallest possible memory; they need rathercomplex techniques to maintain a sketch; along time dimension; by using some existing off-line clustering algorithms. Those clustering algorithms cannot guarantee the optimalclustering result over data segments in a data stream but accumulate errors over …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2006,3

The query processingof graph-structured XML document brings new challenges.

General Purpose Index-Based Method for Efficient MaxRS Query,Xiaoling Zhou; Wei Wang; Jianliang Xu,Abstract The Maximizing Range Sum problem is widely applied in facility locating; spatialdata mining; and clustering problems. The current most efficient method solves it in time O(n\log n) for a particular given rectangle size. This is inefficient in cases where the queriesare frequently called with different parameters. Thus; in this paper; we propose an index-based method that solves the maxRS query in time O (\log n) for any given query. Besides;our method can be used to solve the k-enclosing problem in time O (1) for any given k valueif indexes are sorted according to the optimizing criteria; or O ((nk)^ 2 k+ n\log n) withoutusing any index; which is comparative to the current most efficient work.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2016,2
Boosting the quality of approximate string matching by synonyms,Jiaheng Lu; Chunbin Lin; Wei Wang; Chen Li; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract A string-similarity measure quantifies the similarity between two text strings forapproximate string matching or comparison. For example; the strings “Sam” and “Samuel”can be considered to be similar. Most existing work that computes the similarity of two stringsonly considers syntactic similarities; for example; number of common words or q-grams.While this is indeed an indicator of similarity; there are many important cases wheresyntactically-different strings can represent the same real-world object. For example;“Bill” isa short form of “William;” and “Database Management Systems” can be abbreviated as“DBMS.” Given a collection of predefined synonyms; the purpose of this article is to exploresuch existing knowledge to effectively evaluate the similarity between two strings andefficiently perform similarity searches and joins; thereby boosting the quality of …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,2
XML keyword search with promising result type recommendations,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Rui Zhou; Wei Wang,Abstract Keyword search enables inexperienced users to easily search XML database withno specific knowledge of complex structured query languages and XML data schemas.Existing work has addressed the problem of selecting data nodes that match keywords andconnecting them in a meaningful way; eg; SLCA and ELCA. However; it is time-consumingand unnecessary to serve all the connected subtrees to the users because in general theusers are only interested in part of the relevant results. In this paper; we propose a newkeyword search approach which basically utilizes the statistics of underlying XML data todecide the promising result types and then quickly retrieves the corresponding results withthe help of selected promising result types. To guarantee the quality of the selectedpromising result types; we measure the correlations between result types and a keyword …,World Wide Web,2014,2
Informative frequent assembled feature for face detection,Bang Zhang; Getian Ye; Yang Wang; Wei Wang; Jie Xu; Gunawan Herman; Jun Yang,In this paper; we propose a novel approach to automatically generating; instead of manuallydesigning; discriminative visual features for face detection. The features are composed bymultiple local features (eg; Haar features); and such features can capture not only the localtexture information but also their spatial configurations. Therefore; the proposed featurecontains rich semantic information so that the classifier built on a set of such features canachieve high accuracy and high efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposedapproach outperforms the techniques based on local features and the state-of-the-artdiscriminative features for face detection.,Image Processing (ICIP); 2009 16th IEEE International Conference on,2009,2
Practical indexing XML document for twig query,Hongzhi Wang; Wei Wang; Jianzhong Li; Xuemin Lin; Reymond Wong,Abstract Answering structural queries of XML with index is an important approach of efficientXML query processing. Among existing structural indexes for XML data; F&B index is thesmallest index that can answer all branching queries. However; an F&B index for lessregular XML data often contains a large number of index nodes; and hence a large amountof main memory. If the F&B index cannot be accommodated in the available memory; itsperformance will degrade significantly. This issue has practically limited wider application ofthe F&B index. In this paper; we propose a disk organization method for the F&B index whichshift part of the leave nodes in the F&B index to the disk and organize them judiciously onthe disk. Our method is based on the observation that the majority of the nodes in a F&Bindex is often the leaf nodes; yet their access frequencies are not high. We select some …,Advances in Computer Science–ASIAN 2005. Data Management on the Web,2005,2
Query-aware locality-sensitive hashing scheme for $ $ l_p $ $ lp norm,Qiang Huang; Jianlin Feng; Qiong Fang; Wilfred Ng; Wei Wang,Abstract The problem of c-Approximate Nearest Neighbor (c-ANN) search in high-dimensional space is fundamentally important in many applications; such as imagedatabase and data mining. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its variants are the well-known indexing schemes to tackle the c-ANN search problem. Traditionally; LSH functionsare constructed in a query-oblivious manner; in the sense that buckets are partitioned beforeany query arrives. However; objects closer to a query may be partitioned into differentbuckets; which is undesirable. Due to the use of query-oblivious bucket partition; the state-of-the-art LSH schemes for external memory; namely C2LSH and LSB-Forest; only work withapproximation ratio of integer c ≥ 2 c≥ 2. In this paper; we introduce a novel concept ofquery-aware bucket partition which uses a given query as the “anchor” for bucket partition …,The VLDB Journal,2017,1
Graph summarization for entity relatedness visualization,Yukai Miao; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang,Abstract In modern search engines; Knowledge Graphs have become a key component forknowledge discovery. When a user searches for an entity; the existing systems usuallyprovide a list of related entities; but they do not necessarily give explanations of how theyare related. However; with the help of knowledge graphs; we can generate relatednessgraphs between any pair of existing entities. Existing methods of this problem are eithergraph-based or list-based; but they all have some limitations when dealing with largecomplex relatedness graphs of two related entity. In this work; we investigate how tosummarize the relatedness graphs and how to use the summarized graphs to assistant theusers to retrieve target information. We also implemented our approach in an online querysystem and performed experiments and evaluations on it.

An Index-Based Method for Efficient Maximizing Range Sum Queries in Road Network,Xiaoling Zhou; Wei Wang,Abstract Given a set of positive weighted points; the Maximizing Range Sum (maxRS)problem finds the placement of a query region r of given size such that the weight sum ofpoints covered by r is maximized. This problem has long been studied since its wideapplication in spatial data mining; facility locating; and clustering problems. However; mostof the existing work focus on Euclidean space; which is not applicable in many real-lifecases. For example; in location-based services; the spatial data points can only be accessedby following certain underlying (road) network; rather than straight-line access. Thus in thispaper; we study the maxRS problem with road network constraint; and propose an index-based method that solves the online queries highly efficiently.,Australasian Database Conference,2016,1
BEVA: An Efficient Query Processing Algorithm for Error-Tolerant Autocompletion,Xiaoling Zhou; Jianbin Qin; Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Query autocompletion has become a standard feature in many search applications;especially for search engines. A recent trend is to support the error-tolerant autocompletion;which increases the usability significantly by matching prefixes of database strings andallowing a small number of errors. In this article; we systematically study the queryprocessing problem for error-tolerant autocompletion with a given edit distance threshold.We propose a general framework that encompasses existing methods and characterizesdifferent classes of algorithms and the minimum amount of information they need to maintainunder different constraints. We then propose a novel evaluation strategy that achieves theminimum active node size by eliminating ancestor-descendant relationships among activenodes entirely. In addition; we characterize the essence of edit distance computation by a …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,1

Visual Specification and Optimization of XQuery Using VXQ,Ryan Choi; Raymond Wong; Wei Wang,Abstract As the popularity of XML increases; the need for querying collections of XML datafrom various systems becomes imperative. Proposed by W3C; XQuery is becoming astandard for querying such systems. However; the complexity of XQuery prevents its usageby broad audience. This paper proposes a visual XQuery specification language called VXQto address this issue. By intuitive abstractions of XML and XQuery; the proposed system cangenerate XQueries for users that have little knowledge about the language. We show thatour visual language is more expressive than previous proposals. Finally; we extend ourproposed visual XQuery to support query rewriting and optimization for multiple XQuerysystems.,Database and Expert Systems Applications,2006,1
Efficient Approximate Entity Matching Using Jaro-Winkler Distance,Yaoshu Wang; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang,Abstract Jaro-Winkler distance is a measurement to measure the similarity between twostrings. Since Jaro-Winkler distance performs well in matching personal and entity names; itis widely used in the areas of record linkage; entity linking; information extraction. Given aquery string q; Jaro-Winkler distance similarity search finds all strings in a dataset D whoseJaro-Winkler distance similarity with q is no more than a given threshold τ. With the growth ofthe dataset size; to efficiently perform Jaro-Winkler distance similarity search becomeschallenge problem.

Pre-computed region guardian sets based reverse kNN queries,Wei Song; Jianbin Qin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Wei Wang,Abstract Given a set of objects and a query q; a point p is q's Reverse k Nearest Neighbour(R k NN) if q is one of p'sk-closest objects. R k NN queries have received significantresearch attention in the past few years. However; we realize that the state-of-the-artalgorithm; SLICE; accesses many objects that do not contribute to its R k NN results whenrunning the filtering phase; which deteriorates the query performance. In this paper; wepropose a novel R k NN algorithm with pre-computation by partitioning the data space intodisjoint rectangular regions and constructing the guardian set for each region R. Weguarantee that; for each q that lies in R; its R k NN results are only affected by the objects inR's guardian set. The advantage of this approach is that the results of a query q ∈ R q∈ Rcan be computed by using SLICE on only the objects in its guardian set instead of using …,Data Science and Engineering,2016,*

It is an important tool in many applicationssuch as data visualization. In this paper; we focus on the population mean as our primaryestimation function; and propose effective query processing strategy that can preserve theestimated order to be correct with probabilistic guarantees. We define the cost function asthe number of samples taken for all the groups; and our goal is to make the sample size assmall as possible.

On Gapped Set Intersection Size Estimation,Chen Chen; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang,Abstract There exists considerable literature on estimating the cardinality of set intersectionresult. In this paper; we consider a generalized problem for integer sets where; given a gapparameter δ; two elements are deemed as matches if their numeric difference equals δ or iswithin δ. We call this problem the gapped set intersection size estimation (GSISE/); and itcan be used to model applications in database systems; data mining; and informationretrieval. We first distinguish two subtypes of the estimation problem: the point gapestimation and range gap estimation. We propose optimized sketches to tackle the twoproblems efficiently and effectively with theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate the usageof our proposed techniques in mining top-K related keywords efficiently; by integrating withan inverted index.

XML query processing using views,Caiyun Yao; Jiaheng Lu; Wei Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract A fundamental problem in XML query processing is tree pattern query (TPQ)matching which computes all data instances in an XML database that match an input TPQ.More recently; there is growing attention on applying materialized views; which is anestablished and effective optimization technique in relational database systems; to TPQmatching. We study the query answering using views problem for tree pattern queries (QAV).The QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways:(i) find a maximal result; or (ii) findan equivalent result. For the former; there exists an idea of searching for a maximalcontained rewriting; by applying some compensation to the result of view. Because not allthe answers will be returned; some useful answers may be missing. Motivated by this; westudy the latter one—finding an equivalent rewriting of tree pattern queries.

A space-efficient indexing algorithm for boolean query processing,Jianbin Qin; Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Inverted indexes are the fundamental index for information retrieval systems. Due tothe correlation between terms; inverted lists in the index may have substantial overlap andhence redundancy. In this paper; we propose a new approach that reduces the size ofinverted lists while retaining time-efficiency. Our solution is based on merging inverted liststhat bear high overlap to each other and manage their content in the resulting condensedindex. An efficient algorithm is designed to discover heavily-overlapped inverted lists andconstruct the condensed index for a given dataset. We demonstrate that our algorithmdelivers considerable space saving while incurring little query performance overhead.,WISE 2012,2012,*
Fast SLCA and ELCA Computation for XML Keyword Query Based on Set Intersection Operation,Junfeng Zhou; Zhifeng Bao; Wei Wang; Wang Ling TOK; Ziyang Chen; Xudong Lin; Jingfeng Guo,In this paper; we focus on efficient keyword query processing on XML data based on SLCAand ELCA semantics. We have an elaborate design of the keyword inverted list to efficientlylocate the nodes that directly or indirectly contain a given keyword. We propose a family ofalgorithms that are based on set intersection operation to accelerate SLCA and ELCAcomputation. In essence; the problem of SLCA and ELCA computation becomes finding aset of common nodes that appear in all inverted lists and checking their satisfiability. Weshow that any existing set intersection algorithms can be adopted for SLCA and ELCAcomputation; and our optimization techniques can be used together with any existing searchmethod to improve the overall performance. Experiments verify that the performance of ourmethods outperforms existing methods by more than 2 orders of magnitude in most cases.,*,2011,*

Pushing Theoretically-Founded Probabilistic Guarantees in Highly-Efficient OLAP Engines,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Wei Wang,Abstract Efficient aggregate query processing is a main requirement for Decision SupportSystems (DSS); due to the very large size of the multidimensional data stored in theunderlying Data Warehouse Server (DWS). Approximate aggregate query processing isable to provide fast answers to aggregate queries by trading off accuracy for efficiency; andhas become a useful tool to many DSS-based applications. Researchers have devoted agreat deal of attention to the problem of efficiently compressing data cubes in order toretrieve approximate answers having low query errors. However; few works only focus onthe problem of deriving theoretical bounds over these errors; which is indeed a criticalaspect for any database/datacube approximation technique.
