Network-aware query processing for stream-based applications,Yanif Ahmad; Uğur Çetintemel,Abstract This paper investigates the benefits of network awareness when processingqueries in widely-distributed environments such as the Internet. We present algorithms thatleverage knowledge of network characteristics (eg; topology; bandwidth; etc.) when decidingon the network locations where the query operators are executed. Using a detailedemulation study based on realistic network models; we analyse and experimentally evaluatethe proposed approaches for distributed stream processing. Our results quantify thesignificant benefits of the network-aware approaches and reveal the fundamental trade-offbetween bandwidth efficiency and result latency that arises in networked query processing.,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,157
A type system for statically detecting spreadsheet errors,Yanif Ahmad; Tudor Antoniu; Sharon Goldwater; Shriram Krishnamurthi,We describe a methodology for detecting user errors in spreadsheets; using the notion ofunits as our basic elements of checking. We define the concept of a header and discuss twotypes of relationships between headers; namely is-a and has-a relationships. With these; wedevelop a set of rules to assign units to cells in the spreadsheet. We check for errors byensuring that every cell has a well-formed unit. We describe an implementation of thesystem that allows the user to check Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. We have run our systemon practical examples; and even found errors in published spreadsheets.,Automated Software Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 18th IEEE International Conference on,2003,95

Dbtoaster: Higher-order delta processing for dynamic; frequently fresh views,Yanif Ahmad; Oliver Kennedy; Christoph Koch; Milos Nikolic,Abstract Applications ranging from algorithmic trading to scientific data analysis requirerealtime analytics based on views over databases that change at very high rates. Suchviews have to be kept fresh at low maintenance cost and latencies. At the same time; theseviews have to support classical SQL; rather than window semantics; to enable applicationsthat combine current with aged or historical data. In this paper; we present viewlettransforms; a recursive finite differencing technique applied to queries. The viewlet transformmaterializes a query and a set of its higher-order deltas as views. These views support eachother's incremental maintenance; leading to a reduced overall view maintenance cost. Theviewlet transform of a query admits efficient evaluation; the elimination of certain expensivequery operations; and aggressive parallelization.

DBToaster: A SQL compiler for high-performance delta processing in main-memory databases,Yanif Ahmad; Christoph Koch,Abstract We present DBToaster; a novel query compilation framework for producing highperformance compiled query executors that incrementally and continuously answer standingaggregate queries using in-memory views. DBToaster targets applications that requireefficient main-memory processing of standing queries (views) fed by high-volume datastreams; recursively compiling view maintenance (VM) queries into simple C++ functions forevaluating database updates (deltas). While today's VM algorithms consider the impact ofsingle deltas on view queries to produce maintenance queries; we recursively considerdeltas of maintenance queries and compile to thoroughly transform queries into code.Recursive compilation successively elides certain scans and joins; and eliminatessignificant query plan interpreter overheads.

COLR-Tree: Communication-efficient spatio-temporal indexing for a sensor data web portal,Yanif Ahmad; Suman Nath,We present COLR-Tree; an abstraction layer designed to support efficient spatio-temporalqueries on live data gathered from a large collection of sensors. We use COLR-Tree in apublicly-available sensor web portal to separate the concerns of sensor data managementfrom the web portal application. COLR-Tree uses two techniques to optimize end-to-endlatencies of users' queries by minimizing expensive data collection from sensors. First; ituses a novel technique to effectively cache aggregate results computed over sensor datawith different expiry times. Second; it incorporates an efficient one-pass sampling algorithmwith its range lookup to utilize cached data and compensate for occasional unavailability ofsensors. We evaluate our implementation of COLR-Tree on SQL Server 2005 with a real;large workload from Windows Live Local. Our experiments demonstrate that COLR-Tree …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

DBToaster: higher-order delta processing for dynamic; frequently fresh views,Christoph Koch; Yanif Ahmad; Oliver Kennedy; Milos Nikolic; Andres Nötzli; Daniel Lupei; Amir Shaikhha,Abstract Applications ranging from algorithmic trading to scientific data analysis require real-time analytics based on views over databases receiving thousands of updates each second.Such views have to be kept fresh at millisecond latencies.

Communication efficient spatial search in a sensor data web portal,*,Techniques for collecting and displaying sensor data captured by a spatially representativesample of sensors requested in a search query are described. The sensors are representedin an index structure (eg; a data tree). In response to a query; the index structure isleveraged to identify a subset of sensors that exhibits a similar spatial distribution to theoriginal full set of sensors. Sensor data is then collected from the subset of sensors byprobing the sensors or retrieving recently cached data located by the index and returned tosatisfy the query. In this manner; the number of sensors to be probed is reduced; therebyreducing latency involved with polling a large number of sensors and making the searchprocess more efficient.,*,2009,23
Static spherically symmetric wormholes in f (R; T) gravity,M Zubair; Saira Waheed; Yasir Ahmad,Abstract In this work; we explore wormhole solutions in f (R; T) theory of gravity; where R isthe scalar curvature and T is the trace of stress-energy tensor of matter. To investigate this;we consider a static spherically symmetric geometry with matter contents as anisotropic;isotropic; and barotropic fluids in three separate cases. By taking into account theStarobinsky f (R) model; we analyze the behavior of energy conditions for these differentkinds of fluids. It is shown that the wormhole solutions can be constructed without exoticmatter in few regions of space-time. We also give the graphical illustration of the resultsobtained and discuss the equilibrium picture for the anisotropic case only. It is concludedthat the wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter are realistic and stable in this theory ofgravity.,The European Physical Journal C,2016,19
Slot-cache for caching aggregates of data with different expiry times,*,Techniques for collecting and displaying sensor data captured by a spatially and temporallyrepresentative sample of sensors requested in a search query are described. The sensorsare represented in an index structure (eg; a data tree) having a plurality of leaf nodes andinternal nodes. The leaf nodes are associated with sensors and the internal nodes areallotted with caches having cache slots for storing sensor data with various expiry times. Inresponse to a query; the index structure is leveraged to identify a set of nodes associatedwith sensors of a user selected spatial region. Sensor data having an expiry time greaterthan a user specified expiry time is then collected from one or more cache slots of the set ofnodes. In this manner; the number of sensors to be probed to collect the sensor data isreduced.,*,2012,19

In a nutshell; a DDMS manages large dynamic datastructures with agile; frequently fresh views; and provides a facility for monitoring theseviews and triggering application-level events. We motivate DDMS with applications in large-scale data analytics; database monitoring; and high-frequency algorithmic trading.

I/O streaming evaluation of batch queries for data-intensive computational turbulence,Kalin Kanov; Eric Perlman; Randal Burns; Yanif Ahmad; Alexander Szalay,Abstract We describe a method for evaluating computational turbulence queries; includingLagrange Polynomial interpolation; based on partial sums that allows the underlying data tobe accessed in any order and in parts. We exploit these properties to stream data from diskin a single pass and concurrently evaluate batch queries. The combination of sequential I/Oand data sharing improves performance by an order of magnitude when compared withdirect evaluation of each query. The technique also supports distributed evaluation ofqueries in a database cluster; assembling the partial sums from each node at the querymediator. Interpolation is fundamental to computational turbulence; over 95% of queries usethese routines; and the partial sums method allows the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster torealize scale and throughput for our scientists' data-intensive workloads.,Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing; Networking; Storage and Analysis,2011,15
Simultaneous equation systems for query processing on continuous-time data streams,Yanif Ahmad; Olga Papaemmanouil; Ugur Cetintemel; Jennie Rogers,We introduce Pulse; a framework for processing continuous queries over models ofcontinuous-time data; which can compactly and accurately represent many real-worldactivities and processes. Pulse implements several query operators; including filters;aggregates and joins; that work by solving simultaneous equation systems; which in manycases is significantly cheaper than processing a stream of tuples. As such; Pulse translatesregular queries to work on continuous-time inputs; to reduce computational overhead andlatency while meeting user-specified error bounds on query results. For error boundchecking; Pulse uses an approximate query inversion technique that ensures the solverexecutes infrequently and only in the presence of errors; or no previously known results.

The Aurora and Borealis Stream Processing Engines,Uğur Çetintemel; Daniel Abadi; Yanif Ahmad; Hari Balakrishnan; Magdalena Balazinska; Mitch Cherniack; Jeong-Hyon Hwang; Samuel Madden; Anurag Maskey; Alexander Rasin; Esther Ryvkina; Mike Stonebraker; Nesime Tatbul; Ying Xing; Stan Zdonik,Abstract Over the last several years; a great deal of progress has been made in the area ofstream-processing engines (SPEs). Three basic tenets distinguish SPEs from current dataprocessing engines. First; they must support primitives for streaming applications. UnlikeOnline Transaction Processing (OLTP); which processes messages in isolation; streamingapplications entail time series operations on streams of messages. Second; streamingapplications entail a real-time component. If one is content to see an answer later; then onecan store incoming messages in a data warehouse and run a historical query on thewarehouse to find information of interest. This tactic does not work if the answer must beconstructed in real time. The need for real-time answers also dictates a fundamentallydifferent storage architecture.

Locality aware networked join evaluation,Yanif Ahmad; Ugur Cetintemel; John Jannotti; Alexander Zgolinski,We pose the question: how do we efficiently evaluate a join operator; distributed over aheterogeneous network? Our objective here is to optimize the delay of output tuples. Wediscuss key challenges involved in the distribution; namely how to partition the join operator;how to place the resulting partitions on the network; and how to route inputs values fromsources to our operators. Our model revolves on one simple concept-exploiting locality. Weconsider data locality in the distributions of input data values; and network locality in thedistribution of network distances between sites. We sketch strategies to partition the inputdata space; and instantiate a structured topology; consisting of operator replicas to whom toroute tuples for processing.

Nodes comprise of tiny power battery. Nodes sense the data and send it to BS.WSNs need protocol for efficient energy consumption of the network. In direct transmissionand minimum transmission energy routing protocols; energy consumption is not welldistributed. However; LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a clusteringprotocol; randomly selects the Cluster Heads (CHs) in each round. However; randomselection of CHs does not guarantee efficient energy consumption of the network. Therefore;we proposed new clustering techniques in routing protocols; Location-aware Permanent CH(LPCH) and User Defined Location-aware Permanent CH (UDLPCH).

Declarative temporal data models for sensor-driven query processing,Yanif Ahmad; Uğur Çetintemel,Abstract Many sensor network applications monitor continuous phenomena by sampling;and fit time-varying models that capture the phenomena's behaviors. We introduce Pulse; aframework for processing continuous queries over these continuous-time data models.Pulse allows users to declaratively specify both their queries and models; and transformsthese queries into simultaneous equation systems; which in many cases are significantlycheaper to process than a stream of discrete tuples.

Data stream management architectures and prototypes,Yanif Ahmad; Uğur Çetintemel,realized using such logical structures. For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,6

The University of Tokyo; Tokyo;Japan. Clarifying the mechanism of protein-ligand interactions is one of the most important researchsubjects in the field of biophysics. However; most of the research efforts have been devoted topredicting the docking structures. The process of ligand binding remains to be clarified. Moleculardynamics simula- tion is a straightforward way to study the ligand-binding process. However;reproducing the ligand-binding process in an all-atom simulation is quite diffi- cult because itrequires a very long time simulation. For this reason; we have explored the possibility ofcoarse-grained simulation. In this study; we used the MARTINI force field; in which four non-hydrogenatoms are mapped to one particle on average. We performed ligand-binding simulations …,58th Annual Meeting of the Biophysical-Society,2014,*
Learning About Transitions: Adaptive Controls for the Molecular Dynamics Database,Sarana Y Nutanong; Yanif Ahmad; Thomas B Woolf; I-Jeng Wang,Improvements in sampling on the events leading to transitions can provide significantinsights into what drives biomolecular change. We present additions to our MolecularDynamics Database (MDDB). We start with the transitions seen in BPTI from DEShawResearch (Science; 2010) using their long-running 1 ms trajectory as the basis for a Markovchain with states and transitions analyzed from the Anton production trajectory. Ouralgorithm works by resampling snapshot conformations known to be right before transitionevents; creating an ensemble set of transitions preconditioned on sampling in the spacenear to the transitions.,Biophysical Journal,2014,*
Database Guided Exploration to Determine Native Ligands for Orphaned Odorant Receptors,Sarana Nutanong; Kyle Wong; Yanif Ahmad; Jen Pluznick; Blythe Shepard; Thomas B Woolf,Despite significant advances in purification and in high-throughput experimental design; theassignment of ligands to orphaned odorant receptors is difficult. We describe thedevelopment of a three stage computational database that is coupled with experimentalmeasurements to aid the de-orphanization process. We posit that apo receptorconformations can be found that rationalize binding and non-binding ligands first measuredin experiment. The challenge is to find the best receptor models in this large set ofcandidates.,Biophysical Journal,2014,*
Open-Universe Theory for Bayesian Inference; Decision; and Sensing (OUTBIDS),Stuart Russell; Shankar Sastry; Rene Vidal; I Wang; Andreas Terzis; Yanif Ahmad; Avi Pfeffer; Edwin Chong,Abstract: This report describes work in Phase I of the OUTBIDS project under the DARPAMSEE program. The goal of OUTBIDS was to develop the theoretical and technologicalfoundations for sensor data interpretation as a form of probabilistic inference. Achieving thisgoal requires a representation formalism for probability models of sufficient expressivepower to handle the complexity of real-world sensor data. The problem involves two primarysources of difficulty: first; the underlying world generating the data typically contains manyinitially unknown objects interacting over time in complex ways; second; the mapping fromobjects and behaviors to sensor data is itself (as in the case of visual perception; forexample) very complex. The core of the project is the BLOG (Bayesian LOGic) language;which combines probabilistic semantics with the expressive power of first-order logic …,*,2014,*
Abstraction Without Regret in Database Systems Building: a Manifesto,Yanif Ahmad; Hassan Chafi; Thierry Coppey; Mohammad Dashti; Vojin Jovanovic; Oliver Kennedy; Yannis Klonatos; Milos Nikolic; Andres Noetzli; Martin Odersky; Tiark Rompf; Amir Shaikhha,Abstract It has been said that all problems in computer science can be solved by addinganother level of indirection; except for performance problems; which are solved by removinglevels of indirection. Compilers are our tools for removing levels of indirection automatically.However; we do not trust them when it comes to systems building. Most performance-criticalsystems are built in low-level programming languages such as C. Some of the downsides ofthis compared to using modern high-level programming languages are very well known:bugs; poor programmer productivity; a talent bottleneck; and cruelty to programminglanguage researchers. In the future we might even add suboptimal performance to this list. Inthis article; I argue that compilers can be competitive with and outperform human experts atlow-level database systems programming. Performance-critical database systems are a …,*,2014,*
Continued Sampling: Using Data Aware Feedback and Control for Peptide Conformational Search,Thomas B Woolf; Yanif Ahmad,Sampling till completion is a new framework for conformational search that uses a coupledfeedback between running computational dynamics and a large database. By using thisfeedback we can get improved convergence as well as more efficient sampling. We haveapplied this concept to sampling of peptide degrees of freedom and the first part of ourpresentation will highlight the challenges in making this idea work by addressing bothhardware and software issues. This includes our efforts to create rapid query evaluationsand our use of coupled CPU and GPU systems.,Biophysical Journal,2013,*
Streaming applications,Yanif Ahmad; Uĝur Çetintemel,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,*

Evaluating Progress in Probabilistic Programming through Topic Models,Francis Ferraro; Benjamin Van Durme; Yanif Ahmad,Abstract Topic models have proven versatile over the past decade; particularly as partialembeddings within more intricate models. These models present challenges that areanalytic; computational and engineering in nature. Advances in probabilistic programminghave the potential to circumvent a number of these issues; but researchers need a way tocoarsely evaluate these frameworks. We identify three axes of a successful framework andargue that computational efficiency of straight LDA provides one such lens. We provide andrelease a modular open-source testbed to systematically capture one aspect of currentprobabilistic programming and discuss initial results on both heavily-controlled and “real”data.,*,*,*

Statically Finding Errors in Spreadsheets,Yanif Ahmad; Tudor Antoniu; Sharon Goldwater; Shriram Krishnamurthi,Abstract We describe a methodology for detecting user errors in spreadsheets; using thenotion of units as our basic elements of checking. We define the concept of a header anddiscuss two types of relationships between headers; namely is-a and has-a relationships.With these; we develop a set of rules to assign units to cells in the spreadsheet. We check forerrors by ensuring that every cell has a well-formed unit. We describe an implementation ofthe system that allows the user to check Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.,*,*,*
