Routing questions to the right users in online communities,Yanhong Zhou; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian S Jensen; Junjie Yao,Online forums contain huge amounts of valuable user-generated content. In current forumsystems; users have to passively wait for other users to visit the forum systems andread/answer their questions. The user experience for question answering suffers from thisarrangement. In this paper; we address the problem of" pushing" the right questions to theright persons; the objective being to obtain quick; high-quality answers; thus improving usersatisfaction. We propose a framework for the efficient and effective routing of a givenquestion to the top-k potential experts (users) in a forum; by utilizing both the content andstructures of the forum system. First; we compute the expertise of users according to thecontent of the forum system—-this is to estimate the probability of a user being an expert fora given question based on the previous question answering of the user. Specifically; we …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,111
Challenging the Long Tail Recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Jing Li; Junjie Yao; Chen Chen,Abstract The success of" infinite-inventory" retailers such as Amazon. com and Netflix hasbeen largely attributed to a" long tail" phenomenon. Although the majority of their inventoryis not in high demand; these niche products; unavailable at limited-inventory competitors;generate a significant fraction of total revenue in aggregate. In addition; tail productavailability can boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of" one-stopshopping" for both their mainstream and niche tastes. However; most of existingrecommender systems; especially collaborative filter based methods; can not recommendtail products due to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that torecommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long tail productsadds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this paper; we propose a novel …,VLDB 2012,2012,100
A unified model for stable and temporal topic detection from social media data,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Hua Lu; Yuxin Huang; Junjie Yao,Web 2.0 users generate and spread huge amounts of messages in online social media.Such user-generated contents are mixture of temporal topics (eg; breaking events) andstable topics (eg; user interests). Due to their different natures; it is important and useful todistinguish temporal topics from stable topics in social media. However; such adiscrimination is very challenging because the user-generated texts in social media are veryshort in length and thus lack useful linguistic features for precise analysis using traditionalapproaches. In this paper; we propose a novel solution to detect both stable and temporaltopics simultaneously from social media data. Specifically; a unified user-temporal mixturemodel is proposed to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics. To improve this model'sperformance; we design a regularization framework that exploits prior spatial information …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,51
Bursty event detection from collaborative tags,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Yuxin Huang; Yanhong Zhou,Abstract Collaborative tagging have emerged as a ubiquitous way to annotate and organizeonline resources. As a kind of descriptive keyword; large amount of tags are created andassociated to multiple types of resources; eg; web pages; photos; videos and tweets. Users'tagging actions over time reflect their changing interests. Monitoring and analyzing thetemporal patterns of tags can provide important insights to trace hot topics on the web.Existing work focuses on deriving temporal patterns for individual tags. However; there existremarkable correlations among tags assigned to online resources. In this paper; we proposea new approach to detect bursty tagging event; which captures the relations among a groupof correlated tags where the tags are either bursty or associated with bursty tag co-occurrence. This kind of bursty tagging event generally corresponds to a real life event. It …,World Wide Web,2011,43
Temporal and Social Context based Burst Detection from Folksonomies,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Yuxin Huang; Xin Jin,Abstract Burst detection is an important topic in temporal stream analysis. Usually; only thetextual features are used in burst detection. In the theme extraction from current prevailingsocial media content; it is necessary to consider not only textual features but also thepervasive collaborative context; eg; resource lifetime and user activity. This paper exploresnovel approaches to combine multiple sources of such indication for better burst extraction.We systematically investigate the characters of collaborative context; ie; metadata frequency;topic coverage and user attractiveness. First; a robust state based model is utilized to detectbursts from individual streams. We then propose a learning method to combine these burstpulses. Experiments on a large real dataset demonstrate the remarkable improvements overthe traditional methods.,Proceedings of AAAI,2010,42
Parallel subgraph listing in a large-scale graph,Yingxia Shao; Bin Cui; Lei Chen; Lin Ma; Junjie Yao; Ning Xu,Abstract Subgraph listing is a fundamental operation to many graph and network analyses.The problem itself is computationally expensive and is well-studied in centralizedprocessing algorithms. However; the centralized solutions cannot scale well to large graphs.Recently; several parallel approaches are introduced to handle the large graphs.Unfortunately; these parallel approaches still rely on the expensive join operations; thuscannot achieve high performance. In this paper; we design a novel parallel subgraph listingframework; named PSgL. The PSgL iteratively enumerates subgraph instances and solvesthe subgraph listing in a divide-and-conquer fashion. The framework completely relies onthe graph traversal; and avoids the explicit join operation. Moreover; in order to improve itsperformance; we propose several solutions to balance the workload and reduce the size …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,36
Provenance-based Indexing Support in Micro-blog Platforms,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Zijun Xue; Qingyun Liu,Recently; lots of micro-blog message sharing applications have emerged on the web. Userscan publish short messages freely and get notified by the subscriptions instantly. Prominentexamples include Twitter; Facebook's statuses; and Sina Weibo in China. The Micro-blogplatform becomes a useful service for real time information creation and propagation.However; these messages' short length and dynamic characters have posed greatchallenges for effective content understanding. Additionally; the noise and fragments make itdifficult to discover the temporal propagation trail to explore development of micro-blogmessages. In this paper; we propose a provenance model to capture connections betweenmicro-blog messages. Provenance refers to data origin identification and transformationlogging; demonstrating of great value in recent database and workflow systems. To cope …,ICDE 2012,2012,31
TeRec: A Temporal Recommender System Over Tweet Stream,Chen Chen; Hongzhi Yin; Junjie Yao; Bin Cui,Abstract As social media further integrates into our daily lives; people are increasinglyimmersed in real-time social streams via services such as Twitter and Weibo. One importantobservation in these online social platforms is that users' interests and the popularity oftopics shift very fast; which poses great challenges on existing recommender systems toprovide the right topics at the right time. In this paper; we extend the online rankingtechnique and propose a temporal recommender system-TeRec. In TeRec; when postingtweets; users can get recommendations of topics (hashtags) according to their real-timeinterests; they can also generate fast feedbacks according to the recommendations. TeRecprovides the browser-based client interface which enables the users to access the real timetopic recommendations; and the server side processes and stores the real-time stream …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,29
Community level diffusion extraction,Zhiting Hu; Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Eric Xing,Abstract How does online content propagate on social networks? Billions of users generate;consume; and spread tons of information every day. This unprecedented scale of dynamicsbecomes invaluable to reflect our zeitgeist. However; most present diffusion extraction workshave only touched individual user level and cannot obtain comprehensive clues. This paperintroduces a new approach; ie; COmmunity Level Diffusion (COLD); to uncover and exploretemporal diffusion. We model topics and communities in a unified latent framework; andextract inter-community influence dynamics. With a well-designed multi-component modelstructure and a parallel inference implementation on GraphLab; the COLD method isexpressive while remaining efficient.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,27
Keyword Query Reformulation on Structured Data,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Liansheng Hua; Yuxin Huang,Textual web pages dominate web search engines nowadays. However; there is also astriking increase of structured data on the web. Efficient keyword query processing onstructured data has attracted enough attention; but effective query understanding has yet tobe investigated. In this paper; we focus on the problem of keyword query reformulation in thestructured data scenario. These reformulated queries provide alternative descriptions oforiginal input. They could better capture users' information need and guide users to explorerelated items in the target structured data. We propose an automatic keyword queryreformulation approach by exploiting structural semantics in the underlying structured datasources. The reformulation solution is decomposed into two stages; ie; offline term relationextraction and online query generation. We first utilize a heterogenous graph to model the …,ICDE 2012,2012,26
Evolutionary taxonomy construction from dynamic tag space,Bin Cui; Junjie Yao; Gao Cong; Yuxin Huang,Abstract Collaborative tagging allows users to tag online resources. We refer to the largedatabase of tags and their relationships as a tag space. In a tag space; the popularity andcorrelation amongst tags capture the current social interests; and taxonomy is a useful wayto organize these tags. As tags change over time; it is imperative to incorporate the temporaltag evolution into the taxonomies. In this paper; we formalize the problem of evolutionarytaxonomy generation over a large database of tags. The proposed evolutionary taxonomyframework consists of two key features. Firstly; we develop a novel context-aware edgeselection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. Secondly; we propose several algorithms forevolutionary taxonomy fusion. We conduct an extensive performance study using a verylarge real-life dataset (ie; Del. ici. ous). The empirical results clearly show that our …,Web Information Systems Engineering–WISE 2010,2010,20
Eventsearch: A system for event discovery and retrieval on multi-type historical data,Dongdong Shan; Wayne Xin Zhao; Rishan Chen; Baihan Shu; Ziqi Wang; Junjie Yao; Hongfei Yan; Xiaoming Li,Abstract We present EventSearch; a system for event extraction and retrieval on four types ofnews-related historical data; ie; Web news articles; newspapers; TV news program; andmicro-blog short messages. The system incorporates over 11 million web pages extractedfrom" Web InfoMall"; the Chinese Web Archive since 2001. The newspaper and TV newsvideo clips also span from 2001 to 2011. The system; upon a user query; returns a list ofevent snippets from multiple data sources. A novel burst model is used to discover eventsfrom time-stamped texts. In addition to offline event extraction; our system also providesonline event extraction to further meet the user needs. EventSearch provides meaningfulanalytics that synthesize an accurate description of events. Users interact with the system byranking the identified events using different criteria (scale; recency and relevance) and …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,19
User Group Oriented Temporal Dynamics Exploration.,Zhiting Hu; Junjie Yao; Bin Cui,Abstract Temporal online content becomes the zeitgeist to reflect our interests and changes.Active users are essential participants and promoters behind it. Temporal dynamicsbecomes a viable way to investigate users. However; most current work only use globaltemporal trend and fail to distinguish such fine-grained patterns across groups. Differentusers have diverse interest and exhibit distinct behaviors; and temporal dynamics tend to bedifferent. This paper proposes GrosToT (Group Specific Topics-over-Time); a unifiedprobabilistic model to infer latent user groups and temporal topics at the same time. Itmodels group-specific temporal topic variation from social content. By leveraging thecomprehensive group-specific temporal patterns; Gros-ToT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art dynamics modeling methods.

PAGE: a partition aware graph computation engine,Yingxia Shao; Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Lin Ma,Abstract Graph partitioning is one of the key components in parallel graph computation; andthe partition quality significantly affects the overall computing performance. In the existinggraph computing systems;``good''partition schemes are preferred as they have smaller edgecut ratio and hence reduce the communication cost among working nodes. However; in anempirical study on Giraph [1]; we found that the performance over well partitioned graphmight be even two times worse than simple partitions. The cause is that the local messageprocessing cost in graph computing systems may surpass the communication cost in severalcases. In this paper; we analyse the cost of parallel graph computing systems as well as therelationship between the cost and underlying graph partitioning. Based on theseobservation; we propose a novel Partition Aware Graph computation Engine named …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,12
Detecting bursty events in collaborative tagging systems,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Yuxin Huang; Yanhong Zhou,Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as an ubiquitous way to annotate andorganize online resources. The users' tagging actions over time reflect the changing of theirinterests. In this paper; we propose to detect bursty tagging event; which captures therelations among a group of correlated tags where the tags are either bursty or associatedwith bursty tag co-occurrence. We exploit the sliding time intervals to extract bursty featuresfrom large tag corpora as the first step; and then adopt graph clustering techniques to groupbursty features into meaningful bursty events. An experimental study demonstrates thesuperiority of our approach.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,11
Evolutionary taxonomy construction from dynamic tag space,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Gao Cong; Yuxin Huang,Abstract Collaborative tagging becomes a common feature of current web sites; facilitatingordinary users to annotate and represent online resources. The large collection of tags andtheir relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space; the popularity and correlationamongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords anddifficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumptionrelationships; automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to managecollaborative tags. However; tags change over time; and it is also imperative to incorporatethe temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper; we formalize theproblem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line oftaxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space.

Community Specific Temporal Topic Discovery from Social Media,Zhiting Hu; Chong Wang; Junjie Yao; Eric Xing; Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui,Abstract: Studying temporal dynamics of topics in social media is very useful to understandonline user behaviors. Most of the existing work on this subject usually monitors the globaltrends; ignoring variation among communities. Since users from different communities tendto have varying tastes and interests; capturing community-level temporal change canimprove the understanding and management of social content. Additionally; it can furtherfacilitate the applications such as community discovery; temporal prediction and onlinemarketing. However; this kind of extraction becomes challenging due to the intricateinteractions between community and topic; and intractable computational complexity. In thispaper; we take a unified solution towards the community-level topic dynamic extraction.

Constructing evolutionary taxonomy of collaborative tagging systems,Junjie Yao; Yuxin Huang; Bin Cui,Abstract Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label online resources. The tags aregenerally correlated and evolving according to the change of web contents; and thepopularity of tags represent evolution of social interests. Tag taxonomy is a promisingsolution to organize the data in tagging systems. In this demonstration; we propose toconstruct the evolutionary taxonomy which incorporates the correlation and evolution oftags; as user generated tags grow and change temporally. We demonstrate that ourapproach is intuitive and efficient in tag organization which exploits the evolvingcharacteristic of collaborative tagging systems.,Proceeding of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,3
GALLOP: GlobAL Feature Fused LOcation Prediction for Different Check-in Scenarios,Yuxing Han; Junjie Yao; Xuemin Lin; Liping Wang,Location prediction is widely used to forecast users' next place to visit based on his/hermobility logs. It is an essential problem in location data processing; invaluable forsurveillance; business; and personal applications. It is very challenging due to the sparsityissues of check-in data. An often ignored problem in recent studies is the variety acrossdifferent check-in scenarios; which is becoming more urgent due to the increasingavailability of more location check-in applications. In this paper; we propose a new featurefusion based prediction approach; GALLOP; ie; GlobAL feature fused LOcation Prediction fordifferent check-in scenarios. Based on the carefully designed feature extraction methods; weutilize a novel combined prediction framework. Specifically; we set out to utilize the densityestimation model to profile geographical features; ie; context information; the factorization …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
Distinguishing re-sharing behaviors from re-creating behaviors in information diffusion,Yiran Xie; Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Junjie Yao; Quanqing Xu,Abstract Social media plays a fundamental role in the diffusion of information. There are twodifferent ways of information diffusion in social media platforms such as Twitter and Weibo.Users can either re-share messages posted by their friends or re-create messages based onthe information acquired from other non-local information sources such as the mass media.By analyzing around 60 million messages from a large micro-blog site; we find that about69% of the diffusion volume can be attributed to users' re-sharing behaviors; and theremaining 31% are caused by user re-creating behaviors. The information diffusions causedby the two kinds of behaviors have different characteristics and variation trends; but mostexisting models of information diffusion do not distinguish them. The recent availability ofmassive online social streams allows us to study the process of information diffusion in …,World Wide Web,2016,1
Comprehensive Graph and Content Feature Based User Profiling,Peihao Tong; Junjie Yao; Liping Wang; Shiyu Yang,Abstract Nowadays; users post a lot of their ordinary life records to online social sites. Richsocial content covers discussion; interaction and communication activities etc. The socialdata provides insights into users' interest; preference and communication aspects. Aninteresting problem is how to profile users' occupation; ie; professional categories. It hasgreat values for users' recommendation and personalized delivery services.
