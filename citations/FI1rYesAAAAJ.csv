Translating web data,Lucian Popa; Yannis Velegrakis; Renée J Miller; Mauricio A Hernández; Ronald Fagin,An important issue in modern information systems and e-commerce applications is providingsupport for interoperability of independent data sources. A broad variety of data is availableon the Web in distinct heterogeneous sources; stored under different formats: databaseformats (for example; relational model); semistructured formats (for example; DTDs; SGML orXML Schema); scientific formats; etc. Integration of such data is an increasingly importantproblem. Nonetheless; the effort involved in such integration; in practice; is considerable:translation of data from one format (or schema) to another requires writing and managingcomplex data; transformation programs or queries. The chapter presents a novel frameworkfor mapping between any combination of XML and relational schemas; in which a high-level;user specified mapping is translated into semantically meaningful queries that transform …,*,2002,667
On evaluating schema matching and mapping,Zohra Bellahsene; Angela Bonifati; Fabien Duchateau; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract The increasing demand of matching and mapping tasks in modern integrationscenarios has led to a plethora of tools for facilitating these tasks. While the plethora madethese tools available to a broader audience; it led to some form of confusion regarding theexact nature; goals; core functionalities; expected features; and basic capabilities of thesetools. Above all; it made performance measurements of these systems and their distinction adifficult task. The need for design and development of comparison standards that will allowthe evaluation of these tools is becoming apparent. These standards are particularlyimportant to mapping and matching system users; since they allow them to evaluate therelative merits of the systems and take the right business decisions. They are also importantto mapping system developers; since they offer a way of comparing the system against …,*,2011,335
Clio: Schema mapping creation and data exchange,Ronald Fagin; Laura M Haas; Mauricio Hernández; Renée J Miller; Lucian Popa; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract The Clio project provides tools that vastly simplify information integration.Information integration requires data conversions to bring data in different representationsinto a common form. Key contributions of Clio are the definition of non-procedural schemamappings to describe the relationship between data in heterogeneous schemas; a newparadigm in which we view the mapping creation process as one of query discovery; andalgorithms for automatically generating queries for data transformation from the mappings.Clio provides algorithms to address the needs of two major information integration problems;namely; data integration and data exchange. In this chapter; we present our algorithms forboth schema mapping creation via query discovery; and for query generation for dataexchange. These algorithms can be used in pure relational; pure XML; nested relational …,*,2009,186
-Mapping Adaptation under Evolving Schemas,Yannis Velegrakis; Renée J Miller; Lucian Popa,This chapter identifies the problem of mapping adaptation in dynamic environments withevolving schemas. To achieve interoperability; modem information systems and e-commerce applications use mappings to translate data from one representation to another.In dynamic environments like the Web; data sources may change not only their data but alsotheir schemas; their semantics; and their query capabilities. Such changes must be reflectedin the mappings. The chapter motivates the need for an automated system to adaptmappings and describes several areas in which the solutions can be applied. This chapterpresents a novel framework and a tool; Toronto Mapping Adaptation System (ToMAS); thatautomatically maintains the consistency of the mappings as schemas evolve. The approachis unique in many ways. It considers and manages a very general class of mappings …,*,2003,154
STBenchmark: towards a benchmark for mapping systems,Bogdan Alexe; Wang-Chiew Tan; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract A fundamental problem in information integration is to precisely specify therelationships; called mappings; between schemas. Designing mappings is a time-consuming process. To alleviate this problem; many mapping systems have beendeveloped to assist the design of mappings. However; a benchmark for comparing andevaluating these systems has not yet been developed. We present STBenchmark; a solutiontowards a much needed benchmark for mapping systems. We first describe the challengesthat are unique to the development of benchmarks for mapping systems. After this; wedescribe the three components of STBenchmark:(1) a basic suite of mapping scenarios thatwe believe represents a minimum set of transformations that should be readily supported byany mapping system;(2) a mapping scenario generator as well as an instance generator …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,142
Keyword search over relational databases: a metadata approach,Sonia Bergamaschi; Elton Domnori; Francesco Guerra; Raquel Trillo Lado; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Keyword queries offer a convenient alternative to traditional SQL in queryingrelational databases with large; often unknown; schemas and instances. The challenge inanswering such queries is to discover their intended semantics; construct the SQL queriesthat describe them and used them to retrieve the respective tuples. Existing approachestypically rely on indices built a-priori on the database content. This seriously limits theirapplicability if a-priori access to the database content is not possible. Examples include theon-line databases accessed through web interface; or the sources in information integrationsystems that operate behind wrappers with specific query capabilities. Furthermore; existingliterature has not studied to its full extend the inter-dependencies across the ways thedifferent keywords are mapped into the database values and schema elements.

Preserving mapping consistency under schema changes,Yannis Velegrakis; J Miller; Lucian Popa,Abstract In dynamic environments like the Web; data sources may change not only their databut also their schemas; their semantics; and their query capabilities. When a mapping is leftinconsistent by a schema change; it has to be detected and updated. We present a novelframework and a tool (ToMAS) for automatically adapting (rewriting) mappings as schemasevolve. Our approach considers not only local changes to a schema but also changes thatmay affect and transform many components of a schema. Our algorithm detects mappingsaffected by structural or constraint changes and generates all the rewritings that areconsistent with the semantics of the changed schemas. Our approach explicitly modelsmapping choices made by a user and maintains these choices; whenever possible; as theschemas and mappings evolve. When there is more than one candidate rewriting; the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2004,100
Intensional associations between data and metadata,Divesh Srivastava; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract There is a growing need to associate a variety of metadata with the underlying data;but a simple; elegant approach to uniformly model and query both the data and themetadata has been elusive. In this paper; we argue that (1) the relational model augmentedwith queries as data values is a natural way to uniformly model data; arbitrary metadata andtheir associations; and (2) relational queries with a join mechanism augmented to permitmatching of query result relations; instead of only atomic values; is an elegant way touniformly query across data and metadata. We describe the architecture of a system wehave prototyped for this purpose; demonstrate the generality of our approach and evaluatethe performance of the system; in comparison with previous proposals for metadatamanagement.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,84
Mapping XML and relational schemas with Clio,Lucian Popa; Mauricio A Hernandez; Yannis Velegrakis; Renée J Miller; Felix Naumann; Howard Ho,Merging and coalescing data from multiple and diverse sources into different data formatscontinues to be an important problem in modern information systems. Schema matching (theprocess of matching elements of a source schema with elements of a target schema) andschema mapping (the process of creating a query that maps between two disparateschemas) are at the heart of data integration systems. We demonstrate Clio; a semi-automatic schema mapping tool developed at the IBM Almaden Research Center. In thispaper; we showcase Clio's mapping engine which allows mapping to and from relationaland XML schemas; and takes advantage of data constraints in order to preserve dataassociations.,Data Engineering; 2002.

On-the-fly entity-aware query processing in the presence of linkage,Ekaterini Ioannou; Wolfgang Nejdl; Claudia Niederée; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Entity linkage is central to almost every data integration and data cleaning scenario.Traditional techniques use some computed similarity among data structure to performmerges and then answer queries on the merged data. We describe a novel framework forentity linkage with uncertainty. Instead of using the linkage information to merge structures a-priori; possible linkages are stored alongside the data with their belief value. A newprobabilistic query answering technique is used to take the probabilistic linkage intoconsideration. The framework introduces a series of novelties:(i) it performs merges at runtime based not only on existing linkages but also on the given query;(ii) it allows results thatmay contain structures not explicitly represented in the data; but generated as a result of areasoning on the linkages; and (iii) enables an evaluation of the query conditions that …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,60
Exemplar queries: Give me an example of what you need,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Search engines are continuously employing advanced techniques that aim tocapture user intentions and provide results that go beyond the data that simply satisfy thequery conditions. Examples include the personalized results; related searches; similaritysearch; popular and relaxed queries. In this work we introduce a novel query paradigm thatconsiders a user query as an example of the data in which the user is interested. We callthese queries exemplar queries and claim that they can play an important role in dealingwith the information deluge. We provide a formal specification of the semantics of suchqueries and show that they are fundamentally different from notions like queries by example;approximate and related queries. We provide an implementation of these semantics forgraph-based data and present an exact solution with a number of optimizations that …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,59
Representing and querying data transformations,Yannis Velegrakis; Renee J Miller; John Mylopoulos,Modern information systems often store data that has been transformed and integrated froma variety of sources. This integration may obscure the original source semantics of dataitems. For many tasks; it is important to be able to determine not only where data itemsoriginated; but also why they appear in the integration as they do and through whattransformation they were derived. This problem is known as data provenance. In this work;we consider data provenance at the schema and mapping level. In particular; we considerhow to answer questions such as" what schema elements in the source (s) contributed tothis value"; or" through what transformations or mappings was this value derived?" Towardsthis end; we elevate schemas and mappings to first-class citizens that are stored in arepository and are associated with the actual data values.

Sindbad: a location-based social networking system,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Justin J Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents Sindbad; a location-based social networking system. Sindbadsupports three new services beyond traditional social networking services; namely; location-aware news feed; location-aware recommender; and location-aware ranking. These newservices not only consider social relevance for its users; but they also consider spatialrelevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad; implementedwith PostgreSQL and Google Maps API; are demonstrated through user (ie; web/phone) andsystem analyzer GUI interfaces; respectively.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,52

A probabilistic optimization framework for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation frameworkfor queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that returns an empty answer set;our framework dynamically computes and suggests alternative queries with less conditionsthan those the user has initially requested; in order to help the user arrive at a query with anon-empty answer; or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions areignored; the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting queryrelaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing a wide varietyof application-dependent objective functions. We describe optimal and approximatesolutions of different optimization problems using the framework. We analyze thesesolutions; experimentally verify their efficiency and effectiveness; and illustrate their …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,42

It finds numerous applications in situations where traditional keyword-basedsearching techniques are inapplicable due to the unavailability of the database contents forthe construction of the required indexes.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,38
QUEST: a keyword search system for relational data based on semantic and machine learning techniques,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Matteo Interlandi; Raquel Trillo-Lado; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We showcase QUEST (QUEry generator for STructured sources); a search enginefor relational databases that combines semantic and machine learning techniques fortransforming keyword queries into meaningful SQL queries. The search engine relies on twoapproaches: the forward; providing mappings of keywords into database terms (names oftables and attributes; and domains of attributes); and the backward; computing the pathsjoining the data structures identified in the forward step. The results provided by the twoapproaches are combined within a probabilistic framework based on the Dempster-ShaferTheory. We demonstrate QUEST capabilities; and we show how; thanks to the flexibilityobtained by the probabilistic combination of different techniques; QUEST is able to computehigh quality results even with few training data and/or with hidden data sources such as …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,32

On generating benchmark data for entity matching,Ekaterini Ioannou; Nataliya Rassadko; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Entity matching has been a fundamental task in every major integration and datacleaning effort. It aims at identifying whether two different pieces of information are referringto the same real world object. It can also form the basis of entity search by finding the entitiesin a repository that best match a user specification. Despite the many different entitymatching techniques that have been developed over time; there is still no widely acceptedbenchmark for evaluating and comparing them. This paper introduces EMBench; aprincipled system for the evaluation of entity matching systems. In contrast to existing similarefforts; EMBench offers a unique test case generation approach that combines differentlevels of types; complexity; and scales; allowing a complete and accurate evaluation of thedifferent aspects of a matching system.

Updates through views: A new hope,Yannis Kotidis; Divesh Srivastava; Yannis Velegrakis,Database views are extensively used to represent unmaterialized tables. Applications rarelydistinguish between a materialized base table and a virtual view; thus; they may issueupdate requests on the views. Since views are virtual; update requests on them need to betranslated to updates on the base tables. Existing literature has shown the difficulty oftranslating view updates in a side-effect free manner. To address this problem; we propose anovel approach for separating the data instance into a logical and a physical level. Thisseparation allows us to achieve side-effect free translations of any kind of update on theview. Furthermore; deletes on a view can be translated without affecting the base tables.

A hidden markov model approach to keyword-based search over relational databases,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Silvia Rota; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We present a novel method for translating keyword queries over relationaldatabases into SQL queries with the same intended semantic meaning. In contrast to themajority of the existing keyword-based techniques; our approach does not require any a-priori knowledge of the data instance. It follows a probabilistic approach based on a HiddenMarkov Model for computing the top-K best mappings of the query keywords into thedatabase terms; ie; tables; attributes and values. The mappings are then used to generatethe SQL queries that are executed to produce the answer to the keyword query. The methodhas been implemented into a system called KEYRY (from KEYword to queRY).,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2011,26

Modeling concept evolution: a historical perspective,Flavio Rizzolo; Yannis Velegrakis; John Mylopoulos; Siarhei Bykau,Abstract The world is changing; and so must the data that describes its history. Notsurprisingly; considerable research effort has been spent in Databases along this direction;covering topics such as temporal models and schema evolution. A topic that has notreceived much attention; however; is that of concept evolution. For example; Germany(instance-level concept) has evolved several times in the last century as it went throughdifferent governance structures; then split into two national entities that eventually joinedagain. Likewise; a caterpillar is transformed into a butterfly; while a mother becomes two(maternally-related) entities. As well; the concept of Whale (a class-level concept) changedover the past two centuries thanks to scientific discoveries that led to a better understandingof what the concept entails.

The objective is to introduce the audience into the area of the SemanticWeb; and to highlight the fact that the area provides many interesting research opportunitiesfor the data management community. A new model; the Resource Description Framework(RDF); coupled with a new query language; called SPARQL; lead us to revisit someclassical data management problems; including efficient storage; query optimization; anddata integration. These are problems that the Semantic Web community has only recentlystarted to explore; and therefore the experience and long tradition of the databasecommunity can prove valuable.

In the core of every information integration and data exchange effort lies the abilityto identify whether two pieces of information refer to the same real world entity. This ability isof paramount importance for all those applications and systems currently operating in thehighly heterogeneous web environment. Research in data management has long agoexploited features like keys or schema constraints for dealing with that issue; but the webreality has brought new challenges.

Kanata: adaptation and evolution in data sharing systems,Periklis Andritsos; Ariel Fuxman; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Renee J Miller; Yannis Velegrakis,1. INTRODUCTION Data sharing systems permit the transformation; integra- tion; and exchangeof data that has been designed and devel- oped independently. The often subtle and complexinterde- pendencies within data can make the creation; maintenance; and comprehension ofsuch systems quite challenging. We have available a robust arsenal of tools and mechanismsfor reconciling semantic differences in how data is represented including views; mappings; andtransformation languages. There is also a growing maturity in our knowledge of how to create[19; 20] and use these mechanisms in such tasks as query answering [13]; data exchange[9]; data integration [17]; and data sharing [15]. Given this solid foundation in the tools and modelingstructures needed for data sharing; in this project; we are investigating the problem of maintainingsuch systems.

Discovery and correctness of schema mapping transformations,Angela Bonifati; Giansalvatore Mecca; Paolo Papotti; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Schema mapping is becoming pervasive in all data transformation; exchange; andintegration tasks. It brings to the surface the problem of differences and mismatches betweenheterogeneous formats and models; respectively; used in source and target databases to bemapped one to another. In this chapter; we start by describing the problem of schemamapping; its background; and technical implications. Then; we outline the early schemamapping systems; along with the new generation of schema mapping tools. Moving from theformer to the latter entailed a dramatic change in the performance of mapping generationalgorithms. Finally; we conclude the chapter by revisiting the query answering techniquesallowed by the mappings; and by discussing useful applications and future and currentdevelopments of schema mapping tools.,*,2011,14
Combining user and database perspective for solving keyword queries over relational databases,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Matteo Interlandi; Raquel Trillo-Lado; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Over the last decade; keyword search over relational data has attractedconsiderable attention. A possible approach to face this issue is to transform keywordqueries into one or more SQL queries to be executed by the relational DBMS. Finding thesequeries is a challenging task since the information they represent may be modeled acrossdifferent tables and attributes. This means that it is needed to identify not only the schemaelements where the data of interest is stored; but also to find out how these elements areinterconnected. All the approaches that have been proposed so far provide a monolithicsolution. In this work; we; instead; divide the problem into three steps: the first one; driven bythe user׳ s point of view; takes into account what the user has in mind when formulatingkeyword queries; the second one; driven by the database perspective; considers how the …,Information Systems,2016,13

While the traditional query model expects the user to provide a set of specificationsthat the elements of interest need to satisfy; XQ expects the user to provide only an elementof interest and we infer the desired answer set based on that element. Through the variousexamples we demonstrate the functionality of the system and its applicability in variouscases. At the same time; we highlight the technical challenges for this type of queryanswering and illustrate the implementation approach we have materialized.

Semantic search over the web,Roberto De Virgilio; Francesco Guerra; Yannis Velegrakis,The Web has become the world's largest database; with search being the main tool thatallows organizations and individuals to exploit its huge amount of information. Search on theWeb has been traditionally based on textual and structural similarities; ignoring to a largedegree the semantic dimension; ie; understanding the meaning of the query and of thedocument content. Combining search and semantics gives birth to the idea of semanticsearch. Traditional search engines have already advertised some semantic dimensions.Some of them; for instance; can enhance their generated result sets with documents that aresemantically related to the query terms even though they may not include these terms.Nevertheless; the exploitation of the semantic search has not yet reached its full potential.

Providing insight into data source topics,Sonia Bergamaschi; Davide Ferrari; Francesco Guerra; Giovanni Simonini; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract A fundamental service for the exploitation of the modern large data sources that areavailable online is the ability to identify the topics of the data that they contain. Unfortunately;the heterogeneity and lack of centralized control makes it difficult to identify the topicsdirectly from the actual values used in the sources. We present an approach that generatessignatures of sources that are matched against a reference vocabulary of concepts throughthe respective signature to generate a description of the topics of the source in terms of thisreference vocabulary. The reference vocabulary may be provided ready; may be createdmanually; or may be created by applying our signature-generated algorithm over a well-curated data source with a clear identification of topics. In our particular case; we have usedDBpedia for the creation of the vocabulary; since it is one of the largest known collections …,Journal on Data Semantics,2016,7
Modeling associations through intensional attributes,Andrea Presa; Yannis Velegrakis; Flavio Rizzolo; Siarhei Bykau,Abstract Attributes; aka slots or properties; are the main mechanism used to defineassociations between concepts or individuals modeling real world entities in a knowledgebase. Traditionally; an attribute is defined by an explicit statement that specifies the name ofthe attribute and the entities it associates. This has three main limitations:(i) it is not easy toapply to large amounts of data; even if they share the same characteristics; since explicitdefinitions are needed for each concept or individual;(ii) it cannot handle future data; ie;when new concepts or individuals are inserted in the knowledge base their attributes needto be explicitly defined; and (iii) it assumes that the data engineer; or the user that isintroducing a new attribute; has access and privileges to modify the respective objects. Theabove may not be practical in many real ontology application scenarios. We are …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2009,7

Unleashing the power of information graphs,Matteo Lissandrini; Davide Mottin; Themis Palpanas; Dimitra Papadimitriou; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Information graphs are generic graphs that model different types of informationthrough nodes and edges. Knowledge graphs are the most common type of informationgraphs in which nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships among them. Inthis paper; we argue that exploitation of information graphs can lead into novel queryanswering capabilities that go beyond the existing capabilities of keyword search; and focuson one of them; namely; exemplar queries. Exemplar queries is a recently introducedparadigm that treats a user query as an example from the desired result set. In this paper; wedescribe the foundations of exemplar queries and the significant role of information graphs;and we present several applications and relevant research directions.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2015,6
Access control for data integration in presence of data dependencies,Mehdi Haddad; Jovan Stevovic; Annamaria Chiasera; Yannis Velegrakis; Mohand-Saïd Hacid,Abstract Defining access control policies in a data integration scenario is a challenging task.In such a scenario typically each source specifies its local access control policy and cannotanticipate data inferences that can arise when data is integrated at the mediator level.Inferences; eg; using functional dependencies; can allow malicious users to obtain; at themediator level; prohibited information by linking multiple queries and thus violating the localpolicies. In this paper; we propose a framework; ie; a methodology and a set of algorithms; toprevent such violations. First; we use a graph-based approach to identify sets of queries;called violating transactions; and then we propose an approach to forbid the execution ofthose transactions by identifying additional access control rules that should be added to themediator. We also state the complexity of the algorithms and discuss a set of experiments …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,6
On modeling and querying concept evolution,Siarhei Bykau; John Mylopoulos; Flavio Rizzolo; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Entities and the concepts they instantiate evolve over time. For example; acorporate entity may have resulted from a series of mergers and splits; or a concept such asthat of Whale may have evolved along with our understanding of the physical world. Wepropose a model for capturing and querying concept evolution. Our proposal extends anRDF-like model with temporal features and evolution operators. In addition; we provide aquery language that exploits these extensions and supports historical queries. Moreover; westudy how evolution information can be exploited to answer queries that are agnostic toevolution details (hence; evolution-unaware). For these; we propose dynamic programmingalgorithms and evaluate their efficiency and scalability by experimenting with both real andsynthetic datasets.,Journal on Data Semantics,2012,6
Supporting queries spanning across phases of evolving artifacts using steiner forests,Siarhei Bykau; John Mylopoulos; Flavio Rizzolo; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract The problem of managing evolving data has attracted considerable researchattention. Researchers have focused on the modeling and querying of schema/instance-level structural changes; such as; addition; deletion and modification of attributes.Databases with such a functionality are known as temporal databases. A limitation of thetemporal databases is that they treat changes as independent events; while often theappearance (or elimination) of some structure in the database is the result of an evolution ofsome existing structure. We claim that maintaining the causal relationship between the twostructures is of major importance since it allows additional reasoning to be performed andanswers to be generated for queries that previously had no answers. We present here anovel framework for exploiting the evolution relationships between the structures in the …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,6
A context-based model for the interpretation of polysemous terms,Chrisa Tsinaraki; Yannis Velegrakis; Nadzeya Kiyavitskaya; John Mylopoulos,Abstract The problem of polysemy involves having terms; such as “truck”; that refer tomultiple concepts in different contexts; and conversely; having the same concept referred towith different names in different contexts. Contexts may be defined along differentdimensions; such as language (Italian; English; French;...); domain (Philosophy; ComputerScience; Physics;...); time (Ancient Greece; 20th century;...) etc. Given a conceptual model M(aka ontology); a context C and a query Q we motivate and propose algorithms forinterpreting all the terms of the query with respect to M and C. We also define and solve theinverse problem: given a set of concepts S which are part of the answer to query Q and acontext C; we propose algorithms for choosing terms for all the concepts in S. To illustratethe framework; we use a case study involving a history ontology whose elements are …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2010,6
Bridging the gap between heterogeneous and semantically diverse content of different disciplines,Siarhei Bykau; Nadzeya Kiyavitskaya; Chrisa Tsinaraki; Yannis Velegrakis,The Web has been flooded with highly heterogeneous data sources that freely offer theirdata to the public. Careful design and compliance to standards is a way to cope with theheterogeneity. However; any agreement and compliance is practically hard to achieveacross different communities. In this work we describe a framework that enables theexploitation of content across different scientific disciplines. Our approach combines severalnovel techniques at the syntactic; structural and semantic level. In particular; we advocatethat integration should take place at the much higher level; factoring out any syntacticdiscrepancies; and facilitating the exchange of information. We show how a novel techniquefor data annotation using intentional attributes can cope with data associations in high datavolumes; we present a way to overcome the multilingualism barrier; and describe a new …,Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA); 2010 Workshop on,2010,6
Enabling entity-based aggregators for web 2.0 data,Ekaterini Ioannou; Claudia Niederée; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Selecting and presenting content culled from multiple heterogeneous andphysically distributed sources is a challenging task. The exponential growth of the web datain modern times has brought new requirements to such integration systems. Data is not anymore produced by content providers alone; but also from regular users through the highlypopular Web 2.0 social and semantic web applications. The plethora of the available webcontent increased its demand by regular users who could not any more wait thedevelopment of advanced integration tools. They wanted to be able to build in a short timetheir own specialized integration applications. Aggregators came to the risk of these users.They allowed them not only to combine distributed content; but also to process it in ways thatgenerate new services available for further consumption. To cope with the heterogeneous …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,6
Using queries to associate metadata with data,Divesh Srivastava; Yannis Velegrakis,As relational databases proliferate and become increasingly complex; both in their internalstructure and in their interactions with other databases and applications; there is a growingneed to associate a variety of metadata with the underlying data. Even though the need hasbeen apparent; a simple; elegant approach to uniformly model and query both data andmetadata has been elusive. In this paper; we argue that the relational model augmentedwith queries as data values is a natural way to uniformly model data; arbitrary metadata andtheir association.,Data Engineering; 2007.

Managing schema mappings in highly heterogeneous environments,Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Integration; transformation; and translation of data is increasingly important formodern information systems and e-commerce applications. Views; and more generally;transformation specifications; or mappings; provide the foundation for many datatransformation applications. Mappings are usually specified manually by data administratorsthat are familiar with the semantics of the data and have a good knowledge of thetransformation language. The task of generating and managing mappings is laborious; timeconsuming and error-prone since data administrators are called on to write complexmappings in which they specify in tedious detail how the data is to be transformed. Evenonce deployed; mappings must remain under constant supervision since changes in thestructure of the data may require changes in the mappings.,*,2005,6
BLADYG: A novel block-centric framework for the analysis of large dynamic graphs,Sabeur Aridhi; Alberto Montresor; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Recently; distributed processing of large dynamic graphs has become very popular;especially in certain domains such as social network analysis; Web graph analysis andspatial network analysis. In this context; many distributed/parallel graph processing systemshave been proposed; such as Pregel; GraphLab; and Trinity. These systems can be dividedinto two categories:(1) vertex-centric and (2) block-centric approaches. In vertex-centricapproaches; each vertex corresponds to a process; and message are exchanged amongvertices. In block-centric approaches; the unit of computation is a block; a connectedsubgraph of the graph; and message exchanges occur among blocks. In this paper; we areconsidering the issues of scale and dynamism in the case of block-centric approaches.

Top-k item identification on dynamic and distributed datasets,Alessio Guerrieri; Alberto Montresor; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract The problem of identifying the most frequent items across multiple datasets hasreceived considerable attention over the last few years. When storage is a scarce resource;the topic is already a challenge; yet; its complexity may be further exacerbated not only bythe many independent data sources; but also by the dynamism of the data; ie; the fact thatnew items may appear and old ones disappear at any time. In this work; we provide a novelapproach to the problem by using an existing gossip-based algorithm for identifying the kmost frequent items over a distributed collection of datasets; in ways that deal with thedynamic nature of the data. The algorithm has been thoroughly analyzed through trace-based simulations and compared to state-of-the-art decentralized solutions; showing betterprecision at reduced communication overhead.,European Conference on Parallel Processing,2014,5

KEYRY: a keyword-based search engine over relational databases based on a hidden Markov model,Sonia Bergamaschi; Francesco Guerra; Silvia Rota; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose the demonstration of KEYRY; a tool for translating keyword queriesover structured data sources into queries in the native language of the data source. KEYRYdoes not assume any prior knowledge of the source contents. This allows it to be used insituations where traditional keyword search techniques over structured data that requiresuch a knowledge cannot be applied; ie; sources on the hidden web or those behindwrappers in integration systems. In KEYRY the search process is modeled as a HiddenMarkov Model and the List Viterbi algorithm is applied to computing the top-k queries thatbetter represent the intended meaning of a user keyword query. We demonstrate the tool'scapabilities; and we show how the tool is able to improve its behavior over time by exploitingimplicit user feedback provided through the selection among the top-k solutions …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2011,5
LinkDB: a probabilistic linkage database system,Ekaterini Ioannou; Wolfgang Nejdl; Claudia Niederée; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Entity linkage deals with the problem of identifying whether two pieces ofinformation represent the same real world object. The traditional methodology computes thesimilarity among the entities; and then merges those with similarity above some specificthreshold. We demonstrate LinkDB; an original entity storage and querying system thatdeals with the entity linkage problem in a novel way. LinkDB is a probabilistic linkagedatabase that uses existing linkage techniques to generate linkages among entities; butinstead of performing the merges based on these linkages; it stores them alongside the dataand performs only the required merges at run-time; by effectively taking into considerationthe query specifications. We explain the technical challenges behind this kind of queryanswering; and we show how this new mechanism is able to provide answers that …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,5

A holistic and principled approach for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation frameworkfor queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that returns an empty-answer set;our framework dynamically computes and suggests alternative queries with fewer conditionsthan those the user has initially requested; in order to help the user arrive at a query with anon-empty-answer; or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions areignored; the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting queryrelaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing a wide varietyof application-dependent objective functions. We describe optimal and approximatesolutions of different optimization problems using the framework. Moreover; we discuss twoimportant extensions to the base framework: the specification of a minimum size on the …,The VLDB Journal,2016,4

Coping with the persistent cold-start problem,Siarhei Bykau; F Koutrika; Yannis Velegrakis,ABSTRACT Recommender systems predict items a user is likely to like using historical dataabout users and items. A key challenge is how to provide recommendations when historicaldata is sparse or missing; known as the cold-start problem. Current solutions to this problemassume that given an item and a user; the recommendation process misses historical dataonly about one of them but not both. In this paper; we are interested in the challenging moresevere form of the cold-start problem of new-user/new-item. In particular; we are interestedin cases where a system collects historical data about users and items but producesrecommendations mostly for new or anonymous users and about new or evolved items.

Adapting mappings in frequently changing environments,Yannis Velegrakis; Renée J Miller; Lucian Popa,Abstract To achieve interoperability; modern information systems and e-commerceapplications use mappings to translate data from one representation to another. In dynamicenvironments like the Web; data sources may change not only their data but also theirschemas; their semantics; and their query capabilities. Such changes must be reflected inthe mappings. Mappings left inconsistent by a schema change have to be detected andupdated. As large; complicated schemas become more prevalent; and as data is reused inmore and more applications; manually maintaining mappings (even simple mappings likeview definitions) is becoming impractical. We present a novel framework and tool forautomatically adapting mappings as schemas evolve. Our approach considers not only localchanges to a schema; but also changes that may affect and transform many components …,Int. Conf of Very Large Databases (VLDB)(September 2003),2003,4
On Z39. 50 wrapping and description logics,Yannis Velegrakis; Vassilis Christophides; Panos Constantopoulos,Abstract. Z39. 50 is a client/server protocol widely used in digital libraries and museums forsearching and retrieving information spread over a number of heterogeneous sources. Toovercome semantic and schematic discrepancies among the various data sources theprotocol relies on a world view of information as a flat list of fields; called Access Points (AP).One of the major issues for building Z39. 50 wrappers is to map this unstructured list of APsto the underlying source data structure and semantics. For highly structured sources (eg;database management systems; knowledge base systems) this mapping is quite complexand considerably affects the quality of the retrieved data. Unfortunately; existing Z39. 50wrappers have been developed from scratch and they do not provide high-level mappinglanguages with verifiable properties.

Distributed k-core decomposition and maintenance in large dynamic graphs,Sabeur Aridhi; Martin Brugnara; Alberto Montresor; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Distributed processing of large; dynamic graphs has recently received considerableattention; especially in domains such as the analytics of social networks; web graphs andspatial networks. k-core decomposition is one of the significant figures of merit that can beanalyzed in graphs. Efficient algorithms to compute k-cores exist already; both in centralizedand decentralized setting. Yet; these algorithms have been designed for static graphs;without significant support to deal with the addition or removal of nodes and edges.Typically; this challenge is handled by re-executing the algorithm again on the updatedgraph. In this work; we propose distributed k-core decomposition and maintenancealgorithms for large dynamic graphs. The proposed algorithms exploit; as much as possible;the topology of the graph to compute all the k-cores and maintain them in streaming …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems,2016,3
dbTrento: the data and information management group at the University of Trento,Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,[Semantic-based Keyword Search] Keyword search is becoming the de-facto mechanism forquerying data [19]; since it does not require knowledge of the full semantics or theirorganization in the repository; neither knowledge of some complex query language.

Inmany cases; however; the special vocabulary of the archive restricts its access only toexperts in the domain of the material it contains and; as a result; researchers of otherdisciplines or the general public cannot take full advantage of the wealth of information itoffers. To this end; the Papyrus research project has worked towards a solution which makescross-discipline search possible in digital libraries. The developed prototype showcases thisapproach demonstrating how we can discover history in news archives. In this demo wefocus on demonstrating two of the end user tools available in the prototype; the cross-discipline search and the Papyrus browser.,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2011,3

Since it is not based onanalysis of the data source contents; KEYRY finds application in scenarios where sourceshold complex and huge schemas; apt to frequent changes; such as sources belonging to thelinked open data cloud. KEYRY is based on a probabilistic approach that provides the top-kresults that better approximate the intended meaning of the user query.,Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Linked Web Data Management,2011,3
Relational technologies; metadata and rdf,Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Metadata plays an important role in successfully understanding and querying dataon the web. A number of metadata management solutions have already been developed buteach is tailored to specific kinds of metadata. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) isa generic; flexible and powerful model which is becoming the de-facto standard for metadatarepresentation on the Web. Its adoption has created an exponential growth of the amount ofavailable RDF data calling for efficient management solutions. Instead of designing suchsolutions from scratch; it is possible to invest on existing relational technologies by exploitingtheir long presence and maturity. Relational technologies can offer efficient storage and highperformance querying at relatively low cost. Unfortunately; the principles of the relationalmodel are fundamentally different from those of RDF. This difference means that …,*,2010,3
New trends on exploratory methods for data analytics,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Data usually comes in a plethora of formats and dimensions; rendering theexploration and information extraction processes cumbersome. Thus; being able to castexploratory queries in the data with the intent of having an immediate glimpse on some ofthe data properties is becoming crucial. An exploratory query should be simple enough toavoid complicate declarative languages (such as SQL) and mechanisms; and at the sametime retain the flexibility and expressiveness of such languages. Recently; we havewitnessed a rediscovery of the so called example-based methods; in which the user; or theanalyst circumvent query languages by using examples as input. An example is arepresentative of the intended results; or in other words; an item from the result set.

Exploiting Linguistic Analysis on URLs for Recommending Web Pages: A Comparative Study,Sara Cadegnani; Francesco Guerra; Sergio Ilarri; María del Carmen Rodríguez-Hernández; Raquel Trillo-Lado; Yannis Velegrakis; Raquel Amaro,Abstract Nowadays; citizens require high level quality information from public institutions inorder to guarantee their transparency. Institutional websites of governmental and publicbodies must publish and keep updated a large amount of information stored in thousands ofweb pages in order to satisfy the demands of their users. Due to the amount of information;the “search form”; which is typically available in most such websites; is proven limited tosupport the users; since it requires them to explicitly express their information needs throughkeywords. The sites are also affected by the so-called “long tail” phenomenon; aphenomenon that is typically observed in e-commerce portals. The phenomenon is the onein which not all the pages are considered highly important and as a consequence; userssearching for information located in pages that are not condiered important are having a …,*,2017,2
Entity-Based Keyword Search in eb Documents,Enrico Sartori; Yannis Velegrakis; Francesco Guerra,Abstract In document search; documents are typically seen as a flat list of keywords. To dealwith the syntactic interoperability; ie; the use of different keywords to refer to the same realworld entity; entity linkage has been used to replace keywords in the text with a uniqueidentifier of the entity to which they are referring. Yet; the flat list of entities fails to capture theactual relationships that exist among the entities; information that is significant for a moreeffective document search. In this work we propose to go one step further from entity linkagein text; and model the documents as a set of structures that describe relationships among theentities mentioned in the text. We show that this kind of representation is significantlyimproving the effectiveness of document search. We describe the details of theimplementation of the above idea and we present an extensive set of experimental results …,*,2016,2

This is true in particular forinstitutional government and public organization websites; where for transparency reasons alot of information has to be provided. The “long tail” phenomenon affects also this kind ofwebsites and users need support for improving the effectiveness of their navigation.

Finding related forum posts through content similarity over intention-based segmentation,Dimitra Papadimitriou; Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Velegrakis; John Mylopoulos,We study the problem of finding related forum posts to a post at hand. In contrast totraditional approaches for finding related documents that perform content comparisonsacross the content of the posts as a whole; we consider each post as a set of segments;each written with a different goal in mind. We advocate that the relatedness between twoposts should be based on the similarity of their respective segments that are intended for thesame goal; ie; are conveying the same intention. This means that it is possible for the sameterms to weigh differently in the relatedness score depending on the intention of the segmentin which they are found. We have developed a segmentation method that by monitoring anumber of text features can identify the parts of a post where significant jumps occurindicating a point where a segmentation should take place.

The Goal Behind the Action: Toward Goal-Aware Systems and Applications,Dimitra Papadimitriou; Georgia Koutrika; John Mylopoulos; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Human activity is almost always intentional; be it in a physical context or as part ofan interaction with a computer system. By understanding why user-generated events arehappening and what purposes they serve; a system can offer a significantly improved andmore engaging experience. However; goals cannot be easily captured. Analyzing useractions such as clicks and purchases can reveal patterns and behaviors; but understandingthe goals behind these actions is a different and challenging issue.

Searching web 2.0 data through entity-based aggregation,Ekaterini Ioannou; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Entity-based searching has been introduced as a way of allowing users andapplications to retrieve information about a specific real world object such as a person; anevent; or a location. Recent advances in crawling; information extraction; and data exchangetechnologies have brought a new era in data management; typically referred to through theterm Web 2.0. Entity searching over Web 2.0 data facilitates the retrieval of relevantinformation from the plethora of data available in semantic and social web applications.Effective entity searching over a variety of sources requires the integration of the differentpieces of information that refer to the same real world entity.

Understanding the Semantics of Keyword Queries on Relational Data Without Accessing the Instance,Sonia Bergamaschi; Elton Domnori; Francesco Guerra; Silvia Rota; Raquel Trillo Lado; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract The simplicity of keyword queries has made them particularly attractive to thetechnically unskilled user base; tending to become the de facto standard for querying on theweb. Unfortunatelly; alongside its simplicity; came also the loose semantics. Researchershave; for a long time; studied ways to understand the keyword query semantics and retrievethe most relevant data artifacts.

Modeling and Mapping Multilingual and Historically Diverse Content,Nadzeya Kiyavitskaya; Akrivi Katifori; Yannis Velegrakis; Chrisa Tsinaraki; Siarhei Bykau; Eirini Savaidou; Aristotle Tympas; Yannis Ioannidis; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract: Recent digitization efforts made archival content more available and evensearchable through the Web. History researchers use this content for studying past events inrelation to general historiographical issues; which may involve politics; society; ethics; andothers. However; for locating relevant content the researchers need to know the terminologyused for the topic of interest in the past. This problem is crucial for history researchers;because it affects the time and quality of their work. Another problem of great importancewhen dealing with the archival content is multilingualism. Simple translation is not enough toidentify a relevant term in other language; because a term may undergo different changes indifferent social or cultural contexts. In order to address these challenges; the EU-fundedproject Papyrus aims to develop tool support for cross-disciplinary information retrieval of …,CIDOC; Shanghai; China,2010,1
Side-effect-free view updates,Yannis Velegrakis,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,1

Beyond Frequencies: Graph Pattern Mining in Multi-weighted Graphs,Giulia Preti; Matteo Lissandrini; Davide Mottin; Yannis Velegrakis,ABSTRACT Graph pattern mining aims at identifying structures that appear frequently inlarge graphs; under the assumption that frequency signifies importance. Several measuresof frequency have been proposed that respect the apriori property; essential for an efficientsearch of the patterns. This property states that the number of appearances of a pattern in agraph cannot be larger than the frequency of any of its sub-patterns. In real life; there aremany graphs with weights on nodes and/or edges. For these graphs; it is fair that theimportance (score) of a pattern is determined not only by the number of its appearances; butalso by the weights on the nodes/edges of those appearances. Scoring functions based onthe weights do not generally satisfy the apriori property; thus forcing many approaches toemploy other; less efficient; pruning strategies to speed up the computation.

Data Exploration on Large Amount of Relational Data through Keyword Queries,Domenico Beneventano; Francesco Guerra; Yannis Velegrakis,The paper describes a new approach for querying relational databases through keywordsearch by exploting Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. When users do not know thestructures and the content; keyword search becomes the only efficient and effective solutionfor allowing people exploring a relational database. The approach is based on a unifiedview of the database relations (performed through the full disjunction operator); where itscomposing tuples will be considered as documents to be indexed and searched by meansof an IR search engine. Moreover; as it happens in relational databases; the system canmerge the data stored in different documents for providing a complete answer to the user. Inparticular; two documents can be joined because either their tuples in the original databaseshare some Primary Key or; always in the original database; some tuple is connected by …,High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS); 2017 International Conference on,2017,*
Tell me more using Ladders in Wikipedia,Siarhei Bykau; Jihwan Lee; Divesh Srivastava; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We focus on the problem of" tell me more" information related to a given fact inWikipedia. We use the novel notion of role to link information in an infobox with differentplaces in the text of the same Wikipedia page (space) as well as information across differentrevisions of the page (time). In this way; it is possible to link together pieces of informationthat may not represent the same real world entity; yet have served in the same role. Toachieve this; we introduce a novel structure called ladder that allows such spatial andtemporal linking and we show how to effectively and efficiently construct such structures fromWikipedia data.,Proceedings of the 20th International Workshop on the Web and Databases,2017,*

Multi-Exemplar Queries: Searching in Complex Information Spaces Using Simple Examples,Matteo Lissandrini; Davide Mottin; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,In complex information spaces; it is often hard for users to formally specify the elements ofinterest (ie; the desired answers); either due to lack of technical knowledge; or thecomplexity of the task; or even because they may not know exactly what they are looking for.Exemplar queries constitute a query paradigm that makes this process easier; by allowingusers to provide examples of the elements of interest. However; existing approaches eitherassume that the complete structure of the intended results is known to the user and isunique; or the provided examples are elements that should be present in the result set;therefore restricting the range of queries and answers that are supported. In this paper; wepropose a more general approach; the multi-exemplar query paradigm; where eachexample may describe only some of the desired characteristics of the elements of interest …,*,2016,*
Support of Part-Whole Relations in Query Answering,Piotr Kozikowski; Ekaterini Ioannou; Yannis Velegrakis; Francesco Guerra,Abstract Part-whole relations are ubiquitous in our world; yet they do not get “first-class”treatment in the data managements systems most commonly used today. One aspect of part-whole relations that is particularly important is that of attribute transitivity. Some attributes ofa whole are also attributes of its parts; and vice versa. We propose an extension to a genericentity-centric data model to support part-whole relations and attribute transitivity and providemore meaningful results to certain types of queries as a result. We describe how this modelcan be implemented using an RDF repository and three approaches to infer the implicitinformation necessary for query answering that adheres to the semantics of the model. Thefirst approach is a naive implementation and the other two use indexing to improveperformance. We evaluate several aspects of our implementations in a series of …,Semanitic Keyword-based Search on Structured Data Sources,2015,*

Using a HMM based approach for mapping keyword queries into database terms,S Bergamaschi; F Guerra; M Interlandi; S Rota; R Trillo Rtrillo; Y Velegrakis,Systems translating keyword queries into SQL queries over relational databases are usuallyreferred to in the literature as schema-based approaches. These techniques exploit theinformation contained in the database schema to build SQL queries that express theintended meaning of the user query. Besides; typically; they perform a preliminary step thatassociates keywords in the user query with database elements (names of tables; attributesand domain attributes). In this paper; we present a probabilistic approach based on aHidden Markov Model to provide such mappings. In contrast to most existing techniques; ourproposal does not require any a-priori knowledge of the database extension.,Symposium on Advanced Database Systems SEBD,2013,*

Ranking Query Results based on the Query Semantics and in the Presence of Linkage and Evolution,Y Velegrakis,Keyword queries offer a convenient alternative to traditional SQL in querying databases withlarge; often unknown; schemas and instances. The challenge in answering such queries isto discover their intended semantics; construct the different interpretations in the nativequery language and rank the results. We are going to present a framework forunderstanding and ranking the possible interpretations that; in contrast to existing keyword-based techniques; is not using any a-priori knowledge on the instance data. Once aninterpretation is found; we will present how it can be answered on a database in thepresence of linkage information or of semantic evolution relationships among the data. Themethod considers the different alternatives and ranks the data results according to thelikelihood that they are actually representing the data that the user was actually looking.,International Workshop on Ranking in Databases (DBRank),2012,*

In the flurry ofresearch on RDF data management in the last decade;we can identifythree different perspectives on RDF:(1) a relational perspective;(2) an entityperspective; and (3) a graph-based perspective. Eachof these three perspectives has drawnfrom ideas and results inthree distinct research communities to propose solutionsformanaging RDF data: relational databases (for the relationalperspective); informationretrieval (for the entity perspective); and graph theory and graph databases (for the graph-basedperspective).

Embracing Uncertainty in Entity Linking,Ekaterini Ioannou; Wolfgang Nejdl; Claudia Niederée; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract An important task in data integration and data cleaning is the identification of datathat describe the same real-world object; such as an event; a person; or a movie. There arevarious techniques to tackle this problem. The typical methodology is to collect matchingevidence; such as similarities between the entity strings; and based on them; generateinformation to link the entities. Then; using predefined thresholds; or human intervention; theentities are merged; and thus; queries are executed over the resulted merged entities. In thischapter; we explain the limitations of this methodology on recently introduced data; forinstance data from Web 2.0 applications; and the challenges that such data impose on theentity linkage methodology. We then propose an alternative; generic methodology thatallows the use of the entity linkage information upon query processing. In particular; we …,*,2012,*

Multi-Example Search in Rich Information Graphs,Matteo Lissandrini; Davide Mottin; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract—In rich information spaces; it is often hard for users to formally specify thecharacteristics of the desired answers; either due to the complexity of the schema or of thequery language; or even because they do not know exactly what they are looking for.Exemplar queries constitute a query paradigm that overcomes those problems; by allowingusers to provide examples of the elements of interest in place of the query specification. Inthis paper; we propose a general approach where the user-provided example can compriseseveral partial specification fragments; where each fragment describes only one part of thedesired result. We provide a formal definition of the problem; which generalizes existingformulations for both the relational and the graph model. We then describe exact algorithmsfor its solution for the case of information graphs; as well as top-k algorithms. Experiments …,*,*,*

The first contains the papers presented at the ThirdInternational KEYSTONE Conference (IKC 2017); which was held in Gdansk; Poland; onSeptember 11 and 12; 2017; while the second part contains a number of reports thatsummarize the major activities and achievements that have taken place in the context of theaction.,*,*,*
Social-based Collaborative Filtering,Kostas Stefanidis; Eirini Ntoutsi; Haridimos Kondylakis; Yannis Velegrakis; Collaborative Filtering Using Social Data,Collaborative filtering is a special category of recommender systems that generaterecommendations to the users about certain items; eg; products or services; by relying onpreferences of similar users. Social-based collaborative filtering exploits the vast amount ofdata generated in the social networks to improve the quality of recommendations. Such dataare utilized for different purposes; eg; to deal with traditional recommendation problems;such as the cold start problem; which is caused due to lack of user-related data in therecommender; to derive a better quality user neighborhood by integrating user-relatedinformation from the social networks and to enrich the recommendations by capturingdifferent aspects of the users as they are manifested through the content they share and theirinteractions in the social networks.,*,*,*

2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering,Wei-Shinn Ku; Roger Zimmermann; Haixun Wang,We describe DSPHERE a decentralized system for crawling; indexing; searching andranking of documents in the World Wide Web. Unlike most of the existing searchtechnologies that depend heavily on a page-centric view of the Web; we advocate a source-centric view of the Web and propose a decentralized architecture for crawling; indexing andsearching the Web in a distributed source-specific fashion...,*,*,*

Specification declarative de traducteurs Z39. 50a l’aide de la logique descriptive⋆,Yannis Velegrakis; Vassilis Christophides; Panos Constantopoulos,Resume. Z39. 50 est un protocole client/serveur largement repandu dans les bibliothequeset les musees numeriques; pour rechercher et retrouver l'information repartie dans uncertain nombre de sources heterogenes. Pour surmonter les disparites semantiques etschematiques entre les diverses sources de donnees; le protocole est base sur une vue dumonde d'information comme une liste plate de champs; appeles Points d'Acces (PA). Leprincipal probleme pour developper des traducteurs Z39. 50 est de mettre encorrespondance cette liste non structuree de PAs avec les donnees de la source sous-jacente. Malheureusement; les traducteurs Z39. 50 existants ne fournissent pas deslangages de correspondances de haut niveau avec des proprietes verifiables.

OS BI: Open Research Issues,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Business Intelligence can be defined as the process of turning data into informationand then into knowledge. Business Intelligence systems are centered on data warehouses:large repositories of historical data; organized according to the multidimensional model. Inspite of the large amount of research carried out in the last 20 years; the modern end-to-endbusiness intelligence platforms seem to suffer from the increased/changed user needs. Thisis a consequence of the growth of the business intelligence culture within enterprises on theone hand; and a side effect of the mutated business panorama on the other. While in thepast the business intelligence market was strictly dominated by closed source andcommercial tools; the last few years were characterized by the birth of open sourcesolutions. Commercial platforms are commonly considered superior to open source ones …,*,*,*
