Schema label normalization for improving schema matching,Serena Sorrentino; Sonia Bergamaschi; Maciej Gawinecki; Laura Po,Abstract Schema matching is the problem of finding relationships among concepts acrossheterogeneous data sources that are heterogeneous in format and in structure. Starting fromthe “hidden meaning” associated with schema labels (ie class/attribute names) it is possibleto discover relationships among the elements of different schemata. Lexical annotation (ieannotation wrt a thesaurus/lexical resource) helps in associating a “meaning” to schemalabels. However; the performance of semi-automatic lexical annotation methods on real-world schemata suffers from the abundance of non-dictionary words such as compoundnouns; abbreviations; and acronyms. We address this problem by proposing a method toperform schema label normalization which increases the number of comparable labels.

Using semantic techniques to access web data,Raquel Trillo; Laura Po; Sergio Ilarri; Sonia Bergamaschi; Eduardo Mena,Abstract Nowadays; people frequently use different keyword-based web search engines tofind the information they need on the web. However; many words are polysemous and;when these words are used to query a search engine; its output usually includes links toweb pages referring to their different meanings. Besides; results with different meanings aremixed up; which makes the task of finding the relevant information difficult for the users;especially if the user-intended meanings behind the input keywords are not among the mostpopular on the web. In this paper; we propose a set of semantics techniques to group theresults provided by a traditional search engine into categories defined by the differentmeanings of the input keywords. Differently from other proposals; our method considers theknowledge provided by ontologies available on the web in order to dynamically define …,Information Systems,2011,38

An incremental method for the lexical annotation of domain ontologies,Sonia Bergamaschi; Paolo Bouquet; Daniel Giazomuzzi; Francesco Guerra; Laura Po; Maurizio Vincini,Abstract In this article; we present MELIS (Meaning Elicitation and Lexical IntegrationSystem); a method and a software tool for enabling an incremental process of automaticannotation of local schemas (eg relational database schemas; directory trees) with lexicalinformation. The distinguishing and original feature of MELIS is the incremental process: thehigher the number of schemas which are processed; the more background/domainknowledge is cumulated in the system (a portion of domain ontology is learned at everystep); the better the performance of the systems on annotating new schemas.

A Visual Summary for Linked Open Data sources.,Fabio Benedetti; Laura Po; Sonia Bergamaschi,Abstract. In recent years; there has been an increase in the production of machinereadabledata in the form of RDF Datasets belonging to the Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud; however;this growth has not being followed by an analogous improvement and specialization of toolsto search; analyze and visualize LOD sources. As a matter of fact; when dealing with LODsources; users waste a lot of effort trying to understand which kind of knowledge is storedand how the data are organized within a specific Dataset. In this paper; we propose LODeX;a tool that produces a highly representative summary of a LOD source. Starting from theURL of a SPARQL Endpoint; the tool launches a set of predefined SPARQL queries andautomatically generates a summary of the source. The summary reports statistical andstructural information regarding the LOD Dataset; moreover; it permits to be browsed to …,International Semantic Web Conference (Posters & Demos),2014,21

Online Index Extraction from Linked Open Data Sources.,Fabio Benedetti; Sonia Bergamaschi; Laura Po,Abstract. The production of machine-readable data in the form of RDF datasets belonging tothe Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud is growing very fast. However; selecting relevantknowledge sources from the Cloud; assessing the quality and extracting syntheticalinformation from a LOD source are all tasks that require a strong human effort. This paperproposes an approach for the automatic extraction of the more representative informationfrom a LOD source and the creation of a set of indexes that enhance the description of thedataset. These indexes collect statistical information regarding the size and the complexity ofthe dataset (eg the number of instances); but also depict all the instantiated classes and theproperties among them; supplying user with a synthetical view of the LOD source.

Automatic annotation in data integration systems,Sonia Bergamaschi; Laura Po; Serena Sorrentino,Abstract CWSD (Combined Word Sense Disambiguation) is an algorithm for the automaticannotation of structured and semi-structured data sources. Instead of being targeted totextual data sources like most of the traditional WSD algorithms; CWSD can exploitknowledge from the structure of data sources together with the lexical knowledge associatedwith schema elements (terms in the following). We integrated CWSD in the MOMIS system(Mediator EnvirOment forMultiple Information Sources) 1; which is an \itI^3 frameworkdesigned for the integration of data sources; where the lexical annotation of terms wasperformed manually by the user. CWSD combines a structural disambiguation algorithm;that starts the disambiguation process by using the semantic relationships extracted from thedata source schemata and a WordNet Domains based disambiguation algorithm; which …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2007,15

Lodex: A tool for visual querying linked open data,Fabio Benedetti; Sonia Bergamaschi; Laura Po,Formulating a query on a Linked Open Data (LOD) source is not an easy task; a technicalknowledge of the query language; and; the awareness of the structure of the dataset areessential to create a query. We present a revised version of LODeX that provides the user aneasy way for building queries in a fast and interactive manner. When a user decides toexplore a LOD source; he/she can take advantage of the Schema Summary produced byLODeX (ie a synthetic view of the dataset's structure) and he/she can pick graphicalelements from it to create a visual query. The tool also supports the user in browsing theresults and; eventually; in refining the query. The prototype has been evaluated on hundredsof public SPARQL endpoints (listed in Data Hub) and it is available online at http://dbgroup.unimo. it/lodex2.

Visual querying lod sources with lodex,Fabio Benedetti; Sonia Bergamaschi; Laura Po,Abstract The Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud has more than tripled its sources in just threeyears (from 295 sources in 2011 to 1014 in 2014). While the LOD data are being producedat a increasing rate; LOD tools lack in producing an high level representation of datasetsand in supporting users in the exploration and querying of a source. To overcome the aboveproblems and significantly increase the number of consumers of LOD data; we devised anew method and a tool; called LODeX; that promotes the understanding; navigation andquerying of LOD sources both for experts and for beginners. It also provides a standardizedand homogeneous summary of LOD sources and supports user in the creation of visualqueries on previously unknown datasets. We have extensively evaluated the portability andusability of the tool.

Automatic Lexical Annotation: an effective technique for dynamic data integration,Laura Po; Tutor Prof Sonia Bergamaschi; Co-Tutor Prof Paolo Bouquet,Abstract In this thesis I affirm and prove how lexical annotation is helpful in data integration.Data integration is the problem of combining data residing at different sources; andproviding the user with a unified view of these data. Lexical Annotation is a piece ofinformation added in a document (book; online record; video; or other data); that refers to asemantic resource. Each annotation has the property to own one or more lexicaldescriptions. After the lexical annotation of a source; new lexical relationships between theelements of a schema or among elements of different schemata can be discovered. Severalmethods to accomplish the automatic annotation of data sources will be described and a setof evaluations on different scenarios will be shown. It will be demonstrated that lexicalannotation can refine ontology matching techniques. To this purpose; a set of …,PhD in Computer Science; Doctorate School of Information and Communication Technologies; University of Modena e Reggio Emilia; Italy,2009,9
Automatic lexical annotation applied to the SCARLET ontology matcher,Laura Po; Sonia Bergamaschi,Abstract This paper proposes lexical annotation as an effective method to solve theambiguity problems that affect ontology matchers. Lexical annotation associates to eachontology element a set of meanings belonging to a semantic resource. Performing lexicalannotation on the ontologies involved in the matching process allows to detect false positivemappings and to enrich matching results by adding new mappings (ie lexical relationshipsbetween elements on the basis of the semantic relationships holding among meanings). Thepaper will go through the explanation of how to apply lexical annotation on the resultsobtained by a matcher. In particular; the paper shows an application on the SCARLETmatcher. We adopt an experimental approach on two test cases; where SCARLET waspreviously tested; to investigate the potential of lexical annotation. Experiments yielded …,Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems,2010,8

Comparing LDA and LSA Topic Models for Content-Based Movie Recommendation Systems,Sonia Bergamaschi; Laura Po,Abstract We propose a plot-based recommendation system; which is based upon anevaluation of similarity between the plot of a video that was watched by a user and a largeamount of plots stored in a movie database. Our system is independent from the number ofuser ratings; thus it is able to propose famous and beloved movies as well as old or unheardmovies/programs that are still strongly related to the content of the video the user haswatched. The system implements and compares the two Topic Models; Latent SemanticAllocation (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA); on a movie database of two hundredthousand plots that has been constructed by integrating different movie databases in a localNoSQL (MongoDB) DBMS. The topic models behaviour has been examined on the basis ofstandard metrics and user evaluations; performance assessments with 30 users to …,International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies,2014,5
Exposing the underlying schema of LOD sources,Fabio Benedetti; Sonia Bergamaschi; Laura Po,The Linked Data Principles defined by Tim-Berners Lee promise that a large portion of WebData will be usable as one big interlinked RDF database. Today; with more than onethousand of Linked Open Data (LOD) sources available on the Web; we are assisting to anemerging trend in publication and consumption of LOD datasets. However; the pervasiveuse of external resources together with a deficiency in the definition of the internal structureof a dataset causes many LOD sources are extremely complex to understand. In this paper;we describe a formal method to unveil the implicit structure of a LOD dataset by building a(Clustered) Schema Summary. The Schema Summary contains all the main classes andproperties used within the datasets; whether they are taken from external vocabularies ornot; and is conceivable as an RDFS ontology.

Uncertainty in data integration systems: automatic generation of probabilistic relationships,Sonia Bergamaschi; Laura Po; Serena Sorrentino; Alberto Corni,Abstract This paper proposes a method for the automatic discovery of probabilisticrelationships in the environment of data integration systems. Dynamic data integrationsystems extend the architecture of current data integration systems by modeling uncertaintyat their core. Our method is based on probabilistic word sense disambiguation (PWSD);which allows to automatically lexically annotate (ie to perform annotation wrt athesaurus/lexical resource) the schemata of a given set of data sources to be integrated.From the annotated schemata and the relathionships defined in the thesaurus; we derivedthe probabilistic lexical relationships among schema elements. Lexical relationships arecollected in the Probabilistic Common Thesaurus (PCT); as well as structural relationships.,*,2010,4
The MOMIS-STASIS approach for ontology-based data integration,Domenico Beneventano; Mirko Orsini; Laura Po; Serena Sorrentino,Abstract. Ontology based Data Integration involves the use of ontology (s) to effectivelycombine data and information from multiple heterogeneous sources [18]. Ontologies can beused in an integration task to describe the semantics of the information sources and to makethe contents explicit. With respect to the integration of data sources; they can be used for theidentification and association of semantically corresponding information concepts; ie for thedefinition of semantic mapping among concepts of the information sources. MOMIS is a DataIntegration System which performs information extraction and integration from bothstructured and semi-structured data sources [7]. The goal of the STASIS project is to create acomprehensive application suite which allows enterprises to simplify the mapping processbetween data schemas based on semantics [1].

Dealing with uncertainty in lexical annotation,Bergamaschi Sonia; Po Laura; Sorrentino Serena,We present ALA; a tool for the automatic lexical annotation (ie annotation wrt athesaurus/lexical resource) of structured and semi-structured data sources and the discoveryof probabilistic lexical relationships in a data integration environment. ALA performsautomatic lexical annotation through the use of probabilistic annotations; ie an annotation isassociated to a probability value. By performing probabilistic lexical annotation; we discoverprobabilistic inter-sources lexical relationships among schema elements.
