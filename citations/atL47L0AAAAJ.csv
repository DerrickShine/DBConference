E-services: a look behind the curtain,Richard Hull; Michael Benedikt; Vassilis Christophides; Jianwen Su,Abstract The emerging paradigm of electronic services promises to bring to distributedcomputation and services the flexibility that the web has brought to the sharing ofdocuments. An understanding of fundamental properties of e-service composition isrequired in order to take full advantage of the paradigm. This paper examines proposals andstandards for e-services from the perspectives of XML; data management; workflow; andprocess models. Key areas for study are identified; including behavioral service signatures;verification and synthesis techniques for composite services; analysis of service datamanipulation commands; and XML analysis applied to service specifications. We give asample of the relevant results and techniques in each of these areas.,Proceedings of the twenty-second ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2003,316
XPath satisfiability in the presence of DTDs,Michael Benedikt; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract We study the satisfiability problem associated with XPath in the presence of DTDs.This is the problem of determining; given a query p in an XPath fragment and a DTD D;whether or not there exists an XML document T such that T conforms to D and the answer ofp on T is nonempty. We consider a variety of XPath fragments widely used in practice; andinvestigate the impact of different XPath operators on the satisfiability analysis. We first studythe problem for negation-free XPath fragments with and without upward axes; recursion anddata-value joins; identifying which factors lead to tractability and which to NP-completeness.We then turn to fragments with negation but without data values; establishing lower andupper bounds in the absence and in the presence of upward modalities and recursion. Weshow that with negation the complexity ranges from PSPACE to EXPTIME. Moreover …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2008,288
Safe constraint queries,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin,We extend some of the classical characterization theorems of relational database theory---particularly those related to query safety---to the context where database elements comewith fixed interpreted structure and where formulae over elements of that structure can beused in queries. We show that the addition of common interpreted functions; such as realaddition and multiplication; to the relational calculus preserves important characterizationtheorems of the relational calculus and also preserves certain combinatorial properties ofqueries. Our main result of the first kind is that there is a syntactic characterization of thecollection of safe queries over the relational calculus supplemented by a wide class ofinterpreted functions---a class that includes addition; multiplication; and exponentiation---and that this characterization gives us an interpreted analog of the concept of range …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2000,215
VeriWeb: Automatically testing dynamic web sites,Michael Benedikt; Juliana Freire; Patrice Godefroid,Abstract Web sites are becoming increasingly complex as more and more services andinformation are made available over the Internet and intranets. At the same time; the correctbehavior of sites has become crucial to the success of businesses and organizations andthus should be tested thoroughly and frequently. Although traditional software testing isalready a notoriously hard; time-consuming and expensive process; testing Web sitespresents even greater challenges: Web interfaces are very dynamic; the environment of Webapplications is more complex than that of typical monolithic or client-server applications;Web applications; most notably e-commerce sites; have a large number of users who haveno training on how to use the application and hence are more likely to exercise it inunpredictable ways.

Structural properties of XPath fragments,Michael Benedikt; Wenfei Fan; Gabriel Kuper,Abstract We study structural properties of each of the main sublanguages of navigationalXPath (W3c Recommendation) commonly used in practice. First; we characterize theexpressive power of these language fragments in terms of both logics and tree patterns.Second; we investigate closure properties; focusing on the ability to perform basic Booleanoperations while remaining within the fragment. We give a complete picture of the closureproperties of these fragments; treating XPath expressions both as functions of arbitrarynodes in a document tree; and as functions that are applied only at the root of the tree.Finally; we provide sound and complete axiom systems and normal forms for several ofthese fragments. These results are useful for simplification of XPath expressions andoptimization of XML queries.,Theoretical Computer Science,2005,194
Analysis of recursive state machines,Rajeev Alur; Michael Benedikt; Kousha Etessami; Patrice Godefroid; Thomas Reps; Mihalis Yannakakis,Abstract Recursive state machines (RSMs) enhance the power of ordinary state machinesby allowing vertices to correspond either to ordinary states or to potentially recursiveinvocations of other state machines. RSMs can model the control flow in sequentialimperative programs containing recursive procedure calls. They can be viewed as a visualnotation extending Statecharts-like hierarchical state machines; where concurrency isdisallowed but recursion is allowed. They are also related to various models of pushdownsystems studied in the verification and program analysis communities. After introducingRSMs and comparing their expressiveness with other models; we focus on whetherverification can be efficiently performed for RSMs. Our first goal is to examine the verificationof linear time properties of RSMs. We begin this study by dealing with two key …,ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS),2005,182

Relational expressive power of constraint query languages,Michael Benedikt; Guozhu Dong; Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract The expressive power of first-order query languages with several classes ofequality and inequality constraints is studied in this paper. We settle the conjecture thatrecursive queries such as parity test and transitive closure cannot be expressed in therelational calculus augmented with polynomial inequality constraints over the reals.Furthermore; noting that relational queries exhibit several forms of genericity; we establish anumber of collapse results of the following form: The class of generic Boolean queriesexpressible in the relational calculus augmented with a given class of constraints coincideswith the class of queries expressible in the relational calculus (with or without an orderrelation). We prove such results for both the natural and active-domain semantics. As aconsequence; the relational calculus augmented with polynomial inequalities expresses …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1998,156

Efficient network aware search in collaborative tagging sites,Sihem Amer Yahia; Michael Benedikt; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract The popularity of collaborative tagging sites presents a unique opportunity toexplore keyword search in a context where query results are determined by the opinion of anetwork of taggers related to a seeker. In this paper; we present the first in-depth study ofnetwork-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of ananswer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue thatobvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive; due to the dependence ofscores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintainingscore upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag; over the entire collection of users. The resulting boundsare very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,125

A decidable logic for describing linked data structures,Michael Benedikt; Thomas Reps; Mooly Sagiv,Abstract This paper aims to provide a better formalism for describing properties of linkeddata structures (eg; lists; trees; graphs); as well as the intermediate states that arise whensuch structures are destructively updated. The paper defines a new logic that is suitable forthese purposes (called L r; for “logic of reachability expressions”). We show that L r isdecidable; and explain how L r relates to two previously defined structuredescriptionformalisms (“path matrices” and “static shape graphs”) by showing how an arbitrary shapedescriptor from each of these formalisms can be translated into an L r formula.,European Symposium on Programming,1999,97

DTD-directed publishing with attribute translation grammars,Michael Benedikt; Chee Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Rajeev Rastogi; Shihui Zheng; Aoying Zhou,This chapter presents formalism and ATGs; for publishing relational data in XML with respectto a predefined DTD; and gives efficient algorithms for evaluating ATGs. There are keydifferences between ATGs and traditional attribute grammars. A traditional AG is definedwith a context free grammar and more complicated attributes (synthesized and inherited). Ittakes a string as an input; parses the string with the grammar; and computes attributes. Incontrast; it is not possible to “parse” a relational database with a DTD; thus; an ATG extractsrelevant data from the database via queries; and then constructs a parse tree of the DTDusing the data. There have also been applications of AGs to databases; for example; forconstructing query automata and for querying text files. These are mild variations oftraditional AGs and are quite different from ATGs.DTD-Directed Publishing with Attribute …,*,2002,77
Capturing both types and constraints in data integration,Michael Benedikt; Chee-Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Juliana Freire; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract We propose a framework for integrating data from multiple relational sources intoan XML document that both conforms to a given DTD and satisfies predefined XMLconstraints. The framework is based on a specification language; AIG; that extends a DTD by(1) associating element types with semantic attributes (inherited and synthesized; inspiredby the corresponding notions from Attribute Grammars);(2) computing these attributes viaparameterized SQL queries over multiple data sources; and (3) incorporating XML keys andinclusion constraints. The novelty of AIG consists in semantic attributes and theirdependency relations for controlling context-dependent; DTD-directed construction of XMLdocuments; as well as for checking XML constraints in parallel with document-generation.We also present cost-based optimization techniques for efficiently evaluating AIGs …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,74
Challenges in searching online communities,Sihem Amer Yahia; Michael Benedikt; Philip Bohannon,Abstract An ever-growing number of users participate in online communities such as Flickr;del. icio. us; and YouTube; making friends and sharing content. Users come to these sites tofind out about general trends–the most popular tags; or the most recently tagged item–aswell as for more specific information; such as the recent posts of one of their friends. Whilethese activities correspond to different user needs; they all can be seen as the filtering ofresources in communities by various search criteria. We provide a survey of these searchtasks and discuss the challenges in their efficient and effective evaluation. 1,IEEE Data Eng. Bull,2007,58
Stability theory; permutations of indiscernibles; and embedded finite models,John Baldwin; Michael Benedikt,Abstract: We show that the expressive power of first-order logic over finite models embeddedin a model $ M $ is determined by stability-theoretic properties of $ M $. In particular; weshow that if $ M $ is stable; then every class of finite structures that can be defined byembedding the structures in $ M $; can be defined in pure first-order logic. We also showthat if $ M $ does not have the independence property; then any class of finite structures thatcan be defined by embedding the structures in $ M $; can be defined in first-order logic overa dense linear order. This extends known results on the definability of classes of finitestructures and ordered finite structures in the setting of embedded finite models. Theseresults depend on several results in infinite model theory. Let $ I $ be a set of indiscerniblesin a model $ M $ and suppose $(M; I) $ is elementarily equivalent to $(M_1; I_1) $ where …,Transactions of the American Mathematical Society,2000,56
LTL model checking of interval Markov chains,Michael Benedikt; Rastislav Lenhardt; James Worrell,Abstract Interval Markov chains (IMCs) generalize ordinary Markov chains by having interval-valued transition probabilities. They are useful for modeling systems in which sometransition probabilities depend on an unknown environment; are only approximately known;or are parameters that can be controlled. We consider the problem of computing values forthe unknown probabilities in an IMC that maximize the probability of satisfying an ω-regularspecification. We give new upper and lower bounds on the complexity of this problem. Wethen describe an approach based on an expectation maximization algorithm. We providesome analytical guarantees on the algorithm; and show how it can be combined withtranslation of logic to automata. We give experiments showing that the resulting systemgives a practical approach to model checking IMCs.,International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,2013,50

Regular tree languages definable in FO,Michael Benedikt; Luc Segoufin,Abstract We consider regular languages of ranked labeled trees. We give an algebraiccharacterization of the regular languages over such trees that are definable in first-orderlogic in the language of labeled graphs. These languages are the analog on ranked trees ofthe “locally threshold testable” languages on strings. We show that this characterizationyields a decision procedure for determining whether a regular collection of trees is first-orderdefinable: the procedure is polynomial time in the minimal automaton presenting the regularlanguage.,Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science,2005,47
Definable relations and first-order query languages over strings,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin; Thomas Schwentick; Luc Segoufin,Abstract We study analogs of classical relational calculus in the context of strings. We startby studying string logics. Taking a classical model-theoretic approach; we fix a set of stringoperations and look at the resulting collection of definable relations. These form an algebra---a class of n-ary relations for every n; closed under projection and Boolean operations. Weshow that by choosing the string vocabulary carefully; we get string logics that havedesirable properties: computable evaluation and normal forms. We identify five distinctmodels and study the differences in their model-theory and complexity of evaluation. Weidentify a subset of these models that have additional attractive properties; such as finite VCdimension and quantifier elimination. Once you have a logic; the addition of free predicatesymbols gives you a string query language. The resulting languages have attractive …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2003,47

On the structure of queries in constraint query languages,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin,We study the structure of first-order and second-order queries over constraint databases.Constraint databases are formally modeled as finite relational structures embedded in somefixed infinite structure. We concentrate on problems of elimination of constraints; reducingquantification range to the active domain of the database and obtaining new complexitybounds. We show that for a large class of signatures; including real arithmetic constraints;unbounded quantification can be eliminated. That is; one can transform a sentencecontaining unrestricted quantification over the infinite universe to get an equivalent sentencein which quantifiers range over the finite relational structure. We use this result to get a newcomplexity upper bound on the evaluation of real arithmetic constraints. We also expandupon techniques for getting upper bounds on the expressiveness of constraint query …,Logic in Computer Science; 1996. LICS'96. Proceedings.; Eleventh Annual IEEE Symposium on,1996,45
Verifiable properties of database transactions,Michael Benedikt; Timothy Griffin; Leonid Libkin,Abstract It is often necessary to ensure that database transactions preserve integrityconstraints that specify valid database states. While it is possible to monitor for violations ofconstraints at run-time; rolling back transactions when violations are detected; it is preferableto verify correctness statically; beforetransactions are executed. This can be accomplished ifwe can verify transaction safety with respect to a set of constraints by means ofcalculatingweakest preconditions. We study properties of weakest preconditions for anumber of transaction and specification languages. We show that some simple transactionsdo not admit weakest preconditions over first-order logic and some of its extensions such asfirst-order logic with counting and monadicΣ 1 1. We also show that the class of transactionsthat admit weakest preconditions over first-order logic cannot be captured by any …,Information and Computation,1998,41

Automated update management for XML integrity constraints,Michael Benedikt; Glenn Bruns; Julie Gibson; Robin Kuss; Amy Ng,Abstract A key problem in data management is the maintenance of integrity constraints asupdates arrive. This is often done with handwritten code; but it is preferable to use code thatis generated automatically from formally-defined constraints. A problem in doing so;especially for applications in which data is stored as an XML document; is the lack of apowerful integrity constraint language for which incremental maintenance can be performedefficiently. This paper presents∆ X; an XML-based language for integrity constraints and acompiler for producing incremental constraint-checking code. The∆ X language is based onXPath and XML Schema; but is specifically designed to support the automated generation ofincremental constraint-checking code.,Program Language Technologies for XML (PLANX02),2002,39
Semantics; types and effects for XML updates,Michael Benedikt; James Cheney,Abstract The W3C recently released the XQuery Update Facility 1.0; a CandidateRecommendation for an XML update language. It appears likely that this proposal willbecome standard. XQuery has been equip-ped with a formal semantics and sound typesystem; but there has been little work on static analysis or typechecking of XML updates; andthe typing rules in the current W3C proposal appear unsound for “transform” queries thatperform embedded updates. In this paper; we investigate the problem of schema alteration;or synthesizing an output schema describing the result of an update applied to a given inputschema.

Automata vs. logics on data words,Michael Benedikt; Clemens Ley; Gabriele Puppis,Abstract The relationship between automata and logics has been investigated since the1960s. In particular; it was shown how to determine; given an automaton; whether or not it isdefinable in first-order logic with label tests and the order relation; and for first-order logicwith the successor relation. In recent years; there has been much interest in languages overan infinite alphabet. Kaminski and Francez introduced a class of automata called finitememory automata (FMA); that represent a natural analog of finite state machines. A FMA canuse; in addition to its control state; a (bounded) number of registers to store and comparevalues from the input word. The class of data languages recognized by FMA is incomparablewith the class of data languages defined by firstorder formulas with the order relation and anadditional binary relation for data equality.

Adding Updates to XQuery: Semantics; Optimization; and Static Analysis.,Michael Benedikt; Angela Bonifati; Sergio Flesca; Avinash Vyas,The need to extend XQuery to support updates has been recognized both in the researchand the standards community. Several language proposals and prototype implementationshave been put forward; and update language requirements are being defined within theW3C. Most proposals center around the use of update primitives applied to XQueryexpressions; along with a variant of the FLWR loop construct binding variables within ablock of basic update statements. In defining a precise semantics for such statements anumber of issues arise: one must decide how conflicts among updates are to be resolved;and how query evaluation interacts with update application. In this work we provide aframework for defining alternative semantics for updates; and identify within this space whatis (thus far) the consensus choice: that semantics involves a twostage execution process …,XIME-P,2005,31
Destabilizers and independence of XML updates,Michael Benedikt; James Cheney,Abstract Independence analysis is the problem of determining whether an update affects theresult of a query; eg a constraint or materialized view.

Focusing on XML queries as the viewlanguage and the XQuery Update Facility as the update language; we present a syntacticquery rewriting algorithm for translating queries to destabilizers; and show that intersectionchecking can be reduced to satisfiability problems for which efficient checkers already exist.We present an implementation based on an expressive tree satisfiability checker and a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,30
From XQuery to relational logics,Michael Benedikt; Christoph Koch,Abstract Predicate logic has long been seen as a good foundation for querying relationaldata. This is embodied in the correspondence between relational calculus and first-orderlogic; and can also be seen in mappings from fragments of the standard relational querylanguage SQL to extensions of first-order logic (eg with counting). A key question is what isthe analog to this correspondence for querying tree-structured data; as seen; for example; inXML documents. We formalize this as the question of the appropriate logical query languagefor defining transformations on tree-structured data. The predominant practitioner paradigmfor defining such transformations is top-down tree building. This is embodied by the XQueryquery language; which builds the output tree in parallel starting at the root; based onvariable bindings and nodeset queries in the XPath language. The goal of this article is to …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,30
Verification of tree updates for optimization,Michael Benedikt; Angela Bonifati; Sergio Flesca; Avinash Vyas,Abstract With the rise of XML as a standard format for representing tree-shaped data; newprogramming tools have emerged for specifying transformations to tree-like structures. Arecent example along this line are the update languages of [16; 15; 8] which add tree updateprimitives on top of the declarative query languages XPath and XQuery. These tree updatelanguages use a “snapshot semantics”; in which all querying is performed first; after which agenerated sequence of concrete updates is performed in a fixed order determined by queryevaluation. In order to gain efficiency; one would prefer to perform updates as soon as theyare generated; before further querying. This motivates a specific verification problem: givena tree update program; determine whether generated updates can be performed before allquerying is completed. We formalize this notion; which we call “Binding Independence” …,International Conference on Computer Aided Verification,2005,30
Schema-based independence analysis for XML updates,Michael Benedikt; James Cheney,Abstract Query-update independence analysis is the problem of determining whether anupdate affects the results of a query. Query-update independence is useful for avoidingrecomputation of materialized views and may have applications to access control andconcurrency control. This paper develops static analysis techniques for query-updateindependence problems involving core XQuery queries and updates with a snapshotsemantics (based on the W3C XQuery Update Facility proposal). Our approach takesadvantage of schema information; in contrast to previous work on this problem. We formalizeour approach; sketch a proof of correctness; and report on the performance and accuracy ofour implementation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,29
Rewriting guarded negation queries,Vince Bárány; Michael Benedikt; Balder Ten Cate,Abstract The Guarded Negation Fragment (GNFO) is a fragment of first-order logic thatcontains all unions of conjunctive queries; a restricted form of negation that suffices forexpressing some common uses of negation in SQL queries; and a large class of integrityconstraints. At the same time; as was recently shown; the syntax of GNFO is restrictiveenough so that static analysis problems such as query containment are still decidable. Thissuggests that; in spite of its expressive power; GNFO queries are amenable to noveloptimizations. In this paper we provide further evidence for this; establishing that GNFOqueries have distinctive features with respect to rewriting. Our results include effectivepreservation theorems for GNFO; Craig Interpolation and Beth Definability results; and theability to express the certain answers of queries with respect to GNFO constraints within …,International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science,2013,28
Monadic datalog containment,Michael Benedikt; Pierre Bourhis; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We reconsider the problem of containment of monadic datalog (MDL) queries inunions of conjunctive queries (UCQs). Prior work has dealt with special cases; but has leftthe precise complexity characterization open. We begin by establishing a 2EXPTIME lowerbound on the MDL/UCQ containment problem; resolving an open problem from the early90's. We then present a general approach for getting tighter bounds on the complexity;based on analysis of the number of mappings of queries into tree-like instances. We use themachinery to present an important case of the MDL/UCQ containment problem that is in co-NEXPTIME; and a case that is in EXPTIME. We then show that the technique can be used toget a new tight upper bound for containment of tree automata in UCQs. We show that thenew MDL/UCQ upper bounds are tight.,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,2012,28
Probabilistic XML via Markov chains,Michael Benedikt; Evgeny Kharlamov; Dan Olteanu; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We show how Recursive Markov Chains (RMCs) and their restrictions can defineprobabilistic distributions over XML documents; and study tractability of querying over suchmodels. We show that RMCs subsume several existing probabilistic XML models. In contrastto the latter; RMC models (i) capture probabilistic versions of XML schema languages suchas DTDs;(ii) can be exponentially more succinct; and (iii) do not restrict the domain ofprobability distributions to be finite. We investigate RMC models for which tractability can beachieved; and identify several tractable fragments that subsume known tractableprobabilistic XML models. We then look at the space of models between existingprobabilistic XML formalisms and RMCs; giving results on the expressiveness andsuccinctness of RMC subclasses; both with each other and with prior formalisms.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,28
Reachability and connectivity queries in constraint databases,Michael Benedikt; Martin Grohe; Leonid Libkin; Luc Segoufin,Abstract It is known that standard query languages for constraint databases lack the powerto express connectivity properties. Such properties are important in the context ofgeographical databases; where one naturally wishes to ask queries about connectivity(What are the connected components of a given set?) or reachability (Is there a path from Ato B that lies entirely in a given region?). No existing constraint query languages that allowclosed-form evaluation can express these properties. In the first part of the paper; we showthat; in principle; there is no obstacle to getting closed languages that can expressconnectivity and reachability queries. In fact; we show that adding any topological propertyto standard languages like FO+ Lin and FO+ Poly results in a closed language. In thesecond part of the paper; we look for tractable closed languages for expressing …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2003,28

The invention then provides for pre-processing the querybefore submittal to a database engine associated with the database system wherein a resultof the pre-processing operation is to ensure that a query provided to the engine is safe.Safety has a different meaning depending on the application. For example; safety mayinclude ensuring that a query will return an output with finite results or it may includeensuring that certain geometric properties in the query are preserved in the output.,*,2001,28
Efficient and expressive tree filters,Michael Benedikt; Alan Jeffrey,Abstract We investigate streaming evaluation of filters on XML documents; evaluated both atthe root node and at an arbitrary node. Motivated by applications in protocol processing; weare interested in algorithms that make one pass over the input; using space that isindependent of the data and polynomial in the filter. We deal with a logic equivalent to theXPath language; and also an extension with an Until operator. We introduce restrictedsublanguages based on looking only at “reversed” axes; and show that these allowpolynomial space streaming implementations. We further show that these fragments areexpressively complete. Our results make use of techniques developed for the study of LinearTemporal Logic; applied to XML filtering.,International Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science,2007,27
Regular tree languages definable in FO and in FO mod,Michael Benedikt; Luc Segoufin,Abstract We consider regular languages of labeled trees. We give an effectivecharacterization of the regular languages over such trees that are definable in first-orderlogic in the language of labeled graphs. These languages are the analog on trees of the“locally threshold testable” languages on strings. We show that this characterization yields adecision procedure for determining whether a regular tree language is first-order definable:The procedure is polynomial time in the minimal automaton presenting the regularlanguage. We also provide an algorithm for deciding whether a regular language isdefinable in first-order logic supplemented with modular quantifiers.,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2009,25
Towards a characterization of order-invariant queries over tame graphs,Michael Benedikt; Luc Segoufin,Abstract This work deals with the expressive power of logics on finite graphs with access toan additional “arbitrary” linear order. The queries that can be expressed this way are theorder-invariant queries for the logic. For the standard logics used in computer science; suchas first-order logic; it is known that access to an arbitrary linear order increases theexpressiveness of the logic. However; when we look at the separating examples; we findthat they have satisfying models whose Gaifman Graph is complex–unbounded in valenceand in treewidth. We thus explore the expressiveness of order-invariant queries over well-behaved graphs. We prove that first-order order-invariant queries over strings and treeshave no additional expressiveness over first-order logic in the original signature. We alsoprove new upper bounds on order-invariant queries over bounded treewidth and …,The Journal of Symbolic Logic,2009,25
Expressive power of unary counters,Michael Benedikt; H Jerome Keisler,Abstract We compare the expressive power on finite models of two extensions of first orderlogic L with equality. L (Ct) is formed by adding an operator count x∶ ϕ; which builds a termof sort N that counts the number of elements of the finite model satisfying a formula ϕ. Ourmain result shows that the stronger operator count t (x)∶ ϕ; where t (x) is a term of sort N;cannot be expressed in L (Ct). That is; being able to count elements does not allow one tocount terms. This paper also continues our interest in new proof techniques in databasetheory. The proof of the unary counter combines a number of model-theoretic techniquesthat give powerful tools for expressivity bounds: in particular; we discuss here the use ofindiscernibles; the Paris-Harrington form of Ramsey's theorem; and nonstandard models ofarithmetic.,*,1997,25
Exact and approximate aggregation in constraint query languages,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Michael Benedikt Leonid Libkin Bell Laboratories Bell Laboratories 1000 EWarrenville Rd 600 Mountain Avenue Naperville; IL 60566 Murray Hill; NJ 07974 E-mail:benediktObell-labs. com Email: libkinQbell-labs. com We investigate the problem of how toextend constraint query languages with aggregate operators. We deal with standardrelational aggregation; and also with aggregates specific to spatial; data; such as volume.We study several approaches; including the addition of a new class of approximateaggregate operators which allow an error tolerance in the computation.

Determining relevance of accesses at runtime,Michael Benedikt; Georg Gottlob; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Consider the situation where a query is to be answered using Web sources thatrestrict the accesses that can be made on backend relational data by requiring someattributes to be given as input of the service. The accesses provide lookups on the collectionof attributes values that match the binding. They can differ in whether or not they requirearguments to be generated from prior accesses. Prior work has focused on the question ofwhether a query can be answered using a set of data sources; and in developing staticaccess plans (eg; Datalog programs) that implement query answering. We are interested indynamic aspects of the query answering problem: given partial information about the data;which accesses could provide relevant data for answering a given query? We considerimmediate and long-term notions of" relevant accesses"; and ascertain the complexity of …,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,23
Access patterns and integrity constraints revisited,Vince Bárány; Michael Benedikt; Pierre Bourhis,Abstract We consider which queries are answerable in the presence of access restrictionsand integrity constraints; and which portions of the schema are accessible in the presence ofaccess restrictions and constraints. Unlike prior work; we focus on integrity constraintlanguages that subsume inclusion dependencies. We also use a semantic definition ofanswerability: a query is answerable if the accessible information is sufficient to determineits truth value. We show that answerability is decidable for the class of guardeddependencies; which includes all inclusion dependencies; and also for constraints given inthe guarded fragment of first-order logic. We also show that answerable queries have" queryplans" in a restricted language. We give corresponding results for extractability of portions ofthe schema. Our results relate querying with limited access patterns; determinacy-vs …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Database Theory,2013,22
System and method for XML data integration,*,A framework is provided for integrating data from multiple relational sources into an XMLdocument that both conforms to a given DTD and satisfies predefined XML constraints. Theframework is based on a specification language; designated Attribute Integration Grammar(AIG); that extends a DTD by (1) associating element types with semantic attributes;(2)computing these attributes via parameterized SQL queries over multiple data sources; and(3) incorporating XML keys and inclusion constraints. The AIG uniquely operates onsemantic attributes and their dependency relations for controlling context-dependent; DTD-directed construction of XML documents; and; as well as checks XML constraints in parallelwith document-generation.,*,2005,22

Complexity of two-variable logic on finite trees,Saguy Benaim; Michael Benedikt; Witold Charatonik; Emanuel Kieroński; Rastislav Lenhardt; Filip Mazowiecki; James Worrell,Abstract Verification of properties expressed in the two-variable fragment of first-order logicFO 2 has been investigated in a number of contexts. The satisfiability problem for FO 2 overarbitrary structures is known to be NEXPTIME-complete; with satisfiable formulas havingexponential-sized models. Over words; where FO 2 is known to have the sameexpressiveness as unary temporal logic; satisfiability is again NEXPTIME-complete. Overfinite labelled ordered trees; FO 2 has the same expressiveness as navigational XPath; apopular query language for XML documents. Prior work on XPath and FO 2 gives a2EXPTIME bound for satisfiability of FO 2 over trees. This work contains a comprehensiveanalysis of the complexity of FO 2 on trees; and on the size and depth of models. We showthat different techniques are required depending on the vocabulary used; whether the …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2016,21
Method for performing information-preserving DTD schema embeddings,*,Method for performing information-preserving DTD schema embeddings between a sourceschema when matching a source schema and a target schema. The preservation is realizedby a matching process between the two schemas that finds a first string marking of the targetschema; evaluates a legality of the first string marking; determines an estimated minimal costof the first string marking and subsequently adjusts the estimated minimal cost based uponone to one mapping of source schema and target schema subcomponents.,*,2009,20
What you must remember when processing data words,Michael Benedikt; Clemens Ley; Gabriele Puppis,We provide a Myhill-Nerode-like theorem that characterizes the class of data languagesrecognized by deterministic nite-memory automata (DMA). As a byproduct of thischaracterization result; we obtain a canonical representation for any DMA-recognizablelanguage. We then show that this canonical automaton is minimal in a strong sense: it hasthe minimal number of control states and also the minimal amount of internal storage.,Proceedings of AMW 2010,2010,19
Stream firewalling of XML constraints,Michael Benedikt; Alan Jeffrey; Ruy Ley-Wild,Abstract As XML-based messages have become common in many client-server protocols;there is a need to protect application servers from invalid or dangerous messages. Thisleads to the XML stream firewalling problem; that of applying integrity constraints against alarge number of simultaneous streams. We conduct the first investigation of a constraintengine optimized for the generation of XML stream firewalls. We isolate a class of DTDs andXPath constraints which support the generation of low-space filters; and provide algorithmsfor generating firewalls with low per-input-character time and per-stream space. We giveexperimental results which show that we have achieved these goals in practice.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,19
Generating low-cost plans from proofs,Michael Benedikt; Balder Ten Cate; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract We look at generating plans that answer queries over restricted interfaces; makinguse of information about source integrity constraints; access restrictions; and access costs.Our method can exploit the integrity constraints to find low-cost access plans even whenthere is no direct access to relations appearing in the query. The key idea of our method is tomove from a search for a plan to a search for a proof that a query is answerable; andthen\emph {generate a plan from a proof}. Discovery of one proof allows us to find a singleplan that answers the query; exploration of several alternative proofs allows us to find low-cost plans. We start by overviewing a correspondence between proofs and restricted-interface plans in the context of arbitrary first-order constraints; based on interpolation. Thecorrespondence clarifies the connection between preservation and interpolation …,Proceedings of the 33rd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2014,18
Logical definability and query languages over ranked and unranked trees,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin; Frank Neven,Abstract We study relations on trees defined by first-order constraints over a vocabulary thatincludes the tree extension relation T &pr; T′(holding if and only if every branch of Textends to a branch of T′); unary node-tests; and a binary relation checking whether thedomains of two trees are equal. We consider both ranked and unranked trees. These aretrees with and without a restriction on the number of children of nodes. We adopt the model-theoretic approach to tree relations and study relations definable over the structureconsisting of the set of all trees and the aforementioned predicates. We relate definability ofsets and relations of trees to computability by tree automata. We show that some naturalrestrictions correspond to familiar logics in the more classical setting where every tree is astructure over a fixed vocabulary; and to logics studied in the context of XML pattern …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2007,18
Bisimilarity of pushdown automata is nonelementary,Michael Benedikt; Stefan Goller; Stefan Kiefer; Andrzej S Murawski,Abstract Given two pushdown automata; the bisimilarity problem asks whether the infinitetransition systems they induce are bisimilar. While this problem is known to be decidable ourmain result states that it is nonelementary; improving EXPTIME-hardness; which was thebest previously known lower bound for this problem. Our lower bound result holds fornormed pushdown automata as well.,Proceedings of the 2013 28th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science,2013,17
Interpreting tree-to-tree queries,Michael Benedikt; Christoph Koch,Abstract We establish correspondences between top-down tree building query languagesand predicate logics. We consider the expressive power of the query language XQ; a cleancore of the practitioner's language XQuery. We show that all queries in XQ with only atomicequality are equivalent to “first-order interpretations”; an analog to first-order logic (FO) in thesetting of transformations of tree-structured data. When XQ is considered with deep equality;we find that queries can be translated into FO with counting (FO (Cnt)). We establish partialconverses to this; characterizing the subset of the FO resp. FO (Cnt) interpretations thatcorrespond to XQ. Finally; we study the expressive power of fragments of XQ and obtainpartial characterizations in terms of existential FO and a fragment of FO that is two-variable ifthe tree node labeling alphabet is assumed fixed.,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,2006,17
XML subtree queries: Specification and composition,Michael Benedikt; Irini Fundulaki,Abstract A frequent task encountered in XML processing is to filter an input document toproduce a subdocument; that is; a document whose root-to-leaf paths are root-to-leaf pathsof the original document and which inherits the tree structure of the original document.These are what we mean by subtree queries; and while they are similar to XPath filters; theycannot be naturally specified either in XPath or in XQuery. Special-purpose subtree querylanguages provide a natural idiom for specifying this class of queries; but both compositionand evaluation are problematic. In this paper we show that for natural fragments of XPath;the resulting subtree query languages are closed under composition. This closure propertyallows a sequence of subtree queries to be rewritten as a single subtree query; which canthen be evaluated either by a subtree-query specific evaluator or via translation to XQuery …,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,2005,17
Aggregating semantic annotators,Luying Chen; Stefano Ortona; Giorgio Orsi; Michael Benedikt,Abstract A growing number of resources are available for enriching documents withsemantic annotations. While originally focused on a few standard classes of annotations; theecosystem of annotators is now becoming increasingly diverse. Although annotators oftenhave very different vocabularies; with both high-level and specialist concepts; they also havemany semantic interconnections. We will show that both the overlap and the diversity inannotator vocabularies motivate the need for semantic annotation integration: middlewarethat produces a unified annotation on top of diverse semantic annotators. On the one hand;the diversity of vocabulary allows applications to benefit from the much richer vocabularyavailable in an integrated vocabulary. On the other hand; we present evidence that the mostwidely-used annotators on the web suffer from serious accuracy deficiencies: the overlap …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,15
The impact of virtual views on containment,Michael Benedikt; Georg Gottlob,Abstract Virtual views are a mechanism that facilitates re-use and makes queries easier toexpress. However the use of iterative view definitions makes very simple query evaluationand analysis problems more complex. In this paper we study classical containment andequivalence problems for queries built up through simple unions of conjunctive queries andview definitions. More precisely; we determine the complexity of containment andequivalence for non-recursive Datalog. We show that the problem is much harder than itsclassical counterpart--complete for co-NEXPTIME. We then show that this remains true evenwith restrictions on the schema and queries in place. Finally; we isolate subcases that aremore tractable; ranging from NP to PSPACE.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,15
Querying with access patterns and integrity constraints,Michael Benedikt; Julien Leblay; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract Traditional query processing involves a search for plans formed by applyingalgebraic operators on top of primitives representing access to relations in the input query.But many querying scenarios involve two interacting issues that complicate the search. Onthe one hand; the search space may be limited by access restrictions associated with theinterfaces to datasources; which require certain parameters to be given as inputs. On theother hand; the search space may be extended through the presence of integrity constraintsthat relate sources to each other; allowing for plans that do not match the structure of theuser query. In this paper we present the first optimization approach that attacks both thesedifficulties within a single framework; presenting a system in which classical cost-based joinoptimization is extended to support both access-restrictions and constraints.

Regular repair of specifications,Michael Benedikt; Gabriele Puppis; Cristian Riveros,What do you do if a computational object (eg program trace) fails a specification? Anobvious approach is to perform repair: modify the object minimally to get something thatsatisfies the constraints. In this paper we study repair of temporal constraints; given asautomata or temporal logic formulas. We focus on determining the number of repairs thatmust be applied to a word satisfying a given input constraint in order to ensure that itsatisfies a given target constraint. This number may well be unbounded; one of our maincontributions is to isolate the complexity of the" bounded repair problem"; based on acharacterization of the pairs of regular languages that admit such a repair. We consider thisin the setting where the repair strategy is unconstrained and also when the strategy isrestricted to use finite memory. Although the streaming setting is quite different from the …,Logic in Computer Science (LICS); 2011 26th Annual IEEE Symposium on,2011,14

Data Cleaning for Decision Support.,Michael Benedikt; Philip Bohannon; Glenn Bruns,Abstract Data cleaning may involve the acquisition; at some effort or expense; of high-qualitydata. Such data can serve not only to correct individual errors; but also to improve thereliability model for data sources. However; there has been little research into this latter rolefor acquired data. In this short paper we define a new data cleaning model that allows a userto estimate the value of further data acquisition in the face of specific business decisions. Asdata is acquired; the reliability model of sources is updated using Bayesian techniques; thusaiding the user in both developing reasonable probability models for uncertain data and inimproving the quality of that data. Although we do not deal here with the problem of findingoptimal methods for utilizing external data sources; we do show how our formalizationreduces cleaning to a well-studied optimization problem.,CleanDB,2006,14

Tree extension algebras: logics; automata; and query languages,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin,Abstract We study relations on trees defined by first-order constraints over a vocabulary thatincludes the tree extension relation Ì Ì¼; holding if and only if every branch of Ì extends to abranch of Ì¼; unary node-tests; and a binary relation checking if the domains of two trees areequal. We show that from such a formula one can generate a tree automaton that acceptsthe set of tuples of trees defined by the formula; and conversely that every automaton overtree-tuples is captured by such a formula. We look at the fragment with only extensioninequalities and leaf tests; and show that it corresponds to a new class of automata on treetuples; which is strictly weaker then general tree-tuple automata. We use the automatarepresentations to show separation and expressibility results for formulae in the logic. Wethen turn to relational calculi over the logic defined here: that is; from constraints we …,linguistics,2002,14
String operations in query languages,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin; Thomas Schwentick; Luc Segoufin,Abstract We study relational calculi with support for string operations. While SQL restricts theability to mix string pattern-matching and relational operations; prior proposals forembedding SQL in a compositional calculus were based on adding the operation ofconcatenation to first-order logic. These latter proposals yield compositional querylanguages extending SQL; but are unfortunately computationally complete. The unboundedexpressive power in turn implies strong limits on the ability to perform optimization and staticanalysis of properties such as query safety in these languages. In contrast; we look atcompositional extensions of relational calculus that have nice expressiveness; decidability;and safety properties; while capturing string-matching queries used in SQL. We start with anextension based on the string ordering and LIKE predicates.

Expressive power: The finite case,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin,Abstract As we have seen in the previous chapter; usual relational databases are just aspecial case of the constraint model; indeed; a tuple ⃗ a=(a_1;...; a_n) can be representedas a constraint c_ ⃗ a (x_1;...; x_n) ≡ x_1= a_1 ∧... ∧ x_n= a_n in free variables x 1;...; xn.A relation R=\left {⃗ a;...; ⃗ a _m\right\} is then represented by a formula c_R (x_1;...; x_n) ≡c_ ⃗ a ∨ ⋯ ∨ c_ ⃗ a _m stating that the interpretation of a tuple (x 1;...; xn) must be amongthe ⃗ a_i S. Consequently; constraint query languages; over a structure M=\left ⟨ U; Ω\right⟩; can be considered as query languages over ordinary relational databases whoseelements come from the set u. For example; FO+ Lin and FO+ Poly; the relational calculuswith linear and polynomial constraints; can be considered as query languages over ordinaryrelational databases that store numbers.,*,2000,13
Embedded finite models; stability theory; and the impact of order,John T Baldwin; Michael A Benedikt,We extend bounds on the expressive power of first-order logic over finite structures and overordered finite structures; by generalizing to the situation where the finite structures areembedded in an infinite structure M; where M satisfies some simple combinatorial propertiesstudied in model-theoretic stability theory. We first consider first-order logic over finitestructures embedded in a stable structure; and show that it has the same generic expressivepower as first-order logic on unordered finite structures. It follows from this that having theadditional structure of; for example; an abelian group or an equivalence relation; does notallow one to define any new generic queries. We also consider first-order logic over finitestructures living within any model M that lacks the independence property and show that itsexpressive power is bounded by first-order logic over finite ordered structures.

Ultrafilters which extend measures,Michael Benedikt,Abstract We study classes of ultrafilters on ω defined by a natural property of the Loebmeasure in the Nonstandard Universe corresponding to the ultrafilter. This class; theProperty M ultrafilters; is shown to contain all ultrafilters built up by taking iterated productsover collections of pairwise nonisomorphic selective ultrafilters. Results on Property Multrafilters are applied to the construction of extensions of probability measures; and to thestudy of measurable reductions between ultrafilters.,The Journal of Symbolic Logic,1998,12
A step up in expressiveness of decidable fixpoint logics,Michael Benedikt; Pierre Bourhis; Michael Vanden Boom,Abstract Guardedness restrictions are one of the principal means to obtain decidable logics---operators such as negation are restricted so that the free variables are contained in anatom. While guardedness has been applied fruitfully in the setting of first-order logic; theability to add fixpoints while retaining decidability has been very limited. Here we show thatone of the main restrictions imposed in the past can be lifted; getting a richer decidable logicby allowing fixpoints in which the parameters of the fixpoint can be unguarded. Usingautomata; we show that the resulting logics have a decidable satisfiability problem; andprovide a fine study of the complexity of satisfiability. We show that similar methods apply todecide questions concerning the elimination of fixpoints within formulas of the logic.,Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science,2016,11
Querying schemas with access restrictions,Michael Benedikt; Pierre Bourhis; Clemens Ley,Abstract We study verification of systems whose transitions consist of accesses to a Web-based data-source. An access is a lookup on a relation within a relational database; fixingvalues for a set of positions in the relation. For example; a transition can represent access toa Web form; where the user is restricted to filling in values for a particular set of fields. Welook at verifying properties of a schema describing the possible accesses of such a system.We present a language where one can describe the properties of an access path; and alsospecify additional restrictions on accesses that are enforced by the schema. Our mainproperty language; AccLTL; is based on a first-order extension of linear-time temporal logic;interpreting access paths as sequences of relational structures. We also present a lower-level automaton model; A-automata; which AccLTL specifications can compile into. We …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,11

We deal with standard relational aggregation; and also withaggregates specific to spatial data; such as volume. We study several approaches; includingthe addition of a new class of approximate aggregate operators which allow an errortolerance in the computation. We show how techniques of M. Karpinski and A. Macintyre (in“Structures in Logic and Computer Science: A Selection of Essays in Honor of A.Ehrenfeucht;” Springer Lecture Notes on Computer Science 1261; pp. 162–173; Springer-Verlag; Berlin; 1997) and P.

Generating plans from proofs: the interpolation-based approach to query reformulation,Michael Benedikt; Julien Leblay; Balder ten Cate; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract Query reformulation refers to a process of translating a source query—a request forinformation in some high-level logic-based language—into a target plan that abides bycertain interface restrictions. Many practical problems in data management can be seen asinstances of the reformulation problem. For example; the problem of translating an SQLquery written over a set of base tables into another query written over a set of views; theproblem of implementing a query via translating to a program calling a set of database APIs;the problem of implementing a query using a collection of web services. In this book weapproach query reformulation in a very general setting that encompasses all the problemsabove; by relating it to a line of research within mathematical logic.

Determinacy and rewriting of top-down and MSO tree transformations,Michael Benedikt; Joost Engelfriet; Sebastian Maneth,Abstract A query is determined by a view; if the result to the query can be reconstructed fromthe result of the view. We consider the problem of deciding for two given treetransformations; whether one is determined by the other. If the view transformation isinduced by a tree transducer that may copy; then determinacy is undecidable; even foridentity queries. For a large class of non-copying views; namely compositions of functionalextended linear top-down tree transducers with regular look-ahead; we show thatdeterminacy is decidable; where queries are given by deterministic top-down treetransducers with regular look-ahead or by MSO tree transducers. We also show that if aquery is determined; then it can be rewritten into a query that works directly over the viewand is in the same class as the given query. The proof relies on the decidability of …,International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science,2013,10
Positive higher-order queries,Michael Benedikt; Gabriele Puppis; Huy Vu,Abstract We investigate a higher-order query language that embeds operators of the positiverelational algebra within the simply-typed λ-calculus. Our language allows one to succinctlydefine ordinary positive relational algebra queries (conjunctive queries and unions ofconjunctive queries) and; in addition; second-order query functionals; which allow thetransformation of CQs and UCQs in a generic (ie; syntax-independent) way. We investigatethe equivalence and containment problems for this calculus; which subsumes traditionalCQ/UCQ containment. Query functionals are said to be equivalent if the output queries areequivalent; for each possible input query; and similarly for containment. These notions ofcontainment and equivalence depend on the class of (ordinary relational algebra) queriesconsidered. We show that containment and equivalence are decidable when query …,Proceedings of the twenty-ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2010,10
Bounded repairability of word languages,Michael Benedikt; Gabriele Puppis; Cristian Riveros,Abstract What do you do if a computational object (eg program trace) fails a specification?An obvious approach is to perform a repair: modify the object minimally to get something thatsatisfies the constraints. This approach has been investigated in the database community;for integrity constraints; and in the AI community for propositional logics. Here we study howdifficult it is to repair a document in the form of a string. Specifically; we consider number ofedits that must be applied to an input string in order to satisfy a given target language. Thisnumber may be unbounded; our main contribution is to isolate the complexity of thebounded repair problem based on a characterization of the regular languages that admitbounded repairr. We consider the settings where the repair strategy is unconstrained andwhen the editing must be produced in a streaming way; ie by a letter-to-letter transducer.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2013,9
The cost of traveling between languages,Michael Benedikt; Gabriele Puppis; Cristian Riveros,Abstract We show how to calculate the maximum number of edits per character needed toconvert any string in one regular language to a string in another language. Our algorithmmakes use of a local determinization procedure applicable to a subclass of distanceautomata. We then show how to calculate the same property when the editing needs to bedone in streaming fashion; by a finite state transducer; using a reduction to mean-payoffgames. We show that the optimal streaming editor can be produced in PTIME.,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,2011,9

The characterization is in the form ofa query language that can only point that can only talk about points in the set and the“cones” around these points.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2006,9
Higher− Order Functions and Structured Datatypes,Michael Benedikt; Huy Vu,Abstract: Recent proposals from the World Wide Web consortium propose adding support forhigher-order functions within the XQuery standard. In this work we explore languagesadding higher-order features on top of XML and other structured datatypes. We define ahigher-order extension for Core XQuery; along with a higher-order algebra over complexvalues which has the same complexity as the XML-based language. We discuss ourlanguage and its relation with proposed extensions to the XQuery standard; study thecomplexity of evaluation; and briefly discuss our approach to implementing the language.,WebDB: The 15th International Workshop on the Web and Databases (Co− located with ACM SIGMOD),2012,8
Complexity of higher-order queries,Huy Vu; Michael Benedikt,Abstract While relational algebra and calculus are a well-established foundation for classicaldatabase query languages; it is less clear what the analog is for higher-order functions; suchas query transformations. Here we study a natural way to add higher-order functionality toquery languages; by adding database query operators to the λ-calculus as constants. Thisframework; which we refer to as λ-embedded query languages; was introduced in [BPV10].That work had a restricted focus: the containment and equivalence problems for query-to-query functions; in the case where only positive relational operators are allowed asconstants. In this work we take an in-depth look at the most basic issue for such languages:the evaluation problem. We give a full picture of the complexity of evaluation for λ-embeddedquery languages; looking at a number of variations: with negation and without; with only …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Database Theory,2011,8
Relational expressive power of constraint query languages,Michael Benedikt; Guozhu Dong; Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract The expressive power of first-order query languages with several classes ofequality and inequality constraints is studied in this paper. We settle the conjecture thatrecursive queries such as parity test and transitive closure cannot be expressed in therelational calculus augmented with polynomial inequality constraints over the reals.Furthermore; noting that relational queries exhibit several forms of genericity; we establish anumber of collapse results of the following form: The class of generic boolean queriesexpressible in the relational calculus augmented with a given class of constraints coincideswith the class of queries expressible in the relational calculus (with or without an orderrelation). We prove such results for both the natural and active-domain semantics. As aconsequence; the relational calculus augmented with polynomial inequalities expresses …,JOURNAL OF THE ACM,1995,8
Sparqlbye: Querying rdf data by example,Gonzalo Diaz; Marcelo Arenas; Michael Benedikt,Abstract Semantic Web technologies such as RDF and its query language; SPARQL; offerthe possibility of opening up the use of public datasets to a great variety of ordinary users.But a key obstacle to the use of open data is the unfamiliarity of users with the structure ofdata or with SPARQL. To deal with these issues; we introduce a system for querying RDFdata by example. At its core is a technique for reverse-engineering SPARQL queries byexample. We demonstrate how reverse engineering along with other techniques; such asquery relaxation; enables our system; SPARQLByE; to guide users who are unfamiliar withboth the dataset and with SPARQL to the desired query and result set.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,7
Query answering with transitive and linear-ordered data,Antoine Amarilli; Michael Benedikt; Pierre Bourhis; Michael Vanden Boom,Abstract: We consider entailment problems involving powerful constraint languages such asguarded existential rules; in which additional semantic restrictions are put on a set ofdistinguished relations. We consider restricting a relation to be transitive; restricting arelation to be the transitive closure of another relation; and restricting a relation to be a linearorder. We give some natural generalizations of guardedness that allow inference to bedecidable in each case; and isolate the complexity of the corresponding decision problems.Finally we show that slight changes in our conditions lead to undecidability.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.00813,2016,7
The complexity of boundedness for guarded logics,Michael Benedikt; Balder Ten Cate; Thomas Colcombet; Michael Vanden Boom,Abstract—Given a formula φ (x; X) positive in X; the boundedness problem asks whether thefixpoint induced by φ is reached within some uniform bound independent of the structure (iewhether the fixpoint is spurious; and can in fact be captured by a finite unfolding of theformula). In this paper; we study the boundedness problem when φ is in the guardedfragment or guarded negation fragment of first-order logic; or the fixpoint extensions of theselogics. It is known that guarded logics have many desirable computational and modeltheoretic properties; including in some cases decidable boundedness. We prove thatboundedness for the guarded negation fragment is decidable in elementary time; and;making use of an unpublished result of Colcombet; even 2EXPTIME-complete. Our proofextends the connection between guarded logics and automata; reducing boundedness …,Proceedings of the 2015 30th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS),2015,7
The per-character cost of repairing word languages,Michael Benedikt; Gabriele Puppis; Cristian Riveros,Abstract We show how to calculate the maximum number of edits per character needed toconvert any string in one regular language to a string in another language. Our algorithmmakes use of a local determinization procedure applicable to a subclass of distanceautomata. We then show how to calculate the same property when the editing needs to bedone in streaming fashion; by a finite state transducer; using a reduction to mean-payoffgames. In this case; we show that the optimal streaming editor can be produced in P.,Theoretical Computer Science,2014,7
How big must complete XML query languages be?,Clemens Ley; Michael Benedikt,Abstract Marx and de Rijke have shown that the navigational core of the w3c XML querylanguage XPath is not first-order complete--that is it cannot express every query definable infirstorder logic over the navigational predicates. How can one extend XPath to get a first-order complete language? Marx has shown that Conditional XPath--an extension of XPathwith an" Until" operator--is first order complete. The completeness argument makes essentialuse of the presence of upward axes in Conditional XPath. We examine whether it is possibleto get" forward-only" languages that are first-order complete for XML Boolean queries. It iseasy to see that a variant of the temporal logic CTL* is first-order complete; the variant haspath quantifiers for downward; leftward and rightward paths; while along a path one cancheck arbitrary formulas of linear temporal logic (LTL). This language has two major …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory,2009,7
Benchmarking the chase,Michael Benedikt; George Konstantinidis; Giansalvatore Mecca; Boris Motik; Paolo Papotti; Donatello Santoro; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract The chase is a family of algorithms used in a number of data management tasks;such as data exchange; answering queries under dependencies; query reformulation withconstraints; and data cleaning. It is well established as a theoretical tool for understandingthese tasks; and in addition a number of prototype systems have been developed. Whileindividual chase-based systems and particular optimizations of the chase have beenexperimentally evaluated in the past; we provide the first comprehensive and publiclyavailable benchmark---test infrastructure and a set of test scenarios---for evaluating chaseimplementations across a wide range of assumptions about the dependencies and the data.We used our benchmark to compare chase-based systems on data exchange and queryanswering tasks with one another; as well as with systems that can solve similar tasks …,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,6
Effective interpolation and preservation in guarded logics,Michael Benedikt; Balder Ten Cate; Michael Vanden Boom,Abstract Desirable properties of a logic include decidability; and a model theory that inheritsproperties of first-order logic; such as interpolation and preservation theorems. It is knownthat the Guarded Fragment (GF) of first-order logic is decidable and satisfies somepreservation properties from first-order model theory; however; it fails to have Craiginterpolation. The Guarded Negation Fragment (GNF); a recently defined extension; isknown to be decidable and to have Craig interpolation. Here we give the first results oneffective interpolation for extensions of GF. We provide an interpolation procedure for GNFwhose complexity matches the doubly exponential upper bound for satisfiability of GNF. Weshow that the same construction gives not only Craig interpolation; but Lyndon interpolationand relativized interpolation; which can be used to provide effective proofs of some …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2016,6
Generating plans from proofs,Michael Benedikt; Balder Ten Cate; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract We present algorithms for answering queries making use of information aboutsource integrity constraints; access restrictions; and access costs. Our method can exploitthe integrity constraints to find plans even when there is no direct access to relationsappearing in the query. We look at different kinds of plans; depending on the kind ofrelational operators that are permitted within their commands. To each type of plan; weassociate a semantic property that is necessary for having a plan of that type. The key ideaof our method is to move from a search for a plan to a search for a proof of the correspondingsemantic property; and then generate a plan from a proof. We provide algorithms forconverting proofs to plans and show that they will find a plan of the desired type wheneversuch a plan exists. We show that while discovery of one proof allows us to find a single …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,6
Finite open-world query answering with number restrictions,Antoine Amarilli; Michael Benedikt,Open-world query answering is the problem of deciding; given a set of facts; conjunction ofconstraints; and query; whether the facts and constraints imply the query. This amounts toreasoning over all instances that include the facts and satisfy the constraints. We study finiteopen-world query answering (FQA); which assumes that the underlying world is finite andthus only considers the finite completions of the instance. The major known decidable casesof FQA derive from the following: the guarded fragment of first-order logic; which can expressreferential constraints (data in one place points to data in another) but cannot expressnumber restrictions such as functional dependencies; and the guarded fragment withnumber restrictions but on a signature of arity only two. In this paper; we give the firstdecidability results for FQA that combine both referential constraints and number …,Logic in Computer Science (LICS); 2015 30th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on,2015,6
Querying visible and invisible information,Michael Benedikt; Pierre Bourhis; Balder Ten Cate; Gabriele Puppis,Abstract We provide a wide-ranging study of the scenario where a subset of the relations inthe schema are visible---that is; their complete contents are known---while the remainingrelations are invisible. We also have integrity constraints (invariants given by logicalsentences) which may relate the visible relations to the invisible ones. We want to determinewhich information about a query (a positive existential sentence) can be inferred from thevisible instance and the constraints. We consider both positive and negative queryinformation; that is; whether the query or its negation holds. We consider the instance-levelversion of the problem; where both the query and the visible instance are given; as well asthe schema-level version; where we want to know whether truth or falsity of the query can beinferred in some instance of the schema.,Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science,2016,5
Analysis of declarative updates: invited talk,Michael Benedikt,Abstract Declarative XML update languages are harder to analyze than queries. Static typeinference and type checking are certainly more difficult; and even more basic effect analysisproblems are complex--what parts of a document does an update impact? I will begin bysurveying the previous results on analysis of XML updates; and their relation to problems inXPath/XQuery. I will then focus on one interaction problem: do an update and a queryinteract? I will explain why this problem lies at the core of many optimization problems;particularly view maintenance under declarative updates and minimization of number ofpasses in update evaluation. The query/update interaction problem is particularly interestingin that it requires re-examining the notion of query provenance. What does it mean preciselyfor a query to read or depend-on one portion of the document? In the second part of the …,Proceedings of the 2010 EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2010,5
On guard: Producing run-time checks from integrity constraints,Michael Benedikt; Glenn Bruns,Abstract Software applications are inevitably concerned with data integrity; whether the datais stored in a database; files; or program memory. An integrity guard is code executed beforea data update is performed. The guard returns “true” just if the update will preserve dataintegrity. The problem considered here is how integrity guards can be producedautomatically from data integrity constraints. We seek a solution that can be applied ingeneral programming contexts; and that leads to efficient integrity guards. In this paper wepresent a new integrity constraint language and guard generation algorithms that are basedon a rich object data model.,International Conference on Algebraic Methodology and Software Technology,2004,5
Combining Existential Rules and Description Logics.,Antoine Amarilli; Michael Benedikt,Abstract Query answering under existential rules—implications with existential quantifiers inthe head—is known to be decidable when imposing restrictions on the rule bodies such asfrontier-guardedness [Baget et al.; 2010; 2011a]. Query answering is also decidable fordescription logics [Baader; 2003]; which further allow disjunction and functionalityconstraints (assert that certain relations are functions); however; they are focused on ER-type schemas; where relations have arity two. This work investigates how to get the best ofboth worlds: having decidable existential rules on arbitrary arity relations; while allowing richdescription logics; including functionality constraints; on arity-two relations. We first shownegative results on combining such decidable languages. Second; we introduce anexpressive set of existential rules (frontier-one rules with a certain restriction) which can …,IJCAI,2015,4
Interpolation with decidable fixpoint logics,Michael Benedikt; Balder Ten Cate; Michael Vanden Boom,Abstract—A logic satisfies Craig interpolation if whenever one formula φ1 in the logic entailsanother formula φ2 in the logic; there is an intermediate formula—one entailed by φ1 andentailing φ2—using only relations in the common signature of φ1 and φ2. Uniforminterpolation strengthens this by requiring the interpolant to depend only on φ1 and thecommon signature. A uniform interpolant can thus be thought of as a minimal upperapproximation of a formula within a subsignature. For firstorder logic; interpolation holds butuniform interpolation fails. Uniform interpolation is known to hold for several modal anddescription logics; but little is known about uniform interpolation for fragments of predicatelogic over relations with arbitrary arity. Further; little is known about ordinary Craiginterpolation for logics over relations of arbitrary arity that have a recursion mechanism …,Proceedings of the 2015 30th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS),2015,4
Analysis of schemas with access restrictions,Michael Benedikt; Pierre Bourhis; Clemens Ley,Abstract We study verification of systems whose transitions consist of accesses to a Web-based data source. An access is a lookup on a relation within a relational database; fixingvalues for a set of positions in the relation. For example; a transition can represent access toa Web form; where the user is restricted to filling in values for a particular set of fields. Welook at verifying properties of a schema describing the possible accesses of such a system.We present a language where one can describe the properties of an access path and alsospecify additional restrictions on accesses that are enforced by the schema. Our mainproperty language; AccessLTL; is based on a first-order extension of linear-time temporallogic; interpreting access paths as sequences of relational structures. We also present alower-level automaton model; A-automata; into which AccessLTL specifications can …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,4
PDQ: Proof-driven query answering over web-based data,Michael Benedikt; Julien Leblay; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract The data needed to answer queries is often available through Web-based APIs.Indeed; for a given query there may be many Web-based sources which can be used toanswer it; with the sources overlapping in their vocabularies; and differing in their accessrestrictions (required arguments) and cost. We introduce PDQ (Proof-Driven QueryAnswering); a system for determining a query plan in the presence of web-based sources. Itis:(i) constraint-aware--exploiting relationships between sources to rewrite an expensivequery into a cheaper one;(ii) access-aware--abiding by any access restrictions known in thesources; and (iii) cost-aware--making use of any cost information that is available aboutservices. PDQ takes the novel approach of generating query plans from proofs that a queryis answerable. We demonstrate the use of PDQ and its effectiveness in generating low …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,4
HOMES: A Higher− Order Mapping Evaluation System,Huy Vu; Michael Benedikt,Abstract: We describe a system that integrates querying and query transformation in a singlehigher-order query language. The system allows users to write queries that integrate andcombine query transformations. The power of higher-order functions also allows one tosuccinctly write complex relational queries. Our demonstration shows the utility of thesystem; explains the implementation architecture on top of a relational DBMS; and explainsoptimizations that combine subquery caching techniques from relational databases withsharing detection schemes from functional programming.,VLDB: The 37th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases,2011,4
Minimal memory automata,Michael Benedikt; Clemens Ley; Gabriele Puppis,Abstract. We provide a Myhill-Nerode-like theorem that characterizes the class of datalanguages recognized by deterministic finite-memory automata (DMA). As a byproduct ofthis characterization result; we obtain a canonical representation for any DMA-recognizablelanguage. We then show that this canonical automaton is minimal in a strong sense: it hasthe minimal number of control states and also the minimal amount of internal storage. Wefinally show how this minimal automaton can be computed.,Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Databases,2010,4
Definability over linear constraints,Michael Benedikt; H Jerome Keisler,Abstract We settle a number of questions concerning definability in first order logics with anextra predicate symbol ranging over semi-linear sets. These questions are motivated by theconstraint database model for representing spatial data. We give new results both on thepositive and negative side: we show that in first-order logic one cannot query a semi-linearset as to whether or not it contains a line; or whether or not it contains the line segmentbetween two given points. However; we show that some of these queries become definableif one makes small restrictions on the semi-linear sets considered.,International Workshop on Computer Science Logic,2000,4

Grammar and method for integrating XML data from multiple sources,*,A grammar for mapping a first grouping of XML data into a second grouping of XML data anda method for accomplishing same to incorporate the first grouping into the second grouping.The grammar includes a first rule for computing a first child element attribute and a secondrule for computing a second parent element attribute. The first rule and second rule varyaccording to a production of an element type of the first grouping. The element types includePCDATA; disjunctive; conjunctive and Kleene star; each having a unique rule set fordefining inherited and synthesized attributes of the parent and child elements. The methodincludes the step of executing a mapping of a first grouping having at least one parentelement and a set of corresponding child elements into a second grouping in accordancewith the grammar rules based on the production of the element type.,*,2015,3
Two variable vs. linear temporal logic in model checking and games,Michael Benedikt; Rastislav Lenhardt; James Worrell,Abstract: Model checking linear-time properties expressed in first-order logic has non-elementary complexity; and thus various restricted logical languages are employed. In thispaper we consider two such restricted specification logics; linear temporal logic (LTL) andtwo-variable first-order logic (FO2). LTL is more expressive but FO2 can be more succinct;and hence it is not clear which should be easier to verify. We take a comprehensive look atthe issue; giving a comparison of verification problems for FO2; LTL; and various sublogicsthereof across a wide range of models. In particular; we look at unary temporal logic (UTL); asubset of LTL that is expressively equivalent to FO2; we also consider the stutter-freefragment of FO2; obtained by omitting the successor relation; and the expressivelyequivalent fragment of UTL; obtained by omitting the next and previous connectives.

Bisimilarity of pushdown systems is nonelementary,Michael Benedikt; Stefan Göller; Stefan Kiefer; Andrzej S Murawski,Abstract: Given two pushdown systems; the bisimilarity problem asks whether they arebisimilar.

Verification of two-variable logic revisited,Michael Benedikt; Rastislav Lenhardt; James Worrell,Two-variable logic is a fragment of first-order logic that allows for decidable verificationproblems. In previous work; we developed an approach to FO 2 verification that isparticularly useful for probabilistic systems; based on analysis of the translation of FO 2 toautomata. In this work we show that the techniques introduced there can be applied to giveinformation on other logics; and can be used in conjunction with automata-theoretictechniques for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) in the context of probabilistic verification. Firstwe revisit the technique of our prior work starting with FO 2 without the successor relation.Making use of recent results by Weis we show here that we can get quite small automata forthese formula. We then show that we can recapture the automata size bounds for generalFO 2 formulas by bootstrapping results for FO 2 without successor. Next; we look at …,Quantitative Evaluation of Systems (QEST); 2012 Ninth International Conference on,2012,3

Hierarchies of measure-theoretic ultrafilters,Michael Benedikt,Abstract We study relations between measure-theoretic classes of ultrafilters; such as theProperty M ultrafilters of [4]; with other well-known ultrafilter classes. We define severalclasses of measure theoretic ultrafilters; of which the Property M ultrafilters are the strongest.We show which containments are provable in ZFC between these measure-theoreticultrafilters and boolean combinations of well-known ultrafilters such as the selective; semi-selective; and P-point ultrafilters. We also list some of the containment results betweenmeasure-theoretic ultrafilters and several other ultrafilter classes; such as the Arrow andProperty C ultrafilters.,Annals of Pure and Applied Logic,1999,3
Polynomial automata: Zeroness and applications,Michael Benedikt; Timothy Duff; Aditya Sharad; James Worrell,We introduce a generalisation of weighted automata over a field; called polynomialautomata; and we analyse the complexity of the Zeroness Problem in this model; that is;whether a given automaton outputs zero on all words. While this problem is non-primitiverecursive in general; we highlight a subclass of polynomial automata for which the ZeronessProblem is primitive recursive. Refining further; we identify a subclass of affine VAS for whichcoverability is in 2EXPSPACE. We also use polynomial automata to obtain new proofs thatequivalence of streaming string transducers is decidable; and that equivalence of copylessstreaming string transducers is in PSPACE.,Logic in Computer Science (LICS); 2017 32nd Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on,2017,2

Querying visible and invisible tables in the presence of integrity constraints,Michael Benedikt; Pierre Bourhis; Balder ten Cate; Gabriele Puppis,Abstract: We provide a wide-ranging study of the scenario where a subset of the tables in arelational schema are visible to a user (that is; their complete contents are known) while theremaining tables are invisible. The schema also has a set of integrity constraints; which mayrelate the visible tables to invisible ones but also may constrain both the visible and invisibleinstances. We want to determine whether information about a user query can be inferredusing only the visible information and the constraints.

Controlling the depth; size; and number of subtrees for two-variable logic on trees,Saguy Benaim; Michael Benedikt; Rastislav Lenhardt; James Worrell,Abstract: Verification of properties of first order logic with two variables FO2 has beeninvestigated in a number of contexts. Over arbitrary structures it is known to be decidablewith NEXPTIME complexity; with finitely satisfiable formulas having exponential-sizedmodels. Over word structures; where FO2 is known to have the same expressiveness asunary temporal logic; the same properties hold. Over finite labelled ordered trees FO2 is alsoof interest: it is known to have the same expressiveness as navigational XPath; a commonquery language for XML documents. Prior work on XPath and FO2 gives a 2EXPTIME boundfor satisfiability of FO2. In this work we give the first in-depth look at the complexity of FO2 ontrees; and on the size and depth of models.

Profound: program-analysis-based form understanding,Michael Benedikt; Tim Furche; Andreas Savvides; Pierre Senellart,Abstract An important feature of web search interfaces are the restrictions enforced on inputvalues-those reflecting either the semantics of the data or requirements specific to theinterface. Both integrity constraints and" access restrictions" can be of great use to webexploration tools. We demonstrate here a novel technique for discovering constraints thatrequires no form submissions whatsoever. We work via statically analyzing the JavaScriptclient-side code used to enforce the constraints; when such code is available. We combinecustom recognizers for JavaScript functions relevant to constraint checking with a genericprogram analysis layer. Integrated with a web browser; our system shows the constraintsdetected on accessed web forms; and allows a user to see the corresponding JavaScriptcode fragment.,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,2

Query Safety with Constraints,Michael Benedikt; Leonid Libkin,Abstract The power of classical query languages is linked to the fact that they express arestricted class of declarative programs. The class of semantic objects expressible throughqueries in the relational calculus; for example; is limited in a number of ways: They havePTIME data complexity; and their expressiveness is well understood. Although relationalcalculus queries may not return finite results; a natural subclass of the relational calculusdoes; namely the class of range-restricted queries. This class gives guarantees of finiteoutput; and is complete in this respect; capturing all relational calculus queries whoseoutputs are always finite; the safe queries.,*,2000,2

Reformulating queries: theory and practice,Michael Benedikt; E Kostylev; Fabio Mogavero; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract: We consider a setting where a user wants to pose a query against a dataset wheresome background knowledge; expressed as logical sentences; is available; but only asubset of the information can be used to answer the query. We thus want to reformulate theuser query against the subvocabulary; arriving at a query that is equivalent to the user'squery assuming the background theory; but using only the restricted vocabulary. Weconsider two variations of the problem; one where we want any such reformulation andanother where we restrict the size. We first present a classification of the complexity of theproblem; showing that distinct techniques are needed for the two variations above. We thenpresent algorithms for solving the problems in practice and evaluate their performance.,*,2017,1
Determinacy and rewriting of functional top–down and MSO tree transformations,Michael Benedikt; Joost Engelfriet; Sebastian Maneth,Abstract A query is determined by a view; if the result of the query can be reconstructed fromthe result of the view. We consider the problem of deciding for two given (functional) treetransformations; whether one is determined by the other. If the view transformation isinduced by a tree transducer that may copy; then determinacy is undecidable. For a largeclass of noncopying views; namely compositions of extended linear top–down treetransducers; we show that determinacy is decidable; where queries are either deterministictop–down tree transducers (with regular look-ahead) or deterministic MSO tree transducers.We also show that if a query is determined by a view; then it can be rewritten into a querythat works over the view and is in the same class of transducers as the query. The proofrelies on the decidability of equivalence for the considered classes of queries; and on …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2017,1
The complexity of higher-order queries,Michael Benedikt; Gabriele Puppis; Huy Vu,Abstract Higher-order transformations are ubiquitous within data management. In relationaldatabases; higher-order queries appear in numerous aspects including query rewriting andquery specification. This work investigates languages that combine higher-ordertransformations with ordinary relational database query languages. We study the two mostbasic computational problems associated with these query languages–the evaluationproblem and the containment problem. We isolate the complexity of evaluation at everyorder; in an analysis similar to that for that standard typed lambda calculus. We show that thecontainment problem (and hence; the equivalence problem) is decidable in severalimportant subcases; particularly in the case where query constants and variables range overthe positive relational operators. The main decidability result relies on techniques that …,Information and Computation,2015,1

ROSeAnn: Reconciling opinions of semantic annotators,Luying Chen; Stefano Ortona; Giorgio Orsi; Michael Benedikt,Abstract Named entity extractors can be used to enrich both text and Web documents withsemantic annotations. While originally focused on a few standard entity types; the ecosystemof annotators is becoming increasingly diverse; with recognition capabilities ranging fromgeneric to specialised entity types. Both the overlap and the diversity in annotatorvocabularies motivate the need for managing and integrating semantic annotations:allowing users to see the results of multiple annotations and to merge them into a unifiedsolution. We demonstrate ROSEANN; a system for the management of semanticannotations. ROSEANN provides users with a unified view over the opinion of multipleindependent annotators both on text and Web documents. It allows users to understand andreconcile conflicts between annotations via ontology-aware aggregation. ROSEANN …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,1
Report on the first Workshop on Innovative Querying of Streams,Michael Benedikt; Dan Olteanu,INnovative QUErying of STreams (INQUEST) was held on September 25-27; 2012 in theDepartment of Computer Science of the University of Oxford (UK). It was sponsored by theUK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); as part of the project“Enforcement of Constraints on XML Streams”. Stream processing represents a thriving areaof research across the algorithms; databases; networking; programming languages; andsystems research communities. Within the database community; a “classical” problem isquery processing on streams of discrete tuple-oriented data. One goal of the workshopconsiders the way recent developments add complexity to this problem:• how does thesetting change when data to be considered by queries is not relational; but has nestedstructure; such as XML or JSON?• conversely; how does the setting change when data to …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2013,1

Determining relevance of accesses at runtime (extended version),Michael Benedikt; Georg Gottlob; Pierre Senellart,Abstract: Consider the situation where a query is to be answered using Web sources thatrestrict the accesses that can be made on backend relational data by requiring someattributes to be given as input of the service. The accesses provide lookups on the collectionof attributes values that match the binding. They can differ in whether or not they requirearguments to be generated from prior accesses. Prior work has focused on the question ofwhether a query can be answered using a set of data sources; and in developing staticaccess plans (eg; Datalog programs) that implement query answering. We are interested indynamic aspects of the query answering problem: given partial information about the data;which accesses could provide relevant data for answering a given query? We considerimmediate and long-term notions of" relevant accesses"; and ascertain the complexity of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1104.0553,2011,1
An insider's guide to logic in telecommunications data,Michael Benedikt,Most of the functionality of modern telecommunication systems has migrated to software;and much of that software consists of code for manipulating data: data describing eithersubscriber features or equipment configuration. The data is generally hierarchicallystructured but extremely complex-it consists of hundreds or even thousands of"classes"(roughly speaking; distinct labels on a tree); with the same information occurring indifferent formats across many classes in a hierarchy. The data is also required to satisfy agigantic number of integrity constraints; vital to the correct routing of phone calls. Thechallenge is to create tools for populating this data; updating the data; and propagatingthese updates to derived data; all without violating these integrity constraints. The aim of thisarticle is to give an overview of recent projects at Bell Labs that tackle this problem …,Logic in Computer Science; 2005. LICS 2005. Proceedings. 20th Annual IEEE Symposium on,2005,1
Definability with a predicate for a semi-linear set,Michael Benedikt; H Jerome Keisler,Abstract We settle a number of questions concerning definability in first order logic with anextra predicate symbol ranging over semi-linear sets. We give new results both on thepositive and negative side: we show that in first-order logic one cannot query a semi-linearset as to whether or not it contains a line; or whether or not it contains the line segmentbetween two given points. However; we show that some of these queries become definableif one makes small restrictions on the semi-linear sets considered.,The Journal of Symbolic Logic,2003,1

Goal-Driven Query Answering for Existential Rules with Equality,Michael Benedikt; Boris Motik; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract: Inspired by the magic sets for Datalog; we present a novel goal-driven approach foranswering queries over terminating existential rules with equality (aka TGDs and EGDs).Our technique improves the performance of query answering by pruning the consequencesthat are not relevant for the query. This is challenging in our setting because equalities canpotentially affect all predicates in a dataset. We address this problem by combining theexisting singularization technique with two new ingredients: an algorithm for identifying therules relevant to a query and a new magic sets algorithm. We show empirically that ourtechnique can significantly improve the performance of query answering; and that it canmean the difference between answering a query in a few seconds or not being able toprocess the query at all.

When Can We Answer Queries Using Result-Bounded Data Interfaces?,Antoine Amarilli; Michael Benedikt,Abstract: We consider answering queries where the underlying data is available only overlimited interfaces which provide lookup access to the tuples matching a given binding; butpossibly restricting the number of output tuples returned. Interfaces imposing such" resultbounds" are common in accessing data via the web. Given a query over a set of relations aswell as some integrity constraints that relate the queried relations to the data sources; weexamine the problem of deciding if the query is answerable over the interfaces; that is;whether there exists a plan that returns all answers to the query; assuming the source datasatisfies the integrity constraints. The first component of our analysis of answerability is areduction to a query containment problem with constraints. The second component is a setof" schema simplification" theorems capturing limitations on how interfaces with result …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.07936,2017,*

Limiting Until in Ordered Tree Query Languages,Michael Benedikt; Clemens Ley,Abstract Marx and de Rijke have shown that the navigational core of the w3c XML querylanguage XPath is not first-order complete; that is; it cannot express every query definable infirst-order logic over the navigational predicates. How can one extend XPath to get a first-order complete language? Marx has shown that Conditional XPath—an extension of XPathwith an “Until” operator—is first-order complete. The completeness argument makesessential use of the presence of upward axes in Conditional XPath. We examine whether itis possible to get “forward-only” languages that are first-order complete for Boolean querieson ordered trees. It is easy to see that a variant of the temporal logic CTL< sup>*</sup> isfirst-order complete; the variant has path quantifiers for downward; leftward; and rightwardpaths; while along a path one can check arbitrary formulas of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2016,*

Yet theusefulness of this data is limited by the difficulty in performing queries that require dataspanning multiple services. We overview a platform which offers integrated data access withminimal user awareness. Users pose high-level queries to this platform; and the systemapplies a combination of reasoning techniques and cost-based optimization to generate anefficient and reliable implementation on top of the services. We briefly explain the platform'sreasoning paradigm; which is based on exact reformulation; we then overview the platform'suse on a set of bioinformatics sources; and provide some preliminary results concerning itsperformance.,BAI@ IJCAI,2016,*
Query answering with transitive and linear-ordered data,M Vanden Boom; Michael Benedikt; A Amarilli; P Bourhis,Abstract: We consider entailment problems involving powerful constraint languages such asguarded existential rules; in which additional semantic restrictions are put on a set ofdistinguished relations. We consider restricting a relation to be transitive; restricting arelation to be the transitive closure of another relation; and restricting a relation to be a linearorder. We give some natural generalizations of guardedness that allow inference to bedecidable in each case; and isolate the complexity of the corresponding decision problems.Finally we show that slight changes in our conditions lead to undecidability.,*,2016,*
Combining Existential Rules and Description Logics (Extended Version),Antoine Amarilli; Michael Benedikt,Abstract: Query answering under existential rules--implications with existential quantifiers inthe head--is known to be decidable when imposing restrictions on the rule bodies such asfrontier-guardedness [BLM10; BLMS11]. Query answering is also decidable for descriptionlogics [Baa03]; which further allow disjunction and functionality constraints (assert thatcertain relations are functions); however; they are focused on ER-type schemas; whererelations have arity two. This work investigates how to get the best of both worlds: havingdecidable existential rules on arbitrary arity relations; while allowing rich description logics;including functionality constraints; on arity-two relations. We first show negative results oncombining such decidable languages. Second; we introduce an expressive set of existentialrules (frontier-one rules with a certain restriction) which can be combined with powerful …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.00326,2015,*

Here we give the first results oneffective interpolation for extensions of GF. We provide an interpolation procedure for GNFwhose complexity matches the doubly exponential upper bound for satisfiability of GNF.

Logical Approaches to Query Optimization over Web-Based Sources.,Michael Benedikt,Abstract. Much of the data needed to answer user queries resides on the web–accessiblevia web apis or web forms. The setting is answering queries over sources that are connectedto one another by semantic relationships (that is; integrity constraints). The sources mayhave overlap; may have multiple means of access with different requirements (eg number ofrequired arguments); and the means of access within and across relations may differradically in cost. This work presents a method for generating query plans that run on top ofthese sources; obeying the access patterns and exploiting the integrity constraints. Theapproach is based on” implementing” interpolation and definability results in predicate logic;while extending them to take into account access restrictions; modifying them work in thepresence of background integrity constraints; combining them with cost considerations.

Neither topic subsumes the other;since the models may be infinite; while the model theory of finite structures can beconsidered from a non-algorithmic perspective. The volume does not aim for a generaltheory of either topic-the algorithmic model theory covered here is quite different fromcomputable model theory or feasible model,*,2013,*
Repairing strings and trees,Michael Benedikt,Abstract: What do you do if a computational object fails a specification? An obviousapproach is to repair it; namely; to modify the object minimally to get something that satisfiesthe constraints. In this thesis we study foundational problems of repairing regularspecifications over strings and trees. Given two regular specifications R and T we aim tounderstand how difficult it is to transform an object satisfying R into an object satisfying T.The setting is motivated by considering R to be a restriction--a constraint that the input objectis guaranteed to satisfy--while T is a target--a constraint that we want to enforce.,*,2013,*
Two variable and linear temporal logic in model checking and games,James Worrell,Abstract: Model checking linear-time properties expressed in first-order logic has non-elementary complexity; and thus various restricted logical languages are employed. In thefirst part of this dissertation we consider two such restricted specification logics on words:linear temporal logic (LTL) and two-variable first-order logic (FO2). LTL is more expressivebut FO2 can be more succinct; and hence it is not clear which should be easier to verify. Wetake a comprehensive look at the issue; giving a comparison of verification problems forFO2; LTL; and various sublogics thereof across a wide range of models. In particular; welook at unary temporal logic (UTL); a subset of LTL that is expressively equivalent to FO2.,*,2013,*

To peopleoutside of computer science–and perhaps to many within–it will be unclear what this termmeans. First of all; what is a “database”? Used generally; it could mean any collection ofinformation. It is obvious that there are deep scientific issues involved in managinginformation. But information and data are very general notions. Doesn't much of computingdeal with manipulating data or information? Isn't everything data? Clearly the databases thatDBR deals with must be something more specific.,*,2011,*

Embedded Finite Models; Stability; and the Impact of Order,John T Baldwin; Michael A Benedikt,Abstract We extend bounds on the expressive power of rstorder logic over nite structuresand over orderednite structures; by generalizing to the situation where the nite structures areembedded in an in nite structure M; where M satis es some simple combinatorial propertiesstudied in model-theoretic stability theory. We rst consider rst-order logic over nite structuresembedded in a stable structure; and show that it has the same generic expressive power asrst-order logic on unordered nite structures. It follows from this that having the additionalstructure of; for example; an abelian group or an equivalence relation; does not allow one tode ne any new generic queries. We also consider rst-order logic over nite structures livingwithin any model M that lacks the independence property and show that its expressivepower is bounded by rst-order logic over nite ordered structures. This latter result gives an …,*,1998,*

Nonstandard analysis in selective universes,MICHAEL Benedikt,A major goal in foundational research in nonstandard analysis has been to pinpointproperties of nonstandard models beyond transfer and^-saturation that are useful inapplications. Research in this vein includes the work of Henson on the IsomorphismProperty [10]; and the work of Ross and Jin on the Special Model Axiom [20; 13]. However;most of the work in this direction focuses on'big'models: models with lots of saturation. Anatural counterpart to these investigations is to look at models that are in some sense as"small'as possible. A nonstandard universe formed using a selective ultrafilter is definitely assmall as an uii-saturated nonstandard universe can get: no nonstandard universe can beproperly embedded in it [7; p. 291]. We would therefore expect these universes to have verydistinctive properties. The purpose of this paper is to show that this is indeed the case.

A Decidable Logic for Describing Linked Data Structures Michael Benedikt1; Thomas Reps2; and Mooly Sagiv3 1 Bell Laboratories; Lucent Technologies; benedikt...,Michael Benedikt,Abstract. This paper aims to provide a better formalism for describing properties of linkeddata structures (eg; lists; trees; graphs); as well as the intermediate states that arise whensuch structures are destructively updated. The paper defines a new logic that is suitable forthese purposes (called L½; for" logic of reachability expressions"). We show that L½ isdecidable; and explain how L½ relates to two previously defined structuredescriptionformalisms (" path matrices" and" static shape graphs") by showing how an arbitrary shapedescriptor from each of these formalisms can be translated into an L½ formula.,*,*,*

Schema-based independence analysis for XML updates. http://web. comlab. ox. ac. uk/people/Michael. Benedikt/papers/tr. pdf,Michael Benedikt; James Cheney,Abstract Query-update independence analysis is the problem of determining whether anupdate affects the results of a query. Query-update independence is useful for avoidingrecomputation of materialized views and may have applications to access control andconcurrency control. This paper develops static analysis techniques for queryupdateindependence problems involving core XQuery queries and updates with a snapshotsemantics (based on the W3C XQuery Update Facility proposal). Our approach takesadvantage of schema information; in contrast to previous work on this problem. We formalizeour approach; sketch a proof of correctness; and report on the performance and accuracy ofour implementation. 1.,*,*,*
PSPACE hardness of mixed world query answering for Atomic Queries under Guarded TGDs,Michael Benedikt; Pierre Bourhis,Consider a vocabulary divided into open-world relations O and closed-world relations C; aset of logical sentences (“integrity constraints” henceforward) Σ; a boolean query Q; and aninstance D. We say that Q is certain with respect to O; C; Σ; D if: for every instance D thatextends D and agrees with D on relations in C; Q holds on D. As in most prior work; we focuson the case in which Q is a conjunctive query; an existential quantification of conjunctions ofatoms; and the case where Q is a disjunction of conjunctive queries. We will be interested inthe data complexity of the problem: fixing O; C; Σ; Q and varying D. It is well-known that evenwhen the constraints Σ have a very restricted form; the data-complexity can be coNP-hard[AD98]. coNP-hardness in data complexity can even occur when the arity of relations is atmost 2 [LSW15; LSW13].[BBPtC16] provided examples of schemas with arity larger than 2 …,*,*,*

Recall that a conjunctive query Q with atomsA1... An is executable relative to a schema with access patterns if there is an annotation ofeach atom Ai= Ri (xi) with an access method mti on R such that for each variable x of Q; forthe first Ai containing x; x occurs only in an output position of mti.

Speakers and Titles,Michael Benedikt,ABSTRACT: This tutorial concentrates on links between traditional (infinitary) model theoryand complexity theory. We begin with an overview of theclassical'connection betweencomplexity theory and finite model theory; giving quickly the basic results of descriptivecomplexity theory./We then discuss several ways of generalizing this to take account a fixedinfinite background structure. We will start by giving the basics of complexity theoryparameterized by a model (algebraic complexity over an arbitrary structure). We then coverresults characterizing first-order theories of models via the complexity of query problems(embedded finite model theory). Finally; time permitting; we will look at abstractions ofdescriptive complexity theory to take into account a background structure.,*,*,*
