Are mid-latitude slopes sensitive to climatic oscillations? Implications from an Early Holocene sequence of slope deposits and buried soils from eastern Germany,Stefan Dreibrodt; Johanna Lomax; Oliver Nelle; Carolin Lubos; Peter Fischer; Andrey Mitusov; Stefan Reiss; Ulrich Radtke; Marie Nadeau; Pieter Meiert Grootes; Hans-Rudolf Bork,Abstract On a straight slope within the lake catchment of Kleiner Tornowsee (Brandenburg;Germany) a sequence of slope sediments has been deposited during the Late Glacial; theEarly Holocene and around cal 4.2 ka before today; 800; 500 and 300 years ago. Thechronology is based on 21 radiocarbon dates and 11 OSL dates and a deposition modelincluding the numerical data as well as stratigraphic information has been calculated withOxCal 4.1. A comparison of the woody taxa of charcoal particles (n= 566) embedded withinthe sediments with the known regional vegetation history confirmed the reliability of thedates. According to the age; volume and distribution the deposition of the Early Holocenesediments at ca. 10.3 kyrs; ca. 9.5 kyrs and ca. 8.2 to 7.7 kyrs before today strongly suggestsan influence of known climatic deteriorations phases on geomorphologic processes.

Buried dark soil horizons and archaeological features in the Neolithic settlement region of the Lower Rhine area; NW Germany: formation; geochemistry and chrono...,R Gerlach; P Fischer; E Eckmeier; A Hilgers,Abstract The properties and age of buried humic and clay-rich dark soil remains (Bht-horizons and pits) at archaeological excavations in the Lower Rhine Basin (NW Germany)were investigated. These Bht-features were formerly described as a component of LuvicPhaeozems and as relics of chernozemic soils. Field observations challenge thisinterpretation. The Bht-horizons in the Lower Rhine Basin occur in a patchy distributionindependent of relief position and climatic condition; and they are mostly connected withartefact-free but human-made pits (off-site features) consisting of the same Bht-material. Thepresence of charred organic matter (pyrogenic carbon) and its radiocarbon ages suggestedthat these Bht-horizons are not relics of naturally formed soils but rather archaeologicalfeatures.

Influence of HCl pretreatment and organo-mineral complexes on laser diffraction measurement of loess–paleosol-sequences,Philipp Schulte; Frank Lehmkuhl; Florian Steininger; David Loibl; Gregori Lockot; Jens Protze; Peter Fischer; Georg Stauch,Abstract The influence of different sample pretreatment methods on grain size distributionsin particle size analysis has been subject to controversial discussions. Standard samplepreparation typically comprises the disaggregation of aggregated and agglomeratedparticles into single primary particles; ie; the organic binding material is oxidized byhydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and the contained carbonates are dissolved by hydrochloricacid (HCl). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of HCl treatment on grain sizeanalyses of Late Pleistocene and Holocene loess–paleosol-sequences investigated by aBeckman Coulter LS 13320 laser particle analyzer. For this purpose; samples from twodifferent sections with different weathering degrees and sedimentary genesis weremeasured:(1) the Suohuoduo section on the northeastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau …,Catena,2016,27

To understand regional or continental socio-environmental interactions proxy datafrom local archives need to be transferred to larger spatial scales. System properties likespatial heterogeneity; historical and spatial contingency; nonlinearity; scale dependency oremergence make generalizations from local observations to larger scales difficult. As theseare common properties of natural and social systems; the development of aninterdisciplinary upscaling framework for socio-environmental systems remains a challenge.For example; the integration of social and environmental data is often hindered by divergentmethodological; ie qualitative and quantitative; approaches and discipline-specificperceptions of spatial scales.

A sequence of fluvial and aeolian deposits (desert loess) and palaeosoils covering the last 60 ka in the Opuwo basin (Kaokoland/Kunene Region; Namibia) based o...,E Brunotte; B Maurer; P Fischer; J Lomax; H Sander,Abstract Arid and semi-arid areas are lacking in fossils for the reconstruction of theQuaternary climate. Therefore; sediments from ephemeral rivers are a welcome climaticarchive in Namibia. Restrictions concerning the palaeoclimatic evidence lie in the fact thatthe sediments examined usually reflect the climate of the upper reaches of the rivers ratherthan the local climate. The upper reaches may belong to a different climatic zone or (damp)altitudinal zone of vegetation. In order to rule out such allochthonous influences in the studyof the climatic history of the escarpments between the edge of the Namib Desert and thesavannah; research is limited to sediments in basins and valley floors which are not subjectto such influences. Research in the Opuwo basin has extended knowledge of the recentQuaternary climatic history of northern Namibia into the period since ca. 60 ka. The …,Quaternary International,2009,14
Holocene surface ruptures of the Rurrand fault; Germany—Insights from palaeoseismology; remote sensing and shallow geophysics,Christoph Grützner; Peter Fischer; Klaus Reicherter,Abstract The Lower Rhine Embayment in Central Europe hosts a rift system that has verylow deformation rates. The faults in this area have slip rates of less than 0.1 mm yr− 1; whichdoes not allow to investigate ongoing tectonic deformation with geodetic techniques; unlessthey cover very long time spans. Instrumental seismicity does only cover a small fraction ofthe very long earthquake recurrence intervals of several thousands of years.Palaeoseismological studies are needed to constrain slip rates and the earthquake historyof such faults. Destructive earthquakes are rare in the study area; but did occur in historictimes. In 1755/1756; a series of strong earthquakes caused significant destruction in the cityof Düren (Germany) and the surrounding areas. In this study we documentpalaeoseismological data from the nearby Rurrand Fault. In contrast to earlier studies on …,Geophysical Journal International,2016,13

Luminescence dating of loess deposits from the Remagen-Schwalbenberg site; Western Germany,Nicole Klasen; Peter Fischer; Frank Lehmkuhl; Alexandra Hilgers,Abstract: This study describes the luminescence characteristics of quartz of UpperPleistocene loess of the Middle Rhine area. The loess/palaeosol sequence of theSchwalbenberg near Remagen comprises a multitude of interstadial soils and soilsediments that have been dedicated to the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3). These weakcalcaric cambisols and their derivates are underlain by loess and soil sediments of MIS 4 toMIS 5 and covered by loess sediments and intercalated gelic gleysols of MIS 2. We appliedluminescence dating of quartz and feldspar of drill core samples and observed an agediscrepancy within both data sets. The quartz ages were clearly younger than the feldsparages; because of thermally unstable signal components of the quartz luminescence signal.Therefore; we regarded the quartz samples of the lower parts of the drill core as …,Geochronometria,2015,10

Therefore; electric resistivity tomography(ERT) usually results in different subsurface models that fit observed apparent resistivityvalues equally well. To reduce the uncertainty; constraints on both geometry and resistivityof subsurface structure can be incorporated into the ERT inversion. In our study; we testdifferent ways of constraining ERT by a) applying improved starting models; b) applyingstructural constraints and c) applying both structural and resistivity constraints. A prioriinformation is needed for these approaches; which is acquired from Direct Push ElectricalConductivity (DP-EC) logs and vibracores in our study. We found that adapting high verticalresolution of DP-EC logs to coarser ERT resolution requires blocking of the logs.

Quartz OSL dating of late quaternary Chinese and Serbian loess: A cross Eurasian comparison of dust mass accumulation rates,Zoran Perić; Emma Lagerbäck Adolphi; Thomas Stevens; Gábor Újvári; Christian Zeeden; Jan-Pieter Buylaert; Slobodan B Marković; Ulrich Hambach; Peter Fischer; Christoph Schmidt; Philipp Schulte; Lu Huayu; Yi Shuangwen; Frank Lehmkuhl; Igor Obreht; Daniel Veres; Christine Thiel; Manfred Frechen; Mayank Jain; Andreas Vött; Ludwig Zöller; Milivoj B Gavrilov,Abstract Reconstructing dust Mass Accumulation Rate (MAR) from loess deposits is criticalto understanding past atmospheric mineral dust activity and requires accurate independentage models from loess deposits across Europe and Asia. Previous correlations of loess inEurope and China have tended to focus on multi-millennial timescales; with no detailedexamination of dust MAR at the two ends of the Eurasian loess belt on shorter; sub-orbitalscales. Here we present a detailed quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)chronology from the Serbian Titel Loess Plateau (Veliki Surduk loess core) and the ChineseLoess Plateau (Lingtai section). The luminescence ages pass internal tests and showconsistent increases in age with depth; with no obvious major hiatuses. However; asreported before; it seems the quartz OSL technique is only capable of accurate age …,Quaternary International,2018,*
The sedimentary and geomorphological imprint of the AD 365 tsunami on the coasts of southwestern Crete (Greece)–Examples from Sougia and Palaiochora,Vera Werner; Kalliopi Baika; Peter Fischer; Hanna Hadler; Lea Obrocki; Timo Willershäuser; Anastasia Tzigounaki; Aggeliki Tsigkou; Klaus Reicherter; Ioannis Papanikolaou; Kurt Emde; Andreas Vött,Abstract The southwestern coast of Crete; one of the most seismically active regions inEurope; experienced co-seismic crust uplift by 9 m during the Ms= 8.3 mega-earthquake thatstruck the eastern Mediterranean world on 21 July AD 365. An associated tsunami eventcaused thousands of fatalities and destroyed many coastal settlements and infrastructurebetween the Levante in the east and the Adriatic Sea in the northwest. So far; coastalsedimentary archives in southwestern Crete including distinct palaeotsunami fingerprintsare rarely investigated. Therefore; a multi-proxy study including sedimentological;geochemical; geochronological; and microfaunal methods was conducted in order to detectonshore coastal sedimentary archives that functioned as fine sediment traps and documentpalaeotsunami imprint.

The river harbour of Ostia Antica-stratigraphy; extent and harbour infrastructure from combined geophysical measurements and drillings,Tina Wunderlich; Dennis Wilken; Ercan Erkul; Wolfgang Rabbel; Andreas Vött; Peter Fischer; Hanna Hadler; Michael Heinzelmann,Abstract We performed a combined geophysical and geoarchaeological survey of theharbour of ancient Ostia; Italy; to investigate the extent of the former harbour basin; thesedimentary infill and possible building remains around the harbour. Besidesgeoarchaeological results the paper highlights the advantage of combining vibracore drillingwith different geophysical prospection methods; which are sensitive to different physical soilparameters. Geophysical methods applied were electrical resistivity tomography (ERT);ground penetrating radar (GPR) and seismics with shear and compressional waves. Theextent and shape of the harbour basin were determined by ERT profiling. The ERT profileswere compiled into a 3D-model showing that the early lagoonal harbour basin was at least100 m× 50 m wide. Its southern border was confirmed by GPR measurements clearly …,Quaternary International,2017,*
Luminescence dating of the Lower Middle Terrace site at Brühl; southern Lower Rhine Embayment–a first dating approach,Tobias Lauer; Manfred Frechen; Peter Fischer,The Lower Middle Terrace (LMT) in the Lower Rhine area is part of a complex system offluvial terrace-staircas-es within the Rhine area and yields an important archive for periodsof fluvial aggradation driven by climate and tectonics. The so far existing chronostratigraphyof the Lower Middle Terrace is mainly based on geomorphological aspects; petrogra-phyand age estimates of cover sediments. Hence; there is a need to establish a more reliablechronological framework for the aggradation period of the fluvial sand and gravel related tothe LMT itself. Here; we present first luminescence dating results from the LMT site at Brühl;southern Lower Rhine Embayment. Due to the saturation of the quartz OSL signal;luminescence measurements concentrated on the pIRIR290dating approach. Thedetermined feldspar-pIRIR290luminescence ages highlight that the LMT at Brühl seems …,Zeitschrift der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Geowissenschaften,2017,*
The 365 AD tsunami imprint on the coasts of southwestern Crete-Sougia and Palaiochora case studies,Vera Werner; Kalliopi Baika; Anastasia Tzigounaki; Aggeliki Tsigkou; Peter Fischer; Klaus Reicherter; Ioannis Papanikolaou; Andreas Vött,Abstract The southwestern coast of Crete; one of the most seismically active regions inEurope; is supposed to have been uplifted by up to 9 m during the mega-earthquake thatstruck the eastern Mediterranean world on July 21; 365 AD. An associated tsunami event isknown to have caused thousands of fatalities and destroyed many coastal settlements andinfrastructure between the Levante in the east and the Adriatic Sea in the northwest. Sincethis event; the entire southwestern coast of Crete has experienced strong erosion so thatnear-coast geological archives showing relevant Holocene sedimentary records are rare. Sofar; distinct palaeotsunami fingerprints from coastal archives in this region were unknown. Amulti-proxy study including sedimentological; geochemical; geochronological andmicrofaunal methods was conducted at Sougia; within an ancient harbour basin; and …,EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts,2016,*
The Rurrand Fault; Germany: A Holocene surface rupture and new slip rate estimates,Christoph Grützner; Peter Fischer; Klaus Reicherter,Abstract Very low deformation rates in continental interiors are a challenge for research onactive tectonics and seismic hazard. Faults tend to have very long earthquake recurrenceintervals and morphological evidence of surface faulting is often obliterated by erosion andsedimentation. The Lower Rhine Graben in Central Europe is characterized by slow activefaults with individual slip rates of well less than 0.1 mm/a. As a consequence; most geodetictechniques fail to record tectonic motions and the morphological expression of the faults issubtle. Although damaging events are known from this region; eg the 1755/56 Dürenearthquakes series; there is no account for surface rupturing events in instrumental andhistorical records. Owing to the short temporal coverage with respect to the fault recurrenceintervals; these records probably fail to depict the maximum possible magnitudes.

The Eurasian loess-belt has itswestern end in the Middle (Carpathian) and the Lower Danube Basin where one can findtrue loess plateaus dating back more than one million years and comprising a semi-continuous record of Pleistocene environmental change. The loess-palaeosol sequences(LPSS) of the region allow inter-regional and trans-regional comparison and; even moreimportantly; the analysis of temporal and spatial trends in Pleistocene environments; evenon a hemispheric scale.

Towards mineral magnetic based millennial time scales in Late Pleistocene Danubian Loess-Palaeosol Sequences,Ulrich Hambach; Christian Zeeden; Daniel Veres; Igor Obreht; Slobodan B MARKOVICI; Eileen ECKMEIER; Peter FISCHER; Frank LEHMKUHL,Abstract The understanding of the climate system of the Earth's; its present day state; and theprediction of its future states requires the detailed knowledge of its history. Sedimentaryarchives are the bases of almost any historical approach to the Earth's climate system–thepalaeoclimate research. Aeolian dust sediments (loess) are beside marine/lacustrinesediments; peat bogs and arctic ice cores the key archives especially for the reconstructionof the palaeoclimate in the Eurasian continental mid-latitudes. The Eurasian loess-belt hasits western end in the Middle Danube (Carpathian) and the Lower Danube Basin. Like in theChinese Loess Plateau and in the steppe areas of Central Asia and in the regions aroundthe Caspian and the northern Black Sea one can find here true loess plateaus dating backmore than one million years and comprising a semi-continuous record of the Quaternary …,GEOREVIEW: Scientific Annals of Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava.

Solifluction deposits; reworked loess; colluvia and archaeological features at the Early Neolithic site of Düren-Arnoldsweiler; Lower Rhine area; Germany–a microm...,Martin KEHL; Peter FISCHER; Renate GERLACH,Archaeological excavations at Düren-Arnoldsweiler (2009-2011) exposed remnants of aLinear Pottery settlement including more than 30 post-built houses; a burial ground withabout 220 burials; a well and an earthwork. The geological situation at the site iscomplicated. The archaeological features cut into a sequence of solifluction deposits andreworked loess; both containing gravel from the Upper terrace of the River Rhine. Severalwell developed paleosol horizons are intercalated in the Pleistocene deposits. These in turnare covered by layers of Holocene colluvia (hillwash); which bury most of the archaeologicalfeatures and the erosional remnants of the Holocene soil represented by Bt and Btghorizons. Postdepositional pedogenesis has altered the Pleistocene and Holocenesediments and the sedimentary fills of archaeological features.
