Influence Diffusion Dynamics and Influence Maximization in Social Networks with Friend and Foe Relationships,Yanhua Li; Wei Chen; Yajun Wang; Zhi-Li Zhang,Abstract Influence diffusion and influence maximization in large-scale online social networks(OSNs) have been extensively studied because of their impacts on enabling effective onlineviral marketing. Existing studies focus on social networks with only friendship relations;whereas the foe or enemy relations that commonly exist in many OSNs; eg; Epinions andSlashdot; are completely ignored. In this paper; we make the first attempt to investigate theinfluence diffusion and influence maximization in OSNs with both friend and foe relations;which are modeled using positive and negative edges on signed networks. In particular; weextend the classic voter model to signed networks and analyze the dynamics of influencediffusion of two opposite opinions. We first provide systematic characterization of both short-term and long-term dynamics of influence diffusion in this model; and illustrate that the …,WSDM '13 Proceedings of the sixth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2013,121
Optimal forwarder list selection in opportunistic routing,Yanhua Li; Wei Chen; Zhi-Li Zhang,Unlike traditional wireless routing protocols which use a single fixed path; opportunisticrouting explicitly takes advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless communications byusing a set of forwarders to opportunistically perform packet forwarding. A key issue in thedesign of opportunistic routing protocols is the forwarder list selection problem. In this paperwe establish a general theory for analyzing the forwarder list selection problem; and developan optimal solution; the minimum transmission selection (MTS) algorithm; which minimizesthe expected number of transmissions and it can be incorporated into existing opportunisticrouting protocols to select optimal forwarder lists. Our theory and algorithm can also begeneralized to optimize other routing objectives such as minimizing the expectedtransmission time or energy consumption in opportunistic routing.

Counting YouTube Videos via Random Prefix Sampling,Jia Zhou; Yanhua Li; Vijay Kumar Adhikari; Zhi-Li Zhang,Abstract Leveraging the characteristics of YouTube video id space and exploiting a uniqueproperty of YouTube search API; in this paper we develop a random prefix sampling methodto estimate the total number of videos hosted by YouTube. Through theoretical modelingand analysis; we demonstrate that the estimator based on this method is unbiased; andprovide bounds on its variance and confidence interval. These bounds enable us tojudiciously select sample sizes to control estimation errors. We evaluate our samplingmethod and validate the sampling results using two distinct collections of YouTube video id's(namely; treating each collection as if it were the" true" collection of YouTube videos). Wethen apply our sampling method to the live YouTube system; and estimate that there are atotal of roughly 500 millions YouTube videos by May; 2011. Finally; using an unbiased …,*,2011,68
Lore: Exploiting sequential influence for location recommendations,Jia-Dong Zhang; Chi-Yin Chow; Yanhua Li,Abstract Providing location recommendations becomes an important feature for location-based social networks (LBSNs); since it helps users explore new places and makes LBSNsmore prevalent to users. In LBSNs; geographical influence and social influence have beenintensively used in location recommendations based on the facts that geographical proximityof locations significantly affects users' check-in behaviors and social friends often havecommon interests. Although human movement exhibits sequential patterns; most currentstudies on location recommendations do not consider any sequential influence of locationson users' check-in behaviors. In this paper; we propose a new approach called LORE toexploit sequential influence on location recommendations. First; LORE incrementally minessequential patterns from location sequences and represents the sequential patterns as a …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,65
Coordinating in-network caching in content-centric networks: Model and analysis,Yanhua Li; Haiyong Xie; Yonggang Wen; Zhi-Li Zhang,In-network content storage has become an inherent capability of routers in the content-centric networking architecture. This raises new challenges in utilizing and provisioning thein-network caching capability; namely; how to optimally provision individual routers' storageto cache contents; so as to balance the trade-offs between the network performance and theprovisioning cost. To address this problem; we first propose a holistic model to characterizethe network performance of routing contents to clients and the network cost incurred byglobally coordinating the in-network storage capability. We then derive the optimal strategyfor provisioning the storage capability that optimizes the overall network performance andcost; and analyze the performance gains via numerical evaluations on real networktopologies.

iGeoRec: A personalized and efficient geographical location recommendation framework,Jia-Dong Zhang; Chi-Yin Chow; Yanhua Li,Geographical influence has been intensively exploited for location recommendations inlocation-based social networks (LBSNs) due to the fact that geographical proximitysignificantly affects users' check-in behaviors. However; current studies only model thegeographical influence on all users' check-in behaviors as a universal way. We argue thatthe geographical influence on users' check-in behaviors should be personalized. In thispaper; we propose a personalized and efficient geographical location recommendationframework called iGeoRec to take full advantage of the geographical influence on locationrecommendations. In iGeoRec; there are mainly two challenges:(1) personalizing thegeographical influence to accurately predict the probability of a user visiting a new location;and (2) efficiently computing the probability of each user to all new locations.

Experimental results confirm that theprediction performance has been significantly improved by using a large volume of trainingdata; a large variety of features from both business support systems (BSS) and operationssupport systems (OSS); and a high velocity of processing new coming data. We havedeployed this churn prediction system in one of the biggest mobile operators in China.

Random walks on digraphs: A theoretical framework for estimating transmission costs in wireless routing,Yanhua Li; Zhi-Li Zhang,In this paper we develop a unified theoretical framework for estimating various transmissioncosts of packet forwarding in wireless networks. Our framework can be applied to the threerouting paradigms; best path routing; opportunistic routing; and stateless routing; to whichnearly all existing routing protocols belong. We illustrate how packet forwarding under eachparadigm can be modeled as random walks on directed graphs (digraphs). By generalizingthe theory of random walks that has primarily been developed for undirected graphs todigraphs; we show how various transmission costs can be formulated in terms of hittingtimes and hitting costs of random walks on digraphs. As representative examples; we applythe theory to three specific routing protocols; one under each paradigm.

Trading Optimality for Scalability in Large-scale Wireless Network Opportunistic Routing,Yanhua Li; Abedelaziz Mohaisen; Zhi-Li Zhang,Opportunistic routing utilizes the broadcast nature of wireless networks; significantlypromoting the unicast throughput. Many variations of opportunistic routing designs havebeen proposed; although all of the current designs consistently rely on all of the topologyinformation to construct forwarder lists and process data forwarding; which indeed restrictsthe application in large-scale wireless networks; where collecting global optimal informationis very costly. In this paper; we propose the localized opportunistic routing (LOR) protocol;which utilizes the distributed minimum transmission selection (MTS-B) algorithm to partitionthe topology into several nested close-node-sets (CNSs) using local information. LOR canlocally realize the optimal opportunistic routing for a large-scale wireless network with lowcontrol overhead cost. Since it does not use global topology information; LOR highlights …,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2013,27
Mutual or unrequited love: Identifying stable clusters in social networks with uni-and bi-directional links,Yanhua Li; Zhi-Li Zhang; Jie Bao,Abstract Many social networks; eg; Slashdot and Twitter; can be represented as directedgraphs (digraphs) with two types of links between entities: mutual (bi-directional) and one-way (uni-directional) connections. Social science theories reveal that mutual connectionsare more stable than one-way connections; and one-way connections exhibit varioustendencies to become mutual connections. It is therefore important to take such tendenciesinto account when performing clustering of social networks with both mutual and one-wayconnections. In this paper; we utilize the dyadic methods to analyze social networks; anddevelop a generalized mutuality tendency theory to capture the tendencies of those nodepairs which tend to establish mutual connections more frequently than those occur bychance. Using these results; we develop a mutuality-tendency-aware spectral clustering …,International Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph,2012,25

The Routing Continuum from Shortest-path to All-path: A Unifying Theory,Yanhua Li; Zhi-Li Zhang; Daniel Boley,Routing is a critical operation in networks. In the context of data and sensor networks;routing strategies such as shortest-path; multi-path and potential-based (" all-path") routinghave been developed. Based on the connection between routing and flow optimization in anetwork; in this paper we develop a unifying theoretical framework by considering flowoptimization with mixed (weighted) L1/L2-norms. We obtain a surprising result: as we varythe trade-off parameter; the routing graphs induced by the optimal flow solutions span fromshortest-path to multi-path to all-path routing-this entire sequence of routing graphs isreferred to as the routing continuum. Our theory subsumes the earlier results showing theshortest path and all-path routing can be obtained from L1 and L2 flow optimization;respectively.

It takesgood advantages of the broadcast nature of wireless network. The source can use multiplepotential paths to deliver the packets to the destination. The routing metric used for selectingthe forwarder lists is very important for designing the opportunistic routing scheme. In thispaper; we propose a novel routing metric STR (successful transmission rate) to choose theforwarder list; which is based on total successful transmission rate. It considers multi-linkscontribution; instead of one" best" link information used in ETX. We also introduce the fairopportunistic routing with linear coding (FORLC) scheme using our STR metric. Theextensive simulation results show that the opportunistic routing with our STR metrics canalways outperform ETXbased ExOR scheme.

Random walks and green's function on digraphs: A framework for estimating wireless transmission costs,Yanhua Li; Zhi-Li Zhang,Abstract Various applications in wireless networks; such as routing and query processing;can be formulated as random walks on graphs. Many results have been obtained for suchapplications by utilizing the theory of random walks (or spectral graph theory); which ismostly developed for undirected graphs. However; this formalism neglects the fact that theunderlying (wireless) networks in practice contain asymmetric links; which are bestcharacterized by directed graphs (digraphs). Therefore; random walk on digraphs is a moreappropriate model to consider for such networks. In this paper; by generalizing the randomwalk theory (or spectral graph theory) that has been primarily developed for undirectedgraphs to digraphs; we show how various transmission costs in wireless networks can beformulated in terms of hitting times and cover times of random walks on digraphs.

Two-Degree-of-Freedom Congestion Control Strategy against Time Delay and Disturbance,Hao Wang; Wei Wei; Yanhua Li; Chenda Liao; Yan Qiao; Zuohua Tian,Most of the existing congestion control schemes cannot guarantee the quality of service inwide-area networks with large round trip time (RTT). Aiming at the above problem; a two-degree-of-freedom congestion control strategy (named TCC) is proposed for improving thestability and robustness of the TCP/AQM system. TCC employs a modified Smith predictorwith two additional controllers to compensate for the RTT delay. The feedback controller isdesigned by the internal model control theory for fast set-point tracking. The disturbancerejection controller is derived from frequency-domain analysis to reject external disturbance.Simulation results in NS2 demonstrate that TCC can effectively overcome the negativeinfluence cased by time delay and disturbance.

Measuring bias in the mixing time of social graphs due to graph sampling,Abedelaziz Mohaisen; Pengkui Luo; Yanhua Li; Yongdae Kim; Zhi-Li Zhang,Sampling of large social graphs is used for addressing infeasibility of measurements in largesocial graphs; or for crawling graphs from online social network services where accessingan entire social graph at once is often impossible. Sampling algorithms aim at maintainingcertain properties of the original graphs in the sampled (or crawled) ones. Several samplingalgorithms; such as breadth-first search; standard random walk; and Metropolis-Hastingsrandom walk; among others; are widely used in the literature for sampling graphs. Some ofthese sampling algorithms are known for their bias; mainly towards high degree nodes;while bias for other metrics is not well-studied. In this paper we consider the bias of samplingalgorithms on the mixing time.

Local scheduling scheme for opportunistic routing,Yanhua Li; Yuan-an Liu; Li Li; Pengkui Luo,Opportunistic routing is a new design trend of wireless routing; which can dramaticallyimprove the end-to-end throughput over traditional routing by judiciously utilizing thebroadcasting nature of wireless network. However; the global scheduling scheme it adoptsrestricts its application in large-scale wireless network; due to the big waste of the end-to-end transmission latency and the computation cost. So; how to schedule the transmissionsof different forwarders is essentially an important issue of the opportunistic routing schemedesign.

A trajectoryaggregate query; as a fundamental functionality for measuring trajectory data; aims toretrieve the statistics of trajectories passing a user-specified spatio-temporal region. A large-scale spatio-temporal database with big disk-resident data takes very long time to produceexact answers to such queries.

In this paper; a resource reservation-based on-demand spectrum assignment and routing protocol is proposed to provide QoSsupport for IEEE 802.11-based multiradio multi-channel ad-hoc networks. Our workdistinguishes from prior ones in that we don't treat the spectrum as the set of discreteorthogonal channels but the continuous resource; ie we use channel width adaptation whenallocating spectrum resource.

Design of forwarder list selection scheme in opportunistic routing protocol,Yanhua Li; Wei Chen; Zhi-Li Zhang,Abstract—Unlike traditional wireless routing protocols which use a single fixed path;opportunistic routing explicitly takes advantage of the broadcast nature of wirelesscommunications by using a set of forwarders to opportunistically perform packet forwarding.A key issue in the design of opportunistic routing protocols is the forwarder list selectionproblem. In this paper we establish a general theory for analyzing the forwarder list selectionproblem; and develop an optimal solution; the minimum transmission selection (MTS)algorithm; which minimizes the expected number of transmissions. Through extensivesimulations using the MIT Roofnet dataset; we demonstrate that in more than 90% cases theMTS algorithm outperforms the forwarder selection scheme used in ExOR; the best knownopportunistic routing protocol in the literature.,*,2008,6

Using unbiasedly estimated video statistics;we study how YouTube grows over time; from the inception of YouTube in 2005 up untilnow. We show that the growth of YouTube videos undergoes several phases: i) an initialgrowth phase best fitted by a quadratic curve; ii) an exponential growth phase that startscirca late 2009; interrupted by iii) a sudden drop that lasts a few months in early 2012; andfollowed by iv) a (resumed) rapid growth phase again. To further understand what drives thegrowth in YouTube uploaded videos; we examine several factors/questions related to thegrowth of YouTube videos; and develop models to predict the growth in the video uploads.To the best of our knowledge; our study is the first of its kind in studying the evolution …,The Sixth ASE International Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom 2014),2014,4
Parallel QRD-M Encoder for Decentralized Multi-User MIMO Systems,Manar Mohaisen; Abedelaziz Mohaisen; Yanhua Li; Pengkui Luo,In this paper; we propose a parallel QRDM encoder (PQRDME) for multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems. The proposed algorithm transforms the full tree-search problem of theconventional QRDME algorithm into parallel partial trees that are processed in parallel;leading to a tremendous increase in the encoding throughput. The proposed algorithmoutperforms the fixed-complexity sphere encoder (FSE) and performs close to the optimumperformance for several scenarios. For instance; in a 4× 4 MUM-MIMO system; the proposedPQRDME lags the optimum performance by 0.3 dB while outperforming the FSE by 2.3 dB ata target BER of 10-4. In this case; the proposed algorithm also doubles the encodingthroughput of the conventional QRDME algorithm.,Communications (ICC); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,4
Detecting and analyzing urban regions with high impact of weather change on transport,Ye Ding; Yanhua Li; Ke Deng; Haoyu Tan; Mingxuan Yuan; Lionel M Ni,In this work; we focus on two fundamental questions that are unprecedentedly important tourban planners to understand the functional characteristics of various urban regionsthroughout a city; namely;(i) how to identify regional weather-traffic sensitivity indexthroughout a city; that indicates the degree to which the region traffic in a city is impacted byweather changes;(ii) among complex regional features; such as road structure andpopulation density; how to dissect the most influential regional features that drive the urbanregion traffic to be more vulnerable to weather changes. However; these two questions arenontrivial to answer; because urban traffic changes dynamically over time and is essentiallyaffected by many other factors; which may dominate the overall impact. We make the firststudy on these questions; by developing a weather-traffic index (WTI) system. The system …,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,2017,3
Mining spatio-temporal reachable regions over massive trajectory data,Guojun Wu; Yichen Ding; Yanhua Li; Jie Bao; Yu Zheng; Jun Luo,Mining spatio-temporal reachable regions aims to find a set of road segments from massivetrajectory data; that are reachable from a user-specified location and within a given temporalperiod. Accurately extracting such spatiotemporal reachable area is vital in many urbanapplications; eg;(i) location-based recommendation;(ii) location-based advertising; and (iii)business coverage analysis. The traditional approach of answering such queries essentiallyperforms a distance-based range query over the given road network; which have two maindrawbacks:(i) it only works with the physical travel distances; where the users usually caremore about dynamic traveling time; and (ii) it gives the same result regardless of thequerying time; where the reachable area could vary significantly with different trafficconditions. Motivated by these observations; we propose a data-driven approach to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,3

However; two fundamental questions are still open:(i) how toidentify regional weather-traffic sensitivity index throughout a city; that indicates the degreeto which the region traffic in a city is impacted by weather changes;(ii) among complexregional features; such as road structure and population density; how to dissect the mostinfluential regional features that drive the urban region traffic to be more vulnerable toweather changes.

Pivotality of nodes in reachability problems using avoidance and transit hitting time metrics,Golshan Golnari; Yanhua Li; Zhi-Li Zhang,Abstract Reachability is crucial to many network operations in various complex networks.More often than not; however; it is not sufficient simply to know whether a source node s canreach a target node t in the network. Additional information associated with reachability suchas how long or how many possible ways node s may take to reach node t. In this paper weanalyze another piece of important information associated with reachability--which we callpivotality. Pivotality captures how pivotal a role that a node k or a subset of nodes S mayplay in the reachability from node s to node t in a given network. We propose two importantmetrics; the avoidance and transit hitting times; which extend and generalize the classicalnotion of hitting times. We show these metrics can be computed from the fundamentalmatrices associated with the appropriately defined random walk transition probability …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,3
On the efficiency of random walk routing in multihop wireless network,Yanhua Li; Debin Zou; Yuan-an Liu; Zheng Zhou; Yong Li,In this paper; we propose a novel routing metric; namely biased delivery probability (BDP);for measuring the wireless node's capacity of forwarding data packet to the destination. BDPessentially assigns different weights to the multi-paths information associated with differenthop counts. An theoretical theory is established to compute the weights for differentscenarios. Using BDP routing metric; we design a prioritized random walk routing (PRR)protocol for multihop wireless network; which incorporates random network coding strategy;and can force the coded packet only randomly" walk" through the higher priority node set;instead of randomly encountered nodes. In such a way; it provides a loop-free random walkforwarding and guarantees the packets consequently go through the right" direction" step bystep to the destination. Extensive simulation results show that the PRR protocol can …,Global Telecommunications Conference; 2009. GLOBECOM 2009. IEEE,2009,3
The optimal distribution of electric-vehicle chargers across a city,Chen Liu; Ke Deng; Chaojie Li; Jianxin Li; Yanhua Li; Jun Luo,It has been estimated that the cumulative sales of Electric Vehicles (EVs) will be up to 5.9million and the stock of EVs will be up to 20 million by 2020 [1]. As the number of EVs isexpanding; there is a growing need for widely distributed; publicly accessible; EV chargingfacilities. The public EV Chargers (EVCs) are expected to be found and will be neededwhere there is on-street parking; at taxi stands; in parking lots at places of employment;hotels; airports; shopping centres; convenience shops; fast food restaurants; and coffeehouses; etc. In this work; we aim to optimize the distribution of public EVCs across the citysuch that (i) the overall revenue generated by the EVCs is maximized; subject to (ii) theoverall driver discomfort (eg; queueing time) for EV charging is minimized. This is the firststudy on EVC distribution where EVCs are assumed to be installed in almost all regions …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,2
Collective Traffic Prediction with Partially Observed Traffic History using Location-Based Social Media,Xinyue Liu; Xiangnan Kong; Yanhua Li,Abstract Traffic prediction has become an important and active research topic in the lastdecade. Existing solutions mainly focus on exploiting the past and current traffic data;collected from various kinds of sensors; such as loop detectors; GPS devices; etc. In real-world road systems; only a small fraction of the road segments are deployed with sensors.For all the other road segments without sensors or historical traffic data; previous methodsmay no longer work. In this paper; we propose to use location-based social media; whichcaptures a much larger area of the road systems than deployed sensors; to predict the trafficconditions. A simple but effective method called CTP is proposed to incorporate location-based social media semantics into the learning process. CTP also exploits complexdependencies among different regions to improve the prediction performances through …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,2
Pulse: A real time system for crowd flow prediction at metropolitan subway stations,Ermal Toto; Elke A Rundensteiner; Yanhua Li; Richard Jordan; Mariya Ishutkina; Kajal Claypool; Jun Luo; Fan Zhang,Abstract The fast pace of urbanization has given rise to complex transportation networks;such as subway systems; that deploy smart card readers generating detailed transactions ofmobility. Predictions of human movement based on these transaction streams representstremendous new opportunities from optimizing fleet allocation of on-demand transportationsuch as UBER and LYFT to dynamic pricing of services. However; transportation researchthus far has primarily focused on tackling other challenges from traffic congestion to networkcapacity. To take on this new opportunity; we propose a real-time framework; called PULSE(P rediction Framework For U sage L oad on Subway Syst E ms); that offers accurate multi-granular arrival crowd flow prediction at subway stations.

Shepherd: sharing energy for privacy preserving in hybrid AC-DC microgrids,Zhichuan Huang; Ting Zhu; Yu Gu; Yanhua Li,Abstract Renewable energy becomes increasingly popular due to its zero carbon dioxideemissions and increasing energy demand. To better utilize renewable energy; hybridAlternative Current (AC)-Direct Current (DC) microgrids have been proposed because themost common renewable energy that can be harvested in residential homes is solar energy;which provides DC power. However; a major issue in a hybrid AC-DC microgrid is privacyleakage because power consumption information of each home can be exposed through thepower lines or compromised neighbors in the microgrid. Power consumption data then canbe used to reveal precise information about appliances' activities with non-intrusive loadmonitoring algorithms. To mitigate leakage of human behaviors in homes; battery-basedload hiding (BLH) is widely studied. In this approach; a battery is used to store and supply …,Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Future Energy Systems,2016,2

In this paper; we propose a framework that useslarge-scale cell tower data dumps and extracts points-of-interest (POIs) from a socialnetwork web site called Weibo; and provides new LBS based on these two data sets; ie;predicting the existence of POIs and the number of POIs in a certain area. We use Voronoidiagram to divide a city area into non-overlapping regions; and a k-means clusteringalgorithm to aggregate neighboring cell towers into region groups. A supervised learningalgorithm is adopted to build up a model between the number of connections of cell towersand the POIs in different region groups; where a classification or regression model is used topredict the POI existence or the number of POIs; respectively.

LOR: Localized Opportunistic Routing in Large-scale Wireless Network,Yanhua Li; Debin Zou; Hao Wang; Zheng Zhou; Yuan-An Liu; Yan Qiao,As the wireless network scales up in size and complexity; the need to study the scalabilityand behaviors of these networks and their protocols becomes essential. Opportunisticrouting utilizes broadcast nature of wireless network; and significantly increases the unicastthroughput. However; all of the current opportunistic routing protocols have to rely on thewhole topology information. This indeed restricts to applying the opportunistic routing tolarge-scale wireless networks; due to the huge cost of the control overheads needed forbuilding a network graph at each node. In this paper; we propose the localized opportunisticrouting (LOR) protocol; which utilizes the distributed minimum transmission selection (MTS)algorithm to partition the topology into several nested close-node-sets (CNS) with {localinformation}. It can locally realize the optimal opportunistic routing for large-scale wireless …,GLOBECOM 2010; 2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference,2010,2
Querying Massive Trajectories by Path on the Cloud,Ruiyuan Li; Sijie Ruan; Jie Bao; Yanhua Li; Yingcai Wu; Yu Zheng,ABSTRACT A path query aims to find the trajectories that pass a given sequence ofconnected road segments within a time period. It is very useful in many urban applications;eg; 1) traffic modeling; 2) frequent path mining; and 3) traffic anomaly detection. Existingsolutions for path query are implemented based on single machines; which are not efficientfor the following tasks: 1) indexing large-scale historical data; 2) handling real-time trajectoryupdates; and 3) processing concurrent path queries. In this paper; we design and implementa cloud-based path query processing framework based on Microsoft Azure. We modify thesuffix tree structure to index the trajectories using Azure Table.

Data-driven inverse learning of passenger preferences in urban public transits,Guojun Wu; Yichen Ding; Yanhua Li; Jun Luo; Fan Zhang; Jie Fu,Abstract—Urban public transit planning is crucial in reducing traffic congestion and enablinggreen transportation. However; there is no systematic way to integrate passengers' personalpreferences in planning public transit routes and schedules so as to achieve highoccupancy rates and efficiency gain of ride-sharing. In this paper; we take the first step tpexact passengers' preferences in planning from history public transit data. We propose adata-driven method to construct a Markov decision process model that characterizes theprocess of passengers making sequential public transit choices; in bus routes; subway lines;and transfer stops/stations. Using the model; we integrate softmax policy iteration intomaximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning to infer the passenger's reward functionfrom observed trajectory data.

REC: Predictable Charging Scheduling for Electric Taxi Fleets,Zheng Dong; Cong Liu; Yanhua Li; Jie Bao; Yu Gu; Tian He,Due to the energy security concern; our society is witnessing a surge of EV fleetapplications; eg; public EV taxi fleet systems. A major issue impeding an even morewidespread adoption of EVs is range anxiety; which is due to several factors includinglimited battery capacity; limited availability of battery charging stations; and long chargingtime compared to traditional gasoline vehicles. By analyzing our accessible real-world EVtaxi system-wide datasets; we observe that current EV taxi drivers often suffer fromunpredictable; long waiting times at charging stations; due to temporally and spatiallyunbalanced utilization among charging stations. This is mainly because current taxi fleetmanagement system simply rely on taxi drivers to make charging decisions.

Scalable User-Substation Assignment with Big Data from Power Grids,Bo Lyu; Yanhua Li; Jie Fu; Andrew C Trapp; Haiyong Xie; Yong Liao,The fast pace of global urbanization is drastically changing the population distributions overthe world; which leads to significant changes in geographical population densities. Suchchanges in turn alter the underlying geographical power demand over time; and drive powersubstations to become over-supplied (demand< capacity) or under-supplied (demand~capacity). In this paper; we make the first attempt to investigate the problem of powersubstation-user assignment by analyzing large-scale power grid data. We develop aScalable Power User Assignment (SPUA) framework; that takes large-scale spatial poweruser/substation distribution data and temporal user power consumption data as input; andcontrol the assignments between users and substations; in a manner that minimizes themaximum substation utilization among all substations.

Modeling urban trip demands in cloud-commuting system: A holistic approach,Guanxiong Liu; Menghai Pan; Yanhua Li; Zhi-Li Zhang; Jun Luo,Rapid pace of global urbanization has posed significant challenges to urban transportationinfrastructures. Existing urban transit systems suffer many well-known shortcomings; wherepublic transits have limits on coverage areas; and fixed schedules; and private transits areexpensive and fail to timely meet the demand needs. We thus envision a Cloud-Commutingsystem; that employs a giant pool of centralized taxis/shuttles to better cope with the dynamicurban trip demands. To better understand the feasibility of such a system; in this paper wedevelop generative models to capture fundamental demand arrival and service patterns;and introduce a novel model to estimate the total number of vehicles needed to serve allurban demands. We conduct experiments using large scale urban taxi trajectory data fromShenzhen; China; and compare our proposed models with empirical baselines.

Forecasting Gathering Events through Continuous Destination Prediction on Big Trajectory Data,Amin Vahedian; Xun Zhou; Ling Tong; Yanhua Li; Jun Luo,ABSTRACT Urban gathering events such as social protests; sport games; and trafficcongestion bring significant challenges to urban management. Identifying gathering eventstimely is thus an important problem for city administrators and stakeholders. Previoustechniques on gathering event detection are mostly descriptive; ie; using realtime on-siteobservations (eg; taxi drop-offs; traffic volume) to detect the gathering events that havealready emerged. In this paper we propose a predictive approach to identify future gatheringevents through destination prediction of incomplete trajectories. Our approach consists oftwo parts; ie; destination prediction and event forecasting. For the destination prediction part;we relax the Markov property assumed in most of the related work and address theconsequent high-memory-cost challenge by proposing a novel Via Location Grouping …,*,2017,*
CityLines: Hybrid Hub-and-Spoke Urban Transit System,Guanxiong Liu; Yanhua Li; Zhi-Li Zhang; Jun Luo; Fan Zhang,ABSTRACT Rapid urbanization has posed significant burden on urban transportationinfrastructures. In today's cities; both private and public transits have clear limitations to fulfillpassengers' needs for quality of experience (QoE): Public transits operate along fixed routeswith long wait time and total transit time; Private transits; such as taxis; private shuttles andride-hailing services; provide point-to-point transits with high trip fare. In this paper; wepropose CityLines; a transformative urban transit system; employing hybrid hub-and-spoketransit model with shared shuttles. Analogous to Airlines services; the proposed CityLinessystem routes urban trips among spokes through a few hubs or direct paths; with travel timeas short as private transits and fare as low as public transits.
