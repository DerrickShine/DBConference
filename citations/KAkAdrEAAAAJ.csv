Synchrony of clinical and laboratory surveillance for influenza in Hong Kong,Lin Yang; Chit Ming Wong; Eric HY Lau; King Pan Chan; Chun Quan Ou; Joseph SM Peiris,Background Consultation rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) in an outpatient setting havebeen regarded as a good indicator of influenza virus activity in the community. As ILI-likesymptoms may be caused by etiologies other than influenza; and influenza virus activity inthe tropics and subtropics is less predictable than in temperate regions; the correlationbetween of ILI and influenza virus activity in tropical and subtropical regions is less welldefined. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study; we used wavelet analysis toinvestigate the relationship between seasonality of influenza virus activity and consultationrates of ILI reported separately by General Out-patient Clinics (GOPC) and GeneralPractitioners (GP). During the periods 1998–2000 and 2002–2003; influenza virus activityexhibited both annual and semiannual cycles; with one peak in the winter and another in …,PloS one,2008,78
Effect of interventions on influenza A (H9N2) isolation in Hong Kong’s live poultry markets; 1999–2005,E Lau,Abstract Live poultry markets (LPMs) are a recognized source of influenza viruses. Since2001 and 2003; respectively; a first and second monthly “rest-day” has been implemented inHong Kong's LPMs; when stalls are cleared of unsold poultry and disinfected. We assessedthe incremental effectiveness of each rest-day and the banning of live quail sales in 2002 inreducing (H9N2) subtype isolation rates for chickens and minor poultry; by using amultivariable Poisson generalized linear model. There was a 58% reduction (p= 0.001) invirus isolation after 1 monthly rest-day in minor poultry compared with 27%(p= 0.22) inchickens. Combining 1 rest-day with the removal of quails further reduced virus isolation inchickens but not in minor poultry. However; an additional rest-day each month did notappear to affect isolation rates for either species.,*,2007,68

Avian Influenza and Ban on Overnight Poultry Storage in Live Poultry Markets; Hong Kong,YH Connie Leung; Eric HY Lau; Li Juan Zhang; Yi Guan; Benjamin J Cowling; JS Malik Peiris,Previous influenza pandemics originated from influenza viruses of birds (1). Live poultry marketsplay a crucial role in maintenance; amplification; and dissemination of avian influenza viruses(2;3) and are high-risk locations for potential zoonotic transmission of highly pathogenic avianinfluenza (HPAI) virus (H5N1) to humans (4;5). From September 1999 through May 2011; fecaldropping samples were collected monthly under the poultry cages in live poultry markets in HongKong as part of a systematic longitudinal avian influenza surveillance program. During the12-year period of surveillance; several interventions were implemented by the Hong Kong governmentin response to outbreaks of influenza virus (H5N1) in live poultry markets and on poultryfarms. In July 2001; a monthly rest day was first implemented; under this system; all poultry inlive poultry markets must be sold or slaughtered at the end of the day; poultry stalls must …,Emerging Infectious Diseases,2012,53

Methods We extended methods for prospective estimation ofthe effective reproduction number;(R t); over time in an emerging epidemic to allow forreporting delays and repeated importations. We estimated R t based on case notificationsand hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virusinfections in Hong Kong from June through October 2009 Results R t declined from around1.4–1.5 at the start of the local epidemic to around 1.1–1.2 later in the summer; suggestingchanges in transmissibility perhaps related to school vacations or seasonality. Estimates ofR t based on hospitalizations of confirmed H1N1 cases closely matched estimates based oncase notifications.

Infection fatality risk of the pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 virus in Hong Kong,Jessica Y Wong; Peng Wu; Hiroshi Nishiura; Edward Goldstein; Eric HY Lau; Lin Yang; SK Chuang; Thomas Tsang; JS Malik Peiris; Joseph T Wu; Benjamin J Cowling,Abstract One measure of the severity of a pandemic influenza outbreak at the individuallevel is the risk of death among people infected by the new virus. However; there arecomplications in estimating both the numerator and denominator. Regarding the numerator;statistical estimates of the excess deaths associated with influenza virus infections tend toexceed the number of deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed infection. Regarding thedenominator; few infections are laboratory confirmed; while differences in case definitionsand approaches to case ascertainment can lead to wide variation in case fatality riskestimates. Serological surveillance can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence ofinfection as a denominator that is more comparable across studies.

The transmission dynamics of tuberculosis in a recently developed Chinese city,Peng Wu; Eric HY Lau; Benjamin J Cowling; Chi-Chiu Leung; Cheuk-Ming Tam; Gabriel M Leung,Background Hong Kong is an affluent subtropical city with a well-developed healthcareinfrastructure but an intermediate TB burden. Declines in notification rates through the 1960sand 1970s have slowed since the 1980s to the current level of around 82 cases per 100 000population. We studied the transmission dynamics of TB in Hong Kong to explore the factorsunderlying recent trends in incidence. Methodology/Principal Findings We fitted an age-structured compartmental model to TB notifications in Hong Kong between 1968 and 2008.We used the model to quantify the proportion of annual cases due to recent transmissionversus endogenous reactivation of latent infection; and to project trends in incidence rates to2018. The proportion of annual TB notifications attributed to endogenous reactivationincreased from 46% to 70% between 1968 and 2008. Age-standardized notification rates …,PLoS One,2010,27
Forecasting influenza epidemics in Hong Kong,Wan Yang; Benjamin J Cowling; Eric HY Lau; Jeffrey Shaman,Recent advances in mathematical modeling and inference methodologies have enableddevelopment of systems capable of forecasting seasonal influenza epidemics in temperateregions in real-time. However; in subtropical and tropical regions; influenza epidemics canoccur throughout the year; making routine forecast of influenza more challenging. Here wedevelop and report forecast systems that are able to predict irregular non-seasonal influenzaepidemics; using either the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter or a modified particle filter inconjunction with a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. We applied these model-filter systems to retrospectively forecast influenza epidemics in Hong Kong from January1998 to December 2013; including the 2009 pandemic. The forecast systems were able toforecast both the peak timing and peak magnitude for 44 epidemics in 16 years caused …,PLoS computational biology,2015,25

Because immune responses often play arole; antivirals may not ensure a successful outcome. To identify pathogenic mechanismsand potential adjunctive therapeutic options; we compared the extent to which avianinfluenza A/H5N1 virus and seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus impair alveolar fluid clearanceand protein permeability in an in vitro model of acute lung injury; defined the role of virus-induced soluble mediators in these injury effects; and demonstrated that the effects areprevented or reduced by bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells. Weverified the in vivo relevance of these findings in mice experimentally infected with influenzaA/H5N1. We found that; in vitro; the alveolar epithelium's protein permeability and fluidclearance were dysregulated by soluble immune mediators released upon infection with …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2016,20

A chain multinomial model for estimating the real-time fatality rate of a disease; with an application to severe acute respiratory syndrome,Paul SF Yip; Eric HY Lau; KF Lam; Richard M Huggins,Abstract It is well known that statistics using cumulative data are insensitive to changes.World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of fatality rates are of the above type; whichmay not be able to reflect the latest changes in fatality due to treatment or government policyin a timely fashion. Here; the authors propose an estimate of a real-time fatality rate basedon a chain multinomial model with a kernel function. It is more accurate than the WHOestimate in describing fatality; especially earlier in the course of an epidemic. The estimatorprovides useful information for public health policy makers for understanding the severity ofthe disease or evaluating the effects of treatments or policies within a shorter time period;which is critical in disease control during an outbreak. Simulation results showed that theperformance of the proposed estimator is superior to that of the WHO estimator in terms of …,American journal of epidemiology,2005,18

A comparison study of realtime fatality rates: severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong; Singapore; Taiwan; Toronto and Beijing; China,Paul SF Yip; KF Lam; Eric HY Lau; Pui‐Hing Chau; Kenneth W Tsang; Anne Chao,Summary. In an outbreak of a completely new infectious disease like severe acuterespiratory syndrome (SARS); estimation of the fatality rate over the course of the epidemicis of clinical and epidemiological importance. In contrast with the constant case fatality rate;a new measure; termed the 'realtime'fatality rate; is proposed for monitoring the newemerging epidemic at a population level. A competing risk model implemented via acounting process is used to estimate the realtime fatality rate in an epidemic of SARS. It cancapture and reflect the time-varying nature of the fatality rate over the course of the outbreakin a timely and accurate manner. More importantly; it can provide information on the efficacyof a certain treatment and management policy for the disease. The method has been appliedto the SARS data from the regions affected; namely Hong Kong; Singapore; Toronto …,Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society),2005,16

A note on the estimation of the initial number of susceptible individuals in the general epidemic model,Richard M Huggins; Paul SF Yip; Eric HY Lau,Abstract Traditional inference for epidemic models depends on knowledge of the initialnumber of susceptible individuals. However; this may be difficult to obtain in practice. In thisshort note we show that it is possible to use data from a major epidemic to estimate thenumber of individuals initially susceptible to a disease and an approximate asymptoticvariance is derived. The results are confirmed in simulations of major epidemics. Anapplication to a data set on smallpox is given.,Statistics & probability letters,2004,9

Estimating the Basic Reproductive Number in the General Epidemic Model with an Unknown Initial Number of Susceptible Individuals,Eric HY Lau; Paul SF Yip,Abstract. In any epidemic; there may exist an unidentified subpopulation which might benaturally immune or isolated and who will not be involved in the transmission of the disease.Estimation of key parameters; for example; the basic reproductive number; withoutaccounting for this possibility would underestimate the severity of the epidemics. Here; wepropose a procedure to estimate the basic reproductive number (R 0) in an epidemic modelwith an unknown initial number of susceptibles. The infection process is usually notcompletely observed; but is reconstructed by a kernel-smoothing method under a countingprocess framework. Simulation is used to evaluate the performance of the estimators formajor epidemics. We illustrate the procedure using the Abakaliki smallpox data.,Scandinavian Journal of Statistics,2008,8

The infection fatality risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Hong Kong in 2009,JYT Wong; P Wu; H Nishiura; E Goldstein; EHY Lau; L Yang; SK Chuang; T Tsang; JSM Peiris; JTK Wu; BJ Cowling,BACKGROUND: One measure of the severity of a pandemic influenza at an individual levelis the risk of death among people infected by the new virus. However; there arecomplications in estimating both the numerator and denominator. Regarding the numerator;statistical estimates of the excess deaths associated with influenza virus infections tend toexceed the number of deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed infection. Regarding thedenominator; few infections are laboratory confirmed; while differences in case definitionsand approaches to case ascertainment can lead to wide variation in case fatality riskestimates. Serologic surveillance can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence ofinfection as a denominator that is more comparable across studies.

A joint analysis of influenza-associated hospitalizations and mortality in Hong Kong; 1998–2013,Peng Wu; Anne M Presanis; Helen S Bond; Eric HY Lau; Vicky J Fang; Benjamin J Cowling,Abstract Influenza viruses may cause severe human infections leading to hospitalization ordeath. Linear regression models were fitted to population-based data on hospitalizationsand deaths. Surveillance data on influenza virus activity permitted inference on influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths. The ratios of these estimates were used as apotential indicator of severity. Influenza was associated with 431 (95% CrI: 358–503)respiratory deaths and 12;700 (95% CrI: 11;700–13;700) respiratory hospitalizations peryear. Majority of the excess deaths occurred in persons≥ 65 y of age. The ratios of deaths tohospitalizations in adults≥ 65 y were significantly higher for influenza A (H1N1) and A(H1N1) pdm09 compared to A (H3N2) and B.

A test for constant fatality rate of an emerging epidemic: with applications to severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong and Beijing,KF Lam; JV Deshpande; EHY Lau; UV Naik‐Nimbalkar; PSF Yip; Ying Xu,Summary The etiology; pathogenesis; and prognosis for a newly emerging disease aregenerally unknown to clinicians. Effective interventions and treatments at the earliestpossible times are warranted to suppress the fatality of the disease to a minimum; andinappropriate treatments should be abolished. In this situation; the ability to extract mostinformation out of the data available is critical so that important decisions can be made.Ineffectiveness of the treatment can be reflected by a constant fatality over time whileeffective treatment normally leads to a decreasing fatality rate. A statistical test for constantfatality over time is proposed in this article. The proposed statistic is shown to converge to aBrownian motion asymptotically under the null hypothesis. With the special features of theBrownian motion; we are able to analyze the first passage time distribution based on a …,Biometrics,2008,5

Transmission of hand; foot and mouth disease and its potential driving factors in Hong Kong,Bingyi Yang; Eric HY Lau; Peng Wu; Benjamin J Cowling,Abstract Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease withsubstantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associationsbetween HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays; while limitedstudies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure thetransmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. Alikelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproductionnumber (R t) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to2014. The associations of between-year effects; depletion of susceptibles; absolute humidityand school holidays with R t were examined using linear regression.

The incubation period is the delay from infectionuntil onset of symptoms; and varies from person to person. Few previous studies haveexamined whether the duration of the incubation period correlates with subsequent diseaseseverity. Methods and Findings We analyzed data of period of exposure on 395 humancases of laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in China in a Bayesianframework using a Weibull distribution. We found a longer incubation period for the 173 fatalcases with a mean of 3.7 days (95% credibility interval; CrI: 3.4–4.1); compared to a mean of3.3 days (95% CrI: 2.9–3.6) for the 222 non-fatal cases; and the difference in means wasmarginally significant at 0.47 days (95% CrI:-0.04; 0.99).

Analysis of potential changes in seriousness of influenza A and B viruses in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2011,Jessica Y Wong; Peng Wu; Edward Goldstein; Eric HY Lau; Dennis KM Ip; Joseph T Wu; Benjamin J Cowling,Summary Continued monitoring of the seriousness of influenza viruses is a public healthpriority. We applied time-series regression models to data on cardio-respiratory mortalityrates in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2011. We used surveillance data on outpatientconsultations for influenza-like illness; and laboratory detections of influenza types/subtypesto construct proxy measures of influenza activity. In the model we allowed the regressioncoefficients for influenza to drift over time; and adjusted for temperature and humidity. Theregression coefficient for influenza A (H3N2) increased significantly in 2005. The regressioncoefficients for influenza A (H1N1) and B were relatively stable over the period. Our modelsuggested an increase in seriousness of A (H3N2) in 2005; the year after the appearance ofthe A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like virus when the drifted A/California/7/2004 (H3N2)-like …,Epidemiology & Infection,2015,3

We used data on deaths involvinglaboratory-confirmed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus infection that occurred between April2009 and May 2010 in Hong Kong; China; to adjust for these underlying risk factors. Lifeexpectancy was corrected with hazard-based modifications to the life tables. The excesshazards posed by underlying risk factors were added to the “baseline” age-specific hazardsin the local life tables to reflect the life expectancy associated with each underlying riskfactor. Of 72 deceased persons with laboratory-confirmed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virusinfection; 56% had underlying risk factors.

However; most existing traditional health promotionapproaches and materials may have suboptimal effectiveness for improving hygienepractice in young children due to their difficulty and incomprehensibility to this age group.METHOD: To target this important gap in health promotion; we designed an outreach healthpromotion programme; including educational materials and interactive activities; tailor-madefor early school-age children to cover key messages of influenza transmission and …,ISIRV Options-9 Conference,2016,*

Clinical outcome of manycases remained poor despite the early initiation of treatment and provision of intensive care.We reported here our work on the public health aspect of the disease for informing thepreparation of future waves of the epidemic. METHODS: We analyzed clinical andepidemiological information of laboratory-confirmed cases of avian influenza A (H7N9) virusinfection reported in first wave (March-May; 2013) of the epidemic. We compared this withinformation from patients having H5N1 or pH1N1 infections and other severe respiratoryinfections captured by routine surveillance. RESULTS: The majority of hospitalized patientswere having a severe disease; with an overall fatality risk of 36%.

Electronic School Absenteeism System for Multiple Disease Surveillance in Hong Kong,Dennis Ip; Eric HY Lau; Teresa So; Lai-ming Ho; Bejamin J Cowling; Gabriel Leung,The school absenteeism surveillance system was developed via the eAttendance module ofthe eClass system; a digital school administration platform operated by a local commercialvendor. In replacing the traditional paper-based roll call; students of the participating schoolswould swipe their smart card over a designated sensor at the school entrance each day to onentering the school to register their attendance. Electronic summary reports can then be generatedautomatically for each school in the eClass system; and transferred to our back-end server foranalysis. The submitted records were anonymised and were stratified into ILI / upper respiratorytract illness; gastroenteritis; and non-sickness related absence in a subset of participating schoolsin the pilot study in 2008-2012 [1].

Use of time series models for multi-stream surveillance,Eric HY Lau; Benjamin J Cowling; Lai Ming Ho; Gabriel M Leung,METHODS We studied nine annual cycles of sentinel surveil- lance data on influenza-like illnessconsultation rates in outpatient clinics in four geographic areas under two surveillancenetworks; namely GPs and GOPCs (a total of 8 streams). We used dynamic linear mod- els; aclass of state space models which can track trends and variances in time series data; on themulti- stream (multivariate) and aggregated (univariate) data; and we determined that an aberrationhad oc- curred when the current observation fell outside a forecast interval generated by themodel. For simul- taneous monitoring of all 8 data streams; we moni- tored separate aberrationsas above and generated alerts based on the first occurrence of any aberration (M1); 2 simultaneousaberrations (M2); the first oc- currence of 3 simultaneous aberrations (M3); any 2 aberrationswithin a 2-week period (M4); and any 3 aberrations within a 2-week period (M5).

Re:“a Chain Multinomial Model For Estimating The Real-time Fatality Rate Of A Disease; With An Application To Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome”,Eric HY Lau; Paul SF Yip,In a recent article (1); we and our colleagues proposed a method of estimating a fatality ratein real time based on a chain multinomial model. We demonstrated that the proposedestimator is more sensitive than that of the World Health Organization. We proposed a kernelsmoothing method that we applied to the crude estimator of the daily death and recoveryprobabilities; p1t and p2t; under the chain multinomial model. However; the kernel functionwe used is a two-sided one with a bandwidth b; implying that when we estimate the fatalityrate at timet; data within the period [tÿb; tþb] are needed. In a retrospective study; this isobviously not a problem. However; when the method is applied during an epidemic; there isno observation for the period (t; tþ b]. Here we suggest a one-sided kernel function methodsuch that only information up to time t is needed to obtain a timely estimate of fatality up to …,American journal of epidemiology,2005,*
