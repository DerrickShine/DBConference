Probabilistic frequent itemset mining in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Florian Verhein; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract Probabilistic frequent itemset mining in uncertain transaction databasessemantically and computationally differs from traditional techniques applied to standard"certain" transaction databases. The consideration of existential uncertainty of item (sets);indicating the probability that an item (set) occurs in a transaction; makes traditionaltechniques inapplicable. In this paper; we introduce new probabilistic formulations offrequent itemsets based on possible world semantics. In this probabilistic context; an itemsetX is called frequent if the probability that X occurs in at least minSup transactions is above agiven threshold τ. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first approach addressing thisproblem under possible worlds semantics. In consideration of the probabilistic formulations;we present a framework which is able to solve the Probabilistic Frequent Itemset Mining …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,280
A framework for clustering uncertain data,Erich Schubert; Alexander Koos; Tobias Emrich; Andreas Züfle; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Arthur Zimek,Abstract The challenges associated with handling uncertain data; in particular with queryingand mining; are finding increasing attention in the research community. Here we focus onclustering uncertain data and describe a general framework for this purpose that also allowsto visualize and understand the impact of uncertainty---using different uncertainty models---on the data mining results. Our framework constitutes release 0.7 of ELKI (http://elki. dbs. ifi.lmu. de/) and thus comes along with a plethora of implementations of algorithms; distancemeasures; indexing techniques; evaluation measures and visualization components.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,64
Querying uncertain spatio-temporal data,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zufle,The problem of modeling and managing uncertain data has received a great deal of interest;due to its manifold applications in spatial; temporal; multimedia and sensor databases.There exists a wide range of work covering spatial uncertainty in the static (snapshot) case;where only one point of time is considered. In contrast; the problem of modeling andquerying uncertain spatio-temporal data has only been treated as a simple extension of thespatial case; disregarding time dependencies between consecutive timestamps. In this work;we present a framework for efficiently modeling and querying uncertain spatio-temporaldata. The key idea of our approach is to model possible object trajectories by stochasticprocesses. This approach has three major advantages over previous work. First it allowsanswering queries in accordance with the possible worlds model.

Reverse k-nearest neighbor search in dynamic and general metric databases,Elke Achtert; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract In this paper; we propose an original solution for the general reverse k-nearestneighbor (RkNN) search problem. Compared to the limitations of existing methods for theRkNN search; our approach works on top of any hierarchically organized tree-like indexstructure and; thus; is applicable to any type of data as long as a metric distance function isdefined on the data objects. We will exemplarily show how our approach works on top of themost prevalent index structures for Euclidean and metric data; the R-Tree and the M-Tree;respectively. Our solution is applicable for arbitrary values of k and can also be applied indynamic environments where updates of the database frequently occur. Although being themost general solution for the RkNN problem; our solution outperforms existing methods interms of query execution times because it exploits different strategies for pruning false …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,59
Statistical density prediction in traffic networks,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract Recently; modern tracking methods started to allow capturing the position ofmassive numbers of moving objects. Given this information; it is possible to analyze andpredict the traffic density in a network which offers valuable information for traffic control;congestion prediction and prevention. In this paper; we propose a novel statistical approachto predict the density on any edge of such a network at some time in the future. Our methodis based on short-time observations of the traffic history. Therefore; knowing the destinationof each traveling individual is not required. Instead; we assume that the individuals will actrationally and choose the shortest path from their starting points to their destinations. Basedon this assumption; we introduce a statistical approach to describe the likelihood of anygiven individual in the network to be located at a certain position at a certain time. Since …,*,2008,55
Efficient probabilistic reverse nearest neighbor query processing on uncertain data,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Stefan Zankl; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Given a query object q; a reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query in a commoncertain database returns the objects having q as their nearest neighbor. A new challenge fordatabases is dealing with uncertain objects. In this paper we consider probabilistic reversenearest neighbor (PRNN) queries; which return the uncertain objects having the queryobject as nearest neighbor with a sufficiently high probability. We propose an algorithm forefficiently answering PRNN queries using new pruning mechanisms taking distancedependencies into account. We compare our algorithm to state-of-the-art approachesrecently proposed. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is able tosignificantly outperform previous approaches. In addition; we show how our approach caneasily be extended to PRkNN (where k> 1) query processing for which there is currently …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,53
Boosting spatial pruning: on optimal pruning of MBRs,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Fast query processing of complex objects; eg spatial or uncertain objects; dependson efficient spatial pruning of objects' approximations; which are typically minimumbounding rectangles (MBRs). In this paper; we propose a novel effective and efficientcriterion to determine the spatial topology between multi-dimensional rectangles. Giventhree rectangles R; A; and B; in a multi-dimensional space; the task is to determine whetherA; is definitely closer to R; than B. This domination relation is used in many applications toperform spatial pruning. Traditional techniques apply spatial pruning based on minimal andmaximal distance. These techniques however show significant deficiencies in terms ofeffectivity. We prove that our decision criterion is correct; complete; and efficient to computeeven for high dimensional databases.

Scalable probabilistic similarity ranking in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,This paper introduces a scalable approach for probabilistic top-k similarity ranking onuncertain vector data. Each uncertain object is represented by a set of vector instances thatis assumed to be mutually exclusive. The objective is to rank the uncertain data according totheir distance to a reference object. We propose a framework that incrementally computesfor each object instance and ranking position; the probability of the object falling at thatranking position. The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for severalstate-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models. Existing approaches compute this probabilitydistribution by applying the Poisson binomial recurrence technique of quadratic complexity.In this paper; we theoretically as well as experimentally show that our framework reducesthis to a linear-time complexity while having the same memory requirements; facilitated by …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,41
Probabilistic nearest neighbor queries on uncertain moving object trajectories,Johannes Niedermayer; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Nikos Mamoulis; Lei Chen; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Nearest neighbor (NN) queries in trajectory databases have received significantattention in the past; due to their applications in spatio-temporal data analysis. More recentwork has considered the realistic case where the trajectories are uncertain; however; onlysimple uncertainty models have been proposed; which do not allow for accurateprobabilistic search. In this paper; we fill this gap by addressing probabilistic nearestneighbor queries in databases with uncertain trajectories modeled by stochastic processes;specifically the Markov chain model. We study three nearest neighbor query semantics thattake as input a query state or trajectory q and a time interval; and theoretically evaluate theirruntime complexity. Furthermore we propose a sampling approach which uses Bayesianinference to guarantee that sampled trajectories conform to the observation data stored in …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,40
A novel probabilistic pruning approach to speed up similarity queries in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,In this paper; we propose a novel; effective and efficient probabilistic pruning criterion forprobabilistic similarity queries on uncertain data. Our approach supports a generaluncertainty model using continuous probabilistic density functions to describe the (possiblycorrelated) uncertain attributes of objects. In a nutshell; the problem to be solved is tocompute the PDF of the random variable denoted by the probabilistic domination count:Given an uncertain database object B; an uncertain reference object R and a set D ofuncertain database objects in a multi-dimensional space; the probabilistic domination countdenotes the number of uncertain objects in D that are closer to R than B. This dominationcount can be used to answer a wide range of probabilistic similarity queries.

Voronoi-based nearest neighbor search for multi-dimensional uncertain databases,Peiwu Zhang; Reynold Cheng; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle; Yu Tang; Tobias Emrich,In Voronoi-based nearest neighbor search; the Voronoi cell of every point p in a databasecan be used to check whether p is the closest to some query point q. We extend the notion ofVoronoi cells to support uncertain objects; whose attribute values are inexact. Particularly;we propose the Possible Voronoi cell (or PV-cell). A PV-cell of a multi-dimensional uncertainobject o is a region R; such that for any point pϵR; o may be the nearest neighbor of p. If thePV-cells of all objects in a database S are known; they can be used to identify objects thathave a chance to be the nearest neighbor of q. However; there is no efficient algorithm forcomputing an exact PV-cell. We hence study how to derive an axis-parallel hyper-rectangle(called the Uncertain Bounding Rectangle; or UBR) that tightly contains a PV-cell. We furtherdevelop the PV-index; a structure that stores UBRs; to evaluate probabilistic nearest …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,29
Indexing uncertain spatio-temporal data,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract The advances in sensing and telecommunication technologies allow the collectionand management of vast amounts of spatio-temporal data combining location and timeinformation. Due to physical and resource limitations of data collection devices (eg; RFIDreaders; GPS receivers and other sensors) data are typically collected only at discrete pointsof time. In-between these discrete time instances; the positions of tracked moving objects areuncertain. In this work; we propose novel approximation techniques in order toprobabilistically bound the uncertain movement of objects; these techniques allow forefficient and effective filtering during query evaluation using an hierarchical index structure.To the best of our knowledge; this is the first approach that supports query evaluation onvery large uncertain spatio-temporal databases; adhering to possible worlds semantics …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,29
Probabilistic frequent pattern growth for itemset mining in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Florian Verhein; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Frequent itemset mining in uncertain transaction databases semantically andcomputationally differs from traditional techniques applied on standard (certain) transactiondatabases. Uncertain transaction databases consist of sets of existentially uncertain items.The uncertainty of items in transactions makes traditional techniques inapplicable. In thispaper; we tackle the problem of finding probabilistic frequent itemsets based on possibleworld semantics. In this context; an itemset X is called frequent if the probability that X occursin at least minSup transactions is above a given threshold τ.

Model-based probabilistic frequent itemset mining,Thomas Bernecker; Reynold Cheng; David W Cheung; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Sau Dan Lee; Matthias Renz; Florian Verhein; Liang Wang; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract Data uncertainty is inherent in emerging applications such as location-basedservices; sensor monitoring systems; and data integration. To handle a large amount ofimprecise information; uncertain databases have been recently developed. In this paper; westudy how to efficiently discover frequent itemsets from large uncertain databases;interpreted under the Possible World Semantics. This is technically challenging; since anuncertain database induces an exponential number of possible worlds. To tackle thisproblem; we propose a novel methods to capture the itemset mining process as a probabilitydistribution function taking two models into account: the Poisson distribution and the normaldistribution.

Inverse queries for multidimensional spaces,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Shiming Zhang; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Traditional spatial queries return; for a given query object q; all database objectsthat satisfy a given predicate; such as epsilon range and k-nearest neighbors. This paperdefines and studies inverse spatial queries; which; given a subset of database objects Q anda query predicate; return all objects which; if used as query objects with the predicate;contain Q in their result. We first show a straightforward solution for answering inversespatial queries for any query predicate. Then; we propose a filter-and-refinement frameworkthat can be used to improve efficiency. We show how to apply this framework on a variety ofinverse queries; using appropriate space pruning strategies. In particular; we proposesolutions for inverse epsilon range queries; inverse k-nearest neighbor queries; and inverseskyline queries.

Reverse-nearest neighbor queries on uncertain moving object trajectories,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries in spatial and spatio-temporal databaseshave received significant attention in the database research community over the lastdecade. A reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query finds the objects having a given queryobject as its nearest neighbor. RNN queries find applications in data mining; marketinganalysis; and decision making. Most previous research on RNN queries over trajectorydatabases assume that the data are certain. In realistic scenarios; however; trajectories areinherently uncertain due to measurement errors or time-discretized sampling. In this paper;we study RNN queries in databases of uncertain trajectories. We propose two types of RNNqueries based on a well established model for uncertain spatial temporal data based onstochastic processes; namely the Markov model.

Representative clustering of uncertain data,Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Nikos Mamoulis; Arthur Zimek; Matthias Renz,Abstract This paper targets the problem of computing meaningful clusterings from uncertaindata sets. Existing methods for clustering uncertain data compute a single clustering withoutany indication of its quality and reliability; thus; decisions based on their results arequestionable. In this paper; we describe a framework; based on possible-worlds semantics;when applied on an uncertain dataset; it computes a set of representative clusterings; eachof which has a probabilistic guarantee not to exceed some maximum distance to the groundtruth clustering; ie; the clustering of the actual (but unknown) data. Our framework can becombined with any existing clustering algorithm and it is the first to provide qualityguarantees about its result.

Reverse k-nearest neighbor monitoring on mobile objects,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Naixin Xu; Andreas Züfle,Abstract In this paper we focus on the problem of continuously monitoring the set of Reversek-Nearest Neighbors (RkNNs) of a query object in a moving object database using a clientserver architecture. The RkNN monitoring query computes for a given query object q; the setRkNN (q) of objects having q as one of their k-nearest neighbors for each point in time. Inour setting the central server can poll the exact positions of the clients if needed. However incontrast to most existing approaches for this problem we argue that in various applications;the limiting factor is not the computational time needed but the amount of traffic sent via thenetwork. We propose an approach that minimizes the amount of communication betweenclients and central server by an intelligent approximation of the position of the clients.Additionally we propose several poll heuristics in order to further decrease the …,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,14

Geo-social skyline queries,Tobias Emrich; Maximilian Franzke; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract By leveraging the capabilities of modern GPS-equipped mobile devices providingsocial-networking services; the interest in developing advanced services that combinelocation-based services with social networking services is growing drastically. Based on geo-social networks that couple personal location information with personal social contextinformation; such services are facilitated by geo-social queries that extract useful informationcombining social relationships and current locations of the users.

Compared to the limitations of existing methodsfor the RkNN search; our approach works on top of Multi-Resolution Aggregate (MRA)versions of any index structures for multidimensional feature spaces where each non-leafnode is additionally associated with aggregate information like the sum of all leaf-entriesindexed by that node.

On reverse-k-nearest-neighbor joins,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract A reverse k-nearest neighbour (R k NN) query determines the objects from adatabase that have the query as one of their k-nearest neighbors. Processing such a queryhas received plenty of attention in research. However; the effect of running multiple R k NNqueries at once (join) or within a short time interval (bulk/group query) has only received littleattention so far.

Constrained reverse nearest neighbor search on mobile objects,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract In this paper; we formalize the novel concept of Constrained Reverse k-NearestNeighbor (CRkNN) search on mobile objects (clients) performed at a central server. TheCRkNN query computes for a given query object q the set RkNN (q) of objects having q asone of their k-nearest neighbors; iff the result set exceeds a specific threshold m; ie Card(RkNN (q))≥ m. Otherwise; the query reports an empty result. In our setting; the positions ofthe query object and database objects are approximated by minimal bounding rectanglesthat depend on the last reported location of the object; as well as on the time that has beenpassed since the object reported its recent exact location. We propose an approach thatminimizes the amount of communication between clients and central server by using theapproximation of the positions to identify true hits and true drops.

Continuous inverse ranking queries in uncertain streams,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract This paper introduces a scalable approach for continuous inverse ranking onuncertain streams. An uncertain stream is a stream of object instances with confidences; egobserved positions of moving objects derived from a sensor. The confidence value assignedto each instance reflects the likelihood that the instance conforms with the current true objectstate. The inverse ranking query retrieves the rank of a given query object according to agiven score function. In this paper we present a framework that is able to update the queryresult very efficiently; as the stream provides new observations of the objects. We willtheoretically and experimentally show that the query update can be performed in linear timecomplexity. We conduct an experimental evaluation on synthetic data; which demonstratesthe efficiency of our approach.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,6
Probabilistic join queries in uncertain databases,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Thomas Bernecker; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract The join query is a very important database primitive. It combines two datasets Rand S (R= S in case of a self-join) based on some query predicate into one set such that thenew set contains pairs of objects of the two original sets. In various application areas; egsensor databases; location-based services or face recognition systems; joins have to becomputed based on vague and uncertain data. As a consequence; in the recent decade a lotof approaches that address the management and efficient query processing of uncertaindata have been published. They mainly differ in the representation of the uncertain data; thedistance measures or other types of object comparisons; the types of queries; the querypredicates and the representation of the result.

Hot item detection in uncertain data,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract An object o of a database D is called a hot item; if there is a sufficiently largepopulation of other objects in D that are similar to o. In other words; hot items are objectswithin a dense region of other objects and provide a basis for many density-based datamining techniques. Intuitively; objects that share their attribute values with a lot of otherobjects could be potentially interesting as they show a typical occurrence of objects in thedatabase. Also; there are a lot of application domains; eg sensor databases; trafficmanagement or recognition systems; where objects have vague and uncertain attributes.We propose an approach for the detection of potentially interesting objects (hot items) of anuncertain database in a probabilistic way.

In this paper;we describe problems of handling spatial data in an MMO and outline why analyzing spatialpatterns is an important task for keeping an MMO successful over a long period of time.Though many of these problems share a close connection to well-known tasks in temporaland spatial databases; there are many significant differences as well.

Probabilistic ranking in uncertain vector spaces,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract In many application domains; eg sensor databases; traffic management orrecognition systems; objects have to be compared based on positionally and existentiallyuncertain data. Feature databases with uncertain data require special methods for effectivesimilarity search. In this paper; we propose a probabilistic similarity ranking algorithm whichcomputes the results dynamically based on the complete information given by inexact objectrepresentations. Hence; this can be performed in an effective and efficient way. We assumethat the objects are given by a set of points in a vector space with confidence valuesfollowing the discrete uncertainty model. Based on this representation; we introduce aprobabilistic ranking algorithm that is able to reduce significantly the computationalcomplexity of the computation of the probability that an object is at a certain ranking …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,5
Tourismo: A user-preference tourist trip search engine,Gregor Jossé; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Georgios Skoumas; Matthias Schubert; Dieter Pfoser,Abstract In this demonstration we re-visit the problem of finding an optimal route fromlocation A to B. Currently; navigation systems compute shortest; fastest; most economicroutes or any combination thereof. More often than not users want to consider “soft”qualitative metrics such as popularity; scenic value; and general appeal of a route. Routingalgorithms have not (yet) been able to appreciate; measure; and evaluate such qualitativemeasures. Given the emergence of user-generated content; data exists that records userpreference. This work exploits user-generated data; including image data; text data andtrajectory data; to estimate the attractiveness of parts of the spatial network in relation to aparticular user. We enrich the spatial network dataset by quantitative scores reflectingqualitative attractiveness.

Similarity search and mining in uncertain spatial and spatio-temporal databases,Andreas Züfle,Abstract Both the current trends in technology such as smart phones; general mobiledevices; stationary sensors and satellites as well as a new user mentality of utilizing thistechnology to voluntarily share information produce a huge flood of geo-spatial and geo-spatio-temporal data. This data flood provides a tremendous potential of discovering newand possibly useful knowledge. In addition to the fact that measurements are imprecise; dueto the physical limitation of the devices; some form of interpolation is needed in-betweendiscrete time instances.

Probabilistic ranking in fuzzy object databases,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Ranking queries have been investigated extensively in the past due to their broadrange of applications. In this paper; we study this problem in the context of fuzzy objects thathave indeterministic boundaries. Fuzzy objects play an important role in many areas; suchas biomedical image databases and GIS. To the best of our knowledge; we present the firstefficient approach for similarity ranking in fuzzy object databases. The main challenge ofranking fuzzy objects is that these objects consist of multiple instances; each associated witha probability. We propose a framework to transform fuzzy objects into probabilistic objectswhich can then be ranked using existing algorithms for probabilistic objects.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,4
Continuous probabilistic count queries in wireless sensor networks,Anna Follmann; Mario A Nascimento; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Peer Kröger; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Count queries in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) report the number of sensornodes whose measured values satisfy a given predicate. However; measurements in WSNsare typically imprecise due; for instance; to limited accuracy of the sensor hardware. In thiscontext; we present four algorithms for computing continuous probabilistic count queries ona WSN; ie; given a query Q we compute a probability distribution over the number of sensorssatisfying Q's predicate. These algorithms aim at maximizing the lifetime of the sensors byminimizing the communication overhead and data processing cost. Our performanceevaluation shows that by using a distributed and incremental approach we are able toreduce the number of message transfers within the WSN by up to a factor of 5 whencompared to a straightforward centralized algorithm.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,4
Probabilistic frequent pattern growth for itemset mining in uncertain databases (technical report),Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Florian Verhein; Andreas Züfle,Abstract: Frequent itemset mining in uncertain transaction databases semantically andcomputationally differs from traditional techniques applied on standard (certain) transactiondatabases. Uncertain transaction databases consist of sets of existentially uncertain items.The uncertainty of items in transactions makes traditional techniques inapplicable. In thispaper; we tackle the problem of finding probabilistic frequent itemsets based on possibleworld semantics. In this context; an itemset X is called frequent if the probability that X occursin at least minSup transactions is above a given threshold. We make the followingcontributions: We propose the first probabilistic FP-Growth algorithm (ProFP-Growth) andassociated probabilistic FP-Tree (ProFP-Tree); which we use to mine all probabilisticfrequent itemsets in uncertain transaction databases without candidate generation.

TrendTracker: Modelling the motion of trends in space and time,Klaus Arthur Schmid; Christian Frey; Fengchao Peng; Michael Weiler; Andreas Zufle; Lei Chen; Matthias Renz,Both the current trends in technology such as smart phones; general mobile devices;stationary sensors and satellites as well as a new user mentality of utilizing this technologyto voluntarily share information produce a huge flood of geo-textual data. Such data includesmicroblogging platforms such as Twitter; social networks such as Facebook; and data fromnews stations. Such geo-textual data allows to immediately detect and react to new andemerging trends. A trend is a set of keywords associated with a time interval where thefrequency of these keywords is increased significantly. In this paper; we investigate thedissemination of trends over space and time. For this purpose; we employ a four-stepframework. In the first step; we employ existing solutions to mine a large number of trends.Second; for each trend we create a spatio-temporal dissemination model; which …,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,3
Minimal spatio-temporal database repairs,Markus Mauder; Markus Reisinger; Tobias Emrich; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Goce Trajcevski; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract This work addresses the problem of efficient detection and fixing of inconsistenciesin spatio-temporal databases. In contrast to traditional database settings; where integrityconstraints pertain to explicitly stored values and values defined via views and aggregates;spatio-temporal data may exhibit other types of constraint violations that cannot be tied tostored or aggregated values. The main reason is that spatio-temporal phenomena arecontinuous but their database representations are discrete. Thus; the constraints aresemantic in nature; as opposed to being dependent on the actual stored data. We give ageneral definition of semantic constraints of a trajectory database and define rules to repairviolations of these constraints. In order to minimize the distortion of the state of the database;we aim at minimizing the changes needed for repairing violations of such semantic …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,3

Similarity search on uncertain spatio-temporal data,Johannes Niedermayer; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Nikos Mamoulis; Lei Chen; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract In this work; we address the problem of similarity search in a database of uncertainspatio-temporal objects. Each object is defined by a set of observations ((time; location)-tuples) and a Markov chain which describes the objects uncertain motion in space and time.To model similarity-which is an important building block for many applications such asidentifying frequent motion patterns or trajectory clustering-we employ the well-knownLongest Common Subsequence (LCSS) measure; which becomes a distribution onuncertain spatio-temporal data (ULCSS). We show how the aligned version (without timeshifting) of the ULCSS can be exactly computed in PTIME; which is also verified by extensiveexperiments.,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2013,3
Exploration of Monte-Carlo based probabilistic query processing in uncertain graphs,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; André Suhartha; Andreas Züfle,Abstract This demo presents a framework for running probabilistic graph queries onuncertain graphs and visualizing their results. The framework supports the most commonuncertainty model for uncertain graphs; ie existential uncertainty for the edges of the graph.A large variety of meaningful graph queries are supported; such as shortest path; range; kN;reverse kN; reachability and various aggregation queries. Since the problem of exactprobability computation according to possible world semantics is in# P-Time for manycombinations of model and query; and since ignoring uncertainty (eg by using expectationsonly) will yield counterintuitive and hard to interpret results; our framework uses anoptimized version of Monte-Carlo sampling to estimate the results which allows us not onlyto perform queries that conform to possible world semantics but also to sample only parts …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,3
Similarity search in time series of dynamical model-based systems,Kyoji Kawagoe; Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Arthur Zimek; Andreas Zufle,Similarity search in time series is usually based on an assessment of the geometric similarityof the time series curves. In bioinformatics; dynamical model-based analysis and processingis used; where the curve itself is not meaningful. However; some internal features based ona model extracted from time series are meaningful. Therefore; the similarity is based on adynamical model explaining the observation instead of being based merely on thesuperficial observation. There currently exist no methods for meaningful similarity search onsuch time series data emerging in bioinformatics. In this paper; we introduce a new similaritysearch method for time series based on similarity of internal features; called the perturbationmethod.,Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA); 2010 Workshop on,2010,3
On privacy in spatio-temporal data: User identification using microblog data,Erik Seglem; Andreas Züfle; Jan Stutzki; Felix Borutta; Evgheniy Faerman; Matthias Schubert,Abstract Location data is among the most sensitive data regarding the privacy of theobserved users. To collect location data; mobile phones and other mobile devices constantlytrack their positions. This work examines the question whether publicly available spatio-temporal user data can be used to link newly observed location data to known user profiles.For this study; publicly available location information about Twitter users is used to constructspatio-temporal user profiles describing a user's movement in space and time. It shows howto use these profiles to match a new location trace to their user with high accuracy.Furthermore; it shows how to link users of two different trace data sets. For this case study;15;989 of the most prolific Twitter users in London in 2014 are considered.

Uncertain voronoi cell computation based on space decomposition,Tobias Emrich; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Reynold Cheng,Abstract The problem of computing Voronoi cells for spatial objects whose locations are notcertain has been recently studied. In this work; we propose a new approach to computeVoronoi cells for the case of objects having rectangular uncertainty regions. Since exactcomputation of Voronoi cells is hard; we propose an approximate solution. The main idea ofthis solution is to apply hierarchical access methods for both data and object space. Ourspace index is used to efficiently find spatial regions which must (not) be inside a Voronoicell. Our object index is used to efficiently identify Delauny relations; ie; data objects whichaffect the shape of a Voronoi cell. We develop three algorithms to explore index structuresand show that the approach that descends both index structures in parallel yields fast queryprocessing times.

An extendable framework for managing uncertain spatio-temporal data,Tobias Emrich; Maximilian Franzke; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract This demonstration presents our Uncertain-Spatio-Temporal (UST)} framework thatwe have developed in recent years. The framework allows not only to visualize and explorespatio-temporal data consisting of (location; time; object)-triples but also provides anextensive codebase easily extensible and customizable by developers and researchers.The main research focus of this UST-framework is the explicit consideration of uncertainty;an aspect that is inherent in spatio-temporal data; due to infrequent position updates; due tophysical limitations and due to power constraints. The UST-framework can be used to obtaina deeper intuition of the quality of spatio-temporal data models. Such models aim atestimating the position of a spatio-temporal object at a time where the object's position is notexplicitly known; for example by using both historic (traffic-) pattern information; and by …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,2
Spatial inverse query processing,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Shiming Zhang; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Traditional spatial queries return; for a given query object q; all database objectsthat satisfy a given predicate; such as epsilon range and k-nearest neighbors. This paperdefines and studies inverse spatial queries; which; given a subset of database objects Q anda query predicate; return all objects which; if used as query objects with the predicate;contain Q in their result. We first show a straightforward solution for answering inversespatial queries for any query predicate. Then; we propose a filter-and-refinement frameworkthat can be used to improve efficiency. We show how to apply this framework on a variety ofinverse queries; using appropriate space pruning strategies. In particular; we proposesolutions for inverse epsilon range queries; inverse k-nearest neighbor queries; and inverseskyline queries. Furthermore; we show how to relax the definition of inverse queries in …,GeoInformatica,2013,2
Efficient traffic density prediction in road networks using suffix trees,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Recently; modern tracking methods started to allow capturing the position ofmassive numbers of moving objects. Given this information; it is possible to analyze andpredict the traffic density in a network which offers valuable information for traffic control;congestion prediction and prevention. In this paper; we propose a statistical approach topredict the density on any edge in such a network at a future point of time. Our methodcombines long-term and short-term observations of a traffic network in order to predict trafficdensity for the near future. In our experiments; we show the capability of our approach tomake useful predictions about the traffic density and illustrate the efficiency of our newalgorithm when calculating these predictions.,KI-Künstliche Intelligenz,2012,2
Continuous probabilistic sum queries in wireless sensor networks with ranges,Nina Hubig; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Mario A Nascimento; Matthias Renz; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Data measured in wireless sensor networks are inherently imprecise. Aggregatequeries are often used to analyze the collected data in order to alleviate the impact of suchimprecision. In this paper we will deal with the imprecision in the measured values explicitlyby employing a probabilistic approach and we focus on one particular type of aggregatequery; namely the SUM query.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2012,2
Knowledge extraction from crowdsourced data for the enrichment of road networks,Gregor Jossé; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Georgios Skoumas; Matthias Schubert; Matthias Renz; Dieter Pfoser; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract In current navigation systems quantitative metrics such as distance; time andenergy are used to determine optimal paths. Yet; a “best path”; as judged by users; mighttake qualitative features into account; for instance the scenery or the touristic attractivenessof a path. Machines are unable to quantify such “soft” properties. Crowdsourced dataprovides us with a means to record user choices and opinions. In this work; we surveyheterogeneous sources of spatial; spatio-temporal and textual crowdsourced data as aproxy for qualitative information of users in movement. We (i) explore the process ofextracting qualitative information from uncertain crowdsourced data sets employing differenttechniques;(ii) investigate the enrichment of road networks with the extracted information byadjusting its properties and by building a meta-network; and (iii) show how to use the …,Geoinformatica,2017,1
Spatio-Temporal Site Recommendation,Guolei Yang; Andreas Züfle,Recommendation systems have become extremely common in recent years; and are utilizedin a variety of areas to predict the" rating" or" preference" that a user would give to a point ofinterest (PoI); such as a restaurant; a hotel; or a bar. Such systems typically produce a list ofrecommendations by considering previous ratings of the user; as well as ratings of otherusers. Not every person rates every point of interest they visit. In this work; we want toexplore the use of spatio-temporal data to improve recommendation systems: We postulatethat spatio-temporal user data may indicate the liking or disliking of a point of interest.Clearly; if a user frequently visits the same PoI; stays at the PoI for long times; and is willingto travel a long distance to visit a PoI; that might indicate that user likes that PoI. Thus; wepropose to extract user-PoI relation features from spatio-temporal trajectory data only …,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,1
Finding Influencers in Temporal Social Networks Using Intervention Analysis,Maximilian Franzke; Janina Bleicher; Andreas Züfle,Abstract People influence; inspire and learn from each other. The result of such a latentcooperation can be observed in social networks; where interacting users are connected witheach other. In previous work; the influence casted by a single individual is measured purelyquantitatively; by analyzing the topology of a social network. In this work; we take a steptowards analyzing the quality of an influencer. For this purpose; we analyze how attributesdescribing an individual change over time; and put this change in the context of the socialnetwork topology changing over time. Each social node is associated with time-series oftheir attribute values; such as their number of citations. For each individual; we apply theconcept of intervention analysis; to identify points in time; so-called interventions; whenthese attributes have been affected significantly. Such interventions can be of either …,Australasian Database Conference,2016,1
Socio textual mapping,Michael Weiler; Andreas Züfle; Felix Borutta; Tobias Emrich,Abstract Location-based social networks are a source of geo-spatial data enriched by textualinformation; such as news; travel blogs; tweets and user recommendations. Such data maydescribe an event; an experience or a point of interest that is relevant to a user. In this visionpaper we propose to describe a spatial region by the thoughts; ideas and emotionsfrequently and recently expressed by people in that region. For this purpose; we envision toextract features from geo-textual data; which capture not only the vocabulary; but alsocurrent topics and current general interests. We formally define the problem of drawing asocio textual map using geo-textual data and identify the necessary steps towards thisvision: We represent each region as a stream of text messages such as tweets. In eachregion; we maintain a feature representation of text messages. We define a dissimilarity …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location-Based Social Networks,2015,1

Optimal Distance Bounds for the Mahalanobis Distance,Tobias Emrich; Gregor Jossé; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Markus Mauder; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert; Andreas Züfle,Abstract The Mahalanobis distance; or quadratic form distance; is a distance measurecommonly used for feature-based similarity search in scenarios where features arecorrelated. For efficient query processing on such data effective distance-based spatialpruning techniques are required. In this work we investigate such pruning techniques bymeans of distance bounds of the Mahalanobis distance in the presence of rectangularspatial approximations. Specifically we discuss how to transform the problem of computingminimum and maximum distance approximations between two minimum boundingrectangles (MBRs) into a quadratic optimization problem. Furthermore; we show how therecently developed concept of spatial domination can be solved under the Mahalanobisdistance by a quadratic programming approach.,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2013,1
Managing uncertain spatio-temporal data,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Andreas Zuefle; Lei Chen; Xiang Lian; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Many spatial query problems defined on uncertain data are computationallyexpensive; in particular; if in addition to spatial attributes; a time component is added.Although there exists a wide range of applications dealing with uncertain spatio-temporaldata; there is no solution for efficient management of such data available yet. This paper isthe first work to propose general models for spatio-temporal uncertain data that have thepotential to allow efficient processing on a wide range of queries. The main challenge hereis to unfold this potential by developing new algorithms based on these models.

Each of these criteriahave different properties and pruning areas. This demo offers a visual interface forcomparing existing pruning criteria under various settings and in different applicationsallowing an easy integration of new criteria.

Efficient Information Flow Maximization in Probabilistic Graphs,Christian Frey; Andreas Zufle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz,Reliable propagation of information through large networks; eg communication networks;social networks or sensor networks is very important in many applications concerningmarketing; social networks; and wireless sensor networks. However; social ties of friendshipmay be obsolete; and communication links may fail; inducing the notion of uncertainty insuch networks. In this paper; we address the problem of optimizing information propagationin uncertain networks given a constrained budget of edges. We show that this problemrequires to solve two NP-hard subproblems: the computation of expected information flow;and the optimal choice of edges. To compute the expected information flow to a sourcevertex; we propose the F-tree as a specialized data structure; that identifies independentcomponents of the graph for which the information flow can either be computed …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*
Protecting User Privacy: Obfuscating Discriminative Spatio-Temporal Footprints,Jinhyung D Park; Erik Seglem; Eric Lin; Andreas Züfle,Abstract In recent years; applications that collect and store location data have becomeubiquitous; allowing users to engage in a variety of interactions with other users andservices in their digital or physical vicinity. However; usage of these geolocation services putusers at risk of serious privacy threats. For instance; state-of-the-art user-identificationmethods use geospatial trajectories derived from location based services to identify users atan alarmingly high accuracy. In this work; we address the problem of protecting useridentities by presenting methods for obfuscating discriminative location data in users'profiles. We utilize data provided by the public Twitter API; collecting tweets with geolocationtags from a select group of prolific users in a 12-week time period. To minimize the amountof data obfuscated; we present two methods to identify the most discriminative tweets.

Real-Time Bayesian Micro-Analysis for Metro Traffic Prediction,Eric Lin; Jinhyung D Park; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Metro transport plays a large role in major cities around the world as an easilyaccessible and convenient means of transit. We propose a novel approach to forecast themetro network flow of passengers; which is exceptionally useful for city planning. Forinstance; accurate estimations of passenger outflow provide valuable insight in decidingwhere and when to add new trains and stations. We present a micro-prediction approach topredict individual passenger's destination station and arrival time. As a global apriori modelwe empirically learn a probability distribution of origin-destination (OD) station-pairs usinganalysis on historical data and estimate travel times between stations.

Uncertain Voronoi cell computation based on space decomposition,Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Zufle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Reynold Cheng,Abstract To facilitate (k)-Nearest Neighbor queries; the concept of Voronoi decomposition iswidely used. In this work; we propose solutions to extend the concept of Voronoi-cells touncertain data. Due to data uncertainty; the location; the shape and the extent of a Voronoicell are random variables. To facilitate reliable query processing despite the presence ofuncertainty; we employ the concept of possible-Voronoi cells and introduce the novelconcept of guaranteed-Voronoi cells: The possible-Voronoi cell of an object U consists of allpoints in space that have a non-zero probability of having U as their nearest-neighbor; andthe guaranteed-Voronoi cell; which consists of all points in space which must have U as theirnearest-neighbor. Since exact computation of both types of Voronoi cells is computationallyhard; we propose approximate solutions. Therefore; we employ hierarchical access …,Geoinformatica,2017,*
Detection and Prediction of Natural Hazards Using Large-Scale Environmental Data,Nina Hubig; Philip Fengler; Andreas Züfle; Ruixin Yang; Stephan Günnemann,Abstract Recent developments in remote sensing have made it possible to instrument andsense the physical world with high resolution and fidelity. Consequently; very large spatio-temporal environmental data sets; have become available to the research community. Suchdata consists of time-series; starting as early as 1973; monitoring up to thousands ofenvironmental parameters; for each spatial region of a resolution as low as 0.5'* 0.5'. Tomake this flood of data actionable; in this work; we employ a data driven approach to detectand predict natural hazards. Our supervised learning approach learns from labeled historicevents. We describe each event by a three-mode tensor; covering space; time andenvironmental parameters.

Predicting the Evolution of Narratives in Social Media,Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Dieter Pfoser; Andrew Crooks; Arie Croitoru; Anthony Stefanidis,Abstract The emergence of global networking capabilities (eg social media) has providednewfound mechanisms and avenues for information to be generated; disseminated; shaped;and consumed. The spread and evolution of online information represents a uniquenarrative ecosystem that is facilitated by cyberspace but operates at the nexus of threedimensions: the social network; the contextual; and the spatial. Current approaches topredict patterns of information spread across social media primarily focus on the socialnetwork dimension of the problem. The novel challenge formulated in this work is to blendthe social; spatial; and contextual dimensions of online narratives in order to support highfidelity simulations that are contextually informed by past events; and support the multi-granular; reconfigural and dynamic prediction of the dissemination of a new narrative.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2017,*
A Unified Framework to Predict Movement,Olga Gkountouna; Dieter Pfoser; Carola Wenk; Andreas Züfle,Abstract In the current data-centered era; there are many highly diverse data sources thatprovide information about movement on networks; such as GPS trajectories; traffic flowmeasurements; farecard data; pedestrian cameras; bike-share data and even geo-socialmovement trajectories. The challenge identified in this vision paper is to create a unifiedframework for aggregating and analyzing such diverse and uncertain movement data onnetworks. This requires probabilistic models to capture flow/volume and movementprobabilities on a network over time. Novel algorithms are required to train these modelsfrom datasets with varying levels of uncertainty. By combining information from differentnetworks; immediate applications of such a unifying movement model include optimal siteplanning; map construction; traffic management; and emergency management.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2017,*
Spatio-temporal prediction of social connections,Guolei Yang; Andreas Züfle,Abstract It is long known that a user's mobility pattern can be affected by his socialconnections. Users tend to visit same locations visited by their friends. In this paper weinvestigate the inverse problem: How does a set of user trajectories reflect their socialconnections. To this end; we define the social connection prediction problem. Given twousers; predict the probability that they are friends by mining their historical trajectories. A firstapproach to do so is to exam how often the two users visit the same location at the sametime; which suffers from the problem that different locations/times may have differentpredictive power. We propose a comprehensive prediction model that is able to capture thisdifference between locations and time slots. To demonstrate its effectiveness; we trained theproposed model using the publicly available Foursquare dataset.

Such location-based social networks allow people to recordand share their location and are a rich source of information which can be exploited to studypeople's various attributes and characteristics and can provide various Geo-Social (GS)services. In this demonstration; we propose a new type of query called Top-k Geo-Social(TGS) query; which enriches the semantics of the conventional spatial query by introducinga social relevance attribute. Similarly; users formulate their TGS queries and view the resultsthrough browser-based client side interface.

Bayesian network movement model,Andreas Züfle,Abstract To unify and integrate various types; resolutions; and levels of uncertainty of userlocation data; we employ a Bayesian learning approach; which allows to iteratively add newknowledge to refine a model describing the motion of an object in space and time. Byexplicitly modelling uncertainty; we maintain a notion of data reliability; such that theconfidence of any query and mining results can be assessed. Based on this motion modelfor individual users; we present our algorithms for estimating the continuous location ofusers based on sparse observations. Our approach uses a global traffic model using aMarkov-chain as an apriori-model; which is learned from all available historic trajectory data.Starting from this apriori-model; we use observations of individual users to adapt this model;using a forward backward approach to add new knowledge to the model.

Similarity search in fuzzy object databases,Diana Uskat; Tobias Emrich; Andreas Züfle; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Thomas Bernecker; Matthias Renz,Abstract Fuzzy object databases are becoming more and more important in the context ofimage analysis. Examples include satellite images where blurred trees; houses or lakes canstill be organized and searched in a meaningful manner and biomedical images which canbe utilized to find similar disease patterns and monitor disease progress. One problem of theunderlying data is that it contains blurred image content; ie; fuzzy data. Therefore; an image-based similarity search; which can process huge amounts of fuzzy data in an efficient andeffective way; is desirable. The aim of this work is to develop efficient and effective methodsfor similarity search in fuzzy object databases. First; a suitable similarity measure based on ashape similarity is proposed. Based on this; two novel k-nearest neighbor algorithms forefficient similarity search are presented. The first approach gains efficiency at the cost of …,Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2015,*
Monitoring Probabilistic Threshold SUM Query Processing in Uncertain Streams,Nina Hubig; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Mario A Nascimento; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Many sources of data streams; eg geo-spatial streams derived from GPS-trackingsystems or sensor streams provided by sensor networks are inherently uncertain due toimpreciseness of sensing devices; due to outdated information; and due to human errors. Inorder to support data analysis on such data; aggregation queries are an important class ofqueries. This paper introduces a scalable approach for continuous probabilistic SUM queryprocessing in uncertain stream environments. Here we consider an uncertain stream as astream of uncertain values; each given by a probability distribution among the domain of thesensor values. Continuous probabilistic sum queries maintain the probability distribution ofthe sum of possible sensor values actually derived from the streaming environment. Ourapproach is able to efficiently compute the probabilistic SUM according to the possible …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,*
Scalable Probabilistic Similarity Ranking in Uncertain Databases (Technical Report),Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract: This paper introduces a scalable approach for probabilistic top-k similarity rankingon uncertain vector data. Each uncertain object is represented by a set of vector instancesthat are assumed to be mutually-exclusive. The objective is to rank the uncertain dataaccording to their distance to a reference object. We propose a framework that incrementallycomputes for each object instance and ranking position; the probability of the object falling atthat ranking position. The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for severalstate-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models. Existing approaches compute this probabilitydistribution by applying a dynamic programming approach of quadratic complexity. In thispaper we theoretically as well as experimentally show that our framework reduces this to alinear-time complexity while having the same memory requirements; facilitated by …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0907.2868,2009,*

Tourismo: A User-Preference Tourist Trip Search Engine,Klaus Arthur Schmid; Gregor Jossé; Andreas Züfle; Georgios Skoumas; Matthias Schubert; Dieter Pfoser,Abstract. In this demonstration we re-visit the problem of finding an optimal route fromlocation A to B. Currently; navigation systems compute shortest; fastest; most economicroutes or any combination thereof. More often than not users want to consider “soft”qualitative metrics such as popularity; scenic value; and general appeal of a route. Routingalgorithms have not (yet) been able to appreciate; measure; and evaluate such qualitativemeasures. Given the emergence of user-generated content; data exists that records userpreference. This work exploits user-generated data; including image data; text data andtrajectory data; to estimate the attractiveness of parts of the spatial network in relation to aparticular user. We enrich the spatial network dataset by quantitative scores reflectingqualitative attractiveness. These scores are derived from a user-specific selfassessment (“ …,*,*,*
