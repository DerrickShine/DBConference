Inference Attacks on Property-Preserving Encrypted Databases,Muhammad Naveed; Seny Kamara; Charles V Wright,Abstract Many encrypted database (EDB) systems have been proposed in the last few yearsas cloud computing has grown in popularity and data breaches have increased. The state-of-the-art EDB systems for relational databases can handle SQL queries over encrypted dataand are competitive with commercial database systems. These systems; most of which arebased on the design of CryptDB (SOSP 2011); achieve these properties by making use ofproperty-preserving encryption schemes such as deterministic (DTE) and order-preservingencryption (OPE). In this paper; we study the concrete security provided by such systems.We present a series of attacks that recover the plaintext from DTE-and OPE-encrypteddatabase columns using only the encrypted column and publicly-available auxiliaryinformation. We consider well-known attacks; including frequency analysis and sorting; as …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2015,150
Dynamic searchable encryption via blind storage,Muhammad Naveed; Manoj Prabhakaran; Carl A Gunter,Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption allows a client to store a dynamic collection ofencrypted documents with a server; and later quickly carry out keyword searches on theseencrypted documents; while revealing minimal information to the server. In this paper wepresent a new dynamic SSE scheme that is simpler and more efficient than existingschemes while revealing less information to the server than prior schemes; achieving fullyadaptive security against honest-but-curious servers. We implemented a prototype of ourscheme and demonstrated its efficiency on datasets from prior work. Apart from its concreteefficiency; our scheme is also simpler: in particular; it does not require the server to supportany operation other than upload and download of data. Thus the server in our scheme canbe based solely on a cloud storage service; rather than a cloud computation service as …,2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),2014,142
Identity; location; disease and more: Inferring your secrets from android public resources,Xiaoyong Zhou; Soteris Demetriou; Dongjing He; Muhammad Naveed; Xiaorui Pan; XiaoFeng Wang; Carl A Gunter; Klara Nahrstedt,Abstract The design of Android is based on a set of unprotected shared resources; includingthose inherited from Linux (eg; Linux public directories). However; the dramatic developmentin Android applications (app for short) makes available a large amount of public backgroundinformation (eg; social networks; public online services); which can potentially turn suchoriginally harmless resource sharing into serious privacy breaches. In this paper; we reportour work on this important yet understudied problem. We discovered three unexpectedchannels of information leaks on Android: per-app data-usage statistics; ARP information;and speaker status (on or off). By monitoring these channels; an app without any permissionmay acquire sensitive information such as smartphone user's identity; the disease conditionshe is interested in; her geo-locations and her driving route; from top-of-the-line Android …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,101
Privacy in the Genomic Era,Muhammad Naveed; Erman Ayday; Ellen W Clayton; Jacques Fellay; Carl A Gunter; Jean-Pierre Hubaux; Bradley A Malin; XiaoFeng Wang,Abstract Genome sequencing technology has advanced at a rapid pace and it is nowpossible to generate highly-detailed genotypes inexpensively. The collection and analysis ofsuch data has the potential to support various applications; including personalized medicalservices. While the benefits of the genomics revolution are trumpeted by the biomedicalcommunity; the increased availability of such data has major implications for personalprivacy; notably because the genome has certain essential features; which include (but arenot limited to)(i) an association with traits and certain diseases;(ii) identification capability(eg; forensics); and (iii) revelation of family relationships. Moreover; direct-to-consumer DNAtesting increases the likelihood that genome data will be made available in less regulatedenvironments; such as the Internet and for-profit companies.

The peril of fragmentation: Security hazards in android device driver customizations,Xiaoyong Zhou; Yeonjoon Lee; Nan Zhang; Muhammad Naveed; XiaoFeng Wang,Android phone manufacturers are under the perpetual pressure to move quickly on theirnew models; continuously customizing Android to fit their hardware. However; the securityimplications of this practice are less known; particularly when it comes to the changes madeto Android's Linux device drivers; eg; those for camera; GPS; NFC etc. In this paper; wereport the first study aimed at a better understanding of the security risks in thiscustomization process. Our study is based on ADDICTED; a new tool we built forautomatically detecting some types of flaws in customized driver protection. Specifically; ona customized phone; ADDICTED performs dynamic analysis to correlate the operations on asecurity-sensitive device to its related Linux files; and then determines whether those filesare under-protected on the Linux layer by comparing them with their counterparts on an …,2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),2014,66
Security Concerns in Android mHealth Apps,Dongjing He; Muhammad Naveed; Carl A Gunter; Klara Nahrstedt,Abstract Mobile Health (mHealth) applications lie outside of regulatory protection such asHIPAA; which requires a baseline of privacy and security protections appropriate to sensitivemedical data. However; mHealth apps; particularly those in the app stores for iOS andAndroid; are increasingly handling sensitive data for both professionals and patients. Thispaper presents a series of three studies of the mHealth apps in Google Play that show thatmHealth apps make widespread use of unsecured Internet communications and third partyservers. Both of these practices would be considered problematic under HIPAA; suggestingthat increased use of mHealth apps could lead to less secure treatment of health data unlessmHealth vendors make improvements in the way they communicate and store data.,AMIA 2014 Annual Symposium,2014,40
Leave Me Alone: App-level Protection Against Runtime Information Gathering on Android,Nan Zhang; Kan Yuan; Muhammad Naveed; Xiaoyong Zhou; XiaoFeng Wang,Stealing of sensitive information from apps is always considered to be one of the mostcritical threats to Android security. Recent studies show that this can happen even to theapps without explicit implementation flaws; through exploiting some design weaknesses ofthe operating system; eg; Shared communication channels such as Bluetooth; and sidechannels such as memory and network-data usages. In all these attacks; a malicious appneeds to run side-by-side with the target app (the victim) to collect its runtime information.Examples include recording phone conversations from the phone app; gathering WebMD'sdata usages to infer the disease condition the user looks at; etc. This runtime-information-gathering (RIG) threat is realistic and serious; as demonstrated by prior research and ournew findings; which reveal that the malware monitoring popular Android-based home …,2015 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),2015,37
The Fallacy of Composition of Oblivious RAM and Searchable Encryption,Muhammad Naveed,ABSTRACT Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a tool proposed to hide access pattern leakage; andthere has been a lot of progress in the efficiency of ORAM schemes; however; less attentionhas been paid to study the applicability of ORAM for cloud applications such as symmetricsearchable encryption (SSE). Although; searchable encryption is one of the motivations forORAM research; no in-depth study of the applicability of ORAM to searchable encryptionexists as of June 2015. In this work; we initiate the formal study of using ORAM to reduce theaccess pattern leakage in searchable encryption. We propose four new leakage classes anddevelop a systematic methodology to study the applicability of ORAM to SSE. We develop aworst-case communication baseline for SSE. We show that completely eliminating leakagein SSE is impossible. We propose single keyword schemes for our leakage classes and …,*,2015,31
Inside Job: Understanding and Mitigating the Threat of External Device Mis-Bonding on Android,Muhammad Naveed; Xiaoyong Zhou; Soteris Demetriou; XiaoFeng Wang; Carl A Gunter,Abstract—Today's smartphones can be armed with many types of external devices; such asmedical devices and credit card readers; that enrich their functionality and enable them to beused in application domains such as healthcare and retail. This new development comeswith new security and privacy challenges. Existing phone-based operating systems; Androidin particular; are not ready for protecting authorized use of these external devices: indeed;any app on an Android phone that acquires permission to utilize communication channelslike Bluetooth and Near Field Communications is automatically given the access to devicescommunicating with the phone on these channels. In this paper; we present the first study onthis new security issue; which we call external Device Mis-Bonding or DMB; under thecontext of Bluetooth-enabled Android devices.

Controlled Functional Encryption,Muhammad Naveed; Shashank Agrawal; Manoj Prabhakaran; Xiaofeng Wang; Erman Ayday; Jean-Pierre Hubaux; Carl Gunter,Abstract Motivated by privacy and usability requirements in various scenarios where existingcryptographic tools (like secure multi-party computation and functional encryption) are notadequate; we introduce a new cryptographic tool called Controlled Functional Encryption (C-FE). As in functional encryption; C-FE allows a user (client) to learn only certain functions ofencrypted data; using keys obtained from an authority. However; we allow (and require) theclient to send a fresh key request to the authority every time it wants to evaluate a function ona ciphertext. We obtain efficient solutions by carefully combining CCA2 secure public-keyencryption (or rerandomizable RCCA secure public-key encryption; depending on thenature of security desired) with Yao's garbled circuit. Our main contributions in this workinclude developing and for-mally defining the notion of C-FE; designing theoretical and …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2014,30
Practicing Oblivious Access on Cloud Storage: the Gap; the Fallacy; and the New Way Forward,Vincent Bindschaedler; Muhammad Naveed; Xiaorui Pan; XiaoFeng Wang; Yan Huang,Abstract To understand the gap between theory and practice for oblivious cloud storage; weexperimentally evaluate four representative Oblivious RAM (ORAM) designs on Amazon S3.We replay realistic application traces to these ORAMs in order to understand whether theycan meet the demands of various real applications using cloud storage as a backend. Wefind that metrics traditionally used in the ORAM literature; eg; bandwidth overhead; fail tocapture the practical needs of those applications. With a new understanding of the desirableproperties; relevant metrics; and observations about the cloud services and theirapplications; we propose CURIOUS; a new modular partition-based ORAM framework; andshow experimentally that it is thus far the most promising approach.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2015,29
Mayhem in the Push Clouds: Understanding and Mitigating Security Hazards in Mobile Push-Messaging Services,Tongxin Li; Xiaoyong Zhou; Luyi Xing; Yeonjoon Lee; Muhammad Naveed; XiaoFeng Wang; Xinhui Han,Abstract Push messaging is among the most important mobile-cloud services; offeringcritical supports to a wide spectrum of mobile apps. This service needs to coordinatecomplicated interactions between developer servers and their apps in a large scale; makingit error prone. With its importance; little has been done; however; to understand the securityrisks of the service. In this paper; we report the first security analysis on those push-messaging services; which reveals the pervasiveness of subtle yet significant security flawsin them; affecting billions of mobile users. Through even the most reputable services likeGoogle Cloud Messaging (GCM) and Amazon Device Messaging (ADM); the adversaryrunning carefully-crafted exploits can steal sensitive messages from a target device;stealthily install or uninstall any apps on it; remotely lock out its legitimate user or even …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2014,28
Leakage-Abuse Attacks against Order-Revealing Encryption,Paul Grubbs; Kevin Sekniqi; Vincent Bindschaedler; Muhammad Naveed; Thomas Ristenpart,Order-preserving encryption and its generalization order-revealing encryption (OPE/ORE)allow sorting; performing range queries; and filtering data-all while only having access tociphertexts. But OPE and ORE ciphertexts necessarily leak information about plaintexts; andwhat level of security they provide in practice has been unclear. In this work; we introducenew leakage-abuse attacks that recover plaintexts from OPE/ORE-encrypted databases.Underlying our new attacks is a framework in which we cast the adversary's challenge as anon-crossing bipartite matching problem. This allows easy tailoring of attacks to a specificscheme's leakage profile. In a case study of customer records; we show attacks that recover99% of first names; 97% of last names; and 90% of birthdates held in a database; despite allvalues being encrypted with the OPE scheme most widely used in practice.

Breaking Web Applications Built On Top of Encrypted Data,Paul Grubbs; Richard McPherson; Muhammad Naveed; Thomas Ristenpart; Vitaly Shmatikov,Abstract We develop a systematic approach for analyzing client-server applications that aimto hide sensitive user data from untrusted servers. We then apply it to Mylar; a frameworkthat uses multi-key searchable encryption (MKSE) to build Web applications on top ofencrypted data. We demonstrate that (1) the Popa-Zeldovich model for MKSE does not implysecurity against either passive or active attacks;(2) Mylar-based Web applications revealusers' data and queries to passive and active adversarial servers; and (3) Mylar isgenerically insecure against active attacks due to system design flaws. Our results show thatthe problem of securing client-server applications against actively malicious servers ischallenging and still unsolved.,ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,22

What’s in Your Dongle and Bank Account? Mandatory and Discretionary Protection of Android External Resources,Soteris Demetriou; Xiaoyong Zhou; Muhammad Naveed; Yeonjoon Lee; Kan Yuan; X Wang; Carl A Gunter,Abstract—The pervasiveness of security-critical external resources (eg accessories; onlineservices) poses new challenges to Android security. In prior research we revealed that giventhe BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN permissions; a malicious app on an authorizedphone gains unfettered access to any Bluetooth device (eg; Blood Glucose meter; etc.). Herewe further show that sensitive text messages from online banking services and socialnetworks (account balance; password reset links; etc.) are completely exposed to any appwith either the RECEIVE_SMS or the READ_SMS permission. Similar security risks arepresent in other channels (Internet; Audio and NFC) extensively used to connect the phoneto assorted external devices or services.

Network intrusion prevention by configuring ACLs on the routers; based on snort IDS alerts,Muhammad Naveed; Shams un Nihar; Mohammad Inayatullah Babar,Intrusion prevention is one of the fundamental requirements for a network to be secure.Investing on intrusion prevention forbade its use for securing many networks. This studyproposes a very basic way to prevent intrusions without any additional cost. Snort is a freeopen source IDS; which we have integrated with a Cisco router to prevent intrusions. Ciscorouters are very common in today's networks. Other routers like Juniper; or even simpleADSL or SOHO routers can be used but with minor changes for the router specificconfiguration. As ADSL is very common nowadays; ADSL routers are present everywhereand they can easily replace the Cisco router used in this study and provide intrusionprevention capabilities for homes and businesses which otherwise are not able to afford it.Router and computer (to be used as a sensor) are fundamental components of every …,Emerging Technologies (ICET); 2010 6th International Conference on,2010,15
Reliable and Low Cost RFID Based Authentication System for Large Scale Deployment.,Muhammad Naveed; Wasim Habib; Usman Masud; Ubaid Ullah; Gulzar Ahmad,Abstract Identification is very important nowadays; whether there is need to identify persons;animals or objects; RFIDs provide a very good solution to the problem of identification andauthentication. No one can deny the importance of authentication; it is done at the airport; atthe railway station; in the library etc; but usually it's done manually. The proposed system isa low cost automatic identification and authentication system which can be deployed at thedoors of the building to authenticate authorized people. RFID based system should be verylow cost and reliable for large scale deployment; for example RFID deployment in an airportto identify every official and passenger. The proposed system aims to develop a very lowcost RFID authentication system based on the low cost components already available in themarket. The complete system costs less than $10 USD.

Hurdles for genomic data usage management,Muhammad Naveed,Our genome determines our appearance; gender; diseases; reaction to drugs; and muchmore. It not only contains information about us but also about our relatives; past generations;and future generations. This creates many policy and technology challenges to protectprivacy and manage usage of genomic data. In this paper; we identify various features ofgenomic data that make its usage management very challenging and different from othertypes of data. We also describe some ideas about potential solutions and propose somerecommendations for the usage of genomic data.,Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW); 2014 IEEE,2014,3

Poster: Privacy Implications of BSSID based Location Services,Muhammad Naveed; XiaoFeng Wang; Carl Gunter,Abstract—In this work we show the threats to location privacy of an Android user frompopular wireless Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) based location services. Our approachuses a combination of techniques an attacker can use to infer the location of a user. Firstly;we describe how an Android app (even with zero permissions) can stealthily steal theBSSIDs from a phone. Secondly; we were able to reverse-engineer the mobile-app to serverprotocol interaction of a popular BSSID based location service; allowing the attacker to getthe location of any chosen BSSID. We make this BSSID to location lookup software availableat [1]. We have a demo [3]; which shows a malicious app (with zero permissions) stealing theBSSID of the wireless network and transmitting the same to the attacker; allowing theattacker to accurately locate the location of the user.
