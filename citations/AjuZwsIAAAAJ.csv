Nonlocal third-order shear deformation plate theory with application to bending and vibration of plates,Ramin Aghababaei; JN Reddy,Abstract The third-order shear deformation plate theory of Reddy [A simple higher-ordertheory for laminated composite plates; J. Appl. Mech. 51 (1984) 745–752] is reformulatedusing the nonlocal linear elasticity theory of Eringen. This theory has ability to capture theboth small scale effects and quadratic variation of shear strain and consequently shearstress through the plate thickness. Analytical solutions of bending and free vibration of asimply supported rectangular plate are presented using this theory to illustrate the effect ofnonlocal theory on deflection and natural frequency of the plates. Finally; the relationsbetween nonlocal third-order; first-order and classical theories are discussed by numericalresults.,Journal of Sound and Vibration,2009,217
Critical length scale controls adhesive wear mechanisms,Ramin Aghababaei; Derek H Warner; Jean-Francois Molinari,Abstract The adhesive wear process remains one of the least understood areas ofmechanics. While it has long been established that adhesive wear is a direct result ofcontacting surface asperities; an agreed upon understanding of how contacting asperitieslead to wear debris particle has remained elusive. This has restricted adhesive wearprediction to empirical models with limited transferability. Here we show that discrepantobservations and predictions of two distinct adhesive wear mechanisms can be reconciledinto a unified framework. Using atomistic simulations with model interatomic potentials; wereveal a transition in the asperity wear mechanism when contact junctions fall below acritical length scale. A simple analytic model is formulated to predict the transition in both thesimulation results and experiments. This new understanding may help expand use of …,Nature communications,2016,30
Micromechanics of tensile twinning in magnesium gleaned from molecular dynamics simulations,Ramin Aghababaei; Shailendra P Joshi,Abstract This work discusses coarse-grained micromechanics of tensile twinning inmagnesium (Mg) extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We perform MDsimulations on Mg single crystal orientations with initial idealized defect structures attemperatures T= 5 K and 300 K. A detailed atomistic analysis reveals that tensile loadingalong the c-axis of a defective crystal causes an initial incomplete slip ahead of the defect onthe first-order pyramidal< c+ a> planes; followed by the formation of a {11 2¯ 1} twin embryoand basal dislocation. These mechanisms aid the formation of {10 1¯ 2} twins; which evolverapidly while {11 2¯ 1} twins disappear. We present a micromechanics picture of thedeformation-induced twin structure evolution that is tracked by incorporating a twinorientation analysis (TOA) scheme within Open Visualization Tool.

Micromechanics of crystallographic size-effects in metal matrix composites induced by thermo-mechanical loading,Ramin Aghababaei; Shailendra P Joshi,Abstract We investigate the length-scale dependent micromechanics metal matrixcomposites (MMCs) using a visco-plastic slip-gradient crystal plasticity theory. The salientfeature of this investigation is that it explicitly models the presence of the initial slip-gradientsintroduced by thermal loading that closely mimics conditions experienced during MMCprocessing. We present a two-step finite element procedure for model MMC unit cellscomprising an inclusion embedded within a single crystal. In the first step; the MMCs aresubjected to a thermal excursion that results in geometrically necessary dislocation (GND)density and residual stresses whose magnitude and distribution are influenced by theinclusion size and the initial lattice orientation. The thermal GND density is taken as astarting dislocation substructure for the MMCs in the subsequent step involving …,International Journal of Plasticity,2013,19
Grain size–inclusion size interaction in metal matrix composites using mechanism-based gradient crystal plasticity,Ramin Aghababaei; Shailendra P Joshi,Abstract Metal matrix composites (MMCs) comprising nano/microcrystalline matrices andreinforcements exhibit impressive mechanical behaviors derived by exploiting the sizeeffects due to development of geometrically necessary dislocations. In such nanostructuredMMCs intricate interactions between the grain size dg and inclusion size di may exist in theiroverall response; but are difficult to isolate in experiments and are also not accounted for inthe size-dependent homogenized models. In this paper; we computationally investigate thegrain size–inclusion size interaction in model MMCs architectures wherein the grains andinclusions are explicitly resolved. A mechanism-based slip-gradient crystal plasticityformulation (Han et al.; 2005a) is implemented in a finite element framework to modelpolycrystalline mass as an aggregate of randomly oriented single crystals that host elastic …,International Journal of Solids and Structures,2011,15
Nonlocal continuum crystal plasticity with internal residual stresses,Ramin Aghababaei; Shailendra P Joshi; JN Reddy,Abstract We derive a three-dimensional constitutive theory accounting for length-scaledependent internal residual stresses in crystalline materials that develop due to a non-homogeneous spatial distribution of the excess dislocation (edge and screw) density. Thesecond-order internal stress tensor is derived using the Beltrami stress function tensor φ thatis related to the Nye dislocation density tensor. The formulation is derived explicitly in a three-dimensional continuum setting for elastically isotropic materials. The internal stressesappear as additional resolved shear stresses in the crystallographic visco-plastic constitutivelaw for individual slip systems. Using this formulation; we investigate two boundary valueproblems involving single crystals under symmetric double slip. In the first problem; theresponse of a geometrically imperfect specimen subjected to monotonic and cyclic …,Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids,2011,14
On the debris-level origins of adhesive wear,Ramin Aghababaei; Derek H Warner; Jean-François Molinari,Abstract Every contacting surface inevitably experiences wear. Predicting the exact amountof material loss due to wear relies on empirical data and cannot be obtained from anyphysical model. Here; we analyze and quantify wear at the most fundamental level; ie; weardebris particles. Our simulations show that the asperity junction size dictates the debrisvolume; revealing the origins of the long-standing hypothesized correlation between thewear volume and the real contact area. No correlation; however; is found between the debrisvolume and the normal applied force at the debris level. Alternatively; we show that thejunction size controls the tangential force and sliding distance such that their product; ie; thetangential work; is always proportional to the debris volume; with a proportionality constantof 1 over the junction shear strength. This study provides an estimation of the debris …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2017,6
Impact of internal crystalline boundaries on lattice thermal conductivity: Importance of boundary structure and spacing,Ramin Aghababaei; Guillaume Anciaux; Jean-Francois Molinari,The low thermal conductivity of nano-crystalline materials is commonly explained viadiffusive scattering of phonons by internal boundaries. In this study; we have quantitativelystudied phonon-crystalline boundaries scattering and its effect on the overall lattice thermalconductivity of crystalline bodies. Various types of crystalline boundaries such as stackingfaults; twins; and grain boundaries have been considered in FCC crystalline structures.Accordingly; the specularity coefficient has been determined for different boundaries as theprobability of the specular scattering across boundaries. Our results show that in thepresence of internal boundaries; the lattice thermal conductivity can be characterized by twoparameters:(1) boundary spacing and (2) boundary excess free volume. We show that theinverse of the lattice thermal conductivity depends linearly on a non-dimensional quantity …,Applied Physics Letters,2014,5
A crystal plasticity analysis of length-scale dependent internal stresses with image effects,Ramin Aghababaei; Shailendra P Joshi,Abstract In this work; we present a stress functions approach to include image effects incontinuum crystal plasticity arising from the long-range elastic interactions (LRI) between theGND density and free surfaces. The resulting length-scale dependent internal stressesaugment those produced by the GND density variation. The formulation is applied to thecase of a long; thin specimen subjected to uniform curvature. The analysis shows that undernominally uniform GND density distribution; internal stresses arise from two sources:(1) GND–GND LRI arising from the finite spatial extent of the uniform GND density field and (2) the LRIbetween the GND density and free surfaces appearing as image fields. A comparison withexperimental results suggests that the length-scale for internal stresses; described as acorrelation length-scale; should increase with decreasing specimen thickness.

A mechanistic understanding of the wear coefficient: from single to multiple asperities contact,Lucas Frérot; Ramin Aghababaei; Jean-François Molinari,Abstract Sliding contact between solids leads to material detaching from their surfaces in theform of debris particles; a process known as wear. According to the well-known Archardwear model; the wear volume (ie the volume of detached particles) is proportional to theload and the sliding distance; while being inversely proportional to the hardness. Theinfluence of other parameters are empirically merged into a factor; referred to as wearcoefficient; which does not stem from any theoretical development; thus limiting thepredictive capacity of the model. Based on a recent understanding of a critical length-scalecontrolling wear particle formation; we present two novel derivations of the wear coefficient:one based on Archard's interpretation of the wear coefficient as the probability of wearparticle detachment and one that follows naturally from the up-scaling of asperity-level …,Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids,2018,*

Micromechanical Origins of Adhesive Wear Mechanisms: From Asperity Smoothing to Debris Creation,Ramin Aghababaei; Derek Warner; Jean-François Molinari,The adhesive wear process consists of several physical phenomena including plasticity andfracture which occur at different length and time scales. Despite the critical importance of theadhesive wear process in all engineering applications; it is still described via classical; yetfully empirical; models [1; 2] since the microscopic principles have not been yet understood.Using novel coarse-grained atomistic simulations; we for the first time capture the debrisformation during the adhesive collision between surface asperities [3]. A systematic set ofatomistic simulations reveals a characteristic length scale that controls the adhesive wearmechanisms (ie asperity smoothing versus debris formation) at the asperity level. This lengthscale provides a critical adhesive junction size where bigger junctions produce wear debrisby fracture while smaller ones smooth out plastically. This finding explains why wear …,STLE Tribology Frontier Conference,2017,*

Modeling Slip Gradients and Internal Stresses in Crystalline Microstructures with Distributed Defects,Ramin Aghababaei,This thesis addresses a formulation and investigation of length-scale effects in the presenceof heterogeneities and internal stresses in continuum crystal plasticity. A three-dimensionalconstitutive theory accounting for length-scale dependent internal residual stresses isdeveloped. The resulting internal stress is discussed in terms of the long-range dislocation-dislocation and dislocation-boundaries elastic interactions and physical and mathematicalorigins of corresponding length scales are argued. It will show that internal stress is afunction of spatial variation of GND density in absence of finite boundaries where internalstress arises from GND? GND long range elastic interactions. However in presence of finiteboundaries such as free surfaces or interfaces; additional source of internal stress is presentdue to long range interaction between GND and boundaries.
