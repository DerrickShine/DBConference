Cultural mismatch and creativity in arts education,Samuel Leong,Culture has been found to impact upon creativity; which is valued as 'a motor of economicand social innovation'in a world that is experiencing rapid cultural changes and increasingcultural diversity. Recent research has given attention to the problem of cultural mismatch ineducation; with studies showing that children's success at school depends on the extent towhich the knowledge; background and values of their families match the school's values andpriorities. The greater the mismatch between the two cultures; the less likely the childrenwould benefit from schooling. When schools fail to effectively address the mismatch; socialinequalities and academic failure are perpetuated. But the problem is not confined to homeversus school cultures; and can be present in other kinds of mismatches such as western-eastern cultures and traditional-popular cultures.

A planetary perspective,Samuel Leong,This chapter discusses some of the critical considerations when undertaking interculturalarts research; and proposes a “planetary-commonality” approach that is sensitive to global–local interactions as the point of departure for generating cultural understanding. It sees“interculturality” as involving positive interactions between different cultures on a number oflevels; including sub-cultures; artistic cultures; gender cultures; linguistic cultures; andlearning cultures. This distinguishes itself from a “fusion” approach by taking togethernessas the starting point and having the synthesis of “multiple identities” as its essence (seeRentschler & Huong Le; 2008). The three issues of identity; power relations and presenceare examined and discussed with reference to three intercultural arts phenomena inChinese cultural contexts: the transmission of the Cantonese opera tradition; the adaptive …,The Routledge international handbook of intercultural arts research,2016,1

Distinct cultural differences between the East and West are manifested indifferent and sometimes subtle ways; with the East giving more attention to the mastery ofskills; the inner experience of personal fulfilment; ideas preceding form; and skilldevelopment preceding creative exploration and expression. As China modernizes andtransforms into a superpower; the confluences of Eastern and Western cultures arebecoming more evident with traditional values intersecting with those of capitalism andinternationalization.
