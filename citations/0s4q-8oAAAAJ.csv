Design and preparation of new palladium precatalysts for C–C and C–N cross-coupling reactions,Nicholas C Bruno; Matthew T Tudge; Stephen L Buchwald,A series of easily prepared; phosphine-ligated palladium precatalysts based on the 2-aminobiphenyl scaffold have been prepared. The role of the precatalyst-associated labilehalide (or pseudohalide) in the formation and stability of the palladacycle has beenexamined. It was found that replacing the chloride in the previous version of the precatalystwith a mesylate leads to a new class of precatalysts with improved solution stability and thatare readily prepared from a wider range of phosphine ligands. The differences between theprevious version of precatalyst and that reported here are explored. In addition; the reactivityof the latter is examined in a range of C–C and C–N bond forming reactions.,Chemical science,2013,245
Synthesis and application of palladium precatalysts that accommodate extremely bulky di-tert-butylphosphino biaryl ligands,Nicholas C Bruno; Stephen L Buchwald,A series of palladacyclic precatalysts that incorporate electron-rich di-tert-butylphosphinobiaryl ligands is reported. These precatalysts are easily prepared; and their use provides ageneral means of employing bulky ligands in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.The application of these palladium sources to various C–N and C–O bond-formingprocesses is also described.,Organic letters,2013,79
N-Substituted 2-aminobiphenylpalladium methanesulfonate precatalysts and their use in C–C and C–N cross-couplings,Nicholas C Bruno; Nootaree Niljianskul; Stephen L Buchwald,A series of phosphine-ligated palladium precatalysts based on N-methyl-and N-phenyl-2-aminobiphenyl have been developed. Substitution at the nitrogen center prevents thepresence of traces of aminobiphenyls that contain a free− NH2 group from contaminatingcross-coupling products. These precatalysts produce N-substituted carbazoles uponactivation; which cannot consume starting materials. These precatalysts were efficientlygenerated from 2-aminobiphenyl with minimal purification and found to be highly effective inSuzuki–Miyaura and C–N cross-coupling reactions.,The Journal of organic chemistry,2014,46
Enantioselective synthesis of carbo-and heterocycles through a CuH-catalyzed hydroalkylation approach,Yi-Ming Wang; Nicholas C Bruno; Ángel L Placeres; Shaolin Zhu; Stephen L Buchwald,The enantioselective; intramolecular hydroalkylation of halide-tethered styrenes has beenachieved through a copper hydride-catalyzed process. This approach allowed for thesynthesis of enantioenriched cyclobutanes; cyclopentanes; indanes; and six-membered N-and O-heterocycles. This protocol was applied to the synthesis of the commercial serotoninreuptake inhibitor (−)-paroxetine.,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2015,36

New palladium precatalysts for cross-coupling reactions,Nicholas C Bruno; Stephen L Buchwald,Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have become common tools for CC and CXbond formation in academic and industrial settings. 1-2 Privileged ligand scaffolds haveemerged that can effectively support a vast range of transformations. 3 However; as morecomplex cross-coupling reactions are explored; the method for generation of the catalyticallyactive LnPd (0) species has often proven to be pivotal to the success of a cross-couplingreaction. Many traditional palladium sources can have significant problems in generatingactive catalysts. Stable Pd (0) sources such as Pdn (dba) m contain dibenzylideneacetone(dba) ligands that can impede the catalytic cycle. 4 These Pd species can also containvarying degrees of free dba and palladium nanoparticles. 5 Pd (II) sources such as Pd (OAc)2 and PdCl2 need to be reduced to Pd (0) in-situ before entering a Pd (0)-Pd (II) …,Strem Chemicals; Inc.,2014,2

Phosphine-ligated palladium sulfonate palladacycles,*,Transition metal catalyst complexes play important roles in many areas of chemistry. Catalystcomplexes are recognized to be influenced by the characteristics of the transition metal and thoseof the associated ligands. For example; structural features of the ligands can influence reactionrate; regioselectivity; and stereoselectivity in reactions involving the catalyst complexes. Forexample; in coupling reactions; electron-withdrawing ligands can be expected to slow oxidativeaddition to; and speed reductive elimination from; the metal center; and; conversely;electron-rich ligands can be expected to speed oxidative addition to; and slow reductive eliminationfrom; the metal center … Although phosphine-ligated Pd(0) complexes constitute the activecatalyst in many reactions; such complexes are usually difficult to prepare and extremelyair-sensitive.

Novel palladium precatalysts and their application in cross-coupling reactions and copper-catalyzed enantioselective ring formation,Nicholas Charles Bruno,Chapters 1-3. A series of easily prepared; phosphine-ligated palladium precatalysts basedon the 2-aminobiphenyl scaffold have been prepared. The role of the precatalyst-associatedlabile halide (or pseudohalide) in the formation and stability of the palladacycle has beenexamined. It was found that replacing the chloride in the previous version of the precatalystwith a mesylate leads to a new class of precatalysts with improved solution stability and thatare readily prepared from a wider range of phosphine ligands; including the bulky; electron-rich di-tert-butylphosphino biaryl ligands.
