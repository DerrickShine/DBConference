Algorithmic graph minor theory: Decomposition; approximation; and coloring,Erik D Demaine; Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,At the core of the seminal graph minor theory of Robertson and Seymour is a powerfulstructural theorem capturing the structure of graphs excluding a fixed minor. This result isused throughout graph theory and graph algorithms; but is existential. We develop apolynomial-time algorithm using topological graph theory to decompose a graph into thestructure guaranteed by the theorem: a clique-sum of pieces almost-embeddable intobounded-genus surfaces. This result has many applications. In particular we showapplications to developing many approximation algorithms; including a 2-approximation tograph coloring; constant-factor approximations to treewidth and the largest grid minor;combinatorial polylogarithmic approximation to half-integral multicommodity flow;subexponential fixed-parameter algorithms; and PTASs for many minimization and …,Foundations of Computer Science; 2005.

Computing crossing number in linear time,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Buce Reed,Abstract We show that for every fixed k; there is a linear time algorithm that decides whetheror not a given graph has crossing number at most k; and if this is the case; computes adrawing of the graph in the plane with at most k crossings. This answers the question posedby Grohe (STOC'01 and JCSS 2004). Our algorithm can be viewed as a generalization ofthe seminal result by Hopcroft and Tarjan lin1; which determines if a given graph is planar inlinear time. Our algorithm can also be compared to the algorithms by Mohar (STOC'96 andSiam J. Discrete Math 2001); for testing the embeddability of an input graph in a fixedsurface. For each surface s; Mohar describes an algorithm which yields either an embeddingof G in s or a minor of G which is not embeddable in s and is minimal with this property.,Proceedings of the thirty-ninth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2007,94
The disjoint paths problem in quadratic time,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi; Bruce Reed,Abstract We consider the following well-known problem; which is called the disjoint pathsproblem. For a given graph G and a set of k pairs of terminals in G; the objective is to find kvertex-disjoint paths connecting given pairs of terminals or to conclude that such paths donot exist. We present an O (n 2) time algorithm for this problem for fixed k. This improves thetime complexity of the seminal result by Robertson and Seymour; who gave an O (n 3) timealgorithm for the disjoint paths problem for fixed k. Note that Perković and Reed (2000)announced in [24](without proofs) that this problem can be solved in O (n 2) time. Ouralgorithm implies that there is an O (n 2) time algorithm for the k edge-disjoint paths problem;the minor containment problem; and the labeled minor containment problem. In fact; the timecomplexity of all the algorithms with the most expensive part depending on Robertson …,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2012,93
Finding topological subgraphs is fixed-parameter tractable,Martin Grohe; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Dániel Marx; Paul Wollan,Abstract We prove that for every fixed undirected graph H; there is an O (| V (G)| 3) timealgorithm that; given a graph G; tests if G contains H as a topological subgraph (that is; asubdivision of H is subgraph of G). This shows that topological subgraph testing is fixed-parameter tractable; resolving a longstanding open question of Downey and Fellows from1992. As a corollary; for every H we obtain an O (| V (G)| 3) time algorithm that tests if there isan immersion of H into a given graph G. This answers another open question raised byDowney and Fellows in 1992.,Proceedings of the forty-third annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2011,87
A simpler linear time algorithm for embedding graphs into an arbitrary surface and the genus of graphs of bounded tree-width,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bojan Mohar; Bruce Reed,For every fixed surface $ S $; orientable or non-orientable; and a given graph $ G $; Mohar(STOC'96 and Siam J. Discrete Math.(1999)) described a linear time algorithm which yieldseither an embedding of $ G $ in $ S $ or a minor of $ G $ which is not embeddable in $ S $and is minimal with this property. That algorithm; however; needs a lot of lemmas whichspanned six additional papers. In this paper; we give a new linear time algorithm for thesame problem. The advantages of our algorithm are the following: The proof is considerablysimpler: it needs only about 10 pages; and some results (with rather accessible proofs) fromgraph minors theory; while Mohar's original algorithm and its proof occupy more than 100pages in total. The hidden constant (depending on the genus $ g $ of the surface $ S $) ismuch smaller. It is singly exponential in $ g $; while it is doubly exponential in Mohar's …,Foundations of Computer Science; 2008. FOCS'08. IEEE 49th Annual IEEE Symposium on,2008,58
Scalable similarity search for SimRank,Mitsuru Kusumoto; Takanori Maehara; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract SimRank; proposed by Jeh and Widom; provides a good similarity score and hasbeen successfully used in many of the above mentioned applications. While there are manyalgorithms proposed so far to compute SimRank; but unfortunately; none of them arescalable up to graphs of billions size. Motivated by this fact; we consider the followingSimRank-based similarity search problem: given a query vertex u; find top-k vertices v withthe k highest SimRank scores s (u; v) with respect to u. We propose a very fast and scalablealgorithm for this similarity search problem. Our method consists of the followingingredients:(1) We first introduce a" linear" recursive formula for SimRank. This allows us toformulate a problem that we can propose a very fast algorithm.(2) We establish a Monte-Carlo based algorithm to compute a single pair SimRank score s (u; v); which is based on …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,53
A shorter proof of the graph minor algorithm: the unique linkage theorem,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Paul Wollan,Abstract At the core of the seminal Graph Minor Theory of Robertson and Seymour is apowerful theorem which describes the structure of graphs excluding a fixed minor. Thisresult is used to prove Wagner's conjecture and provide a polynomial time algorithm for thedisjoint paths problem when the number of the terminals is fixed (ie; the Graph MinorAlgorithm). However; both results require the full power of the Graph Minor Theory; ie; thestructure theorem. In this paper; we show that this is not true in the latter case. Namely; weprovide a new and much simpler proof of the correctness of the Graph Minor Algorithm.Specifically; we prove the" Unique Linkage Theorem" without using Graph Minors structuretheorem. The new argument; in addition to being simpler; is much shorter; cutting the proofby at least 200 pages.,Proceedings of the forty-second ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2010,53
Any 7-chromatic graphs has k 7 or k 4; 4 as a minor,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bjarne Toft,In 1943; Hadwiger made the conjecture that every k-chromatic graph has a K k-minor. Thisconjecture is; perhaps; the most interesting conjecture of all graph theory. It is well knownthat the case k= 5 is equivalent to the Four Colour Theorem; as proved by Wagner [39] in1937. About 60 years later; Robertson; Seymour and Thomas [29] proved that the case k= 6is also equivalent to the Four Colour Theorem. So far; the cases k≥ 7 are still open and wehave little hope to verify even the case k= 7 up to now. In fact; there are only a few theoremsconcerning 7-chromatic graphs; eg [17]. In this paper; we prove the deep result stated in thetitle; without using the Four Colour Theorem [1; 2; 28]. This result verifies the first unsettledcase m= 6 of the (m; 1)-Minor Conjecture which is a weaker form of Hadwiger's Conjectureand a special case of a more general conjecture of Chartrand et al.[8] in 1971 and …,Combinatorica,2005,53
Fast and Accurate Influence Maximization on Large Networks with Pruned Monte-Carlo Simulations.,Naoto Ohsaka; Takuya Akiba; Yuichi Yoshida; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Influence maximization is a problem to find small sets of highly influentialindividuals in a social network to maximize the spread of influence under stochastic cascademodels of propagation. Although the problem has been well-studied; it is still highlychallenging to find solutions of high quality in large-scale networks of the day. While Monte-Carlo-simulation-based methods produce near-optimal solutions with a theoreticalguarantee; they are prohibitively slow for large graphs. As a result; many heuristic methodswithout any theoretical guarantee have been developed; but all of them substantiallycompromise solution quality. To address this issue; we propose a new method for theinfluence maximization problem. Unlike other recent heuristic methods; the proposedmethod is a Monte-Carlo-simulationbased method; and thus it consistently produces …,AAAI,2014,52
On Sufficient Degree Conditions for a Graph to be $ k $-linked,Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi; Alexandr Kostochka; Gexin Yu,Abstract A graph is $ k $-linked if for every list of $2 k $ vertices $\{s_1;{\ldots}\; s_k;t_1;{\ldots}\; t_k\} $; there exist internally disjoint paths $ P_1;{\ldots}\; P_k $ such that each $P_i $ is an $ s_i; t_i $-path. We consider degree conditions and connectivity conditionssufficient to force a graph to be $ k $-linked.,Combinatorics; Probability and Computing,2006,51
Linear connectivity forces large complete bipartite minors,Thomas Böhme; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; John Maharry; Bojan Mohar,Abstract Let a be an integer. It is proved that for any s and k; there exists a constant N= N (s;k; a) such that every 31 2 (a+ 1)-connected graph with at least N vertices either contains asubdivision of K a; sk or a minor isomorphic to s disjoint copies of K a; k. In fact; we provethat connectivity 3 a+ 2 and minimum degree at least 31 2 (a+ 1)− 3 are enough while theother conditions cannot be weakened. When s= 1 and k= a; this implies that every 31 2 (a+1)-connected graph with at least N (a) vertices has a K a-minor. This is the first result wherea linear lower bound on the connectivity in terms of the parameter a forces a K a-minor. Thisresolves a conjecture proposed by Mader [W.

Shortest-path queries for complex networks: exploiting low tree-width outside the core,Takuya Akiba; Christian Sommer; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We present new and improved methods for efficient shortest-path query processing.Our methods are tailored to work for two specific classes of graphs: graphs with small tree-width and complex networks. Seemingly unrelated at first glance; these two classes ofgraphs have some commonalities: complex networks are known to have a core--fringestructure with a dense core and a tree-like fringe. Our main contributions are efficientalgorithms and data structures on three different levels. First; we provide two new methodsfor graphs with small but not necessarily constant tree-width. Our methods achieve newtradeoffs between space and query time. Second; we present an improved tree-decomposition-based method for complex networks; utilizing the methods for graphs withsmall tree-width. Third; we extend our method to handle the highly inter-connected core …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,46
Linear-space approximate distance oracles for planar; bounded-genus and minor-free graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Philip N Klein; Christian Sommer,Abstract A (1+ ε)–approximate distance oracle for a graph is a data structure that supportsapproximate point-to-point shortest-path-distance queries. The most relevant measures for adistance-oracle construction are: space; query time; and preprocessing time. There arestrong distance-oracle constructions known for planar graphs (Thorup; JACM'04) and;subsequently; minor-excluded graphs (Abraham and Gavoille; PODC'06). However; theserequire Ω(ϵ^-1n\lgn) space for n–node graphs. In this paper; for planar graphs; bounded-genus graphs; and minor-excluded graphs we give distance-oracle constructions thatrequire only O (n) space. The big O hides only a fixed constant; independent of ε andindependent of genus or size of an excluded minor. The preprocessing times for ourdistance oracle are also faster than those for the previously known constructions. For …,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,2011,43

Many such problems can be mapped ontoground-state-search problems of the Ising model; and various artificial spin systems are nowemerging as promising approaches. However; physical Ising machines have suffered fromlimited numbers of spin-spin couplings because of implementations based on localizedspins; resulting in severe scalability problems. We report a 2;000-spin network with all-to-allspin-spin couplings. Using a measurement and feedback scheme; we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum cut problemson arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2;000 nodes.

Optimal budget allocation: Theoretical guarantee and efficient algorithm,Tasuku Soma; Naonori Kakimura; Kazuhiro Inaba; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We consider the budget allocation problem over bipartite influence model proposedby Alon et al.(Alon et al.; 2012). This problem can be viewed as the well-known influencemaximization problem with budget constraints. We first show that this problem and its muchmore general form fall into a general setting; namely the monotone submodular functionmaximization over integer lattice subject to a knapsack constraint. Our framework includesAlon et al.'s model; even with a competitor and with cost.,International Conference on Machine Learning,2014,40
A linear time algorithm for the induced disjoint paths problem in planar graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract In this paper; we consider a problem which we call the induced disjoint pathsproblem (IDPP) for planar graphs. We are given a planar graph G and a collection of vertexpairs {(s 1; t 1);…;(sk; tk)}. The objective is to find k paths P 1;…; P k such that P i is a pathfrom si to ti and P i and P j have neither common vertices nor adjacent vertices for anydistinct i; j. This problem setting is a generalization of the disjoint paths problem; since if wesubdivide each edge; then desired disjoint paths would be induced disjoint paths. Theproblem is motivated by not only the disjoint paths problem but also the recognition of aninduced subgraph. The latter has been developed in recent years; and this is actuallyconnected to the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem (Chudnovsky; et al.; 2006)[1]; and therecognition of the perfect graphs (Chudnovsky; et al.; 2005)[2]. Our main result in this …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2012,39
Three-coloring triangle-free planar graphs in linear time,Zdeněk Dvořák; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Robin Thomas,Abstract Grötzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph is 3-colorable; andseveral relatively simple proofs of this fact were provided by Thomassen and other authors. Itis easy to convert these proofs into quadratic-time algorithms to find a 3-coloring; but it is notclear how to find such a coloring in linear time (Kowalik used a nontrivial data structure toconstruct an O (n log n) algorithm). We design a linear-time algorithm to find a 3-coloring of agiven triangle-free planar graph. The algorithm avoids using any complex data structures;which makes it easy to implement. As a by-product; we give a yet simpler proof of Grötzsch'stheorem.,ACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG),2011,39
A separator theorem in minor-closed classes,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bruce Reed,It is shown that for each $ t $; there is a separator of size $ O (t\sqrt {n}) $ in any $ n $-vertexgraph $ G $ with no $ K_t $-minor. This settles a conjecture of Alon; Seymour and Thomas(J. Amer. Math. Soc.; 1990 and STOC'90); and generalizes a result of Djidjev (1981); andGilbert; Hutchinson and Tarjan (J. Algorithm; 1984); independently; who proved that everygraph with $ n $ vertices and genus $ g $ has a separator of order $ O (\sqrt {gn}) $; because$ K_t $ has genus $\Omega (t^ 2) $. The bound $ O (t\sqrt {n}) $ is best possible becauseevery 3-regular expander graph with $ n $ vertices is a graph with no $ K_t $-minor for $ t=cn^{1/2} $; and with no separator of size $ dn $ for appropriately chosen positive constants $c; d $. In addition; we give an $ O (n^ 2) $ time algorithm to obtain such a separator; andthen give a sketch how to obtain such a separator in $ O (n^{1+\epsilon}) $ time for any …,Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS); 2010 51st Annual IEEE Symposium on,2010,39
The minimum k-way cut of bounded size is fixed-parameter tractable,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Mikkel Thorup,We consider the minimum k-way cut problem for unweighted undirected graphs with a sizebound s on the number of cut edges allowed. Thus we seek to remove as few edges aspossible so as to split a graph into k components; or report that this requires cutting morethan s edges. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with the standardparameterization in terms of the solution size s. More precisely; for s= O (1); we present aquadratic time algorithm. Moreover; we present a much easier linear time algorithm forplanar graphs and bounded genus graphs. Our tractability result stands in contrast to knownW [1] hardness of related problems. Without the size bound; Downey et al.[2003] proved thatthe minimum k-way cut problem is W [1] hard with parameter k; and this is even for simpleunweighted graphs. Downey et al. asked about the status for planar graphs. We get linear …,Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS); 2011 IEEE 52nd Annual Symposium on,2011,38
Packing cycles through prescribed vertices,Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Dániel Marx,Abstract The well-known theorem of Erdős and Pósa says that a graph G has either k vertex-disjoint cycles or a vertex set X of order at most f (k) such that G∖ X is a forest. Starting withthis result; there are many results concerning packing and covering cycles in graph theoryand combinatorial optimization. In this paper; we generalize Erdős–Pósaʼs result to cyclesthat are required to go through a set S of vertices. Given an integer k and a vertex subset S(possibly unbounded number of vertices) in a given graph G; we prove that either G has kvertex-disjoint cycles; each of which contains at least one vertex of S; or G has a vertex set Xof order at most f (k)= 40 k 2 log 2 k such that G∖ X has no cycle that intersects S.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2011,38
Algorithms for finding an induced cycle in planar graphs and bounded genus graphs,Yusuke Kobayashi; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract In this paper; we consider the problem of finding an induced cycle passing throughk given vertices; which we call the induced cycle problem. The significance of findinginduced cycles stems from the fact that precise characterization of perfect graphs wouldrequire structures of graphs without an odd induced cycle; and its complement. There hasbeen huge progress in the recent years; especially; the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecturewas solved in [6]. Concerning recognition of perfect graphs; there had been a long-standingopen problem for detecting an odd hole and its complement; and finally this was solved in[4]. Unfortunately; the problem of finding an induced cycle passing through two givenvertices is NP-complete in a general graph [2]. However; if the input graph is constrained tobe planar and k is fixed; then the induced cycle problem can be solved in polynomial time …,Proceedings of the twentieth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2009,38
Contraction decomposition in H-minor-free graphs and algorithmic applications,Erik D Demaine; MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We prove that any graph excluding a fixed minor can have its edges partitioned intoa desired number k of color classes such that contracting the edges in any one color classresults in a graph of treewidth linear in k. This result is a natural finale to research incontraction decomposition; generalizing previous such decompositions for planar andbounded-genus graphs; and solving the main open problem in this area (posed at SODA2007). Our decomposition can be computed in polynomial time; resulting in a generalframework for approximation algorithms; particularly PTASs (with k∼ 1/ε); and fixed-parameter algorithms; for problems closed under contractions in graphs excluding a fixedminor. For example; our approximation framework gives the first PTAS for TSP in weighted H-minor-free graphs; solving a decade-old open problem of Grohe; and gives another fixed …,Proceedings of the forty-third annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2011,37

Graph and map isomorphism and all polyhedral embeddings in linear time,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bojan Mohar,Abstract For every surface S (orientable or non-orientable); we give a linear time algorithm totest the graph isomorphism of two graphs; one of which admits an embedding of face-widthat least 3 into S. This improves a previously known algorithm whose time complexity is n O(g); where g is the genus of S. This is the first algorithm for which the degree of polynomial inthe time complexity does not depend on g. The above result is based on two linear timealgorithms; each of which solves a problem that is of independent interest. The first of theseproblems is the following one. Let S be a fixed surface. Given a graph G and an integer k≥3; we want to find an embedding of G in S of face-width at least k; or conclude that such anembedding does not exist. It is known that this problem is NP-hard when the surface is notfixed. Moreover; if there is an embedding; the algorithm can give all embeddings of face …,Proceedings of the fortieth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2008,34
Linear min-max relation between the treewidth of H-minor-free graphs and its largest grid,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,A key theorem in algorithmic graph-minor theory is a min-max relation between the treewidthof a graph and its largest grid minor. This min-max relation is a keystone of the Graph MinorTheory of Robertson and Seymour; which ultimately proves Wagner's Conjecture about thestructure of minor-closed graph properties. In 2008; Demaine and Hajiaghayi proved aremarkable linear min-max relation for graphs excluding any fixed minor H: every H-minor-free graph of treewidth at least c_H r has an r times r-grid minor for some constant c_H.However; as they pointed out; there is still a major problem left in this theorem. The problemis that their proof heavily depends on Graph Minor Theory; most of which lacks explicitbounds and is believed to have very large bounds. Hence c_H is not explicitly given in thepaper and therefore this result is usually not strong enough to derive efficient algorithms …,STACS'12 (29th Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science),2012,33

Algorithmic graph minor theory: Improved grid minor bounds and Wagner’s contraction,Erik D Demaine; MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We explore three important avenues of research in algorithmic graph-minor theory;which all stem from a key min-max relation between the treewidth of a graph and its largestgrid minor. This min-max relation is a keystone of the Graph Minor Theory of Robertson andSeymour; which ultimately proves Wagner's Conjecture about the structure of minor-closedgraph properties. First; we obtain the only known polynomial min-max relation for graphsthat do not exclude any fixed minor; namely; map graphs and power graphs. Second; weobtain explicit (and improved) bounds on the min-max relation for an important class ofgraphs excluding a minor; namely; K 3; k-minor-free graphs; using new techniques that donot rely on Graph Minor Theory. These two avenues lead to faster fixed-parameteralgorithms for two families of graph problems; called minor-bidimensional and contraction …,Algorithmica,2009,31
Planarity allowing few error vertices in linear time,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,We show that for every fixed $ k $; there is a linear time algorithm that decides whether ornot a given graph has a vertex set $ X $ of order at most $ k $ such that $ GX $ is planar (wecall this class of graphs {\it $ k $-apex}); and if this is the case; computes a drawing of thegraph in the plane after deleting at most $ k $ vertices. In fact; in this case; we shalldetermine the minimum value $ l\leq k $ such that after deleting some $ l $ vertices; theresulting graph is planar. If this is not the case; then the algorithm gives rise to a minor whichis not $ k $-apex and is minimal with this property. This answers the question posed byCabello and Mohar in 2005; and by Kawarabayashi and Reed (STOC'07); respectively. Notethat the case $ k= 0$ is the planarity case. Thus our algorithm can be viewed as ageneralization of the seminal result by Hopcroft and Tarjan (J. ACM 1974); which …,Foundations of Computer Science; 2009.

Non-zero disjoint cycles in highly connected group labelled graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Paul Wollan,Abstract Let G=(V; E) be an oriented graph whose edges are labelled by the elements of agroup Γ. A cycle C in G has non-zero weight if for a given orientation of the cycle; when weadd the labels of the forward directed edges and subtract the labels of the reverse directededges; the total is non-zero. We are specifically interested in the maximum number of vertexdisjoint non-zero cycles. We prove that if G is a Γ-labelled graph and G¯ is thecorresponding undirected graph; then if G¯ is 31 2 k-connected; either G has k disjoint non-zero cycles or it has a vertex set Q of order at most 2 k-2 such that GQ has no non-zerocycles. The bound “2 k-2” is best possible. This generalizes the results due to Thomassen(The Erdős–Pósa property for odd cycles in graphs with large connectivity; Combinatorica21 (2001) 321–333.); Rautenbach and Reed (The Erdős–Pósa property for odd cycles in …,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2006,30
Path factors in cubic graphs,Ken‐ichi Kawarabayashi; Haruhide Matsuda; Yoshiaki Oda; Katsuhiro Ota,Abstract Let ℱ be a set of connected graphs. An ℱ-factor of a graph is its spanning subgraphsuch that each component is isomorphic to one of the members in ℱ. Let P k denote the pathof order k. Akiyama and Kano have conjectured that every 3-connected cubic graph of orderdivisible by 3 has a {P 3}-factor. Recently; Kaneko gave a necessary and sufficient conditionfor a graph to have a {P 3; P 4; P 5}-factor. As a corollary; he proved that every cubic graphhas a {P 3; P 4; P 5}-factor. In this paper; we prove that every 2-connected cubic graph oforder at least six has a {P k∣ k≥; 6}-factor; and hence has a {P 3; P 4}-factor.© 2002 WileyPeriodicals; Inc.

Contractible edges and triangles in k-connected graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract It is proved that if G is a k-connected graph which does not contain K− 4; then G hasan edge e or a triangle T such that the graph obtained from G by connecting e or bycontracting T is still k-connected.

A simpler algorithm and shorter proof for the graph minor decomposition,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Paul Wollan,Abstract At the core of the Robertson-Seymour theory of graph minors lies a powerfuldecomposition theorem which captures; for any fixed graph H; the common structuralfeatures of all the graphs which do not contain H as a minor. Robertson and Seymour usedthis result to prove Wagner's Conjecture that finite graphs are well-quasi-ordered under thegraph minor relation; as well as give a polynomial time algorithm for the disjoint pathsproblem when the number of the terminals is fixed. The theorem has since found numerousapplications; both in graph theory and theoretical computer science. The original proof runsmore than 400 pages and the techniques used are highly non-trivial. In this paper; we give asimplified algorithm for finding the decomposition based on a new constructive proof of thedecomposition theorem for graphs excluding a fixed minor H.

Immersing small complete graphs,Matt DeVoss; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bojan Mohar; Haruko Okamura,Abstract Following in the spirit of the Hadwiger and Hajós conjectures; Abu-Khzam andLangston have conjectured that every k-chromatic graph contains an immersion of K k. Theyproved this for k≤ 4. Much before that; Lescure and Meyniel [F. Lescure and H. Meyniel; Ona problem upon configurations contained in graphs with given chromatic number; Graphtheory in memory of GA Dirac (Sandbjerg; 1985); 325− 331; Ann.

We give a simple proof of this result. This; in particular; provesthe conjecture of Abu-Khzam and Langston for every k≤ 7.,Ars Mathematica Contemporanea,2010,27
An (almost) linear time algorithm for odd cycles transversal,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bruce Reed,Abstract We consider the following problem; which is called the odd cycles transversalproblem. Input: A graph G and an integer k. Output: A vertex set X∊ V (G) with| X|≤ k suchthat G–X is bipartite.

Thisimproves the time complexity of the algorithm by Reed; Smith and Vetta [29] who gave an O(nm) time algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm also implies the edge version of theproblem; ie; there is an edge set X′∊ E (G) such that G–X′ is bipartite.

A pair of forbidden subgraphs and perfect matchings,Shinya Fujita; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Claudio Leonardo Lucchesi; Katsuhiro Ota; Michael D Plummer; Akira Saito,Abstract In this paper; we study the relationship between forbidden subgraphs and theexistence of a matching. Let H be a set of connected graphs; each of which has three ormore vertices. A graph G is said to be H-free if no graph in H is an induced subgraph of G.We completely characterize the set H such that every connected H-free graph of sufficientlylarge even order has a perfect matching in the following cases.(1) Every graph in H istriangle-free.(2) H consists of two graphs (ie a pair of forbidden subgraphs). A matching M ina graph of odd order is said to be a near-perfect matching if every vertex of G but one isincident with an edge of M. We also characterize H such that every H-free graph ofsufficiently large odd order has a near-perfect matching in the above cases.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2006,27
Computing personalized PageRank quickly by exploiting graph structures,Takanori Maehara; Takuya Akiba; Yoichi Iwata; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We propose a new scalable algorithm that can compute Personalized PageRank(PPR) very quickly. The Power method is a state-of-the-art algorithm for computing exactPPR; however; it requires many iterations. Thus reducing the number of iterations is themain challenge. We achieve this by exploiting graph structures of web graphs and socialnetworks. The convergence of our algorithm is very fast. In fact; it requires up to 7.5 timesfewer iterations than the Power method and is up to five times faster in actual computationtime.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,26
Hadwiger's conjecture is decidable,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bruce Reed,Abstract The famous Hadwiger's conjecture asserts that every graph with no K t-minor is (t-1)-colorable. The case t= 5 is known to be equivalent to the Four Color Theorem by Wagner;and the case t= 6 is settled by Robertson; Seymour and Thomas. So far the cases t≥ 7 arewide open. In this paper; we prove the following two theorems: There is an O (n 2) algorithmto decide whether or not a given graph G satisfies Hadwiger's conjecture for the case t.Every minimal counterexample to Hadwiger's conjecture for the case t has at most f (t)vertices for some explicit bound f (t). The bound f (t) is at most pppt; where p= 10 10 10 t. Ourproofs for both results use the well-known result by Thomassen [46] for 5-list-coloring planargraphs; together with some results (but not the decomposition theorem) of Graph Minors in[36].

Domination in a graph with a 2‐factor,Ken‐ichi Kawarabayashi; Michael D Plummer; Akira Saito,Abstract Let γ (G) be the domination number of a graph G. Reed 6 proved that every graph Gof minimum degree at least three satisfies γ (G)≤(3/8)| G|; and conjectured that a betterupper bound can be obtained for cubic graphs. In this paper; we prove that a 2-edge-connected cubic graph G of girth at least 3k satisfies equation image. For equation image;this gives equation image; which is better than Reed's bound. In order to obtain this bound;we actually prove a more general theorem for graphs with a 2-factor.© 2006 WileyPeriodicals; Inc. J Graph Theory 52: 1–6; 2006,Journal of Graph Theory,2006,26
Fast shortest-path distance queries on road networks by pruned highway labeling,Takuya Akiba; Yoichi Iwata; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yuki Kawata,Abstract We propose a new labeling method for shortest-path and distance queries on roadnetworks. We present a new framework (ie data structure and query algorithm) referred to ashighway-based labelings and a preprocessing algorithm for it named pruned highwaylabeling. Our proposed method has several appealing features from different aspects in theliterature. Indeed; we take advantages of theoretical analysis of the seminal result by Thorupfor distance oracles; more detailed structures of real road networks; and the pruned labelingalgorithm that conducts pruned Dijkstra's algorithm. The experimental results show that theproposed method is comparable to the previous state-of-the-art labeling method in bothquery time and in data size; while our main improvement is that the preprocessing time ismuch faster.,*,2014,25
A simple algorithm for the graph minor decomposition: logic meets structural graph theory,Martin Grohe; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bruce Reed,Abstract A key result of Robertson and Seymour's graph minor theory is a structure theoremstating that all graphs excluding some fixed graph as a minor have a tree decomposition intopieces that are almost embeddable in a fixed surface. Most algorithmic applications of graphminor theory rely on an algorithmic version of this result. However; the known algorithms forcomputing such graph minor decompositions heavily rely on the very long and complicatedproofs of the existence of such decompositions; essentially they retrace these proofs andshow that all steps are algorithmic.,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2013,25
On-line Ramsey theory for bounded degree graphs,Jane Butterfield; Tracy Grauman; William B Kinnersley; Kevin G Milans; Christopher Stocker; Douglas B West,Abstract When graph Ramsey theory is viewed as a game;“Painter” 2-colors the edges of agraph presented by “Builder”. Builder wins if every coloring has a monochromatic copy of afixed graph G. In the on-line version; iteratively; Builder presents one edge and Painter mustcolor it. Builder must keep the presented graph in a class H. Builder wins the game (G; H) if amonochromatic copy of G can be forced. The on-line degree Ramsey number R∆(G) is theleast k such that Builder wins (G; H) when H is the class of graphs with maximum degree atmost k. Our results include: 1) R∆(G)≤ 3 if and only if G is a linear forest or each componentlies inside K1; 3. 2) R∆(G)≥∆(G)+ t− 1; where t= maxuv∈ E (G) min {d (u); d (v)}. 3) R∆(G)≤d1+ d2− 1 for a tree G; where d1 and d2 are two largest vertex degrees. 4) 4≤ R∆(Cn)≤ 5;with R∆(Cn)= 4 except for finitely many odd values of n. 5) R∆(G)≤ 6 when∆(G)≤ 2.,the electronic journal of combinatorics,2011,25
Odd cycle packing,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bruce Reed,Abstract We consider the following problem; which is called the odd cycle packing problem.Input: A graph $ G $ with n vertices and m edges; and an integer k. Output: k vertex disjointodd cycles. We also consider the edge disjoint case; and the node-and arc-disjoint directedcase. This problem is known to be NP-hard; even for planar graphs; if k is part of input. In thispaper; we first present the integrality gap and hardness results for these problems. We provethat the integrality gap of the standard LP-relaxation of the odd cycle packing problem is Θ(√ n). This result is obtained by giving an algorithm to compute an odd cycle packing; whichgives rise to an O (√ n) approximating algorithm for the fractional odd cycle packingproblem (this gives rise to an upper bound); and by showing that there is a graph G such thatthere is an O (√ n) half-integral odd cycle packing in G; but there are no two disjoint odd …,Proceedings of the forty-second ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2010,25

Estimating local intrinsic dimensionality,Laurent Amsaleg; Oussama Chelly; Teddy Furon; Stephane Girard; Michael E Houle; Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi; Michael Nett,Abstract This paper is concerned with the estimation of a local measure of intrinsicdimensionality (ID) recently proposed by Houle. The local model can be regarded as anextension of Karger and Ruhl's expansion dimension to a statistical setting in which thedistribution of distances to a query point is modeled in terms of a continuous randomvariable. This form of intrinsic dimensionality can be particularly useful in search;classification; outlier detection; and other contexts in machine learning; databases; and datamining; as it has been shown to be equivalent to a measure of the discriminative power ofsimilarity functions. Several estimators of local ID are proposed and analyzed based onextreme value theory; using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); the method of moments(MoM); probability weighted moments (PWM); and regularly varying functions (RV).

Improvements of the theorem of Duchet and Meyniel on Hadwiger's conjecture,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Michael D Plummer; Bjarne Toft,Abstract Since χ (G)· α (G)⩾ n (G); Hadwiger's conjecture implies that any graph G has thecomplete graph K⌈ n/α⌉ as a minor; where n= n (G) is the number of vertices of G and α= α(G) is the maximum number of independent vertices in G. Duchet and Meyniel [Ann. DiscreteMath. 13 (1982) 71–74] proved that any G has K⌈ n/(2 α-1)⌉ as a minor. For α (G)= 2 G hasK⌈ n/3⌉ as a minor. Paul Seymour asked if it is possible to obtain a larger constant than 1 3for this case. To our knowledge this has not yet been achieved. Our main goal here is toshow that the constant 1/(2 α-1) of Duchet and Meyniel can be improved to a larger constant;depending on α; for all α⩾ 3. Our method does not work for α= 2 and we only present someobservations on this case.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2005,24
Vertices of degree 5 in a contraction critically 5-connected graph,Kiyoshi Ando; Atsushi Kaneko; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract. An edge of ak-connected graph is said to be k-contractible if the contraction of theedge results in ak-connected graph. A k-connected graph with no k-contractible edge is saidto be contraction critically k-connected. We prove that a contraction critically 5-connectedgraph on n vertices has at least n/5 vertices of degree 5. We also show that; for a graph Gand an integer k greater than 4; there exists a contraction critically k-connected graph whichhas G as its induced subgraph.,Graphs and Combinatorics,2005,24

The same conclusion does not hold when k is even. This result is ageneralization of the famous theorem of Thomassen [J.

We say that G is parity-k-linked if G is k-linked and; in addition; the paths P1;…; P k can be chosen such that the parities of their length are prescribed. Thomassen [22]was the first to prove the existence of a function f (k) such that every f (k)-connected graph isparity-k-linked if the deletion of any 4 k-3 vertices leaves a nonbipartite graph. In this paper;we will show that the above statement is still valid for 50 k-connected graphs. This is the firstresult that connectivity which is a linear function of k guarantees the Erdős-Pósa type resultfor parity-k-linked graphs.,Combinatorica,2009,23
Development of a new utility-connected photovoltaic inverter line back,M Yamaguchi; K Kawarabayashi; T Takuma; Y Ueda; Y Yamano,A new utility-connected photovoltaic inverter called" LINE BACK"; which is suited to small-scale photovoltaic generation systems for use in private households; has been developed.The inverter converts DC power generated by rooftop photovoltaic cells into AC power; andprovides it to house loads connected to the utility line. When photovoltaic power is greaterthan the loads; the excess power is fed to the utility line through a reverse power flow. Theinverter has several special functions such as a utility protection relay; maximum power pointtracking (MPPT) control; automatic operation with photovoltaic power; detection of islandingoperation; and utility voltage compensation for reverse power flow.

Erdös-pósa property and its algorithmic applications: parity constraints; subset feedback set; and subset packing,Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract The well-known Erdös-Pósa theorem says that for any integer k and any graph G;either G contains k vertex-disjoint cycles or a vertex set X of order at most c· k log k (for someconstant c) such that GX is a forest. Thomassen [39] extended this result to the even cycles;but on the other hand; it is well-known that this theorem is no longer true for the odd cycles.However; Reed [31] proved that this theorem still holds if we relax k vertex-disjoint oddcycles to k odd cycles with each vertex in at most two of them. These theorems initiate manyresearches in both graph theory and theoretical computer science. In the graph theory side;our problem setting is that we are given a graph and a vertex set S; and we want to extendall the above results to cycles that are required to go through a subset of S; ie; each cyclecontains at least one vertex in S (such a cycle is called an S-cycle).

Approximating the list-chromatic number and the chromatic number in minor-closed and odd-minor-closed classes of graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bojan Mohar,Abstract It is well-known (Feige and Kilian [24]; Håstad [39]) that approximating thechromatic number within a factor of n 1-ε cannot be done in polynomial time for ε> 0; unlesscoRP= NP. Computing the list-chromatic number is much harder than determining thechromatic number. It is known that the problem of deciding if the list-chromatic number is k;where k≥ 3; is Π 2 p-complete [37]. In this paper; we focus on minor-closed and odd-minor-closed families of graphs. In doing that; we may as well consider only graphs without K k-minors and graphs without odd K k-minors for a fixed value of k; respectively. Our mainresults are that there is a polynomial time approximation algorithm for the list-chromaticnumber of graphs without K k-minors and there is a polynomial time approximation algorithmfor the chromatic number of graphs without odd-K k-minors.

It has been proved for k⩽ 6; and is still open for every k⩾ 7. It is not even known ifthere exists an absolute constant c such that any ck-chromatic graph has K k as a minor.Motivated by this problem; we show that there exists a computable constant f (k) such thatany graph G without K k as a minor admits a vertex partition V 1;…; V⌈ 15.5 k⌉ such thateach component in the subgraph induced on V i (i⩾ 1) has at most f (k) vertices. This result isalso extended to list colorings for which we allow monochromatic components of order atmost f (k). When f (k)= 1; this is a coloring of G. Hence this is a relaxation of coloring and thisis the first result in this direction.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2007,21

Embedding and canonizing graphs of bounded genus in logspace,Michael Elberfeld; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Graph embeddings of bounded Euler genus (that means; embeddings withbounded orientable or nonorientable genus) help to design time-efficient algorithms formany graph problems. Since linear-time algorithms are known to compute embeddings ofany bounded Euler genus; one can always assume to work with embedded graphs and;thus; obtain fast algorithms for many problems on any class of graphs of bounded Eulergenus. Problems on graphs of bounded Euler genus are also important from the perspectiveof finding space-efficient algorithms; mostly focusing on problems related to finding pathsand matchings in graphs. So far; known space-bounded approaches needed the severeassumption that an embedding is given as part of the input since no space-efficientembedding procedure for nonplanar graphs was known.,Proceedings of the forty-sixth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2014,19

We first present a new combinatorial algorithm using Õ (n 4/11)colors. This is the first combinatorial improvement since Blum's Õ (n 3/8) bound fromFOCS'90. Like Blum's algorithm; our new algorithm composes immediately with recent semi-definite programming approaches; and improves the best bound for the polynomial timealgorithm for the coloring of 3-colorable graphs from O (n 0.2072) colors by Chlamtac fromFOCS'07 to O (n 0.2049) colors.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2017,18
Dynamic influence analysis in evolving networks,Naoto Ohsaka; Takuya Akiba; Yuichi Yoshida; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We propose the first real-time fully-dynamic index data structure designed forinfluence analysis on evolving networks. With this aim; we carefully redesign the datastructure of the state-of-the-art sketching method introduced by Borgs et al.; and constructcorresponding update algorithms. Using this index; we present algorithms for two kinds ofqueries; influence estimation and influence maximization; which are strongly motivated bypractical applications; such as viral marketing. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis;which guarantees the non-degeneracy of the solution accuracy after an arbitrary number ofupdates. Furthermore; we introduce a reachability-tree-based technique and a skippingmethod; which greatly reduce the time consumption required for edge/vertex deletions andvertex additions; respectively; and counter-based random number generators; which …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,17
Deterministic global minimum cut of a simple graph in near-linear time,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Mikkel Thorup,Abstract We present a deterministic near-linear time algorithm that computes the edge-connectivity and finds a minimum cut for a simple undirected unweighted graph G with nvertices and m edges. This is the first o (mn) time deterministic algorithm for the problem. Innear-linear time we can also construct the classic cactus representation of all minimum cuts.,Proceedings of the forty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2015,17

Some remarks on the odd Hadwiger’s conjecture,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Zi-Xia Song,Abstract We say that H has an odd complete minor of order at least l if there are l vertexdisjoint trees in H such that every two of them are joined by an edge; and in addition; all thevertices of trees are two-colored in such a way that the edges within the trees arebichromatic; but the edges between trees are monochromatic. Gerards and Seymourconjectured that if a graph has no odd complete minor of order l; then it is (l− 1)-colorable.This is substantially stronger than the well-known conjecture of Hadwiger. Recently; Geelenet al. proved that there exists a constant c such that any graph with no odd K k-minor is ck√log k-colorable. However; it is not known if there exists an absolute constant c such that anygraph with no odd K k-minor is ck-colorable. Motivated by these facts; in this paper; we shallfirst prove that; for any k; there exists a constant f (k) such that every (496 k+ 13) …,Combinatorica,2007,17
Subgraphs of graphs on surfaces with high representativity,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Atsuhiro Nakamoto; Katsuhiro Ota,Abstract Let G be a 3-connected graph with n vertices on a non-spherical closed surface F k2 of Euler genus k with sufficiently large representativity. In this paper; we first study a newcutting method which produces a spanning planar subgraph of G with a certain goodproperty. This is used to show that such a graph G has a spanning 4-tree with at most max{2k− 5; 0} vertices of degree 4. Using this result; we prove that for any integer t; if n issufficiently large; then G has a connected subgraph with t vertices whose degree sum is atmost 8t− 1. We also give a nearly sharp bound for the projective plane; torus and Kleinbottle. Furthermore; using our cutting method; we prove that a 3-connected graph G on F k 2with high representativity has a 3-walk in which at most max {2k− 4; 0} vertices are visitedthree times; and an 8-covering with at most max {4k− 8; 0} vertices of degree 7 or 8 …,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2003,17
Joint Word Representation Learning Using a Corpus and a Semantic Lexicon.,Danushka Bollegala; Mohammed Alsuhaibani; Takanori Maehara; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Methods for learning word representations using large text corpora have receivedmuch attention lately due to their impressive performance in numerous natural languageprocessing (NLP) tasks such as; semantic similarity measurement; and word analogydetection. Despite their success; these datadriven word representation learning methods donot consider the rich semantic relational structure between words in a cooccurring context.On the other hand; already much manual effort has gone into the construction of semanticlexicons such as the WordNet that represent the meanings of words by defining the variousrelationships that exist among the words in a language. We consider the question; can weimprove the word representations learnt using a corpora by integrating the knowledge fromsemantic lexicons?. For this purpose; we propose a joint word representation learning …,AAAI,2016,16
Choosability of planar graphs of girth 5,Zdenek Dvorák; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract: Thomassen proved that any plane graph of girth 5 is list-colorable from any listassignment such that all vertices have lists of size two or three and the vertices with list ofsize two are all incident with the outer face and form an independent set. We present astrengthening of this result; relaxing the constraint on the vertices with list of size two.

Recognizing a totally odd K 4-subdivision; parity 2-disjoint rooted paths and a parity cycle through specified elements,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Zhentao Li; Bruce Reed,Abstract A totally odd K 4-subdivision is a subdivision of K 4 where each subdivided edgehas odd length. The recognition of a totally odd K 4-subdivision plays an important role inboth graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Sewell and Trotter [53]; Zang [63] andThomassen [60] independently conjectured the existence of a polynomial time recognitionalgorithm.

On the connectivity of minimum and minimal counterexamples to Hadwiger's Conjecture,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract The main result of this paper is the following: Any minimal counterexample toHadwiger's Conjecture for the k-chromatic case is⌈ 2 k 27⌉-connected. This improves theprevious known bound due to Mader [W. Mader; Über trennende Eckenmengen inhomomorphiekritischen Graphen; Math. Ann. 175 (1968) 243–252]; which says that anyminimal counterexample to Hadwiger's Conjecture for the k-chromatic case is 7-connectedfor k⩾ 7. This is the first result on the vertex connectivity of minimal counterexamples toHadwiger's Conjecture for general k. Consider the following problem: There exists aconstant c such that any ck-chromatic graph has a K k-minor. This problem is still open; buttogether with the recent result in [T. Böhme; K.

From the plane to higher surfaces,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Carsten Thomassen,Abstract We show that Grötzschʼs theorem extends to all higher surfaces in the sense thatevery triangle-free graph on a surface of Euler genus g becomes 3-colorable after deleting aset of at most 1000⋅ g⋅ f (g) vertices where f (g) is the smallest edge-width whichguarantees a graph of Euler genus g and girth 5 to be 3-colorable. We derive this result froma general cutting technique which we also use to extend other results on planar graphs tohigher surfaces in the same spirit; even after deleting only 1000g vertices. These include the5-list-color theorem; results on arboricity; and various types of colorings; and decompositiontheorems of planar graphs into two graphs with prescribed degeneracy properties. It is notknown if the 4-color theorem extends in this way.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2012,15
Fixed-parameter tractability for the subset feedback set problem and the s-cycle packing problem,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract We investigate generalizations of the following well-known problems in theframework of parameterized complexity: the feedback set problem and the cycle packingproblem. Our problem setting is that we are given a graph and a vertex set S called“terminals”. Our purpose here is to consider the following problems: 1. The feedback setproblem with respect to the terminals S. We call it the subset feedback set problem. 2. Thecycle packing problem with respect to the terminals S; ie; each cycle has to contain a vertexin S (such a cycle is called an S-cycle). We call it the S-cycle packing problem. We give thefirst fixed parameter algorithms for the two problems. Namely; 1. For fixed k; we can eitherfind a vertex set X of size k such that G− X has no S-cycle; or conclude that such a vertex setdoes not exist in O (n 2 m) time; where n is the number of vertices of the input graph and …,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2012,15
Breaking o (n 1/2)-approximation algorithms for the edge-disjoint paths problem with congestion two,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract In the maximum edge-disjoint paths problem; we are given a graph and a collectionof pairs of vertices; and the objective is to find the maximum number of pairs that can berouted by edge-disjoint paths. An r-approximation algorithm for this problem is a polynomialtime algorithm that finds at least OPT/r edge-disjoint paths; where OPT is the maximumpossible. Currently; an O (n 1/2)-approximation algorithm is best known for this problemeven if a congestion of two is allowed; ie; each edge is allowed to be used in at most two ofthe paths. In this paper; we give a randomized O (n 3/7• poly (log n))-approximationalgorithm with congestion two. This is the first result that breaks the O (n 1/2)-approximationalgorithm. In particular; we prove the following. 1.

InMSNs mobile devices disseminate content only to the nodes whose subscribed interestmatch it. MSNs are used to improve the coverage and increase capacity as we assume thatpeople in an intermittently connected MSNs are socially-related and tend to co-locate quiteregularly.

Approximation algorithms via structural results for apex-minor-free graphs,Erik D Demaine; MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We develop new structural results for apex-minor-free graphs and show their powerby developing two new approximation algorithms. The first is an additive approximation forcoloring within 2 of the optimal chromatic number; which is essentially best possible; andgeneralizes the seminal result by Thomassen [32] for bounded-genus graphs. This resultalso improves our understanding from an algorithmic point of view of the venerableHadwiger conjecture about coloring H-minor-free graphs. The second approximation resultis a PTAS for unweighted TSP in apex-minor-free graphs; which generalizes PTASs for TSPin planar graphs and bounded-genus graphs [20; 2; 24; 15]. We strengthen the structuralresults from the seminal Graph Minor Theory of Robertson and Seymour in the case of apex-minor-free graphs; showing that apices can be made adjacent only to vortices if we …,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,2009,15

Some forbidden subgraph conditions for a graph to have a k-contractible edge,Kiyoshi Ando; Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract An edge of a k-connected graph is said to be k-contractible if the contraction of theedge results in a k-connected graph. Let K n− stand for the graph obtained from K n byremoving one edge. Let G be a k-connected graph (k⩾ 5). It is known that if either “k is oddand G contains no K 4−= K 2+ 2K 1” or “G contains no K 1+ 2K 2”; then G has a k-contractible edge. In this paper; we prove that if G contains neither K 2+ sK 1 nor K 1+ tK 2with positive integers s; t such that s (t− 1)< k; then G has a k-contractible edge. We alsoprove that if δ (G)⩾ k+ 1 and G contains neither K 5− nor 5K 1+ P 3; then G has a k-contractible edge.,Discrete mathematics,2003,15
Edge-disjoint odd cycles in 4-edge-connected graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract Finding edge-disjoint odd cycles is one of the most important problems in graphtheory; graph algorithm and combinatorial optimization. In fact; it is closely related to the well-known max-cut problem. One of the difficulties of this problem is that the Erdös-Pósaproperty does not hold for odd cycles in general. Motivated by this fact; we prove that for anypositive integer k; there exists an integer f (k) satisfying the following: For any 4-edge-connected graph G=(V; E); either G has edge-disjoint k odd cycles or there exists an edgeset F subseteq E with| F|<= f (k) such that GF is bipartite. We note that the 4-edge-connectivity is best possible in this statement. Similar approach can be applied to analgorithmic question. Suppose that the input graph G is a 4-edge-connected graph with nvertices.

Double-critical graphs and complete minors,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Anders Sune Pedersen; Bjarne Toft,Abstract A connected k-chromatic graph G is double-critical if for all edges uv of G the graphG− u− v is (k− 2)-colourable. The only known double-critical k-chromatic graph is thecomplete k-graph Kk. The conjecture that there are no other doublecritical graphs is aspecial case of a conjecture from 1966; due to Erdos and Lovász. The conjecture has beenverified for k at most 5. We prove for k= 6 and k= 7 that any non-complete double-critical k-chromatic graph is 6-connected and contains a complete k-graph as a minor.,the electronic journal of combinatorics,2010,14
List-color-critical graphs on a fixed surface,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bojan Mohar,Abstract A k-list-assignment for a graph G assigns to each vertex v of G a list L (v) ofadmissible colors; where| L (v)|≥ k. A graph is k-list-colorable (or k-choosable) if it can beproperly colored from the lists for every k-list-assignment. We prove the following conjectureposed by Thomassen in 1994:“There are only finitely many list-color-critical graphs with alllists of cardinality at least 5 on any fixed surface.” This generalizes the well-known result ofThomassen on the usual graph coloring case. We use this theorem and specific parts of itsproof to resolve the complexity status of the following problem about k-list-coloring graphson a fixed surface S; where k is a fixed positive integer. Input: A graph G embedded in thesurface S. Question: Is G k-choosable? If not; provide a certificate (a list-color-criticalsubgraph and the corresponding k-list-assignment).

Rooted minor problems in highly connected graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract The purpose of this note is to give a connectivity condition for a graph to have arooted complete bipartite minor.

Roughly; our results saythat if G is large enough; then the linear connectivity on the function of k guarantees theexistence of a rooted K a; k-minor (for any a); and in general; the connectivity condition onthe existence of a rooted K a; k-minor is “almost” the same as the average degree whichforces the existence of a K a; k-minor.,Discrete mathematics,2004,14

Given a pair of\emph {source}-\emph {target} domains; wepropose an unsupervised method for learning domain-specific word representations thataccurately capture the domain-specific aspects of word semantics. First; we select a subsetof frequent words that occur in both domains as\emph {pivots}. Next; we optimize anobjective function that enforces two constraints:(a) for both source and target domaindocuments; pivots that appear in a document must accurately predict the co-occurring non-pivots; and (b) word representations learnt for pivots must be similar in the two domains.Moreover; we propose a method to perform domain adaptation using the learnt word …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.07184,2015,13
More compact oracles for approximate distances in undirected planar graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Christian Sommer; Mikkel Thorup,Abstract Distance oracles are data structures that provide fast (possibly approximate)answers to shortest-path and distance queries in graphs. The tradeoff between the spacerequirements and the query time of distance oracles is of particular interest and the mainfocus of this paper. Unless stated otherwise; we assume all graphs to be planar andundirected. In FOCS 2001 (J. ACM 2004); Thorup introduced approximate distance oraclesfor planar graphs (concurrent with Klein; SODA 2002). Thorup proved that; for any ε> 0 andfor any undirected planar graph G=(V; E) on n=| V| nodes; there exists a (1+ ε)--approximatedistance oracle using space O (nε− 1 log n) such that approximate distance queries can beanswered in time O (ε− 1).,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2013,13
An improved algorithm for finding cycles through elements,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We consider the following problem: Given k independent edges in G. Is there apolynomial time algorithm to decide whether or not G has a cycle through all of theseedges? If the answer is yes; detect such a cycle in polynomial time. This problem can beviewed as an algorithmic aspect of the conjecture of Lovász [22] and Woodall [34]. For fixedk; it follows from the seminal result of Robertson and Seymour [29] that there is a polynomialtime algorithm to decide this problem. But; the proof of its correctness requires the full powerof machinery from the graph minor series of papers; which consist of more than 20 papersand> 500 pages. In addition; the hidden constant is an extremely rapidly growing function ofk. Even k= 3; the algorithm is not practical at all. Our main result is to give a better algorithmfor the problem in the following sense. 1 Even when k is a non-trivially super-constant …,International Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization,2008,13

A graph is a minor of anotherif the first can be obtained from a subgraph of the second by contracting edges. An H minor isa minor isomorphic to H.

Uncertain behaviours of integrated circuits improve computational performance,Chihiro Yoshimura; Masanao Yamaoka; Masato Hayashi; Takuya Okuyama; Hidetaka Aoki; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Hiroyuki Mizuno,Abstract Improvements to the performance of conventional computers have mainly beenachieved through semiconductor scaling; however; scaling is reaching its limitations. Naturalphenomena; such as quantum superposition and stochastic resonance; have beenintroduced into new computing paradigms to improve performance beyond these limitations.Here; we explain that the uncertain behaviours of devices due to semiconductor scaling canimprove the performance of computers. We prototyped an integrated circuit by performing aground-state search of the Ising model. The bit errors of memory cell devices holding thecurrent state of search occur probabilistically by inserting fluctuations into dynamic devicecharacteristics; which will be actualised in the future to the chip. As a result; we observedmore improvements in solution accuracy than that without fluctuations. Although the …,Scientific reports,2015,12
Efficient pagerank tracking in evolving networks,Naoto Ohsaka; Takanori Maehara; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Real-world networks; such as the World Wide Web and online social networks; arevery large and are evolving rapidly. Thus tracking personalized PageRank in such evolvingnetworks is an important challenge in network analysis and graph mining. In this paper; wepropose an efficient online algorithm for tracking personalized PageRank in an evolvingnetwork. The proposed algorithm tracks personalized PageRank accurately (ie; within agiven accuracy ε> 0). Moreover it can update the personalized PageRank scores inamortized O (1/ε) iterations for each graph modification. In addition; when m edges arerandomly and sequentially inserted; the total number of iterations is expected to be O (logm/ε).,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,12
An excluded grid theorem for digraphs with forbidden minors,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Stephan Kreutzer,Abstract The excluded grid theorem; originally proved by Robertson and Seymour in GraphMinors V; is one of the most central results in the study of graph minors. It has foundnumerous applications in algorithmic graph structure theory; for instance as the basis forbidimensionality theory on graph classes excluding a fixed minor. In 1997; Reed [22] andlater Johnson; Robertson; Seymour and Thomas [16] conjectured an analogous theorem fordirected graphs; ie the existence of a function f: ℕ→ ℕ such that every digraph of directedtree-width at least f (k) contains a directed grid of order k. In an unpublished manuscript from2001; Johnson; Robertson; Seymour and Thomas gave a proof of this conjecture for planardigraphs but no result beyond planar graphs is known to date. In this paper we prove theconjecture for the case of digraphs excluding a fixed undirected graph as a minor. For …,*,2014,12

Fora closed surface F 2 ; let ε(F 2 ) denote the Euler characteristic of F 2 . The number k=2−ε(F 2) is called the Euler genus of F 2 .

A coherent Ising machine for MAX-CUT problems: performance evaluation against semidefinite programming and simulated annealing,Yoshitaka Haribara; Shoko Utsunomiya; Yoshihisa Yamamoto,Abstract An optical parametric oscillator network driven by a quantum measurement-feedback circuit; composed of optical homodyne detectors; analog-to-digital conversiondevices and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); is proposed and analysed as ascalable coherent Ising machine. The new scheme has an advantage that a large number ofoptical coupling paths; which is proportional to the square of a problem size in the worstcase; can be replaced by a single quantum measurement-feedback circuit. There isadditional advantage in the new scheme that a three body or higher order Ising interactioncan be implemented in the FPGA digital circuit. Noise associated with the measurement-feedback process is governed by the standard quantum limit.

The directed grid theorem,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Stephan Kreutzer,Abstract The grid theorem; originally proved in 1986 by Robertson and Seymour in GraphMinors V; is one of the most central results in the study of graph minors. It has foundnumerous applications in algorithmic graph structure theory; for instance in bidimensionalitytheory; and it is the basis for several other structure theorems developed in the graph minorsproject. In the mid-90s; Reed and Johnson; Robertson; Seymour and Thomas;independently; conjectured an analogous theorem for directed graphs; ie the existence of afunction f: N-> N such that every digraph of directed tree width at least f (k) contains adirected grid of order k. In an unpublished manuscript from 2001; Johnson; Robertson;Seymour and Thomas give a proof of this conjecture for planar digraphs. But for over adecade; this was the most general case proved for the conjecture.,Proceedings of the forty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2015,11
Packing directed cycles through a specified vertex set,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Daniel Král; Marek Krčál; Stephan Kreutzer,Abstract A seminal result of Reed et al.[15] in 1996 states that the Erdős-Pósa property holdsfor directed cycles; ie for every integer n there is an integer t such that every directed graphG has n pairwise vertex disjoint directed cycles or contains a set T⊆ V (G) of at most tvertices such that G--T contains no directed cycle. In this paper; we consider the Erdős-Pósaproperty for directed cycles through a vertex in a given vertex set S; ie the question if forevery integer n there is an integer t such that if G is a directed graph G and S is a set ofvertices then G has n pairwise vertex disjoint directed cycles each containing a vertex of S orcontains a set T of at most t vertices such that G--T contains no such directed cycle. Forundirected graphs; this property holds for cycles through a vertex in a vertex set S (seeKakimura; Kawarabayashi and Marx [9]; and Pontecorvi and Wollan [12]).,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2013,11

Dominating sets in triangulations on surfaces,Tatsuya Honjo; Ken‐ichi Kawarabayashi; Atsuhiro Nakamoto,Abstract Let G be a graph and let S⊂ V (G). We say that S is dominating in G if each vertexof G is in S or adjacent to a vertex in S. We show that every triangulation on the torus and theKlein bottle with n vertices has a dominating set of cardinality at most equation image.Moreover; we show that the same conclusion holds for a triangulation on any non-sphericalsurface with sufficiently large representativity. These results generalize that for planetriangulations proved by Matheson and Tarjan (European J Combin 17 (1996); 565–568);and solve a conjecture by Plummer (Private Communication).© 2009 Wiley Periodicals; Inc.J Graph Theory 63: 17–30; 2010,Journal of Graph Theory,2010,11
Bounding the size of equimatchable graphs of fixed genus,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Michael D Plummer,Abstract A graph G is said to be equimatchable if every matching in G extends to (ie; is asubset of) a maximum matching in G. In an earlier paper with Saito; the authors showed thatthere are only a finite number of 3-connected equimatchable planar graphs. In the presentpaper; this result is extended by showing that in a surface of any fixed genus (orientable ornon-orientable); there are only a finite number of 3-connected equimatchable graphs havinga minimal embedding of representativity at least three.(In fact; if the graphs considered arenon-bipartite; the representativity three hypothesis may be dropped.) The proof makes use ofthe Gallai-Edmonds decomposition theorem for matchings.,Graphs and Combinatorics,2009,11

In particular; we show that a 6-connected graph with a K math imageminor is 3-linked. Further; we show that a 7-connected graph with a K math image minor is(2; 5)-linked. Finally; we show that a graph of order n and size at least 7n− 29 contains a Kmath image minor.© 2005 Wiley Periodicals; Inc. J Graph Theory 49: 75–91; 2005,Journal of Graph Theory,2005,11
Real-time top-r topic detection on twitter with topic hijack filtering,Kohei Hayashi; Takanori Maehara; Masashi Toyoda; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Twitter is a" what's-happening-right-now" tool that enables interested parties tofollow thoughts and commentary of individual users in nearly real-time. While it is a valuablesource of information for real-time topic detection and tracking; Twitter data are not cleanbecause of noisy messages and users; which significantly diminish the reliability of obtainedresults. In this paper; we integrate both the extraction of meaningful topics and the filtering ofmessages over the Twitter stream. We develop a streaming algorithm for a sequence ofdocument-frequency tables; our algorithm enables real-time monitoring of the top-10 topicsfrom approximately 25% of all Twitter messages; while automatically filtering noisy andmeaningless topics. We apply our proposed streaming algorithm to the Japanese Twitterstream and successfully demonstrate that; compared with other online nonnegative matrix …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,10
Scalable simrank join algorithm,Takanori Maehara; Mitsuru Kusumoto; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Similarity join finds all pairs of objects (i; j) with similarity score s (i; j) greater than somespecified threshold θ. This is a fundamental query problem in the database researchcommunity; and is used in many practical applications; such as duplicate detection;merge/purge; record linkage; object matching; and reference conciliation. In this paper; wepropose a scalable approximation algorithm with an arbitrary accuracy for the similarity joinproblem with the SimRank similarity measure. The algorithm consists of two phases: filterand verification. The filter phase enumerates similar pair candidates; and the similarity ofeach candidate is then assessed in the verification phase. The scalability of the proposedalgorithm is experimentally verified for large real networks. The complexity depends only onthe number of similar pairs; but does not depend on all pairs O (n 2).

List-coloring graphs without subdivisions and without immersions,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract A graph G contains a subdivision of H if G contains a subgraph which is isomorphicto a graph that can be obtained from H by subdividing some edges. A graph H is immersedin a graph G if the vertices of H are mapped to (distinct) vertices of G; and the edges of H aremapped to paths joining the corresponding pairs of vertices of G; in such a way that thepaths are pairwise edge-disjoint. Although the well-known Kuratowski's theorem can bestated in terms of both a subdivision and a minor; we know that the notions of a subdivisionand a minor do not seem to be similar. The notions of an immersion and a minor seem to bequite similar; and structural approach concerning graph minors has been extremelysuccessful. In fact; Robertson and Seymour extended their proof of the famous Wanger'sconjecture to prove that graphs are well-quasi-ordered by the immersion relation.,Proceedings of the twenty-third annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete Algorithms,2012,10

Decomposing a planar graph of girth 5 into an independent set and a forest,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Carsten Thomassen,Abstract We use a list-color technique to extend the result of Borodin and Glebov that thevertex set of every planar graph of girth at least 5 can be partitioned into an independent setand a set which induces a forest. We apply this extension to also extend Grötzsch's theoremthat every planar triangle-free graph is 3-colorable. Let G be a plane graph. Assume that thedistance between any two triangles is at least 4. Assume also that each triangle contains avertex such that this vertex is on the outer face boundary and is not contained in any 4-cycle.Then G has chromatic number at most 3. Note that; in this extension of Grötzsch's theoreman unbounded number of triangles are allowed.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2009,10

This is an analogue of the well-knownconjecture of Hadwiger; and in fact; this would immediately imply Hadwiger's conjecture.The current best-known bound for the chromatic number of graphs with no odd completeminor of order l is by the recent result by Geelen; Gerards; Reed; Seymour and Vetta [8]; andby Kawarabayashi [12] later; independently.

Embedding semantic relations into word representations,Danushka Bollegala; Takanori Maehara; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract: Learning representations for semantic relations is important for various tasks suchas analogy detection; relational search; and relation classification. Although there havebeen several proposals for learning representations for individual words; learning wordrepresentations that explicitly capture the semantic relations between words remains underdeveloped. We propose an unsupervised method for learning vector representations forwords such that the learnt representations are sensitive to the semantic relations that existbetween two words. First; we extract lexical patterns from the co-occurrence contexts of twowords in a corpus to represent the semantic relations that exist between those two words.Second; we represent a lexical pattern as the weighted sum of the representations of thewords that co-occur with that lexical pattern. Third; we train a binary classifier to detect …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.00161,2015,8
Spanning closed walks and TSP in 3-connected planar graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Kenta Ozeki,Abstract In this paper; we prove the following theorem; which is motivated by two differentcontexts independently; namely graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Given a circuitgraph (which is obtained from a 3-connected planar graph by deleting one vertex) with nvertices; there is a spanning closed walk W of length at most 4 (n− 1)/3 such that each edgeis used by W at most twice. Our proof is constructive (and purely combinatorial) in the sensethat there is an O (n 2)-time algorithm to construct such a walk in a given 3-connected planargraph. We shall construct an example that shows that the upper bound 4 (n− 1)/3 isessentially tight. We also point out that 2-connected planar graphs may not have such awalk; as K 2; n− 2 shows.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2014,8

This research has natural applications to sports scheduling; especially forleagues such as the National Basketball Association (NBA) where teams must travel longdistances across North America to play all their games; thus consuming much time; money;and greenhouse gas emissions.

The Erdos-Pósa property for directed graphs,Saeed Akhoondian Amiri; Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi; Stephan Kreutzer; Paul Wollan,Abstract: A classical result by Erdos and Posa states that there is a function $ f:{\mathbbN}\rightarrow {\mathbb N} $ such that for every $ k $; every graph $ G $ contains $ k $pairwise vertex disjoint cycles or a set $ T $ of at most $ f (k) $ vertices such that $ GT $ isacyclic. The generalisation of this result to directed graphs is known as Younger's conjectureand was proved by Reed; Robertson; Seymour and Thomas in 1996. This so-called Erdos-Posa-property can naturally be generalised to arbitrary graphs and digraphs. Robertson andSeymour proved that a graph $ H $ has the Erdos-Posa-property if; and only if; $ H $ isplanar. In this paper we study the corresponding problem for digraphs. We obtain acomplete characterisation of the class of strongly connected digraphs which have the Erdos-Posa-property (both for topological and butterfly minors).

In reality; there are manyadvertisers which are in conflict of advertisement; thus we must extend the model for such acase. By extending the budget allocation problem with a bipartite influence model; wepropose a game-theoretic model problem that considers many advertisers. By simulating ourmodel; we can analyze the behavior of a media channel market; eg; we can estimate whichmedia channels are allocated by an advertiser; and which customers are influenced by anadvertiser. Our model has many attractive features. First; our model is a potential game; …,International Conference on Machine Learning,2015,7
4-connected projective-planar graphs are hamiltonian-connected,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Kenta Ozeki,Abstract We generalize the following two seminal results.(1) Thomassen's result [15] in1983; which says that every 4-connected planar graph is Hamiltonian-connected (whichgeneralizes the old result of Tutte [16] in 1956; which says that every 4-connected planargraph is Hamiltonian).(2) Thomas and Yu's result [12] in 1994; which says that every 4-connected projective-planar graph is Hamiltonian. Here; Hamiltonian-connected means thatfor any two vertices u; v; there is a Hamiltonian path between u and v (and hence thisgeneralizes the existence of Hamiltonian cycles). Specifically; we prove the following; Every4-connected projective-planar graph is Hamiltonian-connected. This proves a conjecture ofDean [3] in 1990. Our result is best possible in many senses. First; we cannot lower theconnectivity 4. Secondly; we cannot generalize our result to a surface with higher genus …,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2015,7
Learning word representations from relational graphs,Danushka Bollegala; Takanori Maehara; Yuichi Yoshida; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract: Attributes of words and relations between two words are central to numerous tasksin Artificial Intelligence such as knowledge representation; similarity measurement; andanalogy detection. Often when two words share one or more attributes in common; they areconnected by some semantic relations. On the other hand; if there are numerous semanticrelations between two words; we can expect some of the attributes of one of the words to beinherited by the other. Motivated by this close connection between attributes and relations;given a relational graph in which words are inter-connected via numerous semanticrelations; we propose a method to learn a latent representation for the individual words. Theproposed method considers not only the co-occurrences of words as done by existingapproaches for word representation learning; but also the semantic relations in which two …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.2378,2014,7
An excluded half-integral grid theorem for digraphs and the directed disjoint paths problem,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi; Stephan Kreutzer,Abstract The excluded grid theorem; originally proved by Robertson and Seymour in GraphMinors V; is one of the most central results in the study of graph minors. It has foundnumerous applications in algorithmic graph structure theory; for instance as the basis forbidimensionality theory on graph classes excluding a fixed minor. In 1997; Reed [25] andlater Johnson; Robertson; Seymour and Thomas [17] conjectured an analogous theorem fordirected graphs; ie the existence of a function f: N→ N such that every digraph of directedtree-width at least f (k) contains a directed grid of order k.,Proceedings of the forty-sixth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2014,7
Minimum degree conditions for vertex-disjoint even cycles in large graphs,Shuya Chiba; Shinya Fujita; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Tadashi Sakuma,Abstract We prove a variant of a theorem of Corrádi and Hajnal (1963)[4] which says that if agraph G has at least 3k vertices and its minimum degree is at least 2k; then G contains kvertex-disjoint cycles. Specifically; our main result is the following. For any positive integer k;there is a constant ck such that if G is a graph with at least ck vertices and the minimumdegree of G is at least 2k; then (i) G contains k vertex-disjoint even cycles; or (ii)(2 k− 1) K1∨ p K 2⊂ G⊂ K 2 k− 1∨ p K 2 (p⩾ k⩾ 2); or (iii) k= 1 and each block of G is either a K 2 oran odd cycle.,Advances in Applied Mathematics,2014,7

We shall show that every 5-connectedgraph G of even order embedded on a closed surface F 2; except the sphere; is 2-extendable if ρ (G)⩾ 7− 2 χ (F 2); where ρ (G) stands for the representativity of G on F 2 and χ(F 2) for the Euler characteristic of F 2.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2011,7
The Multi-Round Balanced Traveling Tournament Problem.,Richard Hoshino; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Given an n-team sports league; the Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP) seeks todetermine an optimal double round-robin schedule minimizing the sum total of distancestraveled by the n teams as they move from city to city. In the TTP; the number of “rounds” isfixed at r= 2. In this paper; we propose the Multi-Round Balanced Traveling TournamentProblem (mb-TTP); inspired by the actual league structure of Japanese professionalbaseball; where n= 6 teams play 120 intraleague games over r= 8 rounds; subject to variousconstraints that ensure competitive balance. These additional balancing constraints enableus to reformulate the 2k-round mb-TTP as a shortest path problem on a directed graph; forall k≥ 1. We apply our theoretical algorithm to the 6-team Nippon (Japanese) ProfessionalBaseball Central League; creating a distance-optimal schedule with 57836 kilometres of …,ICAPS,2011,7

A new proof of the flat wall theorem,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Robin Thomas; Paul Wollan,Abstract We give an elementary and self-contained proof; and a numerical improvement; ofa weaker form of the excluded clique minor theorem of Robertson and Seymour; thefollowing. Let t; r≥ 1 be integers; and let R= 49152 t 24 (40 t 2+ r). An r-wall is obtained froma 2 r× r-grid by deleting every odd vertical edge in every odd row and every even verticaledge in every even row; then deleting the two resulting vertices of degree one; and finallysubdividing edges arbitrarily. The vertices of degree two that existed before the subdivisionare called the pegs of the r-wall. Let G be a graph with no K t minor; and let W be an R-wallin G. We prove that there exist a set A⊆ V (G) of size at most 12288 t 24 and an r-subwallW′ of W such that V (W′)∩ A=∅ and W′ is a flat wall in G− A in the following sense.There exists a separation (X; Y) of G− A such that X∩ Y is a subset of the vertex set of the …,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2017,6
The edge-disjoint paths problem in Eulerian graphs and 4-edge-connected graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract In the edge-disjoint paths problem; we are given a graph and a set of k pairs ofvertices; and we have to decide whether or not the graph has k edge-disjoint pathsconnecting given pairs of terminals. Robertson and Seymour's graph minor project gives riseto a polynomial time algorithm for this problem for any fixed k; but their proof of thecorrectness needs the whole Graph Minor project. We give a faster algorithm and a muchsimpler proof of the correctness for the edge-disjoint paths problem. Our results can besummarized as follows: 1. If an input graph is either 4-edge-connected or Eulerian; then ouralgorithm only needs to look for the following three simple reductions:(i) Excluding verticesof high degree.(ii) Excluding≤ 3-edge-cuts.(iii) Excluding large clique minors. 2.

Half-integral packing of odd cycles through prescribed vertices,Naonori Kakimura; Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract The well-known theorem of Erdős-Pósa says that a graph G has either k disjointcycles or a vertex set X of order at most f (k) for some function f such that G\X is a forest.Starting with this result; there are many results concerning packing and covering cycles ingraph theory and combinatorial optimization. In this paper; we discuss packing disjoint S-cycles; ie; cycles that are required to go through a set S of vertices. For this problem;Kakimura-Kawarabayashi-Marx (2011) and Pontecorvi-Wollan (2010) recently showed theErdős-Pósa-type result holds. We further try to generalize this result to packing S-cycles ofodd length. In contrast to packing S-cycles; the Erdős-Pósa-type result does not hold forpacking odd S-cycles. We then relax packing odd S-cycles to half-integral packing; andshow the Erdős-Pósa-type result for the half-integral packing of odd S-cycles; which is a …,Combinatorica,2013,6
Mining for analogous tuples from an entity-relation graph,Danushka Bollegala; Mitsuru Kusumoto; Yuichi Yoshida; Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract The ability to recognize analogies is an important factor that is closely related tohuman intelligence. Verbal analogies have been used for evaluating both examinees atuniversity entrance exams as well as algorithms for measuring relational similarity. However;relational similarity measures proposed so far are confined to measuring the similaritybetween pairs of words. Unfortunately; such pairwise approaches ignore the rich relationalstructure that exists in real-world knowledge bases containing millions of entities andsemantic relations. We propose a method to efficiently identify analogous entity tuples from agiven entity-relation graph. First; we present an efficient approach for extracting potentialanalogous tuples from a given entity-relation graph. Second; to measure the structuralsimilarity between two tuples; we propose two types of kernel functions: vertex-feature …,Proceedings of the Twenty-Third international joint conference on Artificial Intelligence,2013,6
Model checking for successor-invariant first-order logic on minor-closed graph classes,Kord Eickmeyer; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Stephan Kreutzer,Model checking problems for first-and monadic second-order logic on graphs have receivedconsiderable attention in the past; not the least due to their connections to problems inalgorithmic graph structure theory. While the model checking problem for these logics ongeneral graphs is computationally intractable; it becomes tractable on important classes ofgraphs such as those of bounded tree-width; planar graphs or more generally; classes ofgraphs excluding a fixed minor. It is well known that allowing an order relation or successorfunction can greatly increase the expressive power of the respective logics. This remainstrue even in cases where we require the formulas to be order-or successor-invariant; that is;while they can use an order relation; their truth in a given graph must not depend on theparticular ordering or successor function chosen. Naturally; the question arises whether …,Logic in Computer Science (LICS); 2013 28th Annual IEEE/ACM Symposium on,2013,6
Packing directed circuits through prescribed vertices bounded fractionally,Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,A seminal result of Reed et al. Combinatorica; 16 (1996); pp. 535--554 says that a directedgraph has either k vertex-disjoint directed circuits or a set of at most f(k) vertices meeting alldirected circuits. This paper aims at generalizing their result to packing directed circuitsthrough a prescribed set S of vertices. Such a circuit is called an S-circuit. Even et al.Algorithmica; 20 (1998); pp. 151--174 showed a fractional version of packing S-circuits. Inthis paper; we show that the fractionality can be bounded by at most one-fifth: Given aninteger k and a vertex subset S; whose size may not depend on k; we prove that either G hasa 1/5-integral packing of k disjoint S-circuits; ie; each vertex appears in at most five of theseS-circuits; or G has a vertex set X of order at most f(k) (for some function f of k) such that GXhas no such circuit.

The distance-optimal inter-league schedule for Japanese pro baseball,Richard Hoshino; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) is Japan's largest and most well-knownprofessional sports league; with over 22 million fans each season. Each NPB team plays 24inter-league games during a five-week period each spring. In this paper; we solve theproblem of determining the best possible NPB inter-league schedule that minimizes the sumtotal of distances traveled by all teams. Despite the NP-completeness of the general problemwith 2n teams; we show that for the 12-team NPB; the distance-optimal inter-leagueschedule can be determined from two heuristics that drastically cut down the computationtime. Using these heuristics; we generate the best possible schedule when the home gameslots are uniform (ie; every team in one league plays their home games at the same time);and when they are non-uniform.

An O (logn)-approximation algorithm for the disjoint paths problem in Eulerian planar graphs and 4-edge-connected planar graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract In this paper; we study an approximation algorithm for the maximum edge-disjointpaths problem. In the maximum edge-disjoint paths problem; we are given a graph and acollection of pairs of vertices; and the objective is to find the maximum number of pairs thatcan be connected by edge-disjoint paths. We give an O (log n)-approximation algorithm forthe maximum edge-disjoint paths problem when an input graph is either 4-edge-connectedplanar or Eulerian planar. This improves an O (log 2 n)-approximation algorithm given byKleinberg [10] for Eulerian planar graphs. Our result also generalizes the result by Chekuri;Khanna and Shepherd [2; 3] who gave an O (log n)-approximation algorithm for the edge-disjoint paths problem with congestion 2 when an input graph is planar.,*,2010,6

Hamiltonian cycles in n-factor-critical graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Katsuhiro Ota; Akira Saito,Abstract A graph G is said to be n-factor-critical if G− S has a 1-factor for any S⊂ V (G) with|S|= n. In this paper; we prove that if G is a 2-connected n-factor-critical graph of order p withσ 3 (G)⩾ 3 2 (p− n− 1); then G is hamiltonian with some exceptions. To extend this theorem;we define a (k; n)-factor-critical graph to be a graph G such that G− S has a k-factor for anyS⊂ V (G) with| S|= n. We conjecture that if G is a 2-connected (k; n)-factor-critical graph oforder p with σ 3 (G)⩾ 3 2 (p− n− k); then G is hamiltonian with some exceptions. In thispaper; we characterize all such graphs that satisfy the assumption; but are not 1-tough.Using this; we verify the conjecture for k⩽ 2.,Discrete Mathematics,2001,6

For d= 3 d= 3 this is the four-colour theorem; and theconjecture has been proved for all d≤ 8 d≤ 8; by various authors. In particular; two of usproved it when d= 7 d= 7; and then three of us proved it when d= 8 d= 8. The methods usedfor the latter give a proof in the d= 7 d= 7 case that is simpler than the original; and wepresent it here.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2015,5
Beyond the Euler characteristic: Approximating the genus of general graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Anastasios Sidiropoulos,Abstract Computing the Euler genus of a graph is a fundamental problem in graph theoryand topology. It has been shown to be NP-hard by Thomassen [27] and a linear-time fixed-parameter algorithm has been obtained by Mohar [20]. Despite extensive study; theapproximability of the Euler genus remains wide open. While the existence of a constantfactor approximation is not ruled out; the currently best-known upper bound is a trivial O (n/g)-approximation that follows from bounds on the Euler characteristic. In this paper; we give thefirst non-trivial approximation algorithm for this problem. Specifically; we present apolynomial-time algorithm which given a graph G of Euler genus g outputs an embedding ofG into a surface of Euler genus g O (1). Combined with the above O (n/g)-approximation; ourresult also implies a O (n 1-α)-approximation; for some universal constant α> 0.,Proceedings of the forty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2015,5
Fixed-parameter tractability for subset feedback set problems with parity constraints,Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract The subset feedback set problem; which is a generalization of the well-knownfeedback vertex set problem; is that we are given an undirected graph G with a vertex subsetS and a positive integer k; and the goal is to find a vertex set X of size at most k such that G−X has no S-cycle; where an S-cycle is a cycle having at least one vertex of S. It was recentlyshown that this problem is fixed parameter tractable; where k is the parameter. In this paper;we further generalize this problem to one with the parity constraints; and show the fixedparameter tractability: 1. For a parameter k; there exists a fixed-parameter algorithm thateither finds a vertex set X of size k such that G− X has no S-cycle of even length; orconcludes that such a vertex set does not exist. 2.

The Linear Distance Traveling Tournament Problem.,Richard Hoshino; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We introduce a linear distance relaxation of the nteam Traveling TournamentProblem (TTP); a simple yet powerful heuristic that temporarily “assumes” the n teams arelocated on a straight line; thereby reducing the (n 2) pairwise distance parameters to just n−1 variables. The modified problem then becomes easier to analyze; from which wedetermine an approximate solution for the actual instance on n teams. We presentcombinatorial techniques to solve the Linear Distance TTP (LD-TTP) for n= 4 and n= 6;without any use of computing; generating the complete set of optimal distances regardless ofwhere the n teams are located. We show that there are only 295 non-isomorphic schedulesthat can be a solution to the 6-team LD-TTP; and demonstrate that in all previously-solvedbenchmark TTP instances on 6 teams; the distance-optimal schedule appears in this list …,AAAI,2012,5
An improved algorithm for the half-disjoint paths problem,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,In this paper; we consider the half-integral disjoint paths packing. For a graph G and k pairsof vertices (s 1; t 1);(s 2; t 2);…;(sk; tk) in G; the objective is to find paths P 1;…; P k in G suchthat P i joins si and ti for i= 1; 2;…; k; and in addition; each vertex is on at most two of thesepaths. We give a polynomial-time algorithm to decide the feasibility of this problem with k= O((log n/log log n) 1/7). This improves a result by Kleinberg [Proceedings of the 30th ACMSymposium on Theory of Computing; 1998; pp 530–539] who proved the same conclusionwhen k= O ((log log n) 2/15). Our algorithm still works for several problems related to thebounded unsplittable flow. These results can all carry over to problems involving edgecapacities.

Improved upper bounds on the crossing number,Vida Dujmovic; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bojan Mohar; David R Wood,Abstract The crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of crossings in a drawingof the graph in the plane. Our main result is that every graph G that does not contain a fixedgraph as a minor has crossing number O (Δn); where G has n vertices and maximum degreeΔ. This dependence on n and Ø is best possible. This result answers an open question ofWood and Telle [New York J. Mathematics; 2007]; who proved the best previous bound of O(Ø 2 n). In addition; we prove that every K 5-minor-free graph G has crossing number at most2∑ v deg (v) 2; which again is the best possible dependence on the degrees of G. We alsostudy the convex and rectilinear crossing numbers; and prove an O (Øn) bound for theconvex crossing number of bounded pathwidth graphs; and a∑ v deg (v) 2 bound for therectilinear crossing number of K 3; 3-minor-free graphs.,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth annual symposium on Computational geometry,2008,5
The Chvátal-Erdős condition and 2-factors with a specified number of components,Guantao Chen; Ronald Gould; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Katsuhiro Ota; Akira Saito; Ingo Schiermeyer,Abstract Let G be a 2-connected graph of order n satisfying α (G)= a≤ κ (G); where α (G) andκ (G) are the independence number and the connectivity of G; respectively; and let r (m; n)denote the Ramsey number. The well-known Chvátal-Erdos Theorem states that G has ahamiltonian cycle. In this paper; we extend this theorem; and prove that G has a 2-factor witha specified number of components if n is sufficiently large. More precisely; we prove that (1)if n≥ k· r (a+ 4; a+ 1); then G has a 2-factor with k components; and (2) if n≥ r (2a+ 3; a+ 1)+3 (k− 1); then G has a 2-factor with k components such that all components but one haveorder three.,Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory,2007,5

List-coloring embedded graphs,Zdeněk Dvořák; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract For any fixed surface Σ of genus g; we give an algorithm to decide whether a graphG of girth at least five embedded in Σ is colorable from an assignment of lists of size three intime O (| V (G)|). Furthermore; we can allow a subgraph (of any size) with at most scomponents to be precolored; at the expense of increasing the time complexity of thealgorithm to O (| V (G)| K (g+s)+ 1) for some absolute constant K; in both cases; themultiplicative constant hidden in the O-notation depends on g and s. This also enables us tofind such a coloring when it exists. The idea of the algorithm can be applied to other similarproblems; eg; 5-list-coloring of graphs on surfaces.,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2013,4
Packing cycles through prescribed vertices under modularity constraints,Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract The well-known theorem of Erdős–Pósa says that either a graph G has k disjointcycles or there is a vertex set X of order at most f (k) for some function f such that G∖ X is aforest. Starting with this result; there are many results concerning packing and coveringcycles in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. In this paper; we present a commongeneralization of the following Erdős–Pósa properties: 1. The Erdős–Pósa property forcycles of length divisible by a fixed integer p (Thomassen; 1988 [19]). 2. The Erdős–Pósaproperty for S-cycles; ie; cycles which contain a vertex of a prescribed vertex set S(Kakimura; Kawarabayashi; and Marx; 2011 [10] and Pontecorvi and Wollan; 2010 [13]).Namely; given integers k; p; and a vertex set S (whose size may not depend on k and p); weprove that either a graph G has k disjoint S-cycles; each of which has length divisible by p …,Advances in Applied Mathematics,2012,4
Cliques in odd-minor-free graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; David R Wood,Abstract This paper is about:(1) bounds on the number of cliques in a graph in a particularclass; and (2) algorithms for listing all cliques in a graph. We present a simple algorithm thatlists all cliques in an n-vertex graph in O (n) time per clique. For O (1)-degenerate graphs;such as graphs excluding a fixed minor; we describe a O (n) time algorithm for listing allcliques. We prove that graphs excluding a fixed odd-minor have O (n 2) cliques (which istight); and conclude a O (n 3) time algorithm for listing all cliques.,Proceedings of the Eighteenth Computing: The Australasian Theory Symposium-Volume 128,2012,4
Toughness of Ka; t-minor-free graphs,Guantao Chen; Yoshimi Egawa; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bojan Mohar; Katsuhiro Ota,Abstract The toughness of a non-complete graph G is the minimum value of| S| ω (G− S)among all separating vertex sets S⊂ V (G); where ω (G− S)⩾ 2 is the number of componentsof G− S. It is well-known that every 3-connected planar graph has toughness greater than1/2. Related to this property; every 3-connected planar graph has many good substructures;such as a spanning tree with maximum degree three; a 2-walk; etc. Realizing that 3-connected planar graphs are essentially the same as 3-connected K3; 3-minor-free graphs;we consider a generalization to a-connected Ka; t-minor-free graphs; where 3⩽ a⩽ t. Weprove that there exists a positive constant h (a; t) such that every a-connected Ka; t-minor-free graph G has toughness at least h (a; t). For the case where a= 3 and t is odd; we obtainthe best possible value for h (3; t). As a corollary it is proved that every such graph of …,the electronic journal of combinatorics,2011,4
Non-separating even cycles in highly connected graphs,Shinya Fujita; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We prove that every k-connected graph (k≥ 5) has an even cycle C such that GV(C) is still (k-4)-connected. The connectivity bound is best possible. In addition; we prove thatevery k-connected triangle-free graph (k≥ 5) has an even cycle C such that GV (C) is still (k-3)-connected. The same conclusion also holds for any k-connected graph (k≥ 5) that doesnot contain a K 4−; ie; K 4 minus one edge. The first theorem is an analogue of the well-known result (without the parity condition) by Thomassen [9]. It is also a counterpart of theconjecture made by Thomassen [10] which says that there exists a function f (k) such thatevery f (k)-connected non-bipartite graph has an odd cycle C such that GV (C) is still k-connected. The second theorem is an analogue of the results (without the parity condition)by Egawa [2] and Kawarabayashi [3]; respectively.,Combinatorica,2010,4
Additive approximation algorithms for list-coloring minor-closed class of graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Erik D Demaine; MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi,Abstract It is known that computing the list chromatic number is harder than computing thechromatic number (assuming NP≠ coNP). In fact; the problem of deciding whether a givengraph is f-list-colorable for a function f: V→{c-1; c} for c≥ 3 is Π p 2-complete. In general; it isbelieved that approximating list coloring is hard for dense graphs. In this paper; we areinterested in sparse graphs. More specifically; we deal with nontrivial minor-closed classesof graphs; ie; graphs excluding some K k minor. We refine the seminal structure theorem ofRobertson and Seymour; and then give an additive approximation for list-coloring within k-2of the list chromatic number. This improves the previous multiplicative O (k)-approximationalgorithm [20]. Clearly our result also yields an additive approximation algorithm for graphcoloring in a minor-closed graph class. This result may give better graph colorings than …,Proceedings of the twentieth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2009,4
On the number of 4-contractible edges in 4-connected graphs,Kiyoshi Ando; Yoshimi Egawa; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Matthias Kriesell,All graphs considered here are supposed to be finite; simple; and undirected. Forterminology not defined here we refer to [1] or [2]. An edge e= xy in a k-connected graph G iscalled k-contractible if the graph G/e obtained from G identifying x; y and simplifying theresult is k-connected. It is easy to see that every edge of a connected graph is 1-contractible;and it is a well known fact that every vertex of a 2-connected graph nonisomorphic to K3 isincident with a 2-contractible edge. The corresponding statement for 3-connected graphsfails; but it is still true that for an arbitrary vertex x in a 3-connected graph nonisomorphic toK4 there is a 3-contractible edge at distance 0 or 1 from x (references in [7]).,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2009,4
Fractional coloring and the odd Hadwiger’s conjecture,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bruce Reed,Abstract Gerards and Seymour (see [TR Jensen; B. Toft; Graph Coloring Problems; Wiley-Interscience; 1995]; page 115) conjectured that if a graph has no odd complete minor oforder p; then it is (p− 1)-colorable. This is an analogue of the well known conjecture ofHadwiger; and in fact; this would immediately imply Hadwiger's conjecture. The current bestknown bound for the chromatic number of graphs without an odd complete minor of order pis O (p log p) by the recent result by Geelen et al.[J. Geelen; B. Gerards; B.

2-Connected spanning subgraphs with low maximum degree in locally planar graphs,Mark N Ellingham; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract In this paper; we prove that there exists a function a: N 0× R+→ N such that for eachε> 0; if G is a 4-connected graph embedded on a surface of Euler genus k such that the face-width of G is at least a (k; ε); then G has a 2-connected spanning subgraph with maximumdegree at most 3 in which the number of vertices of degree 3 is at most ε| V (G)|.

Half integral packing; Erdős-Posá-property and graph minors,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We consider the following problem: Given a graph G. Decide whether or not G has khalf-integral packing of an H-minor for fixed k and H. Here; k half-integral packing of an H-minor is that there are k H-minors such that each vertex is used at most twice. Let us observethat if G contains H as a minor; then G has| H| disjoint trees such that after contracting all thetrees; we can get an H. So k half-integral packing of an H-minor means that there are k| H|trees T 1; 1;...; T1;| H|; T 2; 1;...; Tk;| H| such that trees T i; 1;...; T 1;| H| are disjoint for 1≤ i≤ k;and after contracting all these trees Ti; 1;...; T i;| H|; we can get an H for 1≤ i≤ k; but eachvertex is used at most twice in these trees T 1; 1;...; T 1;| H|; T 2; 1;...; T k;| H|.

Graph partition into paths containing specified vertices,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract For a graph G; let σ 2 (G) denote the minimum degree sum of a pair of nonadjacentvertices. Suppose G is a graph of order n. Enomoto and Ota (J.

Semantic Interpretation of Social Network Communities.,Tushar Maheshwari; Aishwarya N Reganti; Upendra Kumar; Tanmoy Chakraborty; Amitava Das,Abstract A community in a social network is considered to be a group of nodes denselyconnected internally and sparsely connected externally. Although previous work intenselystudied network topology within a community; its semantic interpretation is hardlyunderstood. In this paper; we attempt to understand whether individuals in a communitypossess similar Personalities; Values and Ethical background. Finally; we show thatPersonality and Values models could be used as features to discover more accuratecommunity structure compared to the one obtained from only network information.,AAAI,2017,3
Expected Tensor Decomposition with Stochastic Gradient Descent.,Takanori Maehara; Kohei Hayashi; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract In this study; we investigate expected CP decomposition—a special case of CPdecomposition in which a tensor to be decomposed is given as the sum or average of tensorsamples X (t) for t= 1;...; T. To determine this decomposition; we develope stochastic-gradient-descent-type algorithms with four appealing features: efficient memory use; abilityto work in an online setting; robustness of parameter tuning; and simplicity. Our theoreticalanalysis show that the solutions do not diverge to infinity for any initial value or step size.Experimental results confirm that our algorithms significantly outperform all existing methodsin terms of accuracy. We also show that they can successfully decompose a large tensor;containing billion-scale nonzero elements.,AAAI,2016,3
Graph isomorphism for bounded genus graphs in linear time,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract: For every integer $ g $; isomorphism of graphs of Euler genus at most $ g $ can bedecided in linear time. This improves previously known algorithms whose time complexity is$ n^{O (g)} $(shown in early 1980's); and in fact; this is the first fixed-parameter tractablealgorithm for the graph isomorphism problem for bounded genus graphs in terms of theEuler genus $ g $. Our result also generalizes the seminal result of Hopcroft and Wong in1974; which says that the graph isomorphism problem can be decided in linear time forplanar graphs.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.02460,2015,3
Lagrangian Decomposition Algorithm for Allocating Marketing Channels.,Daisuke Hatano; Takuro Fukunaga; Takanori Maehara; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract In this paper; we formulate a new problem related to the well-known influencemaximization in the context of computational advertising. Our new problem considersallocating marketing channels (eg; TV; newspaper; and websites) to advertisers from theview point of a match maker; which was not taken into account in previous studies on theinfluence maximization. The objective of the problem is to find an allocation such that eachadvertiser can influence some given number of customers while the slots of marketingchannels are limited. We propose an algorithm based on the Lagrangian decomposition. Weempirically show that our algorithm computes better quality solutions than existingalgorithms; scales up to graphs of 10M vertices; and performs well particularly in a parallelenvironment.,AAAI,2015,3
Connected (s; t)-Vertex Separator Parameterized by Chordality.,NS Narayanaswamy; N Sadagopan,Abstract We investigate the complexity of finding a minimum connected (s; t)-vertexseparator ((s; t)-CVS) and present an interesting chordality dichotomy: we show that (s; t)-CVS is NP-complete on graphs of chordality at least 5 and present a polynomial-timealgorithm for (s; t)-CVS on chordality 4 graphs. Further; we show that (s; t)-CVS is unlikely tohave δlog2−∈ n-approximation algorithm; for any ϵ> 0 and for some δ> 0; unless NP hasquasi-polynomial Las Vegas algorithms. On the positive-side of approximation; we presenta⌈ c 2⌉-approximation algorithm for (s; t)-CVS on graphs with chordality c≥ 3.

Solving the Traveling Tournament Problem by Packing Three-Vertex Paths.,Marc Goerigk; Richard Hoshino; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Stephan Westphal,Abstract The Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP) is a complex problem in sportsscheduling whose solution is a schedule of home and away games meeting specificfeasibility requirements; while minimizing the total distance traveled by all the teams. Arecently-developed “hybrid” algorithm; combining local search and integer programming;has resulted in best-known solutions for many TTP instances. In this paper; we tackle theTTP from a graph-theoretic perspective; by generating a new “canonical” schedule in whicheach team's threegame road trips match up with the underlying graph's minimum-weight P3-packing. By using this new schedule as the initial input for the hybrid algorithm; we developtournament schedules for five benchmark TTP instances that beat all previously-knownsolutions.,AAAI,2014,3

The Complexity of the Simultaneous Cluster Problem.,Zhentao Li; Manikandan Narayanan; Adrian Vetta,Abstract We study clustering over multiple graphs-each encoding a distinct set of similarityrelationships (edges) over the same set of objects (nodes)-where the aim is to identifyclusters that are supported across the collection of graphs. This problem of simultaneousclustering is readily motivated by the recent deluge of datasets in several domains (includingthe biological sciences; social sciences; and marketing); where the same objects arerepeatedly measured in different conditions; populations or time points. Whilst there hasbeen a vast amount of heuristic work on practical simultaneous clustering problems; little isknown on the theoretical side–we present theoretical results that help explain why suchheuristics typically come without quantitative guarantees. We give algorithmic andcomplexity results for simultaneous clustering using two standard measures on clustering …,J. Graph Algorithms Appl.,2014,3
Sub-exponential graph coloring algorithm for stencil-based Jacobian computations,Michael Lülfesmann; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Partial differential equations can be discretized using a regular Cartesian grid and astencil-based method to approximate the partial derivatives. The computational effort fordetermining the associated Jacobian matrix can be reduced. This reduction can be modeledas a (grid) coloring problem. Currently; this problem is solved by using a heuristic approachfor general graphs or by developing a formula for every single stencil. We introduce a sub-exponential algorithm using the Lipton–Tarjan separator in a divide-and-conquer approachto compute an optimal coloring. The practical relevance of the algorithm is evaluated whencompared with an exponential algorithm and a greedy heuristic.,Journal of Computational Science,2014,3
Totally odd subdivisions and parity subdivisions: Structures and Coloring,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract A totally odd H-subdivision means a subdivision of a graph H in which each edge ofH corresponds to a path of odd length. Thus this concept is a generalization of a subdivisionof H. In this paper; we give a structure theorem for graphs without a fixed graph H as a totallyodd subdivision. Namely; every graph with no totally odd H-subdivision has a tree-decompositionsuch that each piece is either … 1. after deleting bounded number of vertices; an “al- most” embeddedgraph into a bounded-genus sur- face; or … 2. after deleting bounded number of vertices; abipar- tite graph; or … Moreover; we can obtain either a totally odd Kk- subdivision or such atree-decomposition in polynomial time.

The disjoint paths problem: algorithm and structure,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We consider the following well-known problem; which is called the disjoint pathsproblem. Input: A graph G with n vertices and m edges; k pairs of vertices (s 1; t 1);(s 2; t2);...;(sk; tk) in G. Output:(Vertex-or edge-) disjoint paths P 1; P 2;...; P k in G such that P ijoins si and ti for i= 1; 2;...; k. This is certainly a central problem in algorithmic graph theoryand combinatorial optimization. See the surveys [9; 31]. It has attracted attention in thecontexts of transportation networks; VLSI layout and virtual circuit routing in high-speednetworks or Internet. A basic technical problem is to interconnect certain prescribed“channels” on the chip such that wires belonging to different pins do not touch each other. Inthis simplest form; the problem mathematically amounts to finding vertex-disjoint trees orvertex-disjoint paths in a graph; each connecting a given set of vertices.,International Workshop on Algorithms and Computation,2011,3
Non-separating subgraphs after deleting many disjoint paths,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Kenta Ozeki,Abstract Motivated by the well-known conjecture by Lovász (1975)[6] on the connectivityafter the path removal; we study the following problem: There exists a function f= f (k; l) suchthat the following holds. For every f (k; l)-connected graph G and two distinct vertices s and tin G; there are k internally disjoint paths P 1;…; P k with endpoints s and t such that G−⋃ i= 1k V (P i) is l-connected. When k= 1; this problem corresponds to Lovász conjecture; and it isopen for all the cases l⩾ 3. We show that f (k; 1)= 2 k+ 1 and f (k; 2)⩽ 3 k+ 2. The connectivity“2 k+ 1” for f (k; 1) is best possible. Thus our result generalizes the result by Tutte (1963)[8]for the case k= 1 and l= 1 (the first settled case of Lovász conjecture); and the result byChen; Gould and Yu (2003)[1]; Kriesell (2001)[4]; Kawarabayashi; Lee; and Yu (2005)[2];independently; for the case k= 1 and l= 2 (the second settled case of Lovász conjecture) …,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2011,3
Algorithms for finding an induced cycle in planar graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract In this paper; we consider the problem of finding an induced cycle passing throughk given vertices; which we call the induced cycle problem. The significance of findinginduced cycles stems from the fact that a precise characterization of perfect graphs wouldrequire understanding the structure of graphs without an odd induced cycle and itscomplement. There has been huge progress in the recent years; especially; the StrongPerfect Graph Conjecture was solved in 6. Concerning recognition of perfect graphs; therehad been a long-standing open problem for detecting an odd hole and its complement; andfinally this was solved in 4. Unfortunately; the problem of finding an induced cycle passingthrough two given vertices is NP-complete in a general graph 2. However; if the input graphis constrained to be planar and k is fixed; then the induced cycle problem can be solved …,Combinatorica,2010,3

Both “(k− 3)-connected”and “(k− 2)-connected” are best possible in a sense.,Discrete Applied Mathematics,2009,3
On the structure of k-connected graphs without Kk-minor,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Rong Luo; Jianbing Niu; Cun-Quan Zhang,Abstract Suppose G is a k-connected graph that does not contain K k as a minor. What doesG look like? This question is motivated by Hadwiger's conjecture (Vierteljahrsschr.Naturforsch. Ges. Zürich 88 (1943) 133) and a deep result of Robertson and Seymour (J.Combin. Theory Ser. B. 89 (2003) 43). It is easy to see that such a graph cannot contain a(k− 1)-clique; but could contain a (k− 2)-clique; as K k− 5+ G′; where G′ is a 5-connectedplanar graph; shows. In this paper; however; we will prove that such a graph cannot containthree “nearly” disjoint (k− 2)-cliques.

We prove that there exists such a multigraph which ishomomorphic to a graph with minimum degree at least three only if a= 0; and that thereexists such a graph only if a= 0 and b= 2. We also study the distribution of paths whoseinternal vertices have degree exactly two; and show a relation between these paths andedges in a 2-connected graph whose deletion results in a 2-connected graph.,Discrete mathematics,2003,3

Fully Dynamic Shortest-Path Distance Query Acceleration on Massive Networks,Takanori Hayashi; Takuya Akiba; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract The distance between vertices is one of the most fundamental measures forrepresenting relations between them; and it is the basis of other classic measures ofvertices; such as similarity; centrality; and influence. The 2-hop labeling methods are knownas the fastest exact point-to-point distance algorithms on million-scale networks. However;they cannot handle billion-scale networks because of the large space requirement and longpreprocessing time. In this paper; we present the first algorithm that can process exactdistance queries on fully dynamic billion-scale networks besides trivial non-indexingalgorithms; which combines an online bidirectional breadth-first search (BFS) and an offlineindexing method for handling billion-scale networks in memory.

Maximizing time-decaying influence in social networks,Naoto Ohsaka; Yutaro Yamaguchi; Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Influence maximization is a well-studied problem of finding a small set of highlyinfluential individuals in a social network such that the spread of influence under a certaindiffusion model is maximized. We propose new diffusion models that incorporate the time-decaying phenomenon by which the power of influence decreases with elapsed time. Instandard diffusion models such as the independent cascade and linear threshold models;each edge in a network has a fixed power of influence over time. However; in practicalsettings; such as rumor spreading; it is natural for the power of influence to depend on thetime influenced. We generalize the independent cascade and linear threshold models withtime-decaying effects. Moreover; we show that by using an analysis framework based onsubmodular functions; a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2016,2
Adaptive Budget Allocation for Maximizing Influence of Advertisements.,Daisuke Hatano; Takuro Fukunaga; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract The budget allocation problem is an optimization problem arising from advertisingplanning. In the problem; an advertiser has limited budgets to allocate across media; andseeks to optimize the allocation such that the largest fraction of customers can be influenced.It is known that this problem admits a (11/e)-approximation algorithm. However; no previousstudies on this problem considered adjusting the allocation adaptively based upon the effectof the past campaigns; which is a usual strategy in the real setting. Our main contribution inthis paper is to analyze adaptive strategies for the budget allocation problem. We define agreedy strategy; referred to as the insensitive policy; and then give a provable performanceguarantee. This result is obtained by extending the adaptive submodularity; which is aconcept studied in the context of active learning and stochastic optimization; to the …,IJCAI,2016,2
Successor-invariant first-order logic on graphs with excluded topological subgraphs,Kord Eickmeyer; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract: We show that the model-checking problem for successor-invariant first-order logicis fixed-parameter tractable on graphs with excluded topological subgraphs whenparameterised by both the size of the input formula and the size of the exluded topologicalsubgraph. Furthermore; we show that model-checking for order-invariant first-order logic istractable on coloured posets of bounded width; parameterised by both the size of the inputformula and the width of the poset. Our result for successor-invariant FO extends previousresults for this logic on planar graphs (Engelmann et al.; LICS 2012) and graphs withexcluded minors (Eickmeyer et al.; LICS 2013); further narrowing the gap between what isknown for FO and what is known for successor-invariant FO. The proof uses Grohe andMarx's structure theorem for graphs with excluded topological subgraphs. For order …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.01198,2016,2
An Excluded-Minor Approximation of Tree-Depth,Kenichi Kawarabayashi; Benjamin Rossman,*,*,2016,2
A coherent Ising machine with quantum measurement and feedback control,Yoshitaka Haribara; Yoshihisa Yamamoto; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Shoko Utsunomiya,A coherent Ising machine (CIM) based on a multiple-pulse degenerate optical parametricoscillator (DOPO) is proposed to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Theunderlying mechanism originates from the bistable phase operation of each DOPO pulseand the inherent preference of the coupled DOPOs in selecting an oscillation mode with theminimum photon decay rate. In order to build a scalable CIM; a new quantum feedbackscheme via optical homodyne detection and electronic signal processing must replace amassive parallel optical interconnections. This paper presents the basic concept; theoreticalmodel and numerical results of the proposed scheme. Computational experiments areperformed on NP-hard MAX-CUT problems with number of vertices up to 20000.

All-or-nothing multicommodity flow problem with bounded fractionality in planar graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,We study the following all-or-nothing multicommodity flow problem in planar graphs. Input: Agraph G with n vertices and k pairs of vertices (s 1; t 1);(s 2; t 2);...;(sk; tk) in G. Find: A largestsubset W of {1;....; k such that for every i in W; we can send one unit of flow between si and t i.This problem is different from the well-known maximum edge-disjoint paths problem in thatwe do not require integral flows for the pairs. This problem is APX-hard even for trees; and a2-approximation algorithm is known for trees. For general graphs; Chekuri et al.(STOC'04)give a poly-logarithmic factor approximation algorithm and show that a natural LP-relaxationhas a poly-logarithmic integrality gap. This result is in contrast with the integrality gap Ω (√n) for the maximum edge-disjoint paths problem. Our main result considerably strengthensthis result when an input graph is planar. Namely; for the all-or-nothing multicommodity …,Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS); 2013 IEEE 54th Annual Symposium on,2013,2
Graph theory and sports scheduling,Richard Hoshino; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Introduction The effects of global warming have been well documented; especially in recentyears. As a result; the majority of countries have made a commit- ment to reducing their greenhousegas emissions; including many whose national governments have made ambitious and unrealisticpromises. Meeting these targets will require a coordinated effort from policymakers;businesses; and large industries; and numerous creative solutions will need to be imple- mentedto achieve the desired goal. One potential solution is based on discrete mathematics; wherecombinatorial and graph-theoretic techniques are applied to scheduling optimization; leadingto economic and environmental benefits. There are many practical roles for mathemat- icallyoptimal schedules that reduce total travel distance; including supply-chain logistics and air- planeflight assignments.

Linkless and flat embeddings in 3-space,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Stephan Kreutzer; Bojan Mohar,Abstract We consider piecewise linear embeddings of graphs in 3-space ℝ 3. Such anembedding is linkless if every pair of disjoint cycles forms a trivial link (in the sense of knottheory). Robertson; Seymour and Thomas (J. Comb. Theory; Ser. B 64: 185–227; 1995)showed that a graph has a linkless embedding in ℝ 3 if and only if it does not contain as aminor any of seven graphs in Petersen's family (graphs obtained from K 6 by a series of Y Δand Δ Y operations). They also showed that a graph is linklessly embeddable in ℝ 3 if andonly if it admits a flat embedding into ℝ 3; ie an embedding such that for every cycle C of Gthere exists a closed 2-disk D⊆ ℝ 3 with D∩ G=∂ D= C.

Minimally contraction-critically 6-connected graphs,Kiyoshi Ando; Shinya Fujita; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract An edge of a 6-connected graph is said to be removable (resp. contractible) if theremoval (resp. contraction) of the edge results in a 6-connected graph. A 6-connected graphis said to be minimally contraction-critically 6-connected if it has neither removable edge norcontractible edge. Let x be a vertex of a minimally contraction-critically 6-connected graph G.In this paper; we show that there is one of some specified configurations around x and usingthis result we prove that x has a neighbor of degree 6. We also display a condition for x tohave at least two neighbors of degree 6.,Discrete Mathematics,2012,2
2‐and 3‐factors of graphs on surfaces,Ken‐Ichi Kawarabayashi; Kenta Ozeki,Abstract It has been conjectured that any 5-connected graph embedded in a surface Σ withsufficiently large face-width is hamiltonian. This conjecture was verified by Yu for thetriangulation case; but it is still open in general. The conjecture is not true for 4-connectedgraphs. In this article; we shall study the existence of 2-and 3-factors in a graph embeddedin a surface Σ. A hamiltonian cycle is a special case of a 2-factor. Thus; it is quite natural toconsider the existence of these factors. We give an evidence to the conjecture in a sense ofthe existence of a 2-factor. In fact; we only need the 4-connectivity with minimum degree atleast 5. In addition; our face-width condition is not huge. Specifically; we prove the followingtwo results.

Improved algorithm for the half-disjoint paths problem,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract In this paper; we consider the half integral disjoint paths packing. For a graph G andk pairs of vertices (s 1; t 1);(s 2; t 2);...;(sk; tk) in G; the objective is to find paths P 1;...; P k in Gsuch that P i joins si and ti for i= 1; 2;...; k; and in addition; each vertex is on at most two ofthese paths. We give a polynomial-time algorithm to decide the feasibility of this problemwith k= O ((log n/loglog n) 1/12). This improves a result by Kleinberg [12] who proved thesame conclusion when k= O ((loglog n) 2/15). Our algorithm still works for several problemsrelated to the bounded unsplittable flow. These results can all carry over to problemsinvolving edge capacities. Our main technical contribution is to give a “crossbar” of apolynomial size of the tree-width of the graph.,*,2010,2
Approximating list-coloring on a fixed surface,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract It is well-known that approximating the chromatic number within a factor of n 1− εcannot be done in polynomial time for any ε> 0; unless coRP= NP. Also; it is known thatcomputing the list-chromatic number is much harder than the chromatic number (assumingthat the complexity classes NP and coNP are different). In fact; the problem of deciding if agiven graph is f-list-colorable for a function f: V→{k− 1; k} for k≥ 3 is Π 2 p-complete. In thispaper; we are concerned with the following questions: 1 Given a graph embedded on asurface of bounded genus; what is its list-chromatic number? 1 Given a graph embedded ona surface of bounded genus with list-chromatic number k; what is the least l (l≥ k) such thatthe graph can be efficiently and legally colored given a list (coloring scheme) of order l?

A Note on Hamiltonian Cycles in (k; n)-Factor-Critical Graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract. A graph G is said to be (k; n)-factor-critical if GS has a k-factor for any S СV (G) with|S|= n. In [7]; the author; Ota and Saito conjectured that if G is a 2-connected (k; n)-factor-critical graph of order p with σ3 (G)> 3 2 (pnk); then G is hamiltonian with some exceptions.In [7]; the author; Ota and Saito also characterized all those graphs which satisfy theassumption of the conjecture; but are not 1-tough and; by using this; they verified theconjecture for k= 1 and 2.

Polylogarithmic approximation for minimum planarization (almost),Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Anastasios Sidiropoulos,Abstract: In the minimum planarization problem; given some $ n $-vertex graph; the goal isto find a set of vertices of minimum cardinality whose removal leaves a planar graph. This isa fundamental problem in topological graph theory. We present a $\log^{O (1)} n $-approximation algorithm for this problem on general graphs with running time $ n^{O (\logn/\log\log n)} $. We also obtain a $ O (n^\varepsilon) $-approximation with running time $n^{O (1/\varepsilon)} $ for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon> 0$. Prior to our work;no non-trivial algorithm was known for this problem on general graphs; and the best knownresult even on graphs of bounded degree was a $ n^{\Omega (1)} $-approximation [Chekuriand Sidiropoulos 2013]. As an immediate corollary; we also obtain improved approximationalgorithms for the crossing number problem on graphs of bounded degree. Specifically …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.04723,2017,1
Packing edge-disjoint odd Eulerian subgraphs through prescribed vertices in 4-edge-connected graphs,Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,In this paper; we show the Erdös--Pósa property for edge-disjoint packing of S-closedwalks with parity constraints in 4-edge-connected graphs. More precisely; we prove that forany 4-edge-connected graph G and any vertex subset S; either G has k edge-disjointelementary closed odd walks; each of which has at least one vertex of S; or G has an edgeset F with |F|≦f(k) such that GF has no such walks. The 4-edge-connectivity is the bestpossible in the sense that 3-edge-connected graphs do not satisfy the statement. Since theproof is constructive; we can design a fixed-parameter algorithm for finding k edge-disjointwalks satisfying the conditions in a 4-edge-connected graph for a parameter k. In addition;this gives a simple fixed-parameter algorithm for the parity edge-disjoint walks problem withk terminal pairs.,SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics,2017,1
Optimal Pricing for Submodular Valuations with Bounded Curvature.,Takanori Maehara; Yasushi Kawase; Hanna Sumita; Katsuya Tono; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract The optimal pricing problem is a fundamental problem that arises in combinatorialauctions. Suppose that there is one seller who has indivisible items and multiple buyers whowant to purchase a combination of the items. The seller wants to sell his items for the highestpossible prices; and each buyer wants to maximize his utility (ie; valuation minus payment)as long as his payment does not exceed his budget. The optimal pricing problem seeks aprice of each item and an assignment of items to buyers such that every buyer achieves themaximum utility under the prices. The goal of the problem is to maximize the total paymentfrom buyers. In this paper; we consider the case that the valuations are submodular. Weshow that the problem is computationally hard even if there exists only one buyer. Then wepropose approximation algorithms for the unlimited budget case. We also extend the …,AAAI,2017,1
5-connected toroidal graphs are Hamiltonian-connected,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Kenta Ozeki,The problem on the Hamiltonicity of graphs is well studied in discrete algorithm and graphtheory because of its relation to the traveling salesman problem. Starting with Tutte's result;stating that every 4-connected planar graph is Hamiltonian; several researchers havestudied the Hamiltonicity of graphs on surfaces. Extending Tutte's technique; Thomassenproved that every 4-connected planar graph is in fact Hamiltonian-connected; ie; there is aHamiltonian path connecting any two prescribed vertices. For graphs on the torus; Thomasand Yu showed that every 5-connected graph on the torus has a Hamiltonian cycle. In thispaper; we prove the following result which generalizes Thomas and Yu's result.

Connectivity Preserving Iterative Compaction and Finding 2 Disjoint Rooted Paths in Linear Time,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Zhentao Li; Bruce Reed,Abstract: In this paper we show how to combine two algorithmic techniques to obtain lineartime algorithms for various optimization problems on graphs; and present a subroutinewhich will be useful in doing so. The first technique is iterative shrinking. In the first phase ofan iterative shrinking algorithm; we construct a sequence of graphs of decreasing size $G_1;\ldots; G_\ell $ where $ G_1 $ is the initial input; $ G_\ell $ is a graph on which theproblem is easy; and $ G_i $ is obtained from $ G_ {i+ 1} $ via some shrinking algorithm. Inthe second phase we work through the sequence in reverse; repeatedly constructing asolution for a graph from the solution for its successor. In an iterative compaction algorithm;we insist that the graphs decrease by a constant fraction of the entire graph.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.07680,2015,1
Existence of outsiders as a characteristic of online communication networks,Taro Takaguchi; Takanori Maehara; Masashi Toyoda; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract: Online social networking services (SNSs) involve communication activitiesbetween large number of individuals over the public Internet and their crawled records areoften regarded as proxies of real (ie; offline) interaction structure. However; structureobserved in these records might differ from real counterparts because individuals maybehave differently online and non-human accounts may even participate. To understand thedifference between online and real social networks; we investigate an empiricalcommunication network between users on Twitter; which is perhaps one of the largest SNSs.We define a network of user pairs that send reciprocal messages.

A connected subgraph maintaining high connectivity,Shinya Fujita; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract It was proved by Mader that; for every integer l; every k-connected graph ofsufficiently large order contains a vertex set X of order precisely l such that G− X is (k− 2)-connected. This is no longer true if we require X to be connected; even for l= 3. Motivated bythis fact; we are trying to find an “obstruction” for k-connected graphs without such aconnected subgraph. It turns out that the obstruction is an essentially 3-connected subgraphW such that G− W is still highly connected. More precisely; our main result says thefollowing. For k≥ 7 and every k-connected graph G; either there exists a connectedsubgraph W of order 4 in G such that G− W is (k− 2)-connected; or else G contains an“essentially” 3-connected subgraph W; ie; a subdivision of a 3-connected graph; such thatG− W is still highly connected—actually;(k− 6)-connected.

Testing subdivision-freeness: property testing meets structural graph theory,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yuichi Yoshida,Abstract Testing a property P of graphs in the bounded-degree model deals with thefollowing problem: given a graph G of bounded degree d; we should distinguish (withprobability 2/3; say) between the case that G satisfies P and the case that one shouldadd/remove at least ε dn edges of $ G $ to make it satisfy P. In sharp contrast to propertytesting of dense graphs; which is relatively well understood; only few properties are knownto be testable with a constant number of queries in the bounded-degree model. In particular;no global monotone (ie;~ closed under edge deletions) property that expander graphs cansatisfy has been shown to be testable in constant time so far. In this paper; we identify for thefirst time a natural family of global monotone property that expander graphs can satisfy andcan be efficiently tested in the bounded degree model.

An approximation algorithm for the bipartite traveling tournament problem,Richard Hoshino; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,The bipartite traveling tournament problem (BTTP) is an NP-complete scheduling problemwhose solution is a double round-robin inter-league tournament with minimum total traveldistance. The 2 n-team BTTP is a variant of the well-known traveling salesman problem(TSP); albeit much harder as it involves the simultaneous coordination of 2 n teams playinga sequence of home and away games under fixed constraints; rather than a single entitypassing through the locations corresponding to the teams' home venues. As the BTTPrequires a distance-optimal schedule linking venues in close proximity; we provide anapproximation algorithm for the BTTP based on an approximate solution to thecorresponding TSP. We prove that our polynomial-time algorithm generates a 2 n-team inter-league tournament schedule whose total distance is at most 1+ 2 c/3+(3− c)/(3 n) times …,Mathematics of Operations Research,2013,1

A graph G is ℓ-knitted if (G; S) is knitted for all S⊆ V (G)with| S|= ℓ. In this paper; we prove that every 9ℓ-connected graph is ℓ-knitted. HadwigerʼsConjecture states that every k-chromatic graph contains a K k-minor. We use the aboveresult to prove that the connectivity of minimal counterexamples to Hadwigerʼs Conjectureis at least k/9; which was proved to be at least 2 k/27 in Kawarabayashi (2007)[4].,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2013,1

A simple algorithm for 4-coloring 3-colorable planar graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Kenta Ozeki,Abstract Graph coloring for 3-colorable graphs receives very much attention by manyresearchers in theoretical computer science. Deciding 3-colorability of a graph is a well-known NP-complete problem. So far; the best known polynomial approximation algorithmachieves a factor of O (n 0.2072); and there is a strong evidence that there would be nopolynomial time algorithm to color 3-colorable graphs using at most c colors for an absoluteconstant c. In this paper; we consider 3-colorable PLANAR graphs. The Four Color Theorem(4CT)(Appel and Haken (1977)[1]; Appel et al.(1977)[2]; Robertson et al.(1997)[14]) gives anO (n 2) time algorithm to 4-color any planar graph. However the current known proof for the4CT is computer assisted. In addition; the correctness of the proof is still lengthy andcomplicated.

Our main result is the following; for any integer k; there is anabsolute constant ck satisfying the following; let G be a graph with at least ck vertices suchthat the minimum degree of G is at least 2k.

Then either (1) G contains aninduced path P from s to t such that G− V (P) is not bipartite or (2) G can be embedded in theplane so that every odd face contains one of s or t. Furthermore; if (1) holds then we caninsist that G− V (P) is connected; while if G is 5-connected then (1) must hold and P can bechosen so that G− V (P) is 2-connected.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2009,1

The Erdős–Pósa property for edge-disjoint immersions in 4-edge-connected graphs,Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract A graph H is immersed in a graph G if the vertices of H are mapped to distinctvertices of G; and the edges of H are mapped to paths joining the corresponding pairs ofvertices of G; in such a way that the paths are pairwise edge-disjoint. In this paper; we showthat the Erdős–Pósa property holds for packing edge-disjoint K t K t-immersions in 4-edge-connected graphs. More precisely; for positive integers k and t; there exists a constant f (k; t) f(k; t) such that a 4-edge-connected graph G has either k edge-disjoint K t K t-immersions; oran edge subset F of size at most f (k; t) f (k; t) such that G− FG− F has no K t K t-immersion.The 4-edge-connectivity in this statement is best possible in the sense that 3-edge-connected graphs do not have the Erdős–Pósa property.,Journal of Combinatorial Theory; Series B,2018,*

Given a graph G=(V; E) with two distinguished vertices s; t∈ V and an integerparameter L> 0; an L-bounded cut is a subset F of edges (vertices) such that the every pathbetween s and t in G\F has length more than L. The task is to find an L-bounded cut ofminimum cardinality. Though the problem is very simple to state and has been studied sincethe beginning of the 70's; it is not much understood yet. The problem is known to be NP-hardto approximate within a small constant factor even for L≥ 4 (for L≥ 5 for the vertex–deletionversion). On the other hand; the best known approximation algorithm for general graphs hasapproximation ratio only O (n2/3) in the edge case; and O (,*,2018,*
A Polynomial Excluded-Minor Approximation of Treedepth,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Benjamin Rossman,Abstract Treedepth is a well-studied graph invariant in the family of “width measures” thatincludes treewidth and pathwidth. Understanding these invariants in terms of excludedminors has been an active area of research. The recent Grid Minor Theorem of Chekuri andChuzhoy [12] establishes that treewidth is polynomially approximated by the largest k× k gridminor. In this paper; we give a similar polynomial excluded-minor approximation fortreedepth in terms of three basic obstructions: grids; tree; and paths. Specifically; we showthat there is a constant c such that every graph of treedepth≥ kc contains one of thefollowing minors (each of treedepth≥ k): the k× k grid; the complete binary tree of height k;the path of order 2 k. Let us point out that we cannot drop any of the above graphs for ourpurpose. Moreover; given a graph G we can; in randomized polynomial time; find either …,*,2018,*

Think Globally; Embed Locally---Locally Linear Meta-embedding of Words,Danushka Bollegala; Kohei Hayashi; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract: Distributed word embeddings have shown superior performances in numerousNatural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However; their performances vary significantlyacross different tasks; implying that the word embeddings learnt by those methods capturecomplementary aspects of lexical semantics. Therefore; we believe that it is important tocombine the existing word embeddings to produce more accurate and complete\emph {meta-embeddings} of words. For this purpose; we propose an unsupervised locally linear meta-embedding learning method that takes pre-trained word embeddings as the input; andproduces more accurate meta embeddings. Unlike previously proposed meta-embeddinglearning methods that learn a global projection over all words in a vocabulary; our proposedmethod is sensitive to the differences in local neighbourhoods of the individual source …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06671,2017,*
Learning linear transformations between counting-based and prediction-based word embeddings,Danushka Bollegala; Kohei Hayashi; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Despite the growing interest in prediction-based word embedding learning methods; itremains unclear as to how the vector spaces learnt by the prediction-based methods differfrom that of the counting-based methods; or whether one can be transformed into the other.To study the relationship between counting-based and prediction-based embeddings; wepropose a method for learning a linear transformation between two given sets of wordembeddings. Our proposal contributes to the word embedding learning research in threeways:(a) we propose an efficient method to learn a linear transformation between two sets ofword embeddings;(b) using the transformation learnt in (a); we empirically show that it ispossible to predict distributed word embeddings for novel unseen words; and (c) empiricallyit is possible to linearly transform counting-based embeddings to prediction-based …,PloS one,2017,*
An iterative approach for the global estimation of sentence similarity,Tomoyuki Kajiwara; Danushka Bollegala; Yuichi Yoshida; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Measuring the similarity between two sentences is often difficult due to their small lexicaloverlap. Instead of focusing on the sets of features in two given sentences between whichwe must measure similarity; we propose a sentence similarity method that considers twotypes of constraints that must be satisfied by all pairs of sentences in a given corpus.Namely;(a) if two sentences share many features in common; then it is likely that theremaining features in each sentence are also related; and (b) if two sentences contain manyrelated features; then those two sentences are themselves similar. The two constraints areutilized in an iterative bootstrapping procedure that simultaneously updates both word andsentence similarity scores.

Using $ k $-way Co-occurrences for Learning Word Embeddings,Danushka Bollegala; Yuichi Yoshida; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract: Co-occurrences between two words provide useful insights into the semantics ofthose words. Consequently; numerous prior work on word embedding learning have usedco-occurrences between two words as the training signal for learning word embeddings.However; in natural language texts it is common for multiple words to be related and co-occurring in the same context. We extend the notion of co-occurrences to cover $ k (\geq\!\!2) $-way co-occurrences among a set of $ k $-words. Specifically; we prove a theoreticalrelationship between the joint probability of $ k (\geq\!\! 2) $ words; and the sum of $\ell_2 $norms of their embeddings. Next; we propose a learning objective motivated by ourtheoretical result that utilises $ k $-way co-occurrences for learning word embeddings. Ourexperimental results show that the derived theoretical relationship does indeed hold …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.01199,2017,*
Additive non-approximability of chromatic number in proper minor-closed classes,Zdeněk Dvořák; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract: Robin Thomas asked whether for every proper minor-closed class C; there exists apolynomial-time algorithm approximating the chromatic number of graphs from C up to aconstant additive error independent on the class C. We show this is not the case: unless P=NP; for every integer k>= 1; there is no polynomial-time algorithm to color a K_ {4k+ 1}-minor-free graph G using at most chi (G)+ k-1 colors. More generally; for every k>= 1 and1<=\beta<= 4/3; there is no polynomial-time algorithm to color a K_ {4k+ 1}-minor-free graphG using less than beta. chi (G)+(4-3beta) k colors. As far as we know; this is the first non-trivial non-approximability result regarding the chromatic number in proper minor-closedclasses.

Coarsening Massive Influence Networks for Scalable Diffusion Analysis,Naoto Ohsaka; Tomohiro Sonobe; Sumio Fujita; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Fueled by the increasing popularity of online social networks; social influenceanalysis has attracted a great deal of research attention in the past decade. The diffusionprocess is often modeled using influence graphs; and there has been a line of research thatinvolves algorithmic problems in influence graphs. However; the vast size of today's real-world networks raises a serious issue with regard to computational efficiency. In this paper;we propose a new algorithm for reducing influence graphs. Given an input influence graph;the proposed algorithm produces a vertex-weighted influence graph; which is compact andapproximates the diffusion properties of the input graph. The central strategy of influencegraph reduction is coarsening; which has the potential to greatly reduce the number ofedges by merging a vertex set into a single weighted vertex.

Matching extension missing vertices and edges in triangulations of surfaces,Ken‐ichi Kawarabayashi; Kenta Ozeki; Michael D Plummer,In [10] (and independently in [9]) it was shown that every 5-connected planar graph with an evennumber of vertices is 2-extendable.

Scalable Algorithm for Higher-Order Co-Clustering via Random Sampling.,Daisuke Hatano; Takuro Fukunaga; Takanori Maehara; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We propose a scalable and efficient algorithm for coclustering a higher-ordertensor. Viewing tensors with hypergraphs; we propose formulating the co-clustering of atensor as a problem of partitioning the corresponding hypergraph. Our algorithm is based onthe random sampling technique; which has been successfully applied to graph cutproblems. We extend a random sampling algorithm for the graph multiway cut problem tohypergraphs; and design a co-clustering algorithm based on it. Each iteration of ouralgorithm runs in polynomial on the size of hypergraphs; and thus it performs well even forhigher-order tensors; which are difficult to deal with for state-of-the-art algorithm.,AAAI,2017,*

Efficient Sublinear-Regret Algorithms for Online Sparse Linear Regression with Limited Observation,Shinji Ito; Daisuke Hatano; Hanna Sumita; Akihiro Yabe; Takuro Fukunaga; Naonori Kakimura; Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Online sparse linear regression is the task of applying linear regression analysis toexamples arriving sequentially subject to a resource constraint that a limited number offeatures of examples can be observed. Despite its importance in many practicalapplications; it has been recently shown that there is no polynomial-time sublinear-regretalgorithm unless NP $\subseteq $ BPP; and only an exponential-time sublinear-regretalgorithm has been found. In this paper; we introduce mild assumptions to solve theproblem. Under these assumptions; we present polynomial-time sublinear-regret algorithmsfor the online sparse linear regression. In addition; thorough experiments with publiclyavailable data demonstrate that our algorithms outperform other known algorithms.,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2017,*
An improved approximation algorithm for the subpath planning problem and its generalization,Hanna Sumita; Yuma Yonebayashi; Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract This paper focuses on a generalization of the traveling salesman problem (TSP);called the subpath planning problem (SPP).

SPP is one of thefundamental problems in both artificial intelligence and robotics.

An Improved Approximation Algorithm for the Edge-Disjoint Paths Problem with Congestion Two,Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract In the maximum edge-disjoint paths problem; we are given a graph and a collectionof pairs of vertices; and the objective is to find the maximum number of pairs that can berouted by edge-disjoint paths. An r-approximation algorithm for this problem is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds at least OPT/r edge-disjoint paths; where OPT denotes themaximum possible number of pairs that can be routed in a given instance. For a long time;an O (n ½-approximation algorithm has been best known for this problem even if acongestion of two is allowed; that is; each edge is allowed to be used in at most two of thepaths. In this article; we give a randomized O (n&frac; 37 &cdot; poly (log n))-approximationalgorithm with congestion two. This is the first result that breaks the O (n ½)-approximationalgorithm.

Coloring immersion-free graphs,Naonori Kakimura; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract A graph H is immersed in a graph G if the vertices of H are mapped to (distinct)vertices of G; and the edges of H are mapped to paths joining the corresponding pairs ofvertices of G; in such a way that the paths are pairwise edge-disjoint. The notion of animmersion is quite similar to the well-known notion of a minor; as structural approachinspired by the theory of graph minors has been extremely successful in immersions.Hadwiger's conjecture on graph coloring; generalizing the Four Color Theorem; states thatevery loopless graph without a K k-minor is (k− 1)-colorable; where K k is the completegraph on k vertices.

Enhanced Estimation of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality Using Auxiliary Distances,Oussama Chelly; Michael E Houle; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Estimating Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) is of high interest in many machine learningtasks; including dimensionality reduction; outlier detection; similarity search and subspaceclustering. Our proposed estimation strategy; ALID; makes use of a subset of the availableintra-neighborhood distances to achieve faster convergence with fewer samples; and canthus be used on applications in which the data consists of many natural groups of small size.Moreover; it has a smaller bias and variance than state-of-the-art estimators; especially onnonlinear subspaces. We provide a theoretical analysis of the properties of the ALIDestimator; and a thorough experimental framework that shows its faster convergence;smaller bias; and smaller variance compared with state-of-the-art estimators of ID.,*,2016,*

Weattempt to identify users who can find prospective popular items. Such visionary users arecalled observers. By adding observers to a favorite user list; they act to find popular items inadvance. To identify efficient observers; we propose a feature selection based framework.This uses a classifier to predict item popularity; where the input features are a set of userswho adopted an item before others. By training the classifier with sparse and non-negativeconstraints; observers are extracted as users whose parameters take a non-zero value. Inexperiments; we test our approach using real social bookmark datasets. The resultsdemonstrate that our approach can find popular items in advance more effectively thanbaseline methods.,IJCAI,2016,*
Non-separating subgraphs in highly connected graphs,Shinya Fujita; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract A well-known conjecture of Thomassen says that every (a+ b+ 1)-connected graphwith a≥ b can be decomposed into two parts A and B such that A is a-connected and B is b-connected. The case b= 2 is settled by Thomassen himself; but the conjecture is still open forb≥ 3. Motivated by this; we prove that every k-connected graph G (with k≥ 4) has asubgraph M such that either 1. M is 3-connected with at most 5 vertices (thus G− V (M) is (k−5)-connected); or 2. M is an induced cycle such that G− V (C) is (k− 2)-connected. This resultimproves previous known results by Egawa and Kawarabayashi; respectively. Our result isalso related to results and questions of Mader concerning critically k-connected graphs.

The edge density of critical digraphs,Richard Hoshino; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract Let χ (G) denote the chromatic number of a graph G. We say that G is k-critical if χ(G)= k and χ (H)< k for every proper subgraph H⊂ G. Over the years; many properties of k-critical graphs have been discovered; including improved upper and lower bounds for|| G||;the number of edges in ak-critical graph; as a function of| G|; the number of vertices. In thisnote; we analyze this edge density problem for directed graphs; where the chromaticnumber χ (D) of a digraph D is defined to be the fewest number of colours needed to colourthe vertices of D so that each colour class induces an acyclic subgraph.

Towards the Graph Minor Theorems for Directed Graphs,Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi; Stephan Kreutzer,Abstract Two key results of Robertson and Seymour's graph minor theory are: 1. a structuretheorem stating that all graphs excluding some fixed graph as a minor have a treedecomposition into pieces that are almost embeddable in a fixed surface. 2. the k-disjointpaths problem is tractable when k is a fixed constant: given a graph G and k pairs (s_1;t_1);...;(s_k; t_k) of vertices of G; decide whether there are k mutually vertex disjoint paths ofG; the i th path linking s_i and t_i for i= 1;\dots; k.

It has been shown to be NP-hard by [Thomassen'89] and a linear-time fixed-parameter algorithm has been obtained by [Mohar'99]. Despite extensive study; theapproximability of the Euler genus remains wide open.

A flow satisfying these requests is said to be at Nash equilibrium if everypath which carries a positive amount of flow is a shortest path between its source and sink.The goal of MCND is to find a subgraph H of G such that the flow at Nash equilibrium in H isoptimal.

Testing Subdivision-Freeness: Property Testing Meets Structural Graph Theory (コンピュテーション),Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Yuichi Yoshida,抄録 Testing a property P of graphs in the bounded-degree model deals with the followingproblem: given a graph G of bounded degree d; we should distinguish (with probability 2/3;say) between the case that G satisfies P and the case that one should add/remove at leastεdn edges of G to make it satisfy P. In sharp contrast to property testing of dense graphs;which is relatively well understood; only few properties are known to be testable with aconstant number of queries in the bounded-degree model. In particular; no global monotone(ie; closed under edge deletions) property that expander graphs can satisfy has been shownto be testable in constant time so far. In this paper; we identify for the first time a naturalfamily of global monotone property that expander graphs can satisfy and can be efficientlytested in the bounded degree model.

5-coloring K 3; k-minor-free graphs,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract A seminal result of Thomassen [40] says that there are only finitely many 6-color-critical graphs for the bounded genus graphs. This result is no longer true if we consider K 3;k-minor-free graphs. K 3; k-minor-free graphs are a significant generalization of bounded-genus graphs. They also contain infinitely many t-color-critical graphs for all t with k+ 2≥ t≥4. Motivated by this fact; we first show that if G is 6-color-critical 4-connected K 3; k-minor-free graphs; then G has tree-width at most g (k) for some function g of k.

Minors in large almost‐5‐connected non‐planar graphs,Ken‐Ichi Kawarabayashi; John Maharry,Abstract It is shown that every sufficiently large almost-5-connected non-planar graphcontains a minor isomorphic to an arbitrarily large graph from one of six families of graphs.The graphs in these families are also almost-5-connected; by which we mean that they are 4-connected and all 4-separations contain a “small” side.,Journal of Graph Theory,2012,*

Erdocombining double acute accents-Pósa property and its algorithmic applications-Parity constraints; subset feedback set; and subset packing,Naonori Kakimura; Ken Ichi Kawarabayashi; Yusuke Kobayashi,Abstract The well-known Erdocombining double acute accents-Pósa theorem says that forany integer k and any graph G; either G contains k vertex-disjoint cycles or a vertex set X oforder at most ck log k (for some constant c) such that GX is a forest. Thomassen [39]extended this result to the even cycles; but on the other hand; it is well-known that thistheorem is no longer true for the odd cycles. However; Reed [31] proved that this theoremstill holds if we relax k vertex-disjoint odd cycles to k odd cycles with each vertex in at mosttwo of them. These theorems initiate many researches in both graph theory and theoreticalcomputer science. In the graph theory side; our problem setting is that we are given a graphand a vertex set S; and we want to extend all the above results to cycles that are required togo through a subset of S; ie; each cycle contains at least one vertex in S (such a cycle is …,23rd Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms; SODA 2012,2012,*

High connectivity keeping connected subgraph,Shinya Fujita; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract It was proved by Mader that; for every integer l; every k-connected graph ofsufficiently large order contains a vertex set X of order precisely l such that G− X is (k− 2)-connected. This is no longer true if we require X to be connected; even for l= 3. Motivated bythis fact; we are trying to find an “obstruction” for k-connected graphs without such aconnected subgraph. It turns out that the obstruction is an essentially 3-connected subgraphW such that G− W is still highly connected. More precisely; our main result says thefollowing. For k⩾ 7 and every k-connected graph G; either there exists a connectedsubgraph W of order 4 in G such that G− W is (k− 2)-connected; or else G contains an“essentially” 3-connected subgraph W; ie; a subdivision of a 3-connected graph; such thatG− W is still highly connected; actually;(k− 6)-connected.

The Erdös-Lovász Tihany conjecture and complete minors,Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi; Anders Sune Pedersen; Bjarne Toft,Abstract The Erdos-Lovász Tihany Conjecture [Theory of Graphs (Proc. Colloq.; Tihany;1966); Academic Press; 1968] states that for any pair of integers $ s; t≥ 2$ and for anygraph $ G $ with chromatic number equal to $ s+ t− 1$ and clique number less than $ s+ t−1$ there are two disjoint subgraphs of $ G $ with chromatic number $ s $ and $ t $;respectively. The Erdos-Lovász Tihany Conjecture is still open except for a few small valuesof $ s $ and $ t $. Given the same hypothesis as in the Erdos-Lovász Tihany Conjecture; westudy the problem of finding two disjoint subgraphs of $ G $ with complete minors of order $s $ and $ t $; respectively. If Hadwiger's Conjecture holds; then this latter problem might beeasier to settle than the Erdos-Lovász Tihany Conjecture. In this paper we settle this latterproblem for a few small additional values of $ s $ and $ t $.,Journal of Combinatorics,2011,*

A note on traversing specified vertices in graphs embedded with large representativity,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Michael D Plummer,Abstract A graph G is said to have property P (2; k) if given any k+ 2 distinct vertices a; b; v1;…; vk; there is a path P in G joining a and b and passing through all of v 1;…; v k. A graphG is said to have property C (k) if given any k distinct vertices v 1;…; vk; there is a cycle C inG containing all of v 1;…; v k. It is shown that if a 4-connected graph G is embedded in anorientable surface Σ (other than the sphere) of Euler genus eg (G; Σ); with sufficiently largerepresentativity (as a function of both eg (G; Σ) and k); then G possesses both properties P(2; k) and C (k).,Discrete Mathematics,2010,*
New trends on Structural Graph Theory September 5–10; 2010,Boris Alexeev; Jessica McDOnald,Tuza conjectured that for every graph G; the maximum size of a set of edge disjoint trianglesis at most twice the minimum size of a set of edges meeting every triangle. Krivelevichproved that this result is true if we replace the set of edges with a fractional set and asked ifany further improvement on this bound might be possible.

LINKLESS AND FLAT EMBEDDINGS IN 3-SPACE IN QUADRATIC TIME,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Abstract We consider embeddings of graphs in the 3-space R 3 (all embeddings in thispaper are assumed to be piecewise linear). An embbeding of a graph in R3 is linkless ifevery pair of disjoint cycles forms a trivial link (in the sense of knot theory); ie; each of the twocycles (in R 3) can be embedded in a closed topological 2-disk disjoint from the other cycle.Robertson; Seymour and Thomas [38] showed that a graph has a linkless embedding in R 3if and only if it does not contain as a minor any of seven graphs in Petersen's family (graphsobtained from K6 by a series of YΔ and ΔY operations). They also showed that a graph islinklessly embeddable in R 3 if and only if it admits a flat embedding into R 3; ie anembedding such that for every cycle C of G; there exists a closed disk D⊆ R3 with D∩ G=∂D= C. Clearly; every flat embeddings is linkless; but the converse is not true.,*,2009,*

Nonseparating Induced Cycles Consisting of Contractible Edges in k-Connected Graphs,Yoshimi Egawa; Katsumi Inoue; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Egawa and Saito proved that every k-connected graph with girth at least 4 has an inducedcycle C such that GV(C) is (k-3)-connected; and every edge of C is contractible. This meansthat we can find not only a nonseparating cycle C but also one that consists of contractibleedges. Motivated by this result; we prove that if G is ak-connected graph which does notcontain K_4^-; then G has an induced cycle C such that GV(C) is (k-2)-connected and eitherevery edge of C is k-contractible or C is a triangle. As a corollary of this result; we get thefollowing result: Every k-connected graph with girth at least 4 has an induced cycle C suchthat GV(C) is (k-2)-connected; and every edge of C is contractible. This theorem is ageneralization of some known theorems. In particular; this generalizes the above-mentionedresult proved by Egawa and Saito and the result of Egawa which says that ak-connected …,SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics,2008,*

MR2130473 (2005m: 05202) 05C83 (05C40),G Chen; RJ Gould; K Kawarabayashi; F Pfender; B Wei,A graph is k-linked if for every set of 2k disjoint vertices x1;...; xk; y1;...; yk there exist k disjointpaths Pi such that Pi joins xi and yi. Thus every k-linked graph is k-connected but theconverse does not hold. A fundamental result of B. Bollobás and A. Thomason[Combinatorica 16 (1996); no. 3; 313–320; MR1417341 (97h: 05104)] is that every 2k-connected graph which contains a dense minor is k-linked. The present paper is concernedwith the case k= 3. The main result is that if a 6-connected graph G has a K− 9-minor; then itis 3-linked. Most of the proof deals with the case when the number of vertices of G liesbetween 9 and 14.

Algorithm Aspect of Graph Minor Theory,Ken-ichi KAWARABAYASHI,抄録 We shall survey recent progress on algorithm aspect of graph minor theory. One of themain results on Graph Minor Project by Robertson and Seymour is the following. Given agraph G and p pairs of vertices of G for fixed p; there is a polynomial time (actually O (n^ 3)algorithm to decide if there are p mutually disjoint paths of G linking the pair. If p is part of theinput of the problem; then this is one of Karp's NP-complete problems; and it remains NP-complete even for planar graphs. We shall first sketch the algorithm; and explain why thecorrectness needs* 500 pages to prove. Then we shall focus on applications of this result.Topics include tree-width for planar graphs; 2-path problem (2-linked graph); the odd disjointcycles; the parity paths problems; Kuratowski's theorem for general surface; nearly-k-bipartite graph problem and algorithm aspect of Hadwiger's conjecture.,電子情報通信学会技術研究報告.

Indeed; the problem of whether P= NP (or P 6¼ NP) is one of the mostoutstanding open problems in all of mathematics. A wider class of problems frommathematics; computer science; and perhaps operations research has been known to beNP-complete; and even today; the collection of NP-complete problems grows almost everyfew hours. In order to understand NP-hard problems; the research community comes to havea fairly good understanding of combinatorial structures in the past 40 years.

Ideal Drawings of Rooted Trees With Approximately Optimal Width,Therese Biedl,Abstract For rooted trees; an ideal drawing is one that is planar; straight-line; strictly-upward;and order-preserving. This paper considers ideal drawings of rooted trees with the objectiveof keeping the width of such drawings small. It is not known whether finding the minimumwidth is NP-hard or polynomial.

Journal of Computational Science,Michael Lülfesmann; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,Partial differential equations can be discretized using a regular Cartesian grid and a stencil-based method to approximate the partial derivatives. The computational effort fordetermining the associated Jacobian matrix can be reduced. This reduction can be modeledas a (grid) coloring problem. Currently; this problem is solved by using a heuristic approachfor general graphs or by developing a formula...,*,*,*
Unsupervised Feature Selection Using Local ID,Oussama CHELLY; Michael E HOULE; Ken-ichi KAWARABAYASHI,The unsupervised feature selection algorithm we propose:▶ is a filter approach withcompetitive complexity.▶ alleviates the effect of the “curse of dimensionality” by favoringlocal aspects of the data at the expense of global ones.▶ ranks features based on theirdiscriminative power.▶ makes no assumption regarding the distribution of data.▶ isapplicable to all numerical datasets with no restriction on the domain; the distance measuresor the learning task.,*,*,*

1 Overview of the Field,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bojan Mohar; Paul Seymour,Graphs are finite and may have loops and multiple edges. A graph H is a minor of a graph Kif H can be obtained from a subgraph of K by contracting edges. One of the most importantwork in graph theory is the Graph Minor Theory developed by Robertson and Seymour. Ittook more than 20 years to publish this seminal work in a series of 20+ long papers. Alltogether there are 23 papers; Graph Minors I–XXIII. The first 20 of these have been writtenback in the 1980's and have already appeared; the last one being published in 2004. GraphMinors project resulted in many theoretical advances;(eg a proof of Wagner's conjecture);but it also has algorithmic applications; and some of the methods have been successfullyused in practical computation.,*,*,*

Open Problem Garden,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Bojan Mohar,Hadwiger's conjecture asserts that every $ K_t $-\Def [minor]{Graph_minor}-free graph is$(t− 1) $-colourable. Robertson; Seymour and Thomas [RST] proved Hadwiger's conjecturefor $ t\leq 6$. It remains open for $ t\geq 7$. In fact; it is open whether every $ K_t $-minor-free graph is $ ct $-colourable for some constant $ c\geq 1$. It is natural to consideranalogous problems for\Def [list colourings]{List_coloring}.First; consider planar graphs.While every planar graph is 4-colourable; Erdös; Rubin and Taylor.[ERT] conjectured thatsome planar graph is not 4-list-colourable; and that every planar graph is 5-list-colourable.The first conjecture was verified by Voigt [V] and the second by Thomassen [T].,*,*,*

Beyond Grötzsch’s Theorem and Algorithmic applications,Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi; Carsten Thomassen,A graph is k-degenerate if each subgraph has a vertex of degree at most k. Clearly; every k-degenerate graph is (k+ 1)-colorable. Borodin [1] was perhaps the first to suggest to improvethis upper bound on the chromatic number by partitioning the vertex set into two sets whichinduce graphs with better degeneracy properties. Specifically he conjectured that everyplanar graph (which is 5-degenerate by Euler's formula) has a vertex partition whose partsinduce a 1-degenerate and a 2-degenerate graph; respectively; and another a vertexpartition whose parts induce a 0-degenerate and a 3-degenerate graph; respectively. Theseconjectures were proved in [5] and [6]; respectively. In this paper we show that alsoGrötzsch's theorem can be proved by a degeneracy argument as follows:,*,*,*

Some results concerning non-separating subgraphs in k-connected graphs,Shinya Fujita; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi,All graphs considered here are finite; undirected; and without loops or multiple edges. Wereport some recent results on non-separating subgraphs in highly connected graphs. Here anon-separating subgraph denotes a subgraph whose deletion keeps high connectivity. Notethat if we delete a contractible edge in a k-connected graph; the resulting graph will be (k− 1)-connected. Hence; the existence of a contractible subgraph shows the existence of a non-separating subgaph at the same time. In this talk; we focus on the existence of non-separating subgraphs in highly connected graphs; and introduce some related results.,*,*,*
