In this paper; by using multiscale wavelet features; we proposea novel coarse-to-fine algorithm that is able to locate text lines even under complexbackground. First; in the coarse detection; after the wavelet energy feature is calculated tolocate all possible text pixels; a density-based region growing method is developed toconnect these pixels into regions which are further separated into candidate text lines bystructural information.

Fast mode decision algorithm for intra prediction in HEVC,Liang Zhao; Li Zhang; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao,As the next generation standard of video coding; the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)is intended to provide significantly better coding efficiency than all existing video codingstandards. To improve the coding efficiency of intra frame coding; up to 34 intra predictionmodes are defined in HEVC. The best mode among these pre-defined intra predictionmodes is selected by rate-distortion optimization (RDO) for each block. If all directions aretested in the RDO process; it will be very time-consuming. To alleviate the encodercomputation load; this paper proposes a new method to reduce the candidates in RDOprocess. In addition; the direction information of the neighboring blocks is made full use of tospeed up intra mode decision.

Group-based sparse representation for image restoration,Jian Zhang; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Traditional patch-based sparse representation modeling of natural images usually sufferfrom two problems. First; it has to solve a large-scale optimization problem with highcomputational complexity in dictionary learning. Second; each patch is consideredindependently in dictionary learning and sparse coding; which ignores the relationshipamong patches; resulting in inaccurate sparse coding coefficients. In this paper; instead ofusing patch as the basic unit of sparse representation; we exploit the concept of group as thebasic unit of sparse representation; which is composed of nonlocal patches with similarstructures; and establish a novel sparse representation modeling of natural images; calledgroup-based sparse representation (GSR). The proposed GSR is able to sparsely representnatural images in the domain of group; which enforces the intrinsic local sparsity and …,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2014,199
Joint source-channel rate-distortion optimization for H. 264 video coding over error-prone networks,Yuan Zhang; Wen Gao; Yan Lu; Qingming Huang; Debin Zhao,For a typical video distribution system; the video contents are first compressed and thenstored in the local storage or transmitted to the end users through networks. While thecompressed videos are transmitted through error-prone networks; error robustness becomesan important issue. In the past years; a number of rate-distortion (RD) optimized codingmode selection schemes have been proposed for error-resilient video coding; including arecursive optimal per-pixel estimate (ROPE) method. However; the ROPE-relatedapproaches assume integer-pixel motion-compensated prediction rather than subpixelprediction; whose extension to H. 264 is not straightforward. Alternatively; an error-robustRD optimization (ER-RDO) method has been included in H. 264 test model; in which theestimate of pixel distortion is derived by simulating decoding process multiple times in the …,IEEE Transactions on multimedia,2007,174
Joint video/depth rate allocation for 3D video coding based on view synthesis distortion model,Yanwei Liu; Qingming Huang; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract Joint video/depth rate allocation is an important optimization problem in 3D videocoding. To address this problem; this paper proposes a distortion model to evaluate thesynthesized view without access to the captured original view. The proposed distortionmodel is an additive model that accounts for the video-coding-induced distortion and thedepth-quantization-induced distortion; as well as the inherent geometry distortion. Depth-quantization-induced distortion not only considers the warping error distortion; which isdescribed by a piecewise linear model with the video power spectral property; but also takesinto account the warping error correlation distortion between two sources reference views.Geometry distortion is approximated from that of the adjacent view synthesis. Based on theproposed distortion model; a joint rate allocation method is proposed to seek the optimal …,Signal Processing: Image Communication,2009,126
Object detection using spatial histogram features,Hongming Zhang; Wen Gao; Xilin Chen; Debin Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we propose an object detection approach using spatial histogramfeatures. As spatial histograms consist of marginal distributions of an image over localpatches; they can preserve texture and shape information of an object simultaneously. Weemploy Fisher criterion and mutual information to measure discriminability and featurescorrelation of spatial histogram features. We further train a hierarchical classifier bycombining cascade histogram matching and support vector machine. The cascadehistogram matching is trained via automatically selected discriminative features.

How to reduce the recognition time without loss ofaccuracy is a challenging issue. In this paper; a fuzzy decision tree with heterogeneousclassifiers is proposed for large vocabulary sign language recognition. As each sign featurehas the different discrimination to gestures; the corresponding classifiers are presented forthe hierarchical decision to sign language attributes.

A Chinese sign language recognition system based on SOFM/SRN/HMM,Wen Gao; Gaolin Fang; Debin Zhao; Yiqiang Chen,Abstract In sign language recognition (SLR); the major challenges now are developingmethods that solve signer-independent continuous sign problems. In this paper; SOFM/HMMis first presented for modeling signer-independent isolated signs. The proposed methoduses the self-organizing feature maps (SOFM) as different signers' feature extractor forcontinuous hidden Markov models (HMM) so as to transform input signs into significant andlow-dimensional representations that can be well modeled by the emission probabilities ofHMM. Based on these isolated sign models; a SOFM/SRN/HMM model is then proposed forsigner-independent continuous SLR. This model applies the improved simple recurrentnetwork (SRN) to segment continuous sign language in terms of transformed SOFMrepresentations; and the outputs of SRN are taken as the HMM states in which the lattice …,Pattern Recognition,2004,101

In the face like regions; each 19× 19 pixel window at different scales is taken as aface candidate. Then a co arse to fine strategy is designed to acquire accurate face rotationdegree with a neural network and by an iris locating operation. According to the acquired rotation degree; each face candidate window is rotated to be upright. Finally; the feature-based front face detector is developed to verify face patterns.

We introduce a new model; named as effectcomponents description (ECD); to model the variation of the background; by which we canrelate the best estimate of the background to the modes (local maxima) of the underlyingdistribution. Based on ECD; an effective background generation method; most reliablebackground mode (MRBM); is developed.

Image interpolation via regularized local linear regression,Xianming Liu; Debin Zhao; Ruiqin Xiong; Siwei Ma; Wen Gao; Huifang Sun,The linear regression model is a very attractive tool to design effective image interpolationschemes. Some regression-based image interpolation algorithms have been proposed inthe literature; in which the objective functions are optimized by ordinary least squares (OLS).However; it is shown that interpolation with OLS may have some undesirable properties froma robustness point of view: even small amounts of outliers can dramatically affect theestimates. To address these issues; in this paper we propose a novel image interpolationalgorithm based on regularized local linear regression (RLLR). Starting with the linearregression model where we replace the OLS error norm with the moving least squares(MLS) error norm leads to a robust estimator of local image structure.

Image compressive sensing recovery via collaborative sparsity,Jian Zhang; Debin Zhao; Chen Zhao; Ruiqin Xiong; Siwei Ma; Wen Gao,Compressive sensing (CS) has drawn quite an amount of attention as a joint sampling andcompression approach. Its theory shows that when the signal is sparse enough in somedomain; it can be decoded from many fewer measurements than suggested by the Nyquistsampling theory. So one of the most challenging researches in CS is to seek a domainwhere a signal can exhibit a high degree of sparsity and hence be recovered faithfully. Mostof the conventional CS recovery approaches; however; exploited a set of fixed bases (eg;DCT; wavelet; and gradient domain) for the entirety of a signal; which are irrespective of thenonstationarity of natural signals and cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity; thusresulting in poor rate-distortion performance.

Wyner–Ziv-based multiview video coding,Xun Guo; Yan Lu; Feng Wu; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Utilizing video correlations among views would definitely improve multiview videocompression in terms of coding efficiency; which usually requests an expensive system tocollect videos from different cameras and jointly compress them. Thanks to recentdevelopments on distributed video coding; this paper proposes a new multiview videocoding scheme based on Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding technique; in which the complicatedtemporal and interview correlation exploration process is shifted from the encoder side to thedecoder side so that broadband raw data traffic and high intensive computation for jointlyencoding can be avoided. At the encoder side; a wavelet-based WZ scheme is proposed tocompress video of every camera. Furthermore; in order to better utilize correlation in waveletdomain; all coefficients are organized as that done in SPIHT bit plane by bit plane.

Image compressive sensing recovery using adaptively learned sparsifying basis via L0 minimization,Jian Zhang; Chen Zhao; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract From many fewer acquired measurements than suggested by the Nyquist samplingtheory; compressive sensing (CS) theory demonstrates that; a signal can be reconstructedwith high probability when it exhibits sparsity in some domain. Most of the conventional CSrecovery approaches; however; exploited a set of fixed bases (eg DCT; wavelet and gradientdomain) for the entirety of a signal; which are irrespective of the non-stationarity of naturalsignals and cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity; thus resulting in poor CSrecovery performance. In this paper; we propose a new framework for image compressivesensing recovery using adaptively learned sparsifying basis via L0 minimization.

Extended Fisherface for face recognition from a single example image per person,Shiguang Shan; Bo Cao; Wen Gao; Debin Zhao,We extend Fisherface for face recognition from one example image per person. Fisherface isone of the most successful face recognition methods. However; Fisherface requires severaltraining images for each face; so it cannot be applied to face recognition applications whereonly one example image per person is available for training. To tackle this problem; weextended the Fisherface method by proposing a method to derive multiple images of a facefrom one single image. Fisherface is then trained on these derived images. Experimentalresults on the Bern face database and our 350 subjects database show that our methodmakes impressive performance improvement compared with the conventional eigenfacesand template matching techniques.,Circuits and Systems; 2002.

In the proposed rate control technique; an image-stitching method isfirst utilized to simultaneously encode video and depth; and then a joint rate controlalgorithm for MVD is presented. The joint rate control algorithm is performed on three levels;namely view level; video/depth level and frame level. In the view level; different proportionsof rates are allocated for different types of views according to the pre-statistical rateallocation. In the video/depth level; the target rates for video and depth are discriminatorilyassigned to guarantee the high quality of video for the backward-compatible display.

However; the heavy computational complexity limits its practical applications. Inthis paper; a fast disparity and motion estimation for multiview video coding is presented;based on the correlations between the neighboring cameras and between the motion andthe disparity. In the proposed approach; first; a search region estimation is proposed toreduce the disparity estimation complexity according to that the camera set is usually fixedand therefore the disparity between the two neighboring views can be limited to anestimable range.

Face recognition based on face‐specific subspace,Shiguang Shan; Wen Gao; Debin Zhao,Abstract In this article; we present an individual appearance model based method; namedface-specific subspace (FSS); for recognizing human faces under variation in lighting;expression; and viewpoint. This method derives from the traditional Eigenface but differsfrom it in essence. In Eigenface; each face image is represented as a point in a low-dimensional face subspace shared by all faces; however; the experiments conducted showone of the demerits of such a strategy: it fails to accurately represent the mostdiscriminanting features of a specific face. Therefore; we propose to model each face withone individual face subspace; named Face-Specific Subspace. Distance from the face-specific subspace; that is; the reconstruction error; is then exploited as the similaritymeasurement for identification. Furthermore; to enable the proposed approach to solve …,International journal of imaging systems and technology,2003,56
Low-complexity and low-memory entropy coder for image compression,Debin Zhao; YK Chan; Wen Gao,A low-complexity and low-memory entropy coder (LLEC) is proposed for imagecompression. The two key elements in the LLEC are zerotree coding and Golomb-Rice(1966; 1991) codes. Zerotree coding exploits the zerotree structure of transformedcoefficients for higher compression efficiency. GR codes are used to code the remainingcoefficients in a variable-length codes/variable-length integer manner resulting in JPEGsimilar computational complexity. The proposed LLEC does not use any Huffman table;significant/insignificant list; or arithmetic coding; and therefore its memory requirement isminimized with respect to any known image entropy coder.

Improved total variation based image compressive sensing recovery by nonlocal regularization,Jian Zhang; Shaohui Liu; Ruiqin Xiong; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao,Recently; total variation (TV) based minimization algorithms have achieved great success incompressive sensing (CS) recovery for natural images due to its virtue of preserving edges.However; the use of TV is not able to recover the fine details and textures; and often suffersfrom undesirable staircase artifact. To reduce these effects; this paper presents an improvedTV based image CS recovery algorithm by introducing a new nonlocal regularizationconstraint into CS optimization problem. The nonlocal regularization is built on the wellknown nonlocal means (NLM) filtering and takes advantage of self-similarity in images;which helps to suppress the staircase effect and restore the fine details. Furthermore; anefficient augmented Lagrangian based algorithm is developed to solve the above combinedTV and nonlocal regularization constrained problem.

No-reference perceptual image quality metric using gradient profiles for JPEG2000,Luhong Liang; Shiqi Wang; Jianhua Chen; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract No-reference measurement of perceptual image quality is a crucial and challengingissue in modern image processing applications. One of the major difficulties is that someinherent features of natural images and artifacts are possibly rather ambiguous. In thispaper; we tackle this problem using statistical information on image gradient profiles andpropose a novel quality metric for JPEG2000 images. The key part of the metric is ahistogram representing the sharpness distribution of the gradient profiles; from which a blurmetric that is insensitive to inherently blurred structures in the natural image is established.Then a ringing metric is built based on ringing visibilities of regions associated with thegradient profiles. Finally; a combination model optimized through plenty of experiments isdeveloped to predict the perceived image quality. The proposed metric achieves …,Signal Processing: Image Communication,2010,52

In this paper; HFto be estimated is considered as a combination of two components: main high-frequency(MHF) and residual high-frequency (RHF); and we propose a novel image super-resolutionmethod via dual-dictionary learning and sparse representation; which consists of the maindictionary learning and the residual dictionary learning; to recover MHF and RHFrespectively.

It is a change-based motion object extraction approach; which discriminatesbackground and moving objects by means of the higher-order statistics (HOS) performed onthe interframe differences of DC image. The DC image is partly decoded picture from thecompressed video for the rapid reconstruction of image data. In order to employ an optimalthreshold in moving object detection stage; the background is detected by the Moment-preserving thresholding technique for each frame. Based on the background statistic; theproportion of background variance is employed to extract the final object mask bycomparison with the fourth moment measure and the variance.

D-Cast: DSC based soft mobile video broadcast,Xiaopeng Fan; Feng Wu; Debin Zhao,Abstract Mobile video broadcasting is a popular application of wireless network. However;the traditional layer based approaches have limited supports to the accommodation of userswith diverse channel conditions. The newly emerged Softcast approach provides smoothmulticast performance but is not very efficient in inter frame compression. In this work; wepropose a new video multicast approach: D-cast. Instead of using conventional close loopprediction (CLP); D-cast is based on distributed source coding (DSC) theory. This helps D-cast to avoid error propagation but still achieve high compression efficiency in inter framecoding. D-cast outperforms softcast 3--5dB in video PSNR while maintaining the similargraceful degradation feature as softcast. In addition; D-cast is efficient in not only narrowband channel but also wide band channel.,Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia,2011,39
Interpolation-dependent image downsampling,Yongbing Zhang; Debin Zhao; Jian Zhang; Ruiqin Xiong; Wen Gao,Traditional methods for image downsampling commit to remove the aliasing artifacts.However; the influences on the quality of the image interpolated from the downsampled oneare usually neglected. To tackle this problem; in this paper; we propose an interpolation-dependent image downsampling (IDID); where interpolation is hinged to downsampling.Given an interpolation method; the goal of IDID is to obtain a downsampled image thatminimizes the sum of square errors between the input image and the one interpolated fromthe corresponding downsampled image. Utilizing a least squares algorithm; the solution ofIDID is derived as the inverse operator of upsampling. We also devise a content-dependentIDID for the interpolation methods with varying interpolation coefficients. Numerousexperimental results demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the proposed IDID.,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2011,39

A fast inter frame prediction algorithm for multi-view video coding,Xiaoming Li; Debin Zhao; Xiangyang Ji; Qiang Wang; Wen Gao,The multi-view video coding improves the coding efficiency by utilizing motion-compensatedprediction (MCP) and disparity-compensated prediction (DCP). However; the complexity ofthe inter frame prediction is very high; especially when the rate-distortion optimization isused. This paper presents a fast inter frame prediction algorithm to reduce the complexity.Firstly the prediction type is decided according to reference frames. Then some unusefulsearch regions in view direction are removed. Finally a fast inter mode decision strategy isproposed based on the relationship between MCP and DCP.

Distributed wireless visual communication with power distortion optimization,Xiaopeng Fan; Feng Wu; Debin Zhao; Oscar C Au,This paper proposes a novel framework called DCast for distributed video coding andtransmission over wireless networks; which is different from existing distributed schemes inthree aspects. First; coset quantized DCT coefficients and motion data are directly deliveredto the channel coding layer without syndrome or entropy coding. Second; transmissionpower is directly allocated to coset data and motion data according to their distributions andmagnitudes without forward error correction. Third; these data are transformed by Hadamardand then directly mapped using a dense constellation (64K-QAM) for transmission withoutGray coding. One of the most important properties in this framework is that the coding andtransmission rate is fixed and distortion is minimized by allocating the transmission power.Thus; we further propose a power distortion optimization algorithm to replace the …,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,2013,37

Compressed sensing recovery via collaborative sparsity,Jian Zhang; Debin Zhao; Chen Zhao; Ruiqin Xiong; Siwei Ma; Wen Gao,Compressed Sensing (CS) has drawn quite an amount of attention as a joint sampling andcompression approach. Its theory shows that a signal can be decoded from many fewermeasurements than suggested by the Nyquist sampling theory; when the signal is sparse insome domain. So one of the most significant challenges in CS is to seek a domain where asignal can exhibit a high degree of sparsity and hence be recovered faithfully. Most ofconventional CS recovery approaches; however; exploited a set of fixed bases (eg DCT;wavelet and gradient domain) for the entirety of a signal; which are irrespective of thenonstationarity of natural signals and cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity; thusresulting in poor rate-distortion performance.

Accounting for quantization noise in online correlation noise estimation for distributed video coding,Jurgen Slowack; Stefaan Mys; Jozef Skorupa; Peter Lambert; Rik Van de Walle; Christos Grecos,In Distributed Video Coding (DVC); compression is achieved by exploiting correlationbetween frames at the decoder; instead of at the encoder. More specifically; the decoderuses already decoded frames to generate side information Y for each Wyner-Ziv frame X;and corrects errors in Y using error correcting bits received from the encoder. For efficientuse of these bits; the decoder needs information about the correlation between X availableat the encoder and Y at the decoder. While several techniques for online estimation ofcorrelation noise XY have been proposed; the quantization noise in Y has not been takeninto account. As a solution; in this paper; we calculate the quantization noise of intra framesat the encoder and use this information at the decoder to improve the accuracy of thecorrelation noise estimation.

Context-based 2D-VLC entropy coder in AVS video coding standard,Qiang Wang; De-Bin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract In this paper; a Context-based 2D Variable Length Coding (C2DVLC) method forcoding the transformed residuals in AVS video coding standard is presented. One feature inC2DVLC is the usage of multiple 2D-VLC tables and another feature is the usage of simpleExponential-Golomb codes. C2DVLC employs context-based adaptive multiple table codingto exploit the statistical correlation between DCT coefficients of one block for higher codingefficiency. Exp-Golomb codes are applied to code the pairs of the run-length of zerocoefficients and the nonzero coefficient for lower storage requirement. C2DVLC is a lowcomplexity coder in terms of both computational time and memory requirement.

A motion-aligned auto-regressive model for frame rate up conversion,Yongbing Zhang; Debin Zhao; Siwei Ma; Ronggang Wang; Wen Gao,In this paper; a motion-aligned auto-regressive (MAAR) model is proposed for frame rate upconversion; where each pixel is interpolated as the average of the results generated by oneforward MAAR (Fw-MAAR) model and one backward MAAR (Bw-MAAR) model. In the Fw-MAAR model; each pixel in the to-be-interpolated frame is generated as a linear weightedsummation of the pixels within a motion-aligned square neighborhood in the previous frame.To derive more accurate interpolation weights; the aligned actual pixels in the followingframe are also estimated as a linear weighted summation of the newly interpolated pixels inthe to-be-interpolated frame by the same weights. Consequently; the backward-alignedactual pixels in the following frame can be estimated as a weighted summation of thecorresponding pixels within an enlarged square neighborhood in the previous frame.

On rate-distortion modeling and extraction of H. 264/SVC fine-granular scalable video,Jun Sun; Wen Gao; Debin Zhao; Weiping Li,Fine-granular scalable (FGS) technologies in H. 264/AVC-based scalable video coding(SVC) provide a flexible foundation to accommodate different network capacities. To supportefficient quality extraction; it is important to obtain the rate-distortion (RD) or Distortion-Rate(DR) function of each individual picture or a group of pictures (GOP). In this paper; firstly; theRD function of SVC FGS pictures is analyzed with generalized Gaussian model and the DRcurve is proved to be a concave function overall. Considering the current sub-bitplanetechnology; the DR function is revisited and inferred to be linear under MSE criterion withinan FGS level; which also explains why the observed DR curve with PSNR criterion is a piece-wise convex function.

Window-level rate control for smooth picture quality and smooth buffer occupancy,Long Xu; Debin Zhao; Xiangyang Ji; Lei Deng; Sam Kwong; Wen Gao,In rate control; smooth picture quality and smooth buffer occupancy are both important butcontrary to each other at a given bit rate. How to get a good tradeoff between them was notdevoted much attention previously. To deal with this problem; a theoretical window model isproposed in this paper; in which several adjacent frames grouped as a window areconsidered together. The smoothness of both picture quality and buffer occupancy can begracefully achieved by regulating the size of the window. To illustrate the usage of windowmodel; a window-level rate control algorithm cooperated with the traditional ρ-domain rate-distortion model is further introduced.

Statistical model; analysis and approximation of rate-distortion function in MPEG-4 FGS videos,Jun Sun; Wen Gao; Debin Zhao; Qingming Huang,In this paper; the generalized Gaussian distribution is employed first to model the DCTcoefficients of image data from MPEG-4 fine-granularity scalability (FGS) frame. Then;according to the quantization theory; the distortion-rate function of the generalized Gaussianmodel is analyzed and it is concluded that the derivative of the distortion-rate function firstdecreases; and then increases up to the boundary of 6.02 as the bit rate increases. Foractual FGS coding; the derivative of actual distortion-rate function usually decreases as therate increases; and then begins to increase slowly at a comparatively high bit rate. Finally;based on above observations; a rate-distortion (RD) model is proposed to approximate theactual distortion-rate function. Experiments show that the proposed RD model is accurateand flexible.,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,2006,30

New bi-prediction techniques for B pictures coding [video coding],Xiangyang Ji; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao; Qingmin Huang; Siwei Ma; Yan Lu,In the conventional video codec; B pictures usually employ five prediction modes; includingbi-prediction; direct prediction; forward prediction; backward prediction and intra modes.Among them; the direct and bi-prediction modes; whose prediction values are achieved fromboth forward and backward reference pictures; are more efficient in exploiting the temporalcorrelation between the reference pictures and the current B picture. In addition; the directmode does not require any bits for coding the motion vectors. Therefore; the blocks codedwith direct or bi-predictive mode are usually much more than the other modes.

Forretrieving images efficiently; an adaptive relevance feedback approach based on theBayesian inference; rich get richer (RGR); is proposed. If the feedback images in currentiteration are consistent with the previous ones; the images that are similar to the query targetare assigned to high probabilities. Therefore; the images that are similar to the user's idealtarget are emphasized step by step. The experiments showed that the average precision ofRGR improves 5–20% on each interaction compared with non-RGR. When compared withMARS; the proposed approach greatly reduces the user's efforts for composing a query andcaptures user's intention efficiently.,Signal Processing,2005,28
Data-driven sparsity-based restoration of JPEG-compressed images in dual transform-pixel domain.,Xianming Liu; Xiaolin Wu; Jiantao Zhou; Debin Zhao,Arguably the most common cause of image degradation is compression.

Reduced reference stereoscopic image quality assessment based on binocular perceptual information,Feng Qi; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,In this paper; we propose a novel reduced reference stereoscopic image quality assessment(RR-SIQA) metric by using binocular perceptual information (BPI). BPI is represented by thedistribution statistics of visual primitives in left and right views' images; which are extractedby sparse coding and representation. Specifically; entropy of the left view's image andentropy of the right view's image are used to represent monocular cue. Their mutualinformation is used to represent binocular cue.

Entropy of primitive: A top-down methodology for evaluating the perceptual visual information,Xiang Zhang; Shiqi Wang; Siwei Ma; Shaohui Liu; Wen Gao,In this paper; we aim at evaluating the perceptual visual information based on a novel top-down methodology: entropy of primitive (EoP). The EoP is determined by the distribution ofthe atoms in describing an image; and is demonstrated to exhibit closely correlation with theperceptual image quality. Based on the visual information evaluation; we furtherdemonstrate that the EoP is effective in predicting the perceptual lossless of natural images.Inspired by this observation; in order to distinguish whether the loss of input signal is visualnoticeable to human visual system (HVS); we introduce the EoP based perceptual losslessprofile (PLP).

First; with the dynamicrange analysis of DCT coefficients at different frequency positions; several sufficientconditions are derived to early determine whether a prediction error block (8× 8) is an all-zero or a partial-zero block; ie; the DCT coefficients within the block are all or partially zero-quantized. Being different from traditional methods that utilize the sum of absolute difference(SAD) of the entire prediction error block; the sufficient conditions are derived based on theSAD of each row of the prediction error block. For partial-zero blocks; fast DCT/IDCTalgorithms are further developed by pruning conventional 8-point butterfly-based DCT/IDCTalgorithms.

Instead of simplyreconstructing a pixel block from the centers of assigned DCT coefficient quantization bins(hard decoding); we propose to jointly reconstruct a neighborhood group of pixel patchesusing two image priors while satisfying the quantization bin constraints. First; we assumethat a pixel patch can be approximated as a sparse linear combination of atoms from anoffline-learned over-complete dictionary. Second; we assume that a patch; when interpretedas a graph-signal; is smooth with respect to an appropriately defined graph that captures theestimated structure of the target image.

Embedded image coding based on hierarchical discrete cosine transform,Debin Zhao; Dapeng Zhang; Wen Gao,In this paper; we illustrate that the zerotree quantizer developed originally for waveletcompression can be effectively applied to Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in a hierarchicalway. In this Hierarchical DCT (HDCT); the input image is partitioned into a number of 8· 8blocks and a first level DCT is used to each of these blocks individually. As DC coefficients ofDCT neighboring blocks are highly correlated and particularly pronounced to obtain thecompression results at low bit rates; another level DCT is applied to only DC coefficients re-organized as 8· 8 blocks. This procedure is repeated until the last step is reached. All theHDCT coefficients within a DCT block are then rearranged into a subband structure in whichthe zerotree quantizer can be employed.

For the sake ofinstantaneity; we employ two types of computationally efficient but perceptually importantfeatures–optical flow and edges–to capture motion and shape characteristics of actions. It isknown that the two types of features can be unreliable or ambiguous due to noise anddegradation of video quality. In order to endow them with strong discriminative power; wepursue combined features; of which the joint distributions are different in-between actionclasses.

Compression-induced rendering distortion analysis for texture/depth rate allocation in 3D video compression,Yanwei Liu; Siwei Ma; Qingming Huang; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao; Nan Zhang,In 3D video applications; the virtual view is generally rendered by the compressed textureand depth. The texture and depth compression with different bit-rate overheads can lead todifferent virtual view rendering qualities. In this paper; we analyze the compression-inducedrendering distortion for the virtual view. Based on the 3D warping principle; we first addresshow the texture and depth compression affects the virtual view quality; and then derive anupper bound for the compression-induced rendering distortion. The derived distortion bounddepends on the compression-induced depth error and texture intensity error. Simulationresults demonstrate that the theoretical upper bound is an approximate indication of therendering quality and can be used to guide sequence-level texture/depth rate allocation for3D video compression.,Data Compression Conference; 2009.

Enhanced direct mode coding for bi-predictive pictures,Xiangyang Ji; Yan Lu; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao; Siwei Ma,The direct mode coding in the bi-predictive pictures (B-pictures) can efficiently improve theperformance of bi-predictive coding; because it exploits the temporal correlation by bi-directional prediction from both forward and backward reference pictures; and meanwhile itdoes not require any bits for coding the motion vectors. Accordingly; how to accuratelycalculate the motion vectors in terms of direct mode coding is very important to obtain betterprediction values. In other words; it is more desirable to obtain the true motion vectors;because the derived motion vectors need not be coded. The traditional direct mode codingusually derives the motion vector of the current block by scaling the motion vector of the co-located block in the subsequent reference pictures. It is based on the assumption that thenear blocks would have the same motion trajectory. In this paper; we present an improved …,Circuits and Systems; 2004. ISCAS'04.

Firstly; five successive interlaced fields are used and four unidirectional motionvectors are calculated. Secondly; a probabilistic criterion is introduced to select the mostreliable motion vector for each block before MD; which has four possible output motionstates. Finally; an adaptive deinterlacing scheme is proposed based on the motion andtexture information of each block; as well as the output of MD.

The slice-level parallelism ispopular in parallel video coding for its simplicity and flexibility; however; the video qualityloses greatly since the partitioning of slices breaks the dependency between macro-blocks;especially on multi-core or many-core platforms. To address this problem; we propose aMacro-Block Group (MBG) parallel scheme for parallel AVS coding. In the proposedscheme; video frames are equally divided into rectangular MBG regions; each MBG consistsof more rows and less columns of macro-blocks than the slice-level scheme.

A fast intra mode decision algorithm for AVS to H. 264 transcoding,Zhihang Wang; Wen Gao; Debin Zhao; Qingming Huang,H. 264/AVC is the latest video coding standard developed by MPEG and ITU. AVS is thelatest video coding standard developed by China. The two new video coding standards willco-exist in the market in the future. So it is necessary to transcode the AVS format to the H.264/AVC format or vice versa. Because the AVS video coding standard is based on the8times8 block and also uses the intra prediction technology; it is possible to use the AVSintra mode information to predict the H. 264/AVC intra mode.

Joint just noticeable difference model based on depth perception for stereoscopic images,Xiaoming Li; Yue Wang; Debin Zhao; Tingting Jiang; Nan Zhang,Just noticeable difference (JND) model can reflect the least perceptible distortion fromimages; including 2D images and stereoscopic images. As we know; for the perception ofhuman visual system (HVS); stereoscopic images have quite different characteristics from2D images; since stereoscopic images contain not only planar information; but also depthinformation. This paper proposes a joint JND (JJND) model based on depth perception forstereoscopic images. Firstly; disparity estimation is performed in order to decompose theimage into the occlusion region and the non-overlapped region. Then; different JNDthresholds are applied on different regions; according to the depth information of the region;which can be derived from the disparity of the region.

adaptive block-size transform based on extended integer 8× 8/4× 4 transforms for H. 264/AVC,Honggang Qi; Wen Gao; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao,In this paper; a low-complexity adaptive block-size transform (ABT) scheme is proposed forthe H. 264/AVC. The integer 8x8/4x4 discrete cosine transforms with an extended relationare applied to the proposed ABT scheme for reducing the implementation complexities. Inthe proposed scheme; the 8x8/4x4 transforms can be merged together and share the samescale matrix. As a result; the transform units and storage resources can be effectively savedin both encoder and decoder. The 8x8 transform extended from the 4x4 transform of H.264/AVC can be easily implemented with several simple arithmetic operators; and itsintermediate results can be strictly limited within 16-bit. The experimental results show thatthe proposed ABT scheme based on extended transforms achieves a similar codingperformance to the original ABT scheme for H. 264/AVC.,Image Processing; 2006 IEEE International Conference on,2006,9

Fast multi reference frame motion estimation for high efficiency video coding,Shanshe Wang; Siwei Ma; Shiqi Wang; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,In this paper; a fast multi reference frame motion estimation algorithm is proposed to reducethe computational complexity for high efficiency video coding (HEVC). Firstly; according tothe reference frame distribution; we define the motion complexity for a frame. Based on themotion complexity; an initial reference frame set (RFS) is constructed to reduce the numberof the reference frame for motion estimation. Then for each prediction unit (PU); the averagedistortion per pixel together with the motion vector difference (MVD) in the first referenceframe is employed to shrink the RFS in order to early terminate the motion estimationprocess. In addition; to enhance the robustness of the proposed scheme; an expansionmethod for RFS is proposed to guarantee the video quality. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly save the encoding time. For Low …,Image Processing (ICIP); 2013 20th IEEE International Conference on,2013,8
Witsenhausen–Wyner video coding,Mei Guo; Zixiang Xiong; Feng Wu; Debin Zhao; Xiangyang Ji; Wen Gao,Inspired by Witsenhausen and Wyner's 1980 (now expired) patent on “interframe coder forvideo signals;” this paper presents a Witsenhausen-Wyner video codec; where the motion-compensated previously decoded video frame is used at the decoder as side information forjoint decoding. Specifically; we replace predictive Inter coding in H. 264/AVC by thesyndrome-based coding scheme of Witsenhausen and Wyner; while keeping the Intra andSkip modes of H. 264/AVC unchanged. We employ forward motion estimation at the encoderand send the motion vectors to help generate side information at the decoder; since ourfocus is not on low-complexity encoding. We also examine the tradeoff between the motionvector resolution and coding efficiency. Within the Witsenhausen-Wyner coding mode; weoptimize the decision between syndrome coding and entropy coding among different …,IEEE transactions on circuits and systems for video technology,2011,8
Robust stereo matching combining sift descriptor with ncc under mrf framework,Wenkai Li; Hongxun Yao; Rongrong Ji; Pengfei Xu; Xianming Liu; Debin Zhao,There have been several stereo matching methods that perform well under the circumstanceof color consistency. However; various factors including radiometric and device variationsbetween images will drop color consistency and then seriously degrade the performance ofthose methods. In this paper; we propose a robust method to cover these situations. We usea measurement combining SIFT descriptor in intensity space after color histogramequalization with Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) in color invariant log-chromaticityintensity space to compute the cost of point correspondence. The measurement ensures thatillumination-independent gradient information and color invariant correlated information areintegrated properly.

Image quality assessment using spatial frequency component,Guangyao Cao; Luhong Liang; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao,Abstract Image quality assessment (IQA) is a crucial technique in perceptual image/videocoding; because it is not only a ruler for performance evaluation of coding algorithms butalso a metric for ratio-distortion optimization in coding. In this paper; inspired by the fact thatdistortions of both global and local information influence the perceptual image quality; wepropose a novel IQA method that inspects these information in the spatial frequencycomponents of the image. The distortion of the global information mostly existing in lowspatial frequency is measured by a rectified mean absolute difference metric; and thedistortion of the local information mostly existing in high spatial frequency is measured bySSIM. These two measurements are combined using a newly proposed abruptnessweighting that describes the uniformity of the residual image.

Multi-view video coding with flexible view-temporal prediction structure for fast random access,Yanwei Liu; Qingming Huang; Xiangyang Ji; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract Multi-view video is becoming increasingly popular; as it provides users greatlyenhanced viewing experience. Multi-view video coding (MVC) focuses on exploiting not onlythe temporal correlation among the adjacent pictures for each view; but also inter-viewcorrelation. Though the coding efficiency is a key target for MVC; the view-temporalprediction structure for improving the compression efficiency usually results in the decodingdelay and limits the random access ability. Random access ability is an important feature inMVC because it provides the view switching; temporal frame sweepingly browsing and otherinteractive abilities for the client users in multi-view video streaming. In this paper; wepropose an algorithm to flexibly regulate the viewtemporal prediction structure. It is able toachieve a good trade-off between compression performance and random access ability.,Pacific-Rim Conference on Multimedia,2006,8
Video coding by texture analysis and synthesis using graph cut,Yongbing Zhang; Xiangyang Ji; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract A new approach to analyze and synthesize texture regions in video coding ispresented; where texture blocks in video sequence are synthesized using graph cuttechnique. It first identifies the texture regions by video segmentation technique; and thencalculates their motion vectors by motion vector (MV) scaling technique like temporal directmode. After the correction of these MVs; texture regions are predicted from forward and/orbackward reference frames by the corrected MVs. Furthermore; Overlapped Block MotionCompensation (OBMC) is applied to these texture regions to reduce block artifacts.

Joint data partition and rate-distortion optimized mode selection for H. 264 error-resilient coding,Yuan Zhang; Wen Gao; Debin Zhao,Data partitioning (DP) is an efficient error-resilient video coding tool. Its contribution toperformance improvement in the error-prone environment arises from the superior errorconcealment mechanisms that are available with the help of protected data partitions. Sinceerror-concealment in terms of DP is closely related to coding mode; it is desirable to have anoptimized coding mode selection scheme. However; the existing coding mode selectiontechniques usually assume that the same error-concealment mechanism is used for a blockwhen it is lost; and the associated distortion also remains the same. Obviously; thisassumption is not true when DP involves. In this paper; a generalized end-to-end distortionmodel is proposed for the rate-distortion optimized coding mode selection; which fullyutilizes the superior error-concealment mechanism in terms of DP.

New scaling technique for direct mode coding in B pictures,Xiangyang Ji; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao; Yan Lu; Siwei Ma,To leave the maximum flexibility in encoder to optimize the trade-off between codingperformance and complexity; in video coding standards such as H. 264 AVC; H. 263 andMPEG-4 etc; any number of B pictures and any arrangement of P pictures within a group ofpictures (GOP) of arbitrary length are permitted. In addition; multiple reference pictureprediction is also permitted in some video coding systems such as H. 264/AVC to achieveefficient coding by allowing the encoder to select reference pictures among a large numberof coded pictures. Both of the above cases without fixing the temporal distance betweenforward and backward reference pictures require the division operation for deriving themotion vectors of direct mode; which can efficiently exploit the temporal correlation amongpictures and does not require any bits for coding the motion vectors.

Sparsity-based soft decoding of compressed images in transform domain,Xianming Liu; Xiaolin Wu; Debin Zhao,We propose a sparsity-based soft decoding approach to restore compressed images directlyin the transform domain of compression (DCT domain specifically examined in this paper).Restoring transform coefficients rather than pixel values prevents the propagation ofquantization errors in the image domain. As natural images are statistically non-stationarywith spatially varying sparse representations; we develop an adaptive block-wise sparsity-based restoration method that learns and exploits local statistics. Specially; for each DCTblock; we collect sample blocks via non-local patch grouping to learn a compact dictionarybased on principal component analysis. The resulting block-specific dictionary is used toestimate the corresponding DCT coefficients by a technique of collaborative sparse coding;in which the similarity between sample DCT patches used in dictionary construction is …,Image Processing (ICIP); 2013 20th IEEE International Conference on,2013,7

Context-adaptive pixel based prediction for intra frame encoding,Yongbing Zhang; Li Zhang; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Intra prediction is one effective method to remove the spatial redundancies in intra framecoding. Better intra prediction will result in the residual with less energy; which will decreasethe number of bits needed to reconstruct the signal at decoder. To improve the accuracy ofintra prediction; a context-adaptive pixel based prediction (CAPBP) algorithm is proposed inthis paper. For each pixel within the target block to be encoded; the prediction is calculatedas the linear weighted summation of the reconstructed pixels within the left column and theabove row. Based on the assumption that pixels having the same coordinates within oneblock own the same prediction weights; we calculate the corresponding weights for eachpixel within the target block by the least square method. The same processing is alsoperformed at decoder; hence the prediction weights do not need to be sent to the decoder …,Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP); 2010 IEEE International Conference on,2010,7

Towards this issue; we present an efficient coding methodfor the Intra_4x4 prediction mode information. Firstly; a 3-order Markov random field isintroduced to model the correlation among neighboring 4x4 blocks at picture level.Secondly; based on the conditional probabilities learned in this model; we build up a contextadaptive coding scheme to code the Intra_4x4 prediction mode information. Although theprobabilities and the coding scheme are initialized off-line; they can be revised by automaticadjustments. Thus the proposed algorithm is robust to a variety of video sequences.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain a gain up to 0.3 dBin all I-frames coding without involving any serious computational burden.,Circuits and Systems; 2009.

The proposed AR based error concealmentscheme includes a forward AR model for P slice; and a bi-direction AR model for B slice.First; we utilize the block matching algorithm (BMA) to select the best motions for lost blocksfrom the motions of available neighboring blocks. Then; the proposed AR model coefficientsare computed according to the spatial neighboring pixels and their temporal-correlatedpixels indicated by the selected best motions. Finally; applying the AR model; each pixel ofthe lost block is interpolated as a weighted summation of pixels in the reference frame alongthe selected best motions.

Learning convolutional networks for content-weighted image compression,Mu Li; Wangmeng Zuo; Shuhang Gu; Debin Zhao; David Zhang,Abstract: Lossy image compression is generally formulated as a joint rate-distortionoptimization to learn encoder; quantizer; and decoder. However; the quantizer is non-differentiable; and discrete entropy estimation usually is required for rate control. Thesemake it very challenging to develop a convolutional network (CNN)-based imagecompression system. In this paper; motivated by that the local information content is spatiallyvariant in an image; we suggest that the bit rate of the different parts of the image should beadapted to local content. And the content aware bit rate is allocated under the guidance of acontent-weighted importance map. Thus; the sum of the importance map can serve as acontinuous alternative of discrete entropy estimation to control compression rate.

The proposed frameworkoutperforms the traditional framework through the better exploitation of frames correlationwith reference frames; the unequal sample subrates setting among frames in different layersand the reduction of the error propagation. At the encoder; compared with the video/framebased CS; the proposed hierarchical block based CS matrix can be easily implemented andstored in hardware. Each measurement of the block in a different hierarchical frame isobtained with the different sample subrate.

Optimal filter based on scale-invariance generation of natural images,Feng Jiang; Bo-Wei Chen; Seungmin Rho; Wen Ji; Liqiang Pan; Hongwei Guo; Debin Zhao,Abstract One of the most striking properties of natural image statistics is the scale invariance.Some earlier studies have assumed that the kurtosis of marginal band pass filter response tobe constant throughout scales for a natural image. In our study; this assumption is loosenedby adaptively estimating an optimal filter computation whose response distributions throughscales have the least Kullback–Leibler divergence. The adaptive filter and its responsescharacterize the scale-invariance property more accurately and effectively and are furtherutilized to model the statistics scale-invariance prior in this paper. Extensive experiments onimage super-resolution and de-noising manifest that the explored natural images scale-invariance prior model achieves significant performance improvements over the currentstate-of-the-art schemes.,The Journal of Supercomputing,2016,6
Hybrid angular intra/template matching prediction for HEVC intra coding,Tao Zhang; Haoming Chen; Ming-Ting Sun; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,In the latest HEVC video coding standard; angular intra prediction (AIP) applies 35 modesincluding 33 angular modes which can handle blocks with direction information well; andother 2 modes (DC and planar) which are used to predict smooth blocks. However; forblocks with complex texture; these modes may not give good predictions. Some complexblocks can be predicted well by template matching prediction (TMP) which was proposed topredict blocks having similar patterns in the coded regions of the same frame without thecost of large overheads. In this paper; a novel hybrid AIP/TMP is proposed to improve theprediction efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve acoding gain of about 2.5% for high resolution sequences on average compared to the AIP inHEVC. The gain can be up to 4.2%.,Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP); 2015,2015,6
Building emerging pattern (EP) random forest for recognition,Liang Wang; Yizhou Wang; Debin Zhao,The Random forest classifier comes to be the working horse for visual recognitioncommunity. It predicts the class label of an input data by aggregating the votes of multipletree classifiers. However; the classification performances of these tree classifiers aredifferent. The random forest classifier ignores the difference by simply assigning them equalweights in voting for the final classification decision. Also; the random forest classifier onlycasts votes from individual tree classifiers without considering their compositions whichwould be more accurate. In this paper; we propose to tackle the two points by discoveringweighted decision rules from the tree classifiers' output sets on training data. By treating theoutputs of the tree classifiers on each data as a digital itemset; we want to find discriminativepatterns (either containing the output of a single tree classifier or a set of tree classifiers) …,Image Processing (ICIP); 2010 17th IEEE International Conference on,2010,6
Spatial-aided low-delay Wyner-Ziv video coding,Bo Wu; Xiangyang Ji; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract In distributed video coding; the side information (SI) quality plays an important rolein Wyner-Ziv (WZ) frame coding. Usually; SI is generated at the decoder by the motion-compensated interpolation (MCI) from the past and future key frames under the assumptionthat the motion trajectory between the adjacent frames is translational with constant velocity.However; this assumption is not always true and thus; the coding efficiency for WZ coding isoften unsatisfactory in video with high and/or irregular motion. This situation becomes moreserious in low-delay applications since only motion-compensated extrapolation (MCE) canbe applied to yield SI. In this paper; a spatial-aided Wyner-Ziv video coding (WZVC) in low-delay application is proposed. In SA-WZVC; at the encoder; each WZ frame is coded asperformed in the existing common Wyner-Ziv video coding scheme and meanwhile; the …,EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing,2009,6

However; the residue after transform does not conform to a uniformdistribution but approximate to a Laplacian distribution. In this paper; we first deduce a newdistortion model with the assumption of Laplacian distribution of quantized DCT coefficients(called Laplacian distortion model; LDM); and then a more accurate rate-distortion model isproposed based on LDM.

An improved image compression scheme with an adaptive parameters set in encrypted domain,Guochao Zhang; Shaohui Liu; Feng Jiang; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,A growing societal awareness about privacy and security push the development of signalprocessing techniques in the encrypted domain. Data compression in encrypted domainattracts much attention recently years due to its avoiding the leakage of data source duringcompression. This paper proposes an improved block-by-block compression scheme ofencrypted image with flexible compression ratio. The original image is encrypted bypermuting the blocks of the image and then permuting the pixels in the blocks. In thecompression; pixels chosen randomly used as reference information; and remaining pixelsare compressed by coset code. At the decoder side; side information (SI) which is generatedby combining correlation among blocks and image restoration from partial random samples(IRPRS) is utilized to assist the decompression. Moreover; an adaptive system …,Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP); 2013,2013,5
Progressive image restoration through hybrid graph Laplacian regularization,Deming Zhai; Xianming Liu; Debin Zhao; Hong Chang; Wen Gao,In this paper; we propose a unified framework to perform progressive image restorationbased on hybrid graph Laplacian regularized regression. We first construct a multi-scalerepresentation of the target image by Laplacian pyramid; then progressively recover thedegraded image in the scale space from coarse to fine so that the sharp edges and texturecan be eventually recovered. On one hand; within each scale; a graph Laplacianregularization model represented by implicit kernel is learned which simultaneouslyminimizes the least square error on the measured samples and preserves the geometricalstructure of the image data space by exploring non-local self-similarity. In this procedure; theintrinsic manifold structure is considered by using both measured and unmeasured samples.On the other hand; between two scales; the proposed model is extended to the …,Data Compression Conference (DCC); 2013,2013,5
Rate control for consistent visual quality of H. 264/AVC encoding,Long Xu; Sam Kwong; Hanli Wang; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract In this paper; a novel rate control scheme with sliding window basic unit isproposed to achieve consistent or smooth visual quality for H. 264/AVC based videostreaming. A sliding window consists of a group of successive frames and moves forward byone frame each time. To make the sliding window scheme possible for real-time videostreaming; the initial encoder delay inherently in a video streaming system is utilized togenerate all the bits of a window in advance; so that these bits for transmission are readybefore their due time. The use of initial encoder delay does not introduce any additionaldelay in video streaming but benefits visual quality as compared to traditional one-pass ratecontrol algorithms of H. 264/AVC. Then; a Sliding Window Buffer Checking (SWBC)algorithm is proposed for buffer control at sliding window level and it accords with …,Signal Processing: Image Communication,2013,5
High-quality image interpolation via local autoregressive and nonlocal 3-D sparse regularization,Xinwei Gao; Jian Zhang; Feng Jiang; Xiaopeng Fan; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao,In this paper; we propose a novel image interpolation algorithm; which is formulated viacombining both the local autoregressive (AR) model and the nonlocal adaptive 3-D sparsemodel as regularized constraints under the regularization framework. Estimating the high-resolution image by the local AR regularization is different from these conventional ARmodels; which weighted calculates the interpolation coefficients without considering therough structural similarity between the low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images.Then the nonlocal adaptive 3-D sparse model is formulated to regularize the interpolatedHR image; which provides a way to modify these pixels with the problem of numericalstability caused by AR model. In addition; a new Split-Bregman based iterative algorithm isdeveloped to solve the above optimization problem iteratively.

Then;all of the losses evaluated in local neighborhoods are accumulated together to measure theglobal consistency on all samples. Furthermore; a graph-Laplacian based manifoldregularization term is incorporated to penalize the global smoothness of intensity labels;such smoothing can alleviate the insufficient training of the local models and make themmore robust.

Fast and effective interpolation using median filter,Jian Zhang; Siwei Ma; Yongbing Zhang; Debin Zhao,Abstract This paper proposes a fast and effective image interpolation algorithm usingmedian filter. The interpolation algorithm is composed of two steps. First; a non-lineariterative procedure is utilized to interpolate the pixel whose direction can be easilydetermined by local information. Second; according to the introduced assumption that imageinterpolation can be regarded as a local image filtering process; the remaining pixels areinterpolated by the proposed fast median filter method. Experimental results show that theproposed algorithm provides better performance than traditional techniques (eg bilinearinterpolation; bicubic interpolation) both in subjective quality and objective quality withsimilar complexity. In particular; the proposed method is comparable to the well-known NEDIalgorithm in visual quality; however; with much lower computational complexity.

Two hypotheses; the intra-view SI and the interview SI; arefed together into the WZ decoder in the proposed scheme. A multi-hypothesis basedcorrelation model (MHBCM) is presented to fully exploit the redundancy between these twoSI frames and the original frame.

Macroblock-level adaptive scan scheme for discrete cosine transform coefficients,Li Zhang; Wen Gao; Qiang Wang; Debin Zhao,Discrete cosine transform (DCT) has been widely used in image/video coding systems;where zigzag scan is usually employed for DCT coefficient organization. However; due tolocal diversity of prediction errors; the fixed scan pattern; such as the traditional zigzag scan;is not efficient all the time for organizing the DCT transformed prediction errors. In this paper;the statistical distribution of prediction residuals is studied first; and two other scan patternsare introduced to complete the set of possible patterns. Then; a new adaptive scheme thatadaptively chooses for each macroblock the best scan pattern to arrange the quantized DCTcoefficients into arrays is presented. The best scan pattern is selected for each macroblockaccording to its own residual characteristics and hence leads to improved coding efficiency.Experimental results show that this macroblock-level adaptive scan scheme (MLASS) can …,Circuits and Systems; 2007.

In the proposed method; at encoder; each WZ frame is split intotwo parts based on checkerboard pattern and then separately coded. At decoder; one part ofthe WZ frame will be firstly reconstructed; and then Boundary Matching Algorithm (BMA)[12]is used to improve motion compensation of the other part; which can obtain an improved SIof it. As a result; different from the conventional DVC scheme which usually only exploitstemporal correlations among the neighboring frames to generate SI; the proposed method isalso able to furthermore improve SI quality by the aid of the partially decoded WZ frame.

An edge-based median filtering algorithm with consideration of motion vector reliability for adaptive video deinterlacing,Qian Huang; Wen Gao; Debin Zhao; Qingming Huang,Because of its ability to preserve signal edges while filtering out impulsive noises; medianfiltering is widely used in signal processing applications; eg deinterlacing. An edge-basedmedian filtering (EMF) algorithm is proposed for adaptive deinterlacing. A criterion of motionvector reliability (MVR) is also introduced for better interpolation. For each motioncompensated block; two motion vectors between opposite-parity fields and one betweensame-parity fields are taken into account. Experiments show that the proposed MVR andEMF are both very efficient. Outputs of the proposed EMF are much more similar to originalprogressive videos than those of objectively best EMF methods nowadays; without obviousvisual distortions. Finally; the proposed EMF and MVR criterion are shown to be suitable fortexture-based adaptive deinterlacing,Multimedia and Expo; 2006 IEEE International Conference on,2006,5

In this paper; we propose to enhance ASMs by introducing globaltexture constraints expressed by its reconstruction residual in the texture subspace. In theproposed method; each landmark is firstly matched by its local profile in its currentneighborhood; and the overall configure of all the landmarks is re-shaped by the statisticalshape constraint as in the ASMs. Then; the global texture is warped out from the originalimage according to the current shape model; and its reconstruction residual from the pre-trained texture subspace is further exploited to evaluate the fitting degree of the currentshape model to the novel image.

3D visual saliency detection model with generated disparity map,Feng Qi; Debin Zhao; Shaohui Liu; Xiaopeng Fan,Abstract Due to the remarkable distinction between human monocular vision and binocularvision; stereoscopic visual attention becomes an emerging question in the study of 3Dapplications. Some of existing 3D visual saliency detection models take advantage ofground-truth disparity map to compute center-surround differences of the depth features withhigh computational cost. In some 3D applications; the ground-truth disparity map may not bealways available. In this paper; an efficient and simple 3D visual saliency detection model isproposed without using ground-truth disparity map. The proposed model is based on a band-pass filtering method which coincides with the visual perceptual process in human visualsystem.

Low complexity encoder optimization for HEVC,Shanshe Wang; Falei Luo; Siwei Ma; Xiang Zhang; Shiqi Wang; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) improved the coding efficiency significantly.Compared to its predecessor H. 264/AVC; it can provide equivalent subjective quality withmore than 57% bit rate reduction. However; the improvement on coding efficiency isobtained at the expense of much more intensive computation complexity. In this paper;based on an overall analysis of computation complexity at the HEVC encoder; a lowcomplexity encoder optimization scheme is proposed by reducing the number of availablecandidates for evaluation in terms of the intra prediction mode decision; early termination ofcoding unit (CU) splitting and adaptive reference frame selection. With the proposedscheme; the rate distortion optimization (RDO) technique of HEVC can be implemented in alow-complexity way for complexity-constrained encoders.

Game theory based no-reference perceptual quality assessment for stereoscopic images,Feng Jiang; K Bharanitharan; Shovan Barma; Hailiang Wang; Debin Zhao,Abstract In this paper; a no-reference perceptual quality assessment for stereoscopic imageis proposed. Inspired by the binocular rivalry mechanism; the observation annoyanceperception is explained as a bargain process. Game theory is exploited to model the rivalryof the left eye and right eye. The relation between annoyance perception with binoculardisparity is further demonstrated and an annoyance map is calculated to simulate theobserver perception. Then; with the consideration of the properties of HVS; the edge mapand a saliency map are used to adjust the annoyance map. Finally; Minkowski pooling andmulti-scale strategy are applied to compute the final score. We use the EPFL database tovalidate the proposed metric. The experimental results show that the final objective scoreshave a high degree of consistency with the subjective scores.,The Journal of Supercomputing,2015,4
Block-based compressive sensing coding of natural images by local structural measurement matrix,Xinwei Gao; Jian Zhang; Wenbin Che; Xiaopeng Fan; Debin Zhao,Gaussian random matrix (GRM) has been widely used to generate linear measurements incompressive sensing (CS) of natural images. However; in practice; there actually exist twoproblems with GRM. One is that GRM is non-sparse and complicated; leading to highcomputational complexity and high difficulty in hardware implementation. The other is thatregardless of the characteristics of signal the measurements generated by GRM are alsorandom; which results in low efficiency of compression coding. In this paper; we design anovel local structural measurement matrix (LSMM) for block-based CS coding of naturalimages by utilizing the local smooth property of images. The proposed LSMM has two mainadvantages. First; LSMM is a highly sparse matrix; which can be easily implemented inhardware; and its reconstruction performance is even superior to GRM at low CS …,Data Compression Conference (DCC); 2015,2015,4

Firstly; we propose a non-linear adjustment scheme forthe Lagrange multiplier based on the specialized coding structure of HEVC and humanvisual system (HVS) characteristic. Then the Lagrange multiplier is incorporated into the ratedistortion optimization for mode decision. Experimental results demonstrate the proposedscheme can significantly improve the subjective video quality. Compared to the HM anchor;the maximum subjective quality improvement can be up to 30% and the average subjectiveperformance improvement is over 7%; 11% and 10% for random access; low delay P andlow delay B testing configurations respectively.,Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA); 2014 Asia-Pacific,2014,4

The High Efficiency Video Coding standard (HEVC) adopts the intra transformskip mode to improve the coding efficiency of compound video. In this paper; we improve theintra transform skip mode from two aspects. Firstly; we study the statistical character of theintra prediction residual and propose a separate coefficient scan order for the intra transformskip mode. Secondly; we analyze the probability of the intra transform skip mode for differentcoding unit (CU) sizes and prediction unit (PU) sizes; and then propose one limitation toreduce the applied range of intra transform skip mode.

According to the non-local self-similarity property of naturalimages; we first collect two set of samples by template matching: one is called the latent setcorresponding to the current missing patch and the other one is called the template setcorresponding to the current template. Using these two sets of samples as the training data;we learn a dictionary pair and a linear prediction model simultaneously. The pair ofdictionaries aims to characterize the two structural domains of the two sets; and the linearmodel is to reveal the intrinsic relationship between the sparse representations of the currentmissing patches and its template.

Motion vector derivation of deformable block,Na Zhang; Xiaopeng Fan; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Motion estimation (ME) plays an important role in most video encoding systems since itcould significantly affect coding performance. However; both the next generation videocoding standard High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and the current video codingstandard H. 264/MPEG-4 AVC employ block matching motion estimation (BMME) which isbased on translation motion model. This makes it difficult to represent the complex motionaccurately such as rotation; zoom; and etc. In this paper; we propose an adjacent-block-based prediction model to improve the prediction performance of a deformable block. Basedon this model; the motion information of each 4× 4 block; ie the minimum partition (MP) in acoding unit (CU) of HEVC; is derived from the motion information of the nearest neighbors tothe four corners of current prediction unit (PU).

Different from the traditional down-sampling algorithms; whichare independent from the interpolation process; the proposed down-sampling algorithmhinges the down-sampling to the interpolation process. Consequently; the proposed down-sampling algorithm is able to maintain the original information of the input image to thelargest extent. The down-sampled image is then fed into JPEG.

To address this problem; a novel Macro-Block Group (MBG) decompositionscheme is presented for parallel AVS coding. In the proposed scheme; video frames areequally divided into rectangular MBG regions; each consists of more rows and less columnsthan the slice-level scheme. Since MBG is not supported by AVS; a vertical partitioningscheme is introduced; and the mode confining and MVD adjusting techniques are utilized tokeep consistency with the standard. In practice; our parallel encoder is developed on theTILE64 platform; where P/B frames use the MBG-level parallelism and I frames use themacro-block-level parallelism.

So unlike the most popularused SVM training algorithm sequential minimal optimization (SMO) which solves the QPsubproblem containing minimal two Lagrange multipliers; SSMO can analytically updateonly one Lagrange multiplier at every step.

However; it is rarely used to solve low-level vision problemssuch as image compression studied in this paper. Here; we move forward a step andpropose a novel compression framework based on CNNs. To achieve high-quality imagecompression at low bit rates; two CNNs are seamlessly integrated into an end-to-endcompression framework.

In the improved context modeling for transformcoefficient levels; the context model index for significance map is dependent on the numberof the significant neighbors covered by a local template and its position within transformblock (TB). To limit the total number of context models for significance map; TBs are split intodifferent regions based on the coefficient position.

Perceptual image quality assessment combining free-energy principle and sparse representation,Yutao Liu; Guangtao Zhai; Xianming Liu; Debin Zhao,Since the purpose of objective image quality assessment is to be consistent with subjectiveimage quality assessment as highly as possible; the understanding of the mechanisms ofhuman visual system will certainly benefit the study of objective image quality assessment.Recent developments in brain theory and neuroscience; particularly the free-energyprinciple; account for the perception and understanding of visual scenes. As the free-energyprinciple conjectures; the brain tries to generate the corresponding prediction for itsencountered scene by an internal generative model.

Adaptive transform with HEVC intra coding,Tao Zhang; Haoming Chen; Ming-Ting Sun; Ankur Saxena; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,This paper proposes a content adaptive transform based on singular value decomposition(SVD) with HEVC intra coding. In the latest video coding standard HEVC; a combination ofDiscrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Sine Transform (DST) is adopted totransform the residuals from intra prediction. The DCT and DST are fixed transforms whichare derived based on the Gauss-Markov model. Since the residual blocks contain variousdistributions which may not be compacted well by the fixed DCT/DST; we propose anadaptive transform method based on SVD which is adaptive to residuals for angular intracoding. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve rate-distortionperformance improvements compared to HEVC intra coding (up to 1.9% bit rate savings).,Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA); 2015 Asia-Pacific,2015,3
Low-complexity encoder framework for window-level rate control optimization,Long Xu; Sam Kwong; Yun Zhang; Debin Zhao,There exists a tradeoff between visual quality smoothness and buffer constraint in ratecontrol.

A fast video transcoder from Wyner-Ziv to AVS,Aiguo Yi; Xianming Liu; Xiaopeng Fan; Debin Zhao,Abstract As well known; Wyner-Ziv codec has low encoding complexity; while AVS codechas low decoding complexity. In this paper; our goal is to get benefits from both AVS andWyner-Ziv to fit well some applications; such as mobile video communication. We propose afast video transcoder from Wyner-Ziv to AVS. The transcoder design aims at reducingencoding complexity of AVS. Taking into account that mode decision in AVS is very time-consuming; in the proposed scheme; we discard the mode decision and directly re-use thecorresponding decision results of Wyner-Ziv decoder. At the same time; motion estimation inAVS encoder is speeded up by using the derived motion vectors in Wyner-Ziv decoder assearching origins.

In the proposed method; two factors are taken into account: first; we set a fixedfoveation and then get the cut-off frequency for every macroblock. Second; we compute theJND values for each pixel in the frame to be encoded; and then use the JND variance ofeach macroblock to tune the corresponding cut-off frequency.

Region-based fusion strategy for side information generation in DMVC,Yongpeng Li; Xiangyang Ji; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,The coding efficiency of Wyner-Ziv frames relies considerably on the quality of sideinformation and the capability to model the statistical dependency between the originalframe and side information. In the field of distributed multi-view video coding (DMVC); thereare two kinds of side information; namely temporal side information (TSI); which is generatedby exploiting the temporal correlation; and inter-view side information (IVSI); which isgenerated by exploiting the inter-view correlation.

Direct mode coding for B pictures using virtual reference picture,Da Liu; Debin Zhao; Jun Sun; Wen Gao,The direct mode used in the bi-predictive pictures (B-pictures) can efficiently improve thecoding performance of B pictures; because it has small overhead and obtains a predictivepicture from two reference pictures. The traditional temporal direct mode (TDM) derives themotion vector of the current block by scaling the motion vector of the co-located block in thebackward reference picture. However; when the current block and its co-located block inbackward reference picture belong to different objects with different motion directions; theprediction efficiency of TDM is drastically reduced. In this paper; we propose an improveddirect mode prediction method. In the method; a virtual reference picture is generated usingthe pixel projection technique.

With the proposed technique; theMBR streams can be independently encoded without losing any coding efficiency. Similar todistributed video coding; the proposed Wyner-Ziv switching scheme also faces thechallenge of rate allocation at the server side. To solve this problem; we propose a newcorrelation model based on the analysis on the reconstructed frames from the streams withdifferent bit rates. Accordingly; the number of transmitted bits can be on-line calculatedbased on the correlation model without any feedback from the decoder.

High efficient context-based variable length coding with parallel orientation,Qiang Wang; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao; Siwei Ma,Abstract Entropy coding is one of the most important techniques in video codec. Two maincriteria to assess an entropy coder are coding efficiency and friendly realizationcharacteristic. In the recent development of the H. 264/AVC standard; a sophisticatedentropy coder; named Context-based Adaptive Variable Length Coding (CAVLC); has beeninvented; which supplies higher coding efficiency than other VLC-based entropy coders inprevious video coding standards. But due to its algorithm's inherit traits CAVLC must beexecuted in a sequential manner; which results in relative low throughput rate.

Joint gaze-correction and beautification of DIBR-synthesized human face via dual sparse coding,Xianming Liu; Gene Cheung; Deming Zhai; Debin Zhao; Hiroshi Sankoh; Sei Naito,Gaze mismatch is a common problem in video conferencing; where the viewpoint capturedby a camera (usually located above or below a display monitor) is not aligned with the gazedirection of the human subject; who typically looks at his counterpart in the center of thescreen. This means that the two parties cannot converse eye-to-eye; hampering the qualityof visual communication. One conventional approach to the gaze mismatch problem is tosynthesize a gaze-corrected face image as viewed from center of the screen via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR); assuming texture and depth maps are available at thecamera-captured viewpoint (s). Due to self-occlusion; however; there will be missing pixelsin the DIBR-synthesized view image that require satisfactory filling.

Soft mobile video broadcast based on side information refining,Wei Huang; Xiaopeng Fan; Debin Zhao,Video broadcasting is a popular application of wireless network; whose main challenge is toaccommodate different users with different channel conditions. Recently; a novelD-Cast'approach based on distributed source coding (DSC) is proposed.

Arbitrary-sized motion detection in screen video coding,Tao Zhang; Xun Guo; Yan Lu; Shipeng Li; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao,In real-time screen remoting system; frame rate is one of essential factors that affect userexperience. Therefore; how to compress diversity of screen contents fast and efficiently is akey issue. Existing video codecs such as H. 264 are always used in such a system forscreen compression. However; arbitrary-sized regions with large motion always exist intypical screen content videos; which lead to a lower encoding speed and higher bit-rate;thereby decrease the frame rate. This paper proposes an efficient motion detectionalgorithm; which is fast and efficient for large motion regions. In specific; a region-basedmotion detection is used to find motion vectors instead of traditional block based motionestimation. The motion vectors are then utilized by H. 264 encoder for normal motioncompensated prediction.

Up-sampling oriented frame rate reduction,Yongbing Zhang; Haoqian Wang; Debin Zhao,Abstract Reducing the frame rate of a sequence results in the information loss of interpolatedframes that cannot be recovered by temporal up-sampling. The most prevalent frame ratereduction method is the direct down-sampling; which maintains the original frames of theinput sequence with a constant interval. It achieves wide applications due to simplicity.However; it neglects the influences on interpolated frames brought by temporal up-sampling.To maintain more information during down-sampling; which will be used for interpolation;this paper proposes an up-sampling oriented frame rate reduction by hinging the temporalup-sampling and down-sampling. It is designed with the goal of improving the quality of up-sampled frames while keeping the down-sampled sequence faithful to the input one. For aparticular temporal up-sampling method; eg; motion compensation frame interpolation …,Signal Processing: Image Communication,2013,2

Web image interpolation via weighted total least squares regression,Xianming Liu; Deming Zhai; Guangtao Zhai; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Although ordinary least squares (OLS) regression achieves great success in clean imageinterpolation; its effectiveness is questionable in the scenario of web images which areusually compressed beforehand. The inherent flaw of OLS is that it is asymmetric; theperturbation is only confined on the right side of the linear system. It is not reasonable forweb images. Considering the drawback of OLS; in this paper; we propose an efficient webimage interpolation algorithm based on total least squares (TLS) regression. In the proposedmethod; small perturbations are allowed in both side of the system; which are optimized byTLS in a patch-based manner. Furthermore; we develop a weighted version of TLS toconsider contribution diversity of different samples and patches in model estimation; whichcan efficiently remove the influence of outliers in regression.

Side information extrapolation with temporal and spatial consistency,Xianming Liu; Deming Zhai; Debin Zhao; Ruiqin Xiong; Siwei Ma; Wen Gao,In this paper; we present an efficient side information extrapolation scheme with temporaland spatial consistency for low delay Wyner-Ziv video coding. Our method is based on theregularized local linear regression (RLLR) model; in which each pixel in SI is approximatedas a linear weighted combination of samples within a local temporal neighborhood. Theoptimal model parameters are estimated by projecting the transformation function onto thetemporal training samples to exploit motion-related dependency. During this procedure;moving weights are incorporated into the objective function to express the relativeimportance of training samples in estimating parameters of the model. Furthermore; spatialcorrelation is explored by imposing an additional local smoothness penalty; which doesgood to estimate the occluded regions and complex motion regions.

Fovea based image quality assessment,Anan Guo; Debin Zhao; Shaohui Liu; Guangyao Cao,Humans are the ultimate receivers of the visual information contained in an image; so thereasonable method of image quality assessment (IQA) should follow the properties of thehuman visual system (HVS). In recent years; IQA methods based on HVS-models are slowlyreplacing classical schemes; such as mean squared error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-NoiseRatio (PSNR). IQA-structural similarity (SSIM) regarded as one of the most popular HVS-based methods of full reference IQA has apparent improvements in performance comparedwith traditional metrics in nature; however; it performs not very well when the images'structure is destroyed seriously or masked by noise. In this paper; a new efficient foveabased structure similarity image quality assessment (FSSIM) is proposed.

Mahalanobis distance based polynomial segment model for chinese sign language recogniton,Yu Zhou; Xilin Chen; Debin Zhao; Hongxun Yao; Wen Gao,Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems are mostly based on Hidden Markov Model(HMM) and have achieved excellent results. However; the assumption of frameindependence in HMM makes it inconsistent with the characteristic of strong temporalcorrelation in sign language signals. Polynomial Segment Model (PSM) explicitly representsthe temporal evolution of sign language features as a Gaussian process with time-varyingparameters. In this paper PSM is first introduced to SLR framework to solve the temporalcorrelation problem. Considering the correlation among the coefficients of polynomialtrajectory's different orders; Mahalanobis distance is used as the classification criterion toevaluate the likelihood of test data. Experimental results show that our method outperformthe conventional HMM methods by 6.81% in recognition accuracy.,Multimedia and Expo; 2008 IEEE International Conference on,2008,2
Statistical analysis and modeling of rate-distortion function in SVC fine-granular SNR scalable videos,Jun Sun; Wen Gao; Debin Zhao,In this paper; we propose a simple and effective rate-distortion model of fine-granular SNRscalable (FGS) layer in JVT scalable video coding (SVC). First; we introduce generalizedGaussian distributions (GGD) to model the distributions of the 16 (4* 4) integer transformcoefficients of the SVC FGS residue picture. Then we analyze the quantization scheme ofSVC FGS coding; under which we analyze the distortion-rate function of generalizedGaussian model and conclude that the derivative of the distortion-rate function usuallydecreases to the traditional number 6.02 dB/bit as the coding rate increases. For somespecial cases where the shape of GGD is smooth; the derivative of the distortion-ratefunction increases to 6.02 dB/bit as the rate increases in the actual coding rate range.Guided by the observations; an effective and flexible rate-distortion model is proposed to …,Multimedia and Expo; 2007 IEEE International Conference on,2007,2
An enhanced robust entropy coder for video codecs based on context-adaptive reversible vlc,Qiang Wang; Debin Zhao; Siwei Ma; Wen Gao,This paper proposes an enhanced RVLC coder; context-adaptive reversible variable lengthcoder (CRVLC); for DCT coefficients by using the techniques of data sub-partitioning andcontext modeling. The data sub-partitioning means that the data part of DCT coefficients issplit into several small sub-partitions. As each sub-partition can be reversibly decoded byRVLC; more data as well as higher error resilience can be obtained. The context modelingexploits the correlation of DCT coefficients for further compression. This modeling definesthe contexts by hierarchical-dependent information. The information is also available in thebackward decoding; so that it supports the reversible decoding. And with it the dataoutputted by CRVLC can be naturally placed into multiple sub-partitions.,Data Compression Conference; 2007. DCC'07,2007,2

An Efficient FGS Coding Scheme for Interlaced Scalable Video Coding,Yanyan Zheng; Xiangyang Ji; Feng Wu; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,JVT scalable video coding (SVC) provides high coding efficiency for progressive videosequences with combined scalability. However; interlaced SVC is only the straightforwardextension of H. 264/AVC interlaced coding with the similar FGS coding technique forprogressive coding. Based on the particular temporal correlation of interlaced videosequences; this paper presents a novel and efficient FGS coding scheme for interlaced SVC;which is able to achieve higher compression efficiency and further temporal scalability byintroducing additional temporal decomposition stage when coding key pictures.

Improvements to multiple FGS layers coding for low-delay applications,Yanyan Zheng; Xiangyang Ji; Feng Wu; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract For low-delay applications in Scalable Video Coding; there are two alternativecoding strategies based on AR-FGS for compressing multiple FGS layers. However; theircoding efficiencies both suffer largely from the inherent drifting errors. In this paper; a moreefficient multiple FGS layers coding structure is presented; which can provide higher codingperformance within wide bitrate range and stronger error resilience. This is achieved byincorporating the partialreconstructed enhancement layer references; instead of thecomplete-reconstructed ones; into the motion-compensated prediction loop of the FGSlayers. Thereupon the prediction drift can be effectively decreased; especially for the middlebitrate points. Further; through selecting different-quality enhancement layer referencesgenerated with cycle-based reconstruction mechanism; more flexible video quality can be …,Joint Video Team; Doc.

On the other hand it isalso well known that wavelet approach has a higher computational complexity than DCTboth in software and in hardware. When both audio and video compression are required asin the case of video recording; it is desirable to achieve higher compression efficiency usingWT and to share the same hardware that is based on WT technology. It is the intention of thispaper to present an architecture for a WT slave processor.

VLSI design of a programmable DCT engine for digital cameras,Debin Zhao; ML Tai; WK Ho; Yiu Keung Chan,In still image compression; the JPEG lossy still image compression standard for continuoustone image is often used. JPEG compression efficiency is achieved by decorrelating animage using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Resulting quantized DCT coefficients arethen entropy coded for higher compression efficiency. In the quest for higher compressionefficiency; wavelet is an attractive alternative at the cost of higher computational complexity.It is proposed in here that DCT followed by Embedded Zerotree Coding (EZC) of DCTcoefficients can be competitive to wavelet compression scheme. The basis ofcompetitiveness is base don achievable visual quality at medium bit rate relevant to digitalcamera applications. As the computational complexity of proposed compression schemeusing DCT followed by EZC is still dominated by DCT operations; it is also proposed in …,Sensors; Cameras; and Applications for Digital Photography,1999,2
Supervised Distributed Hashing for Large-Scale Multimedia Retrieval,Deming Zhai; Xianming Liu; Xiangyang Ji; Debin Zhao; Shin’ichi Satoh; Wen Gao,Recent years have witnessed the growing popularity of hashing for large-scale multimediaretrieval. Extensive hashing methods have been designed for data stored in a singlemachine; that is; centralized hashing. In many real-world applications; however; the large-scale data are often distributed across different locations; servers; or sites. Although hashingfor distributed data can be implemented by assembling all distributed data together as awhole dataset in theory; it usually leads to prohibitive computation; communication; andstorage costs in practice.

Merge mode for deformable block motion information derivation,Na Zhang; Xiaopeng Fan; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Motion estimation (ME) plays an important role in most video coding standards since it canimprove the coding performance significantly. Block matching ME (BMME) based ontranslation motion model is employed in both H. 264/Advanced Video Coding and HighEfficiency Video Coding (HEVC); which assumes that all the pixels in a block undergo thesame motion. However; BMME cannot represent the complex motion accurately; such asrotation; zoom; and deformation motion. To resolve the problem; a merge mode fordeformable block motion information derivation is proposed; which considers bilinearinterpolation model; six-parameter affine model; and four-parameter affine modelsimultaneously.

Quality assessment for real out-of-focus blurred images,Yutao Liu; Ke Gu; Guangtao Zhai; Xianming Liu; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract Images are vulnerable to different kinds of distortions; such as blur; noise;blockiness etc; which all degrade the image quality. Among the distorted images; out-of-focus blurred images are frequently-encountered and occupy a large proportion. However;few efforts have been done to quality evaluation for these images. In this paper; we devise adedicated quality evaluation scheme to automatically infer the quality of out-of-focus blurredimages; which is named GPSQ (Gradient magnitude and Phase congruency-based andSaliency-guided Quality model). In GPSQ; a pair of low-level features; including gradientmagnitude (GM) and phase congruency (PC); are extracted to characterize the image localblurriness. Then saliency detection is performed on the image to generate a correspondingsaliency map.

Deep networks for compressed image sensing,Wuzhen Shi; Feng Jiang; Shengping Zhang; Debin Zhao,The compressed sensing (CS) theory has been successfully applied to image compressionin the past few years as most image signals are sparse in a certain domain. Several CSreconstruction models have been recently proposed and obtained superior performance.However; there still exist two important challenges within the CS theory. The first one is howto design a sampling mechanism to achieve an optimal sampling efficiency; and the secondone is how to perform the reconstruction to get the highest quality to achieve an optimalsignal recovery. In this paper; we try to deal with these two problems with a deep network.First of all; we train a sampling matrix via the network training instead of using a traditionalmanually designed one; which is much appropriate for our deep network based reconstructprocess.

Convolutional Neural Networks Based Intra Prediction for HEVC,Wenxue Cui; Tao Zhang; Shengping Zhang; Feng Jiang; Wangmeng Zuo; Zhaolin Wan; Debin Zhao,Summary form only given. Traditional intra prediction methods for HEVC rely on using thenearest reference lines for predicting a block; which ignore much richer context between thecurrent block and its neighboring blocks and therefore cause inaccurate predictionespecially when weak spatial correlation exists between the current block and the referencelines. To overcome this problem; in this paper; an intra-prediction convolutional neuralnetwork (IPCNN) is proposed for intra prediction; which exploits the rich context of thecurrent block and therefore is capable of improving the accuracy of predicting the currentblock. Meanwhile; the reconstruction of the three nearest blocks can also be refined. To thebest of our knowledge; this is the first paper that directly applies CNNs to intra prediction forHEVC.

To this end; the existing works typically train a depth regressor from visualappearance. However; the state-of-the-art performance of these schemes is still far fromsatisfactory; mainly because of the over-fitting and under-fitting problems in regressortraining. In this paper; we offer a different data-driven paradigm of estimating depth from asingle image; which formulates depth estimation from a search-based perspective. Inparticular; we handle the depth estimation of local patches via a novel cross-modalityretrieval scheme; which searches for the 3D patches with similar structure/appearance to the2D query from a dataset with 2D-3D mappings. To that effect; a coupled dictionary learningformulation is proposed to link the 2D query with the 3D patches; on the reconstruction …,European Conference on Computer Vision,2016,1
Arithmetic coding using hierarchical dependency context model for H. 264/AVC video coding,Min Gao; Qiang Wang; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract In this paper; a hierarchical dependency context model (HDCM) is firstly proposedto exploit the statistical correlations of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficients in H.264/AVC video coding standard; in which the number of non-zero coefficients in a DCTblock and the scanned position are used to capture the magnitude varying tendency of DCTcoefficients. Then a new binary arithmetic coding using hierarchical dependency contextmodel (HDCMBAC) is proposed. HDCMBAC associates HDCM with binary arithmeticcoding to code the syntax elements for a DCT block; which consist of the number of non-zerocoefficients; significant flag and level information.

Quad-tree based inter-view motion prediction,Ji Ma; Na Zhang; Xiaopeng Fan; Ruiqin Xiong; Debin Zhao,As a 3D video extension of Audio Video Coding Standard (AVS); 3D-AVS is beingdeveloped to improve the coding efficiency of multi-view video. Since multi-view video iscomposed of projections of the same scenery from different viewpoints at the same timeinstant; it contains a large amount of inter-view redundancies. To exploit the inter-viewcorrelation; this paper presents a method to derive the motion parameters for a coding unit(CU) in the dependent view from the already coded inter-view picture. The algorithm isbased on quad-tree partitioning; each CU could be recursively split into four sub-CUs of thesame size and whether each sub-CU is further split is determined by comparing the derivedmotion parameters.

Quality assessment for out-of-focus blurred images,Yutao Liu; Guangtao Zhai; Xianming Liu; Debin Zhao,During the process of image acquisition; images are often subject to out-of-focus or defocusblur because of the improper adjustment of the camera's focal length; this image blur willdegrade the image quality. However; in the literature; image quality assessment (IQA)methods dedicated to evaluating the quality of images with out-of-focus blur remain few.Therefore; in this paper; we focus our attention on the quality assessment of images thatsuffer from out-of-focus blur and propose an objective quality assessment methodaccordingly. Concretely; we construct a dedicated out-of-focus blurred image dataset; whichis composed of 150 images subjected to different degrees of out-of-focus blur and the meanopinion scores (MOSs).

A visual comfort assessment metric for stereoscopic images,Feng Qi; Xiaopeng Fan; Debin Zhao; Tingting Jiang; Jian Zhang,Recent studies have shown that one of the main reasons inducing visual discomfort isaccommodation-vergence conflict. To evaluate visual discomfort induced by this conflict; thispaper proposes a stereo visual comfort assessment (SVCA) metric based on themeasurement of accommodation and vergence for stereoscopic image. Here;accommodation corresponds to the monocular focusing process which is modeled by two-view images' joint entropy; vergence corresponds to binocular fusion which is modeled bytwo-view images' mutual information. The joint entropy and mutual information arecalculated by the visual primitives extracted from two-view images. In this paper;accommodation-vergence conflict is expressed as the ratio of the mutual information overjoint entropy.

Frame Rate and Perceptual Quality for HD Video,Yutao Liu; Guangtao Zhai; Debin Zhao; Xianming Liu,Abstract The frame rate (FR) of a video plays an important role in affecting the perceptualvideo quality. Most studies about the effect of FR on the video quality mainly focused on lowframe rate; eg less than 30 frames per second (fps); at low resolutions like CIF or QCIF. Asthe video frame rate and resolution advance; we reconsider this issue and investigate therelationship between frame rate and the perceptual video quality under high frame rate andhigh resolution.

Optimal entropy-constrained non-uniform scalar quantizer design for low bit-rate pixel domain DVC,Bo Wu; Nan Zhang; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Abstract In this paper; an optimal entropy-constrained non-uniform scalar quantizer isproposed for the pixel domain DVC. The uniform quantizer is efficient for the hybrid videocoding since the residual signals conforming to a single-variance Laplacian distribution.However; the uniform quantizer is not optimal for pixel domain distributed video coding(DVC). This is because the uniform quantizer is not adaptive to the joint distribution of thesource and the SI; especially for low level quantization. The signal distribution of pixeldomain DVC conforms to the mixture model with multi-variance. The optimal non-uniformquantizer is designed according to the joint distribution; the error between the source andthe SI can be decreased. As a result; the bit rate can be saved and the video quality won'tsacrifice too much. Accordingly; a better RD trade-off can be achieved. First; the …,Multimedia tools and applications,2014,1

Our method involves two major stages in frame rate upconversion which are motion estimation and motion vector filtering. In the motion estimationprocess; the depth constraint to block matching algorithm is introduced in the bi-directionalmotion estimation method to obtain the motion vectors. In the motion vector filtering process;a depth-guided filter is designed to enhance the consistence of motions in the same depthplane. The refined motion vectors are used for frame interpolation.

Correlation estimation for distributed wireless video communication,Xiaoliang Zhu; Na Zhang; Xiaopeng Fan; Ruiqin Xiong; Debin Zhao,One important problem in distributed video coding is to estimate the variance of thecorrelation noise between the video signal and its decoder side information. This variance ishard to estimate due to the lack of the motion vectors at the encoder side. In this paper; wefirst propose a linear model to estimate this variance by referring the zero motion predictionat the encoder based on a Markov field assumption. Furthermore; not only the predictionnoise from the video signal itself but also the additional noise due to wireless transmission isconsidered in this paper. We applied our correlation estimation method in our recentdistributed wireless visual communication framework called DCAST. The experimentalresults show that the proposed method improves the video PSNR by 0.5-1.5 dB whileavoiding motion estimation at encoder.,Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP); 2013,2013,1

From relation between filter-based MRFs model and sparsity based method to the pursuit of natural images space,Feng Jiang; Xulin Wang; Debin Zhao,In the pursuit of natural image prior; responses to the specific filter bank and the character ofsparse representation are of the most important clues. Based on these clues; many effectiveand successful algorithms are proposed and widely used in low vision tasks. Up to now; thecorresponding researches with these clues are developed in relatively independent ways. Inthis paper; taking K-SVD as an example of sparse representation and Fields of experts (FoE)as an example of responses to the specific filter bank; we demonstrate the inherentrelationship between them. The filters of FoE stand for the components that fire rarely onnatural images; while the redundant dictionary of K-SVD depicts the primary components tosome extent. They are two complementary pursuits of natural images space.

Estimation of end-to-end distortion of virtual view for error-resilient depth map coding,Min Gao; Xiaopeng Fan; Debin Zhao; Feng Jiang; Wen Gao,In this paper; we propose to estimate the end-to-end distortion of virtual view for error-resilient depth map coding by analyzing the view-rendering process. The end-to-enddistortion is estimated according to the expectation of depth distortion. The expectation ofdepth distortion is estimated based on the error-propagated distortion from the referenceframe; which is calculated recursively for each pixel by considering the sourcecharacteristics; channel condition and error concealment method. The error-propagateddistortion in terms of each frame is updated after the frame is encoded; which is used for thesubsequent frames. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achievessubstantial and consistent gains in comparison with the random intra updating method andthe conventional rate-distortion method for error-resilient depth map coding.,Image Processing (ICIP); 2013 20th IEEE International Conference on,2013,1
A spatial inter-view auto-regressive super-resolution scheme for multi-view image via scene matching algorithm,Min Gao; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Binocular suppression theory states that the stereo vision quality is not much influenced byasymmetric degradation of the individual views. Based on these findings; mixed resolution(MR) multi-view framework jointly utilizes the lower and full resolution images to reduce thedata amount; while maintaining good stereo vision quality. To enhance the resolution of thelower resolution image; a novel superresolution scheme for the MR multi-view framework ispresented in the paper. It is based on the assumption that the image is modeled as a 2Dpiecewise auto-regressive process. In the scheme; each pixel to be interpolated is estimatedas the linear weighted summation of the pixels; which are consisted of the spatialneighboring ones from lower resolution image in the current view and the ones from the fullresolution image in the neighboring views.

Quality assessment of stereoscopic images based on the significance of perceptual vision [J],Feng Jiang; Meisi Guo; Shaohui Liu; Debin Zhao,The visual psychological and physiological factors are crucial for the assessment on imagequality. There are many visual; psychological and physiological calculation models used tosupport the assessment of image quality; however; how to analyze the intrinsic relationsamong various isolated methods and further effectively coordinate them in the task of imagequality assessment is the key to making the assessment results more conform to subjectiveassessment of human. The definition and formalization of visual attention areas as saliencyin the early vision period and poor-quality area for vision transformation periods wereexamined from an image quality angle.

Bayesian frame interpolation by fusing multiple motion-compensated prediction frames,Hongbin Liu; Ruiqin Xiong; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,For video frame rate up-conversion; new frames need to be interpolated along motiontrajectories and inserted between the original adjacent frames. This paper proposes aBayesian frame interpolation strategy; which considers both the spatial (ie intra-frame)correlation model and the temporal (ie inter-frame) correlation model after motioncompensation. Different from the conventional schemes that perform interpolation using onlyone estimated motion vector field (MVF); the proposed strategy estimates multiple MVFs. Tocope with different scales of frame contents; we generate the multiple MVFs through variableblock size motion estimation. A criterion is adopted to estimate reliability of the motioncompensated prediction frames from different motion fields. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that the proposed strategy improves the interpolation performance …,Image Processing (ICIP); 2011 18th IEEE International Conference on,2011,1
Constant quality control of Wyner-Ziv frames in DCT domain distributed video coding,Hongbin Liu; Debin Zhao; Siwei Ma; Wen Gao,Abstract. For most DCT domain distributed video coding systems; fixed uniform quantizersare used to quantize all Wyner-Ziv (WZ) frames. However; it leads to fluctuant video qualitybecause the WZ frame quality is also greatly influenced by the side information (SI) qualitybesides the quantizers. To address this issue; this letter proposes a new constant qualitycontrol strategy; which adaptively designs quantizers for each WZ frame according to its SI.We formulate the constant quality control problem into the adaptive quantization level (AQL)design problem; and propose a low complexity greedy algorithm to solve it. Experimentalresults demonstrate that the proposed algorithm decreases the quality fluctuation obviouslyand improves the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) by 0.79 dB as well when compared withthe state-of-the-art algorithm.,ICIC Express Letters,2011,1
Fast disparity estimation utilizing depth information for multiview video coding,Zhongmei Qiao; Xiaoming Li; Debin Zhao; Yanwei Liu; Wen Gao,Multiview video coding (MVC) improves the coding efficiency by motion estimation (ME) anddisparity estimation (DE). ME and DE at encoder side involve in heavy computation; whichneeds to be further reduced for practical applications. This paper presents fast disparityestimation by utilizing depth information to reduce DE's computational complexity. First; thecoordinate offset of the encoding block is calculated by 3D warping in the reference viewframe utilizing depth map. Then the search region for DE is adjusted according to thecoordinate offset. Experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can save roughly50% coding time with negligible loss of coding efficiency.,Circuits and Systems (ISCAS); 2011 IEEE International Symposium on,2011,1
Joint forward backward error concealment of redundantly coded video,Xiaopeng Fan; Oscar C Au; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Error concealment at the video decoder is to recover erroneous picture region based oncorrectly decoded region in the same frame or the neighboring frames. However; theexisting error concealment methods cannot give satisfactory result in some situations; egwhen a whole frame is lost.

The key observation is that; a future frame can be recoveredwithout using its reference frame when some error resilience tools; such as redundantpicture; are used. Based on this observation; the proposed JFBC performs temporal errorconcealment along not only forward direction but also backward direction. Furthermore; theJFBC combines the forward concealment result and the backward concealment result byusing linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation.

After studying therelationship between search range of P and B picture; a simple search range scalingstrategy is proposed at first; which is efficient for normal or low motion video.

Motion Aligned Spatial Scalable Video Coding,Debing Liu; Yuwen He; Shipeng Li; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,A motion aligned spatial scalable video coding scheme (MA-SSC) is proposed in this paper.Different from the traditional spatial scalable coding schemes derived from MPEG-2; in theproposed scheme only one set of intra or inter prediction modes are optimally selected byjointly considering the base and enhancement layers. Thus; it saves one set of macroblock(MB) mode and motion vectors. Moreover; the combined motion estimation can reduce theresidual coding bits of the base layer. The MA-SSC and traditional spatial scalable codingschemes are both implemented based on H. 264 reference software to evaluate theirperformance.

Extending DACLIC for near-lossless compression with postprocessing of greyscale images,Debin Zhao; YK Chan; Wen Gao,Summary form only given. A lossless/near lossless coding scheme; DACLIC; is presented.The proposed scheme attempts to remove redundancy in a given image in the spatialdomain. The redundancy removal is achieved by block direction prediction and context-based error modeling. The block direction operation in DACLIC first partitions an image intoblocks. Pixels within each incoming block are analyzed resulting in a best directionalprediction for that block. The best direction is chosen from a given set that results in theminimum prediction error. Removal of redundancy by the block direction technique is notpossible for removing all possible redundancy in a given image. Another decorrelation partof the DACLIC scheme is the context-based error modeling which exploits context-dependent DPCM error structures.

Fast Noisy Image Quality Assessment Based on Free-Energy Principle,Yadan Zhao; Yutao Liu; Feng Jiang; Xianming Liu; Debin Zhao,Abstract In this work; we propose a fast noisy image quality assessment approach under thetheory of free-energy principle. The free-energy principle accounts for that the brain tries topredict the input image with an internal generative model. While there exists a discrepancybetween the image and its model-predicted version and this discrepancy is believed to beclosely related to the perceptual quality of the image. Accordingly; we devise the method forevaluating the quality of the noisy image; in which the internal generative model is firstgeneralized from AR simulation and then instantiated with simple but effective medianfunction. The quality-related discrepancy denoted by the entropy of the predicted residuals isdefined to measure the whole quality of the image.

Signal Dependent Transform Based on SVD for HEVC Intracoding,Tao Zhang; Haoming Chen; Ming-Ting Sun; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Transform is used to compact the energy of the blocks into a small number of coefficientsand is widely used in recent image/video coding standards. In the latest video codingstandard high efficiency video coding (HEVC); a combination of discrete cosine transform(DCT) and discrete sine transform (DST) is adopted to transform the residuals from intraprediction.

Research has simulated the sensitivity of HVS toluminance contrast and spatial and temporal masking effects with the just-noticeable-distortion (JND) model; which describes the perception redundancy quantitatively. Thispaper proposes a new model named MJND (JND in Multi-view); which explores the propertyof HVS to stereoscopic masking effect. The proposed model not only contains the spatialand temporal JND; but also includes the JND in depth. The MJND model is then used inmacroblock (MB) quantization adjustment and rate-distortion optimization in multi-view …,*,2013,*
A fast multiview video transcoder for bitrate reduction,Bing Wang; Xiaopeng Fan; Shaohui Liu; Yan Liu; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Video transcoding is an efficient way to reduce the bitrate or convert the format of the originalvideo stream to meet the requirements of different applications and various channelcapacity. In this paper; we propose a fast multiview video transcoder (MVT) for bitratereduction. Different from the H. 264 transcoder; the inter-view prediction information in theinput video stream is utilized to reduce the complexity of transcoding. Besides; we alsoutilize the mode and selected reference frame information in original stream to accelerateRD optimization calculations. Experimental results show that the proposed transcoder canachieve significant computation reduction while maintaining close RD performancecompared to the fully decode and re-encode transcoder (FDET).,Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP); 2012 IEEE,2012,*
Directional frame interpolation for MPEG compressed video,Chang Zhao; Xinwei Gao; Xiaopeng Fan; Debin Zhao,Image interpolation is one of the most elementary imaging research topics. A number ofimage interpolation methods have been developed for uncompressed images in theliterature. However; a lot of videos have already been stored in MPEG-2 format or have to betransmitted in MPEG-2 format due to bandwidth limitation. The image interpolation methodsdeveloped for uncompressed images may not be effective when directly applied tocompressed videos; because on the one hand; they do not utilize the information existed inthe coded bitstreams; on the other hand; they do not consider quantization error; which maybe dominant in some cases. Inspired by the success of the intra prediction in H. 264/AVCand the edge-directed image interpolation methods (such as LAZA and NEDI); we propose adirectional frame interpolation for MPEG compressed video.

A parallel context model for level information in CABAC,Min Gao; Xiaopeng Fan; Qiang Wang; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,Context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) is one of the most time-consumingmodules in H. 264/AVC decoder. A potential way to accelerate CABAC is by parallelization.However; the context modeling process for level information in CABAC is highly serial innature and can not be parallelized in the coefficient level. In order to improve the throughputof CABAC; in this paper we present a parallel context model for level information. The keyfeature of the model is to use the total number of the significant coefficients and the scannedposition of the current significant coefficient in the quantized transform coefficient block asthe context information. Since the context information is independent of the previouslydecoded significant coefficients; parallel decoding in coefficient level is achieved.

Saliency Detection: A Self-Adaption Sparse Representation Approach,Gaoxiang Zhang; Feng Jiang; Debin Zhao; Xiaoshuai Sun; Shaohui Liu,Saliency detection is essential to visual attention modelling and various computer visiontasks. Representation and measurement are two important issues for saliency models. Goodrepresentation and reasonable measurement are both critical issues in modelling visualsaliency mechanism. For every input image; we obtain a self-adaptive dictionary thatdescribes the image content effectively and image prior that forces sparsity in every locationin the image using the K-SVD algorithm. For saliency measurement; background firing rate(BFR) is defined for each sparse features and it is followed by feature activation rate (FAR)computation to measure the bottom-up visual saliency.,Image and Graphics (ICIG); 2011 Sixth International Conference on,2011,*
Up-sampling Dependent Frame Rate Reduction for Low Bit-Rate Video Coding,Yongbing Zhang; Haoqian Wang; Debin Zhao,Summary form only given. In low bit rate video coding; the frame rate of input sequence canbe reduced to the half or even smaller portion by skipping or deleting frames beforecompression; and then the temporal resolution is restored via up-sampling at the decoderside. Numerous algorithms have been developed to address the problem of temporalresolution improvement. Actually; the quality of up-sampled frames depends on not only theperformance of up-sampling method but also the information maintained in the down-sampled video sequence. To improve the quality of up-sampled frames and smooth thequality between the up-sampled and decompressed frames; this paper proposes an up-sampling dependent frame rate reduction; which is shown in Fig. 1.

Frame layer rate control for dual frame motion compensation,Da Liu; Debin Zhao; Siwe Ma; Wen Gao,Rate control plays an important role in video coding. When jump update dual frame motioncompensation (JU-DFMC) is utilized in video coding; two kinds of frames are existedaccording to bit allocation; one is low quality frame (LQF); the other is high quality frame(HQF). For each current frame (LQF or HQF); one short term reference frame (STR) and onelong term reference frame (LTR) are utilized for motion compensation. Owning to this kind ofcoding structure; rate control for JU-DFMC is different from traditional methods. In this paper;a rate control scheme for JU-DFMC is proposed.

Adaptive Spatial and Transform Domain FGS Coding,Li Zhang; Xiangyang Ji; Wen Gao; Debin Zhao,In inter-picture coding; block-based frequency transform is usually carried out on thepredicted errors for each interblock to remove the spatial correlation among them. However;it can not always do well since the predicted errors in some inter-blocks have marginal ordiagonal correlation. A good solution is to omit transform operations for the predicted errorsof those inter-blocks with low correlation before quantization operation. The samephenomenon also can be observed in fine grain scalability (FGS) layer coding. In this paper;an adaptive prediction error coding method in spatial and frequency domain with lowercomplexity is considered for FGS layer coding. Transform operation is only needed whenthere are non-zero reconstructed coefficients in spatially co-located block in base layer.

Low-Complexity FGS Coding for Interlaced SVC in Low-Delay Applications,Yanyan Zheng; Xiangyang Ji; Feng Wu; Debin Zhao; Wen Gao,JVT SVC has adopted AR-FGS (fine granularity scalability with adaptive reference) toefficiently encode the progressive sequences for low-delay applications. Generally; low-delay applications demand low complexity. However; to some extent; the significant gain ofAR-FGS is achieved at the expense of much higher coding complexity. In this paper; wepropose an efficient FGS coding scheme for low-delay applications that can more smartlycompress the interlaced video sources by fully utilizing the special temporal correlation ofinterlaced sequences. Compared to AR-FGS in coding interlaced sequences; the newapproach is able to significantly reduce both the encoding and decoding complexity whilemaintaining comparable compression performance.

An improved motion vector prediction scheme for video coding,Da Liu; Debin Zhao; Qiang Wang; Wen Gao,Abstract The motion vector prediction (MVP) is an important part of video coding. In theoriginal median predictor; if the neighbor blocks of current block are intra-mode coded; theirmotion vectors (MVs) will be set to zeros for MVP of current block. This is not very precise forsequences with strong motion. This paper propose an improved motion vector prediction(MVP) scheme for H. 264. In the proposed scheme; when there are intra-mode macroblocksbeside current block; more MV of the neighbor inter-mode block is utilized instead of zeroMVs of intra-mode macroblocks for MVP of current block. The experimental results show thatthe improved scheme achieves better coding efficiency than the original median predictor.Meanwhile the point obtained by the proposed MVP scheme is closer to the global minimumpoint; the following fast motion estimation (FME) computation complexity is reduced.,Pacific-Rim Conference on Multimedia,2006,*

Although thepossibility of this was shown ten years ago; unfortunately few such studies have beenreported so far. The major difficulty is that motion vectors derived from video decoders; whichgenerally refer to average motion over several field periods instead of motion betweenadjacent fields; are far from perfect. In this paper; a real-time MC deinterlacing scheme isproposed for transcoding from MPEG-2 to AVS; which is the Audio Video coding Standard ofChina targeting at higher coding efficiency and lower complexity than existing standards forhigh definition video coding.

pACOLA–FACE CODER BASED ON LOCATION AND,De-bin ZHAO; Wen GAO; Isaac YK Chan; Ming-bao LIU,Abstract In this paper; FACOLA (FAce COder based on Location and Attention) is proposedfor potential applications. Facc locator locates a facc in an input image using tcmplatematching and eigenface techniques. Attcntion detector detccts high attention and lowattcntion in thc facc located according to thcir frcquency charactcristics. For lhigh attention;usually high quality or losslcss coding is rcquircd; and DPCM coder with thrcc directionalpredictors is applied. DCT coder is adoptcd for low attcntion and non-face area compressionwith different quantization factors. A scheme for adaptively sclccting DCT and DPCMquantization factors is proposcd. It las bccn tcsted on ORI. facc database. FACOLA hasdemonstrated rcliable and accurate pcrformance on facc location and attention dctection.The reconstructed images of FACOLA show much better visual quality than JPEG …,*,*,*
Fast Disparity and Motion Estimation Based on Correlations for Multiview Video Coding,Debin Zhao; Siwei Ma; Wen Gao,Abstract—Recently; multiview video coding has attracted great attention from industries andresearch institutes. However; the heavy computational complexity limits its practicalapplications. In this paper; a fast disparity and motion estimation for multiview video codingis presented; based on the correlations between the neighboring cameras and between themotion and the disparity. In the proposed approach; first; a search region estimation isproposed to reduce the disparity estimation complexity according to that the camera set isusually fixed and therefore the disparity between the two neighboring views can be limited toan estimable range. Second; a motion vector derivation is given based on the geometricrelationship between the motion and the disparity. In addition; an early termination schemeis provided to further reduce the number of reference frames. The experimental results …,*,*,*

Nonparametric Background Generation1,Yazhou Liua; Hongxun Yaoa; Wen Gaob; Xilin Chenb; Debin Zhaoa,Abstract A novel background generation method based on nonparametric backgroundmodel is presented for background subtraction. We introduce a new model; named as effectcomponents description (ECD); to model the variation of the background; by which we canrelate the best estimate of the background to the modes (local maxima) of the underlyingdistribution. Based on ECD; an effective background generation method; most reliablebackground mode (MRBM); is developed. The basic computational module of the method isan old pattern recognition procedure; the mean shift; which can be used recursively to findthe nearest stationary point of the underlying density function. The advantages of thismethod are three-fold: first; backgrounds can be generated from image sequence withcluttered moving objects; second; backgrounds are very clear without blur effect; third; it is …,*,*,*

Incremental Face-Specific Subspace for Online-Learning Face Recognition,Wenchao Zhang; Shiguang Shan; Wen Gao; Jianyu Wang; Debin Zhao,ABSTRACT A practical face recognition system is expected to have the ability to learn onlineto adapt to different variations of the imaging conditions in order to achieve betterrecognition performance; especially when batch training is impossible. This is commonlyachieved by updating the face model incrementally for each face. Based on our previousFace-Specific Subspace (FSS) face recognition method; in this paper; an incrementalsubspace updating method is further applied to FSS in order to make it have the ability tolearn online; which is named Incremental Face Specific Subspace (IFSS). Since in the FSSface recognition method; each individual face is represented as one specific face subspace;therefore; the face model can be updated even only single live example face image isavailable as well as its corresponding class label.

Joint coding Scheme for Maximum Macroblock Prediction Type and Coding Block Pattern,Honggang Qi; Wen Gao; Siwei Ma; Debin Zhao,Abstract. In this paper; a joint coding scheme for improving the coding efficiency ofmacroblock prediction type (MBTYPE) and coded block pattern (CBP) is proposed. Theproposed coding scheme exploits the characteristics of zero-order Exp-Golomb code forcoding MBTYPE and CBP; and makes use of the fractional bits which are unused byMBTYPE to code both maximum MBTYPE and CBP so that each bit can be more efficientlyused. With joint coding scheme; the average length of coded bits for the maximum MBTYPEand the CBP is shortened. The total bitrate is therefore reduced. The analysis andexperimental results show that the proposed scheme is efficient for improving the codingperformances of sequences; especially to those sequences with more blocks coded withmaximum MBTYPE.,*,*,*
