Denial of service attacks in wireless networks: The case of jammers,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Marios Iliofotou; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy,The shared nature of the medium in wireless networks makes it easy for an adversary tolaunch a Wireless Denial of Service (WDoS) attack. Recent studies; demonstrate that suchattacks can be very easily accomplished using off-the-shelf equipment. To give a simpleexample; a malicious node can continually transmit a radio signal in order to block anylegitimate access to the medium and/or interfere with reception. This act is called jammingand the malicious nodes are referred to as jammers. Jamming techniques vary from simpleones based on the continual transmission of interference signals; to more sophisticatedattacks that aim at exploiting vulnerabilities of the particular protocol used. In this survey; wepresent a detailed up-to-date discussion on the jamming attacks recorded in the literature.We also describe various techniques proposed for detecting the presence of jammers …,IEEE Communications surveys & tutorials,2011,374
Lightweight jammer localization in wireless networks: System design and implementation,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Iordanis Koutsopoulos; Ioannis Broustis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy,Jamming attacks have become prevalent during the last few years; due to the shared natureand the open access to the wireless medium. Finding the location of a jamming device is ofgreat importance for restoring normal network operations. After detecting the malicious nodewe want to find its position; in order for further security actions to be taken. Our goal in thispaper is the design and implementation of a simple; lightweight and generic localizationalgorithm. Our scheme is based on the principles of the gradient descent minimizationalgorithm. The key observation is that the packet delivery ratio (PDR) has lower values aswe move closer to the jammer. Hence; the use of a gradient-based scheme; operating on thediscrete plane of the network topology; can help locate the jamming device. Thecontributions of our work are the following:(a) we demonstrate; through analysis and …,Global Telecommunications Conference; 2009. GLOBECOM 2009. IEEE,2009,70
Experimental characterization of 802.11 n link quality at high rates,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Theodoros Salonidis; Henrik Lundgren; Nitin Vaidya,Abstract 802.11 n has made a quantum leap over legacy 802.11 systems by supportingextremely higher transmission rates at the physical layer. In this paper; we ask whether suchhigh rates translate to high quality links in a real deployment. Our experimental investigationin an indoor wireless testbed reveals that the highest transmission rates advertised by the802.11 n standard typically produce losses (or even outages) even in interference-freeenvironments. Such losses become more acute and persist at high SNR values; even at lowinterference intensity. We find that these problems are partly due to bad configurations thatdo not allow exploitation of spatial diversity; partly due to the wider 802.11 n channels thatexpose these sensitive high rates to more interference. We show that these problems can bealleviated using the 802.11 n MAC layer enhancements jointly with packet size …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international workshop on Wireless network testbeds; experimental evaluation and characterization,2010,61
Data mining techniques for (network) intrusion detection systems,Theodoros Lappas; Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract—In Information Security; intrusion detection is the act of detecting actions thatattempt to compromise the confidentiality; integrity or availability of a resource. Intrusiondetection does not; in general; include prevention of intrusions. In this paper; we are mostlyfocused on data mining techniques that are being used for such purposes. We debate on theadvantages and disadvantages of these techniques. Finally we present a new idea on howdata mining can aid IDSs.,Department of Computer Science and Engineering UC Riverside; Riverside CA,2007,49
Auto-configuration of 802.11 n WLANs,Mustafa Y Arslan; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Ioannis Broustis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Sateesh Addepalli; Konstantina Papagiannaki,Abstract Channel Bonding (CB) combines two adjacent frequency bands to form a new;wider band to facilitate high data rate transmissions in MIMO-based 802.11 n networks.However; the use of a wider band with CB can exacerbate interference effects. Furthermore;CB does not always provide benefits in interference-free settings; and can even degradeperformance in some cases. We conduct an in-depth; experimental study to understand theimplications of CB. Based on this study we design an auto-configuration framework;ACORN; for enterprise 802.11 n WLANs. ACORN integrates the functions of userassociation and channel allocation; since our study reveals that they are tightly coupledwhen CB is used. We show that the channel allocation problem with the constraints of CB isNP-complete. Thus; ACORN uses an algorithm that provides a worst case approximation …,Proceedings of the 6th International COnference,2010,47
Detecting selfish exploitation of carrier sensing in 802.11 networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Guanhua Yan; Stephan Eidenbenz; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy,Recently; tuning the clear channel assessment (CCA) threshold in conjunction with powercontrol has been considered for improving the performance of Wireless LANs. However;CCA tuning can be exploited by selfish nodes in order to obtain an unfair share of theavailable bandwidth. In particular; by increasing the CCA threshold; a selfish client canmanipulate the carrier sensing mechanism to ignore the presence of other transmissions onthe medium; consequently; it increases the probability of accessing the medium andtherefore obtains a higher; unfair share of the available bandwidth. In this paper; we proposea novel approach to detect this misbehavior in WLANs. A key insight that leads to ourapproach is that a misbehaving node that has increased its CCA is unlikely to recognize lowpower receptions as legitimate packets; by intelligently sending low power probe …,INFOCOM 2009; IEEE,2009,46
Ares: an anti-jamming reinforcement system for 802.11 networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Ioannis Broustis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Christos Gkantsidis,Abstract Dense; unmanaged 802.11 deployments tempt saboteurs into launching jammingattacks by injecting malicious interference. Nowadays; jammers can be portable devices thattransmit intermittently at low power in order to conserve energy. In this paper; we firstconduct extensive experiments on an indoor 802.11 network to assess the ability of twophysical layer functions; rate adaptation and power control; in mitigating jamming. In thepresence of a jammer we find that:(a) the use of popular rate adaptation algorithms cansignificantly degrade network performance and;(b) appropriate tuning of the carrier sensingthreshold allows a transmitter to send packets even when being jammed and enables areceiver capture the desired signal.

Data fusion algorithms for network anomaly detection: classification and evaluation,Vasilis Chatzigiannakis; Georgios Androulidakis; K Pelechrinis; Symeon Papavassiliou; Vasilis Maglaris,In this paper; the problem of discovering anomalies in a large-scale network based on thedata fusion of heterogeneous monitors is considered. We present a classification of anomalydetection algorithms based on data fusion; and motivated by this classification; theoperational principles and characteristics of two different representative approaches; onebased on the Demster-Shafer theory of evidence and one based on principal componentanalysis; are described. The detection effectiveness of these strategies are evaluated andcompared under different attack scenarios; based on both real data and simulations. Ourstudy and corresponding numerical results revealed that in principle the conditions underwhich they operate efficiently are complementary; and therefore could be used effectively inan integrated way to detect a wider range of attacks..,Networking and Services; 2007.

Downlink capacity of hybrid cellular ad hoc networks,Lap Kong Law; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Michalis Faloutsos,Abstract Augmenting cellular networks with shorter multihop wireless links that carry trafficto/from a base station can be expected to facilitate higher rates and improved spatial reuse;therefore potentially yielding increased wireless capacity. The resulting network is referredto as a hybrid network. However; while this approach can result in shorter range higher ratelinks and improved spatial reuse; which together favor a capacity increase; it relies onmultihop forwarding; which is detrimental to the overall capacity. In this paper; our objectiveis to evaluate the impact of these conflicting factors on the overall capacity of the hybridnetwork. We formally define the capacity of the network as the maximum possible downlinkthroughput under the constraint of max-min fairness. We analytically compute the capacity ofboth one-and two-dimensional hybrid networks with regular placement of base stations …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2010,41
Topology control for effective interference cancellation in multiuser MIMO networks,Ece Gelal; Jianxia Ning; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Tae-Suk Kim; Ioannis Broustis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Bhaskar D Rao,Abstract In multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) networks; receivers decodemultiple concurrent signals using successive interference cancellation (SIC). With SIC; aweak target signal can be deciphered in the presence of stronger interfering signals.However; this is only feasible if each strong interfering signal satisfies a signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) requirement. This necessitates the appropriate selection of asubset of links that can be concurrently active in each receiver's neighborhood; in otherwords; a subtopology consisting of links that can be simultaneously active in the network isto be formed. If the selected subtopologies are of small size; the delay between thetransmission opportunities on a link increases. Thus; care should be taken to form a limitednumber of subtopologies. We find that the problem of constructing the minimum number …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2013,40
Gaming the jammer: Is frequency hopping effective?,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Christos Koufogiannakis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy,Frequency hopping has been the most popularly considered approach for alleviating theeffects of jamming attacks. In this paper; we provide a novel; measurement-driven; gametheoretic framework that captures the interactions between a communication link and anadversarial jammer; possibly with multiple jamming devices; in a wireless networkemploying frequency hopping (FH). The framework can be used to quantify the efficacy ofFH as a jamming countermeasure. Our model accounts for two important factors that affectthe aforementioned interactions:(a) the number of orthogonal channels available for use and(b) the frequency separation between these orthogonal bands. If the latter is small; then theenergy spill over between two adjacent channels (considered orthogonal) is high; as a resulta jammer on an orthogonal band that is adjacent to that used by a legitimate …,Modeling and Optimization in Mobile; Ad Hoc; and Wireless Networks; 2009.

Customized tour recommendations in urban areas,Aristides Gionis; Theodoros Lappas; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The ever-increasing urbanization coupled with the unprecedented capacity tocollect and process large amounts of data have helped to create the vision of intelligenturban environments. One key aspect of such environments is that they allow people toeffectively navigate through their city. While GPS technology and route-planning serviceshave undoubtedly helped towards this direction; there is room for improvement in intelligenturban navigation. This vision can be fostered by the proliferation of location-based socialnetworks; such as Foursquare or Path; which record the physical presence of users indifferent venues through check-ins. This information can then be used to enhance intelligenturban navigation; by generating customized path recommendations for users. In this paper;we focus on the problem of recommending customized tours in urban settings. These …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2014,39
On the efficacy of frequency hopping in coping with jamming attacks in 802.11 networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Christos Koufogiannakis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy,Frequency hopping (FH) has been the most popularly considered approach for alleviatingthe effects of jamming attacks. We re-examine; the efficacy of FH based on bothexperimentation and analysis. Briefly; the limitations of FH are:(a) the energy spill overbetween adjacent channels that are considered to be orthogonal; and (b) the small numberof available orthogonal bands. In a nutshell; the main contributions of our work are:(a)Construction of a measurement-driven game theoretic framework which models theinteractions between a jammer and a communication link employing FH. Our modelaccounts for the above limiting factors and provides bounds on the performance of proactiveFH in coping with jamming.(b) Extensive experimentation to quantify the impact of a jammeron 802.11 a/g/n networks.

VICO: A framework for configuring indoor visible light communication networks,Yiyang Li; Leijie Wang; Jianxia Ning; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Zhengyuan Xu,Visible light communications (VLC) are gaining popularity and may provide an alternativemeans of communications in indoor settings. However; to date; there is very little researchon the deployment or higher layer protocol design for VLC. In this paper; we first performchannel measurements using a physical layer testbed in the visible light band to understandits physical layer characteristics. Our measurements suggest that in order to increase datarates with VLC (1) the beam width of a communicating link can be shrunk; and (2) thetransmission beam can be tuned to point towards the target recipient. We then performMatlab simulations to verify that the human eye is able to accommodate the changesbrought by shrinking a beam or by tuning the beam direction appropriately. As our maincontribution; we then design a configuration framework for a VLC indoor local area …,Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems (MASS); 2012 IEEE 9th International Conference on,2012,37

Design and deployment considerations for high performance MIMO testbeds,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Ioannis Broustis; Theodoros Salonidis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Prasant Mohapatra,Abstract MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) enabled systems are characterized by higherreliability and transmission rates; as compared to conventional SISO (Single Input SingleOutput) systems. However; unless administered properly; the MIMO technology may notfacilitate very high throughputs on point-to-point wireless links. Therefore; it becomesimperative for the network architect to design such networks in ways that fully exploit theinherent properties of MIMO. In this paper; we first conduct an extensive experimental study;using a powerful hardware platform; in order to understand the behavior of MIMO links indifferent topological scenarios. Our experiments involve scenarios with MIMO links inisolation; as well as in competition with other MIMO and SISO links.

Understanding spatial homophily: the case of peer influence and social selection,Ke Zhang; Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract Homophily is a phenomenon observed very frequently in social networks and isrelated with the inclination of people to be involved with others that exhibit similarcharacteristics. The roots of homophily can be subtle and are mainly traced back to twomechanisms:(i) social selection and (ii) peer influence. Decomposing the effects of each ofthese mechanisms requires analysis of longitudinal data. This has been a burden to similarstudies in traditional social sciences due to the hardness of collecting such information.However; the proliferation of online social media has enabled the collection of massiveamounts of information related with human activities. In this work; we are interested inexamining the forces of the above mechanisms in the context of the locations visited bypeople.

Coping with packet replay attacks in wireless networks,Zi Feng; Jianxia Ning; Ioannis Broustis; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Michalis Faloutsos,In this paper; we consider a variant of packet replay attacks wherein; an attacker simplyreplays overheard frames as they are; or with minor manipulations in the packet header; werefer to this as the copycat attack. When routers forward such replayed packets; the levels ofcongestion and interference increase in large portions of the network. Our experimentsindicate that even a single attacker can degrade the route throughput by up to 61%. Whilesimple to use techniques such as digitally signing every packet can stem the disseminationof such packets; they are resource intense. Thus; we design a lightweight detection andprevention system; COPS (for Copycat Online Prevention System); that intelligently uses acombination of digital signatures and Bloom filters to cope with the attack. With our system;the task of identifying and discarding replayed packets is distributed across a plurality of …,Sensor; mesh and ad hoc communications and networks (SECON); 2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on,2011,22
On the importance of temporal dynamics in modeling urban activity,Ke Zhang; Qiuye Jin; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Theodoros Lappas,Abstract The vast amount of available spatio-temporal data of human activities and mobilityhas given raise to the rapidly emerging field of urban computing/informatics. Central to thelatter is understanding the dynamics of the activities that take place in an urban area (eg; acity). This can significantly enhance functionalities such as resource and service allocationwithin a city. Existing literature has paid a lot of attention on spatial dynamics; with thetemporal ones often being neglected and left out. However; this can lead to non-negligibleimplications. For instance; while two areas can appear to exhibit similar activity when thelatter is aggregated in time; they can be significantly different when introducing the temporaldimension. Furthermore; even when considering a specific area X alone; the transitions ofthe activity that takes place within X are important themselves.

ACORN: An auto-configuration framework for 802.11 n WLANs,Mustafa Y Arslan; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Ioannis Broustis; Shailendra Singh; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Sateesh Addepalli; Konstantina Papagiannaki,The wide channels feature combines two adjacent channels to form a new; wider channel tofacilitate high-data-rate transmissions in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-based IEEE802.11 n networks. Using a wider channel can exacerbate interference effects. Furthermore;contrary to what has been reported by prior studies; we find that wide channels do notalways provide benefits in isolation (ie; one link without interference) and can even degradeperformance. We conduct an in-depth; experimental study to understand the implications ofwide channels on throughput performance. Based on our measurements; we design an auto-configuration framework called ACORN for enterprise 802.11 n WLANs.

On the impact of MIMO diversity on higher layer performance,Ece Gelal; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Ioannis Broustis; Srikanth V Krishnamurhty; Saif Mohammed; Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam; Sneha Kasera,In this paper; we shed light on the cross-layer interactions between the PHY; link and routinglayers in networks with MIMO links operating in the diversity mode. Many previous studiesassume an overly simplistic PHY layer model that does not sufficiently capture theseinteractions. We show that the use of simplistic models can in fact lead to misleadingconclusions with regards to the higher layer performance with MIMO diversity. Towardsunderstanding the impact of various PHY layer features on MIMO diversity; we begin with asimple but widely-used model and progressively incorporate these features to create newmodels. We examine the goodness of these models by comparing the simulatedperformance results with each; with measurements on an indoor 802.11 n testbed.

Cognitive radio networks: realistic or not?,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Prashant Krishnamurthy; Martin Weiss; Taieb Znati,Abstract A large volume of research has been conducted in the cognitive radio (CR) area thelast decade. However; the deployment of a commercial CR network is yet to emerge. A largeportion of the existing literature does not build on real world scenarios; hence; neglectingvarious important aspects of commercial telecommunication networks. For instance; a lot ofattention has been paid to spectrum sensing as the front line functionality that needs to becompleted in an efficient and accurate manner to enable an opportunistic CR networkarchitecture. While on the one hand it is necessary to detect the existence of spectrum holes;on the other hand; simply sensing (cooperatively or not) the energy emitted from a primarytransmitter cannot enable correct dynamic spectrum access. For example; the presence of aprimary transmitter's signal does not mean that CR network users cannot access the …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2013,18
FIJI: Fighting implicit jamming in 802.11 WLANs,Ioannis Broustis; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Dimitris Syrivelis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Leandros Tassiulas,Abstract The IEEE 802.11 protocol inherently provides the same long-term throughput to allthe clients associated with a given access point (AP). In this paper; we first identify a clever;low-power jamming attack that can take advantage of this behavioral trait: the placement of alow-power jammer in a way that it affects a single legitimate client can cause starvation to allthe other clients. In other words; the total throughput provided by the corresponding AP isdrastically degraded. To fight against this attack; we design FIJI; a cross-layer anti-jammingsystem that detects such intelligent jammers and mitigates their impact on networkperformance. FIJI looks for anomalies in the AP load distribution to efficiently performjammer detection. It then makes decisions with regards to optimally shaping the traffic suchthat:(a) the clients that are not explicitly jammed are shielded from experiencing starvation …,International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Systems,2009,18
When is electromagnetic spectrum fungible?,Martin Weiss; Prashant Krishnamurthy; Linda E Doyle; Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Fungibility is a common assumption for market-based spectrum management. In this paper;we explore the dimensions of practical fungibility of frequency bands from the point of viewof the spectrum buyer who intends to use it. The exploration shows that fungibility is acomplex; multidimensional concept that cannot casually be assumed. We develop two ideasfor quantifying fungibility-(i) of a fungibility space in which the “distance” between two slicesof spectrum provides score of fungibility and (ii) a probabilistic score of fungibility.,Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DYSPAN); 2012 IEEE International Symposium on,2012,17
Location affiliation networks: Bonding social and spatial information,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Prashant Krishnamurthy,Abstract Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have recently attracted a lot of attentiondue to the number of novel services they can offer. Prior work on analysis of LBSNs hasmainly focused on the social part of these systems. Even though it is important to know howdifferent the structure of the social graph of an LBSN is as compared to the friendship-basedsocial networks (SNs); it raises the interesting question of what kinds of linkages existbetween locations and friendships. The main problem we are investigating is to identify suchconnections between the social and the spatial planes of an LBSN. In particular; in thispaper we focus on answering the following general question “What are the bonds betweenthe social and spatial information in an LBSN and what are the metrics that can revealthem?” In order to tackle this problem; we employ the idea of affiliation networks …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2012,17
Spotting misbehaviors in location-based social networks using tensors,Evangelos Papalexakis; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract The proliferation of mobile devices that are capable of estimating their position; haslead to the emergence of a new class of social networks; namely location-based socialnetworks (LBSNs for short). The main interaction between users in an LBSN is locationsharing. While the latter can be realized through continuous tracking of a user'swhereabouts from the service provider; the majority of LBSNs allow users to voluntarilyshare their location; through check-ins. LBSNs provide incentives to users to perform check-ins. However; these incentives can also lead to people faking their location; thus; generatingfalse information. In this work; we propose the use of tensor decomposition for spottinganomalies in the check-in behavior of users. To the best of our knowledge; this is the firstattempt to model this problem using tensor analysis.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,15
Forensic analysis of packet losses in wireless networks,Jianxia Ning; Shailendra Singh; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Bin Liu; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Ramesh Govindan,Due to the lossy nature of wireless links; it is difficult to determine if packet losses are due towireless-induced effects or from malicious discarding. Many prior efforts on detectingmalicious packet drops rely on evidence collected via passive monitoring by neighbornodes; however; they do not analyze the cause of packet losses. In this paper; we ask:(a)Given certain macroscopic parameters of the network (like traffic intensity and node density)what is the likelihood that evidence exists with respect to a transmission? and;(b) How canthese parameters be used to perform a forensic analysis of the reason for the losses?Towards answering the above questions; we first build an analytical framework thatcomputes the likelihood that evidence (we call this transmission evidence or TE for short)exists with respect to transmissions; in terms of a set of network parameters.

Detection of selfish manipulation of carrier sensing in 802.11 networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Guanhua Yan; Stephan Eidenbenz; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy,Recently; tuning the clear channel assessment (CCA) threshold in conjunction with powercontrol has been considered for improving the performance of WLANs. However; we showthat; CCA tuning can be exploited by selfish nodes to obtain an unfair share of the availablebandwidth. Specifically; a selfish entity can manipulate the CCA threshold to ignore ongoingtransmissions; this increases the probability of accessing the medium and provides the entitya higher; unfair share of the bandwidth. We experiment on our 802.11 testbed tocharacterize the effects of CCA tuning on both isolated links and in 802.11 WLANconfigurations. We focus on AP-client (s) configurations; proposing a novel approach todetect this misbehavior.

Urban navigation beyond shortest route: The case of safe paths,Esther Galbrun; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Advancements in mobile technology and computing have fostered the collection ofa large number of civic datasets that capture the pulse of urban life. Furthermore; the opengovernment and data initiative has led many local authorities to make these datasetspublicly available; hoping to drive innovation that will further improve the quality of life for thecity-dwellers. In this paper; we develop a novel application that utilizes crime data to providesafe urban navigation. Specifically; using crime data from Chicago and Philadelphia wedevelop a risk model for their street urban network; which allows us to estimate the relativeprobability of a crime on any road segment. Given such model we define two variants of theSafePaths problem where the goal is to find a short and low-risk path between a source anda destination location.

Automatic evaluation of information provider reliability and expertise,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Velin Kounev; Vladimir Oleshchuk; Mohd Anwar; Yiling Lin,Abstract Q&A social media have gained a lot of attention during the recent years. People relyon these sites to obtain information due to a number of advantages they offer as comparedto conventional sources of knowledge (eg; asynchronous and convenient access). However;for the same question one may find highly contradicting answers; causing an ambiguity withrespect to the correct information. This can be attributed to the presence of unreliable and/ornon-expert users. These two attributes (reliability and expertise) significantly affect thequality of the answer/information provided. We present a novel approach for estimatingthese user's characteristics relying on human cognitive traits. In brief; we propose each userto monitor the activity of his peers (on the basis of responses to questions asked by him) andobserve their compliance with predefined cognitive models.

Towards reliable spatial information in lbsns,Ke Zhang; Wei Jeng; Francis Fofie; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Prashant Krishnamurthy,Abstract The proliferation of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) has been rapid duringthe last year due to the number of novel services they can support. The main interactionbetween users in an LBSN is location sharing; which builds the spatial component of thesystem. The majority of the LBSNs make use of the notion of check-in; to enable users tovolunteeringly share their whereabouts with their peers and the system. The flow of thisspatial information is unidirectional and originates from the users' side. Given that currentlythere is no infrastructure in place for detecting fake checkins; the quality of the spatialinformation plane of an LBSN is solely based on the honesty of the users. In this paper; weseek to raise the awareness of the community for this problem; by identifying and discussingthe effects of the presence of fake location information.

Quantifying the overhead due to routing probes in multi-rate WMNs,Ioannis Broustis; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Dimitris Syrivelis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Leandros Tassiulas,The selection of high-throughput routes is a key element towards improving the performanceof wireless multihop networks. While several routing metrics have been proposed in theliterature; it has been shown that link-quality aware metrics can provide significantly higherend-to-end throughput. To date; the online computation of such metrics requires the periodictransmission of probe packets at all available transmission rates. However; our link levelmeasurement study on two different 802.11 testbeds demonstrates that:(a) multi-rate probetransmissions increase the number of collisions and enforce nodes to reside in the back-offstate for prolonged time periods; and (b) the extent of performance degradation depends onthe network density; a network-wide throughput reduction of the order of 400% is possible.

The sub-carriers though; experiencedifferent degrees of fading and thus; the received power is different for different sub-carriers;while some frequencies experience deep fades; others are relatively unaffected. In thispaper; we make a case of redistributing the power across the sub-carriers (subject to a fixedpower budget constraint) to better cope with this frequency selectivity. Specifically; wedesign a joint power and rate adaptation scheme (called JPRA for short) wherein powerredistribution is combined with sub-carrier level rate adaptation to yield significantthroughput benefits. We further consider two variants of JPRA:(a) JPRA-CR where; thepower is redistributed across sub-carriers so as to support a maximum common rate (CR) …,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM international symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing,2012,8
Location based social network analysis using tensors and signal processing tools,Evangelos E Papalexakis; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Christos Faloutsos,With the rise of online social networks and smartphones that record the user's location; anew type of online social network has gained popularity during the last few years; the socalled Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs). In such networks; users voluntarily sharetheir location with their friends via a “check-in”. In exchange they get recommendationstailored to their particular location as well as special deals that businesses offer when userscheck-in frequently. LBSNs started as specialized platforms such as Gowalla andFoursquare; however their immense popularity has led online social networking giants likeFacebook to adopt this functionality. The spatial aspect of LBSNs directly ties the physicalwith the online world; creating a very rich ecosystem where users interact with their friendsboth online as well as declare their physical (co-) presence in various locations. Such a …,Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP); 2015 IEEE 6th International Workshop on,2015,7
Analyzing and Modeling Special Offer Campaigns in Location-Based Social Networks.,Ke Zhang; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Theodoros Lappas,Abstract The proliferation of mobile handheld devices in combination with the technologicaladvancements in mobile computing has led to a number of innovative services that makeuse of the location information available on such devices. Traditional yellow pages websiteshave now moved to mobile platforms; giving the opportunity to local businesses andpotential; near-by; customers to connect. These platforms can offer an affordableadvertisement channel to local businesses. One of the mechanisms offered by location-based social networks (LBSNs) allows businesses to provide special offers to theircustomers that connect through the platform. We collect a large time-series dataset fromapproximately 14 million venues on Foursquare and analyze the performance of suchcampaigns using randomization techniques and (nonparametric) hypothesis testing with …,ICWSM,2015,7
Joint reactive jammer detection and localization in an enterprise WiFi network,Yifeng Cai; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Xin Wang; Prashant Krishnamurthy; Yijun Mo,Abstract The deployment of wireless networks for Internet connectivity has been rapid duringthe last decade. Following this trend; enterprises utilize multiple access points (APs) in orderto provide wireless connectivity to authorized users within its premises. However; wirelessnetworks are extremely vulnerable to PHY/MAC layer attacks such as jamming. A jammertransmits electromagnetic energy on the medium in order to either block the access to anylegitimate transmitter or cause collisions at the receiver (or both). One of the most advancedjamming models is that of reactive jamming. A reactive jammer does not constantly transmitenergy on the air; but only jams when a legitimate (target) packet is on the medium; aimingat its collision at the receiver. Previous studies have shown that reactive jamming is one ofthe most difficult attack models to detect. In this work; we propose a scheme that performs …,Computer Networks,2013,7
A software framework for alleviating the effects of MAC-aware jamming attacks in wireless access networks,Ioannis Broustis; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Dimitris Syrivelis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Leandros Tassiulas,Abstract The IEEE 802.11 protocol inherently provides the same long-term throughput to allthe clients associated with a given access point (AP). In this paper; we first identify a clever;low-power jamming attack that can take advantage of this behavioral trait: the placement of alow-power jammer in a way that it affects a single legitimate client can cause starvation to allthe other clients. In other words; the total throughput provided by the corresponding AP isdrastically degraded. To fight against this attack; we design FIJI; a cross-layer anti-jammingsystem that detects such intelligent jammers and mitigates their impact on networkperformance. FIJI looks for anomalies in the AP load distribution to efficiently performjammer detection. It then makes decisions with regards to optimally shaping the traffic suchthat:(a) the clients that are not explicitly jammed are shielded from experiencing starvation …,Wireless Networks,2011,7
Socio-spatial affiliation networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Prashant Krishnamurthy,Abstract Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have recently attracted a lot of attentiondue to the number of novel services they can offer. Prior work on analysis of LBSNs hasmainly focused on the social part of these systems. Even though it is important to know howdifferent the structure of the social graph of an LBSN is as compared to the friendship-basedsocial networks (SNs); it raises the interesting question of what kinds of linkages existbetween locations and friendships. The main problem we are investigating is to identify suchconnections between the social and the spatial planes of an LBSN. In particular; in thispaper we focus on answering the following general question “What are the bonds betweenthe social and spatial information in an LBSN and what are the metrics that can revealthem?” In order to tackle this problem; we employ the idea of affiliation networks …,Computer Communications,2016,6
Location-Based Social Network Users Through a Lense: Examining Temporal User Patterns.,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Prashant Krishnamurthy,Abstract There has been a rapid proliferation of location-based social networks (LBSNs)during the last years. The spatial component of these systems provides a rich source ofinformation that can be exploited by a number of novel services. However; to better designsuch services; it is important to understand the way people make use of these platforms andhow this usage changes over time. While there exist studies that examine the motivations ofpeople for adopting the usage of LBSNs and the temporal dynamics of these motivations;they are based on interviews and are mostly qualitative. Motivations can further onlyindirectly reveal or help us infer user behavior. In this paper; we analyze data from twocommercial LBSNs to examine the temporal evolution of usage patterns to see what the dataon their own reveal. We find that users of two social networks that we examined increase …,AAAI Fall Symposium: Social Networks and Social Contagion,2012,6
Personalized multi-period tour recommendations,S Kotiloglu; T Lappas; K Pelechrinis; PP Repoussis,Abstract During a trip planning; tourists gather information from different sources; select andrank the places to visit according to their personal interests; and try to devise daily toursamong them. This paper addresses the complex selection and touring problem andproposes a “filter-first; tour-second” framework for generating personalized tourrecommendations for tourists based on information from social media and other online datasources. Collaborative filtering is applied to identify a subset of optional points of interest thatmaximize the potential satisfaction; while there are some preselected mandatory points thatthe tourists must visit. Next; the underlying orienteering problem is solved via an IteratedTabu Search algorithm. The goal is to generate tours that contain all mandatory points andmaximize the total score collected from the optional points visited daily; taking into …,Tourism Management,2017,5
Jammer localization in wireless networks: An experimentation-driven approach,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Iordanis Koutsopoulos; Ioannis Broustis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy,Abstract Jamming attacks have become prevalent during the last few years facilitated by theopen access to the shared wireless medium as well as the increased motivation andeasiness to create damage as a result of sophistication of wireless devices; both legitimateand jamming ones. Among the challenges that a wireless network faces while trying toconfront the jammer; jammer localization is of utmost importance. This entails estimating thephysical location of the jammer. Successful jammer localization can trigger a series ofcorrective measures to ensure sustainable network operation. However; locating the jammeris a difficult problem. Our primary goal in this paper is to design a simple; lightweight andgeneric approach for localizing a jamming device through a set of measurable parameters.The key observation guiding our design; is that the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) that can …,Computer Communications,2016,5
Power-Hop: a pervasive observation for real complex networks,Evangelos Papalexakis; Bryan Hooi; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Christos Faloutsos,Complex networks have been shown to exhibit universal properties; with one of the mostconsistent patterns being the scale-free degree distribution; but are there regularitiesobeyed by the r-hop neighborhood in real networks? We answer this question by identifyinganother power-law pattern that describes the relationship between the fractions of nodepairs C (r) within r hops and the hop count r. This scale-free distribution is pervasive anddescribes a large variety of networks; ranging from social and urban to technological andbiological networks. In particular; inspired by the definition of the fractal correlationdimension D 2 on a point-set; we consider the hop-count r to be the underlying distancemetric between two vertices of the network; and we examine the scaling of C (r) with r. Wefind that this relationship follows a power-law in real networks within the range 2≤ r≤ d …,PloS one,2016,5
EigenTransitions with Hypothesis Testing: The Anatomy of Urban Mobility.,Ke Zhang; Yu-Ru Lin; Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract Identifying the patterns in urban mobility is important for a variety of tasks such astransportation planning; urban resource allocation; emergency planning etc. This is evidentfrom the large body of research on the topic; which has exploded with the vast amount ofgeo-tagged user-generated content from online social media. However; most of the existingwork focuses on a specific setting; taking a statistical approach to describe and model theobserved patterns. On the contrary in this work we introduce EigenTransitions; a spectrum-based; generic framework for analyzing spatiotemporal mobility datasets. EigenTransitionscapture the anatomy of the aggregate and/or individuals' mobility as a compact set of latentmobility patterns. Using a large corpus of geo-tagged content collected from Twitter; weutilize EigenTransitions to analyze the structure of urban mobility. In particular; we identify …,ICWSM,2016,5
On the value of shared bike systems in urban environments: Evidence from the real estate market,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Marios Kokkodis; Theodoros Lappas,ABSTRACT During the last years the number of cities that have installed and operate sharedbiking systems has significantly increased. These systems provide an alternative andsustainable mean of transportation to the city-dwellers. Apart from the energy sustainabilitybenefits; shared bike systems can have a positive effect on residents' health; air quality andthe overall condition of the currently crumbling road network/infrastructure. Anecdotal storiesand survey studies have also identified that bike lanes have a positive impact on localbusinesses. In this study; driven by the prevalence of shared bike systems and their possiblepositive effects on a number of urban life facets we opt to study and quantify the value ofthese systems. We use evidence from the real estate market of the city of Pittsburgh;collected from Zillow; and analyze the effect of the shared bike system installed in the city …,Available at SSRN,2015,5
Matching patterns in networks with multi-dimensional attributes: a machine learning approach,Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract Assortative matching is a network phenomenon that arises when nodes exhibit abias towards connections to others of similar characteristics. While mixing patterns innetworks have been studied in the literature; and there are well-defined metrics that capturethe degree of assortativity (eg; assortativity coefficient); the latter deal only with single-dimensional enumerative or scalar features. Nevertheless; various complex behaviors ofnetwork entities—eg; human behaviors in social networks—are captured through vectorattributes. To date; no formal metric able to cope with similar situations has been defined. Inthis paper; we propose a novel; two-step process that extends the applicability of theassortativity coefficient to multi-dimensional attributes. In brief; we first apply clustering of thevertices on their vector characteristic. After clustering is completed; each network node is …,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2014,5
Collaborative assessment of information provider's reliability and expertise using subjective logic,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Vladimir Oleshchuk,Q&A social media have gained a lot of attention during the recent years. People rely onthese sites to obtain information due to a number of advantages they offer as compared toconventional sources of knowledge (eg; asynchronous and convenient access). However;for the same question one may find highly contradicting answers; causing an ambiguity withrespect to the correct information. This can be attributed to the presence of unreliable and/ornon-expert users. These two attributes (reliability and expertise) significantly affect thequality of the answer/information provided. We present a novel approach for estimatingthese user's characteristics relying on human cognitive traits. In brief; we propose each userto monitor the activity of her peers (on the basis of responses to questions asked by her) andobserve their compliance with predefined cognitive models. These observations lead to …,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2011 7th International Conference on,2011,5
Forensic analysis of packet losses in wireless networks,Jianxia Ning; Shailendra Singh; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Bin Liu; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Ramesh Govindan,Due to the lossy nature of wireless links; it is difficult to determine if packet losses are due towireless-induced effects or from malicious discarding. Many prior efforts on detectingmalicious packet drops rely on evidence collected via passive monitoring by neighbornodes. However; they do not analyze the cause of packet losses. In this paper; we ask: 1)Given certain macroscopic parameters of the network (like traffic intensity and node density)what is the likelihood that evidence exists with respect to a transmission? 2) How can theseparameters be used to perform a forensic analysis of the reason for the losses? Towardanswering the above questions; we first build an analytical framework that computes thelikelihood that evidence (we call this transmission evidence; or TE for short) exists withrespect to transmissions; in terms of a set of network parameters. We validate our …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2016,4
Sportsnetrank: Network-based sports team ranking,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Evangelos Papalexakis; Christos Faloutsos,ABSTRACT Which team is the best in the league? How does my team fare with respect tothe rest of the league? These are questions that every sports fan is interested in knowing theanswers to. In other cases; such as in college sports; knowing the answer to these questionsis crucial for shaping the picture of specific contests. In professional sports; sports networksprovide power rankings regularly-typically every week or month depending on the seasonlength of the league-based on their experts opinion. In this work we propose an alternative;objective and network-based way of ranking sports teams. In brief; our method is based onanalyzing a directed network formed between the teams of the corresponding leagues thatcaptures their win-lose relationships. Using data from the National Football League and theNational Basketball Association; we show that even simple network theory metrics (eg …,ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Large Scale Sports Analytics,2016,4
Wifi location fingerprinting,Prashant Krishnamurthy,ABSTRACT Positioning in indoor areas poses several challenges that cannot be easilyovercome using GPS. Although the near-ubiquitous availability of WiFi in most indoor andcampus areas of interest makes it an inexpensive choice (in terms of hardware) forpositioning; WiFi was not designed with positioning as the appli-cation. Hence; traditionaltime or direction-of-arrival techniques are not suitable for positioning with WiFi. Alternatively;over the last decade; location ﬁngerprinting has been widely suggested and investigated forpositioning with WiFi indoors. This chapter provides an overview of WiFi locationﬁngerprinting; the challenges therein; and emerging research and practical directions in thearea.,Advanced Location-Based Technologies and Services,2013,4
Gaming the Game: Honeypot Venues Against Cheaters in Location-based Social Networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Prashant Krishnamurthy; Ke Zhang,Abstract: The proliferation of location-based social networks (LBSNs) has provided thecommunity with an abundant source of information that can be exploited and used in manydifferent ways. LBSNs offer a number of conveniences to its participants; such as-but notlimited to-a list of places in the vicinity of a user; recommendations for an area neverexplored before provided by other peers; tracking of friends; monetary rewards in the form ofspecial deals from the venues visited as well as a cheap way of advertisement for the latter.However; service convenience and security have followed disjoint paths in LBSNs andusers can misuse the offered features. The major threat for the service providers is that offake check-ins.

A Cognitive-based scheme for user reliability and expertise assessment in Q&A social networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Vladimir Zadorozhny; Vladimir Oleshchuk,Q&A social media has gained a great deal of attention during recent years. People rely onthese sites to obtain information due to the number of advantages they offer as compared toconventional sources of knowledge (eg; asynchronous and convenient access). However;for the same question one may find highly contradictory answers; causing ambiguity withrespect to the correct information. This can be attributed to the presence of unreliable and/ornon-expert users. In this work; we propose a novel approach for estimating the reliability andexpertise of a user based on human cognitive traits. Every user can individually estimatethese values based on local pairwise interactions. We examine the convergenceperformance of our algorithm and we find that it can accurately assess the reliability and theexpertise of a user and can successfully react to the latter's behavior change.,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,4
Automated IT system failure prediction: A deep learning approach,Ke Zhang; Jianwu Xu; Martin Renqiang Min; Guofei Jiang; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Hui Zhang,In mission critical IT services; system failure prediction becomes increasingly important; itprevents unexpected system downtime; and assures service reliability for end users. Whileoperational console logs record rich and descriptive information on the health status of thoseIT systems; existing system management technologies mostly use them in a labor-intensiveforensics approach; ie; identifying what went wrong after the fact. Recent efforts on log-based system management take an automation approach with text mining techniques; suchas term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). However; those techniques lead toa high-dimensional feature space; and are not easily generalizable to heterogeneous logformats. In this paper; we present a novel system that automatically parses streamedconsole logs and detects early warning signals for IT system failure prediction.

Pairfac: Event analytics through discriminant tensor factorization,Xidao Wen; Yu-Ru Lin; Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract The study of disaster events and their impact in the urban space has beentraditionally conducted through manual collections and analysis of surveys; questionnairesand authority documents. While there have been increasingly rich troves of humanbehavioral data related to the events of interest; the ability to obtain hindsight following adisaster event has not been scaled up. In this paper; we propose a novel approach foranalyzing events called PairFac. PairFac utilizes discriminant tensor analysis toautomatically discover the impact of a major event from rich human behavioral data. Ourmethod aims to (i) uncover the persistent patterns across multiple interrelated aspects ofurban behavior (eg; when; where and what citizens do in a city) and at the same time (ii)identify the salient changes following a potentially impactful event.

Do street fairs boost local businesses? a quasi-experimental analysis using social network data,Ke Zhang; Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract Local businesses and retail stores are a crucial part of local economy. Localgovernments design policies for facilitating the growth of these businesses that canconsequently have positive externalities on the local community. However; many timesthese policies have completely opposite from the expected results (eg; free curb parkinginstead of helping businesses has been illustrated to actually hurt them due to the smallturnover per spot). Hence; it is important to evaluate the outcome of such policies in order toprovide educated decisions for the future. In the era of social and ubiquitous computing;mobile social media; such as Foursquare; form a platform that can help towards this goal.Data from these platforms capture semantic information of human mobility from which wecan distill the potential economic activities taking place.

Mpg: Not so random exploration of a city,Xiaoyu Ge; Panos K Chrysanthis; Konstantinos Pelechrinis,The proliferation of mobile; ubiquitous and spatial computing has led to a number of servicesaiming into facilitate the exploration of a city. Platforms such as Foursquare and Yelp curateinformation about establishments in an area that can then be used for recommendationpurposes. Traditionally an approach followed by these systems is to rank places based ontheir popularity; proximity or any other feature that represents the quality of the venue andthen return the top-k of them. However; this approach; while simple and intuitive; is notnecessarily providing a diverse set of recommendations; since similar venues typically areranked closely.

Trustworthy operations in cellular networks: The case of PF scheduler,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Prashant Krishanmurthy; Christos Gkantsidis,Cellular data networks are proliferating to address the need for ubiquitous connectivity. Tocope with the increasing number of subscribers and with the spatiotemporal variations of thewireless signals; current cellular networks use opportunistic schedulers; such as theProportional Fairness scheduler (PF); to maximize network throughput while maintainingfairness among users. Such scheduling decisions are based on channel quality metrics andAutomatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) feedback reports provided by the User's Equipment (UE).Implicit in current networks is the a priori trust on every UE's feedback. Malicious UEs can;thus; exploit this trust to disrupt service by intelligently faking their reports.

Detecting route attraction attacks in wireless networks,Mustafa Y Arslan; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Ioannis Broustis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Prashant Krishnamurthy; Prasant Mohapatra,Selecting high performance routes in wireless networks requires the exchange of link qualityinformation among nodes. Adversaries can manipulate this functionality by advertising fakequalities for links; by doing so; they can attract routes and subsequently launch perniciousattacks. Our measurements suggest that malicious route attraction can fatally impactthroughput. We design a framework that is effective against both independent and colludingattackers. In the latter case; we consider both local and remote colluders. With localcollusion; malicious nodes exchange and advertise fake routing information to increase theprobability of being selected as relays. Remote collusion refers to nodes residing in distantparts of the network that (i) create sybil identities in a local neighborhood and/or (ii) utilizelink quality reports to advertise fake links.

VA-index: quantifying assortativity patterns in networks with multidimensional nodal attributes,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Dong Wei,Network connections have been shown to be correlated with structural or external attributesof the network vertices in a variety of cases. Given the prevalence of this phenomenonnetwork scientists have developed metrics to quantify its extent. In particular; the assortativitycoefficient is used to capture the level of correlation between a single-dimensional attribute(categorical or scalar) of the network nodes and the observed connections; ie; the edges.Nevertheless; in many cases a multi-dimensional; ie; vector feature of the nodes is ofinterest. Similar attributes can describe complex behavioral patterns (eg; mobility) of thenetwork entities. To date little attention has been given to this setting and there has not beena general and formal treatment of this problem. In this study we develop a metric; the vectorassortativity index (VA-index for short); based on network randomization and (empirical) …,PloS one,2016,2
Urban informatics and the web,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Daniele Quercia,Abstract Based on a recent report from the United Nations; more than 50% of the world'spopulation currently lives in cities. This percentage is projected to increase to 70% by theyear 2050 [1]. As massive amounts of people move to urban areas there is a need for citiesto be run more efficiently; while at the same time improving the quality of life of their dwellers.Nevertheless; the exact same force that sets the above requirement; ie; the proliferation ofurbanization levels; makes this task much harder and challenging; especially in megacities.Despite the aforementioned conflicting dynamics; many city management operations can befacilitated by appropriate exploitation of the unprecedented amount of data that can be madeavailable to authorities from a variety of sources.

Country-level spatial dynamics of user activity: a case study in location-based social networks,Anh Le; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Prashant Krishnamurthy,Abstract Identifying and understanding the emerging patterns in user activity is an importantstep in designing and developing features for online social networks. With the explosivegrowth of user-generated data in such networks; the recorded user activities are no moresparse snapshots but are close to a live reflection of real life. This allows us to extractpatterns which are tied to the time and space context of real life activity from such recordeddata. In this work; we analyze two rich datasets obtained from two major location-basedsocial networks (Foursquare and Gowalla) and show how users change their activitypatterns depending on the country they currently reside on. We also compare activitypatterns between foreign users from different countries and local users.

However; users can misuse the offered features and the major threat for theservice providers is that of fake check-ins. Users can easily manipulate the localizationmodule of the underlying application and declare their presence in a counterfeit location.The incentives for these behaviors can be both earning monetary rewards as well as virtualrewards. Therefore; while fake check-ins driven from the former motive can cause monetarylosses; those aiming in virtual rewards are also harmful.

iWinrNFL: A Simple and Well-Calibrated In-Game NFL Win Probability Model,Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract: During the last sports season a lot of discussion has been generated for theseveral; high-profile;" comebacks" that were observed in almost all sports. The Cavalierswon the championship after being down 3-1 in the NBA final's series; which was exactly thecase for Chicago Cubs and the World Series. The Patriots won the Super Bowl even thoughthey were trailing by 25 points late in the third quarter; while more recently FC Barcelona inthe top-16 round of Champions League scored 3 goals during the last 7 minutes of the game(including stoppage time) against PSG to advance in the tournament. This has brought therobustness and accuracy of the various probabilistic prediction models under high scrutiny.In this paper; we discuss some of the issues that have been brought up in the wake of lastyear's events and we also develop our own in-game win probability model for NFL …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00197,2017,1

The anatomy of American football: evidence from 7 years of NFL game data,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Evangelos Papalexakis,How much does a fumble affect the probability of winning an American football game? Howbalanced should your offense be in order to increase the probability of winning by 10%?These are questions for which the coaching staff of National Football League teams have aclear qualitative answer. Turnovers are costly; turn the ball over several times and you willcertainly lose. Nevertheless; what does “several” mean? How “certain” is certainly? In thisstudy; we collected play-by-play data from the past 7 NFL seasons; ie; 2009–2015; and webuild a descriptive model for the probability of winning a game. Despite the fact that ourmodel incorporates simple box score statistics; such as total offensive yards; number ofturnovers etc.; its overall cross-validation accuracy is 84%. Furthermore; we combine thisdescriptive model with a statistical bootstrap module to build FPM (short for Football …,PLoS one,2016,1
Mining emerging user-centered network structures in location-based social networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Theodoros Lappas,The digitization of social networks has enabled the passive collection of large scale data;which in turn have fostered social studies that have been traditionally dependent on smallscale; interview-based data. During the last years; a new class of digital social networks hasemerged; namely; location-based social networks (LBSNs). The main interaction betweenusers of an LBSN is location sharing; ie; declaring their presence to specific places. Thelatter ties the virtual; online world with the real space that users interact in. Thus; except fromthe social graph; a number of implicit network structures emerge. As an example; two peoplecan be considered to be connected if they have been to at least k common places. Similarstructures play crucial role in fields such as epidemiology and urban planning; while theycan have implications in communication networks as well (eg; mobile peer-to-peer …,Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS); 2014 IEEE Conference on,2014,1

Detecting Fake Check-Ins in Location-based Social Networks Through Honeypot Venues,Ke Zhang; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Prashant Krishnamurthy,The proliferation of location-based social networks (LBSNs) has offered many conveniencesto its participants; such as place recommendation; tracking of friends; monetary rewards fromvenues visited and a cheap way of advertisement for local businesses. However; users canmisuse the offered features and the major threat for the service providers is that of fakecheck-ins. Users can easily manipulate the localization module of the underlying applicationand declare their presence in a counterfeit location. The incentives for these behaviors canbe both earning monetary rewards as well as virtual rewards. The latter is part of the“gamification” employed by LBSNs; which essentially transforms the LBSN into a mobilegame for attracting new users and keeping the existing ones active.

Athlytics: Winning in Sports with Data,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Evangelos Papalexakis,Abstract Data and analytics have been part of the sports industry from as early as the 1870s;when the first boxscore in baseball was recorded. However; it is only recently that advanceddata mining and machine learning techniques have been utilized for facilitating theoperations of sports franchises. While part of the reason is related with the ability to collectmore fine-grained data; an equally important factor for this turn to analytics is the hugesuccess and competitive advantage that early adopters of investment in analytics enjoyed(popularized by the best-seller-Moneyball? that described the success that OaklandAthletics had with analytics).

Effects of Promotions on Location-Based Social Media: Evidence from Foursquare,Ke Zhang; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Theodoros Lappas,Abstract Location has been identified as a critical factor for the success of a business. Forexample; businesses in dense urban areas are exposed to more customers than businessesin sparsely populated neighborhoods; while proximity to a popular landmark can increase abusiness's reach. This creates significant challenges for new businesses to expand theirreach and customer base. However; the advancement of mobile; social; and spatialcomputing has led to the transformation of traditional web-based yellow pages to a mobileformat (eg; location-based social networks; LBSNs). This has allowed businesses that arenot in prime locations to become visible to nearby customers.

tHoops: A Multi-Aspect Analytical Framework Spatio-Temporal Basketball Data Using Tensor Decomposition,Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Evangelos Papalexakis,Abstract: The shot selection process in basketball can be thought of as an indicator of theidentity of a player/team. Characterization of these processes is important for player andteam comparisons; pre-game scouting etc. Typically; shot charts are compared in a heuristicmanner. Recently though automated ways have appeared in the sports analytics literaturethat aim into identifying a set of prototype shooting patterns that can be used as a basis fordescribing the tendencies of a player/team. However; these approaches are almostexclusively focused on the spatial distribution of the shots. However; there is a multitude ofother parameters that can affect the shot selection by a player. For example; the timeremaining on the clock; the score differential; etc. are some contextual factors that canimpact the shot selection of a player.

Many securityinitiatives and commercial entities are harnessing the readily public information; but theyseem to focus on structured sources of information. Our goal here is to extract informationfrom hacker forums; whose information is provided in ad hoc and unstructured ways. Here;we focus on the problem of identifying malicious IPs addresses; when these are beingreported in the forums. We develop a method to automate the identification of malicious IPswith the design goal of being independent of external sources. A key novelty is that we use amatrix decomposition method to extract latent features of the behavioral information of theusers; which we combine with textual information from the related posts. As key designfeature; our technique can be applied to different language forums since it relies on a …,Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2017,2017,*
LinNet: Probabilistic Lineup Evaluation Through Network Embedding,Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract: Which of your team's possible lineups has the best chances against each of youropponents possible lineups? In order to answer this question we develop LinNet. LinNetexploits the dynamics of a directed network that captures the performance of lineups at theirmatchups. The nodes of this network represent the different lineups; while an edge fromnode j to node i exists if lineup i has outperformed lineup j. We further annotate each edgewith the corresponding performance margin (point margin per minute). We then utilize thisstructure to learn a set of latent features for each node (ie; lineup) using the node2vecframework. Consequently; LinNet builds a model on this latent space for the probability oflineup A beating lineup B. We evaluate LinNet using NBA lineup data from the five seasonsbetween 2007-08 and 2011-12.

Uncovering Correlations between Urban Road Network Centrality and Human Mobility,Ke Zhang; Li Geng; Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract Urban planners have been long interested in understanding how urban structureand activities are mutually influenced. What are the forces that lead to the current patterns ofroad network and what is the influence of the latter's structure on urban activities? Networkcentrality measures have been traditionally utilized to uncover the structural properties ofurban street networks.

The Anatomy of the Three-Point Shot: Spatial Bias; Fractals and the Three-Point Line in the NBA,Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract: Even though it might have taken some time; the three-point line ultimately changedthe way the game is played as evidenced by the increase in the three-point shot attemptsover the years. However; during the last few years we have experienced record-breakingseasons in terms of both three-point attempts and field goals made. This brings back to thesurface questions such as" What is the rationale behind the three-point line?";" Is the three-point shot distance appropriate?" and many more similar questions. In this work; eventhough we do not take a stand against the three-point line; we provide evidence thatchallenge its distance. In particular; we analyze shot charts and we identify a statisticallysignificant discontinuity in the shot attempts between 1-feet zones just inside and outside thethree-point line. In addition we introduce a metric inspired by fractal theory to quantify this …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.03229,2016,*

Innovative Routes for Enhancing Adolescent Marijuana Treatment: Interplay of Peer Influence Across Social Media and Geolocation,Tammy Chung; Kostantinos Pelechrinis; Michalis Faloutsos; Lindsay Hylek; Brian Suffoletto; Sarah W Feldstein Ewing,Abstract Peer behaviors are highly influential in youth decision-making around whether touse marijuana. Social media; as a popular form of peer interaction; has extended peerinfluence on marijuana use from “in-person” to “on-line” relationships. This is highlyconcerning; as youth may report their marijuana use on social media as it occurs. Theimmediacy and possible virality of this type of on-line interaction not only is a source of risk;but also may have utility for monitoring and predicting an episode of marijuana use justbefore it occurs. This article discusses how in-person and on-line peer interactionscontribute to youth marijuana use in order to identify triggering social contexts (eg; in-personco-location of peers; on-line peer influence) associated with marijuana use.

VA-Index: Quantifying Assortativity Patterns in Networks with Multidimensional Nodal Attributes (Open Access),Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Dong Wei,Abstract: Network connections have been shown to be correlated with structural or externalattributes of the network vertices in a variety of cases. Given the prevalence of thisphenomenon network scientists have developed metrics to quantify its extent. In particular;the assortativity coefficient is used to capture the level of correlation between a single-dimensional attribute (categorical or scalar) of the network nodes and the observedconnections; ie; the edges. Nevertheless; in many cases a multi-dimensional; ie; vectorfeature of the nodes is of interest. Similar attributes can describe complex behavioralpatterns (eg; mobility) of the network entities. To date little attention has been given to thissetting and there has not been a general and formal treatment of this problem.

The Invisible Barrier: The Effect of Promoting Agencies on Sales in Electronic Markets,Marios Kokkodis; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Theodoros Lappas,Electronic marketplaces have been booming in the past decade.

The digital trails thatLBSN users leave on these systems; mainly through the action of check-in (ie; voluntarysharing of their whereabouts); span multiple dimensions such as; social (who is friend withwhom?); geographical (where do people go?); temporal (when do people transit in the city);as well as contextual (what do people do in the city?) forming a composite network. It thusbecomes crucial to be able to analyze the above information in a holistic way; that is; withoutfocusing on a specific dimension only. For that; we develop GeoTense; which models a geo-social composite network as a tensor.

On the trade-offs between collecting packet level forensic evidence and data delivery performance in wireless networks,Jianxia Ning; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Srikanth V Krishnamurthy; Ramesh Govindan,Transmission Evidence (TE for short) refers to a historic trail of the packet transmissions inthe network. TE is collected and maintained in a distributed manner by the nodes in thenetwork and can be queried on demand by a network forensics system to trace past events.The latter can facilitate crucial applications such as identifying malicious or malfunctioningnodes. Recently; we developed an analytical framework towards computing the likelihood ofTE availability in wireless networks. Our prior efforts [1] brought to light the impact of thenetwork's operational parameters (such as transmission rate and packet length) on theavailability of TE. However; provisioning for TE could impact the network performance interms of throughput and/or delay.

In thispaper; we employ the capabilities of PCA combined with statistical fits to trace data todevelop tractable models that can be used to simulate the quality of links in wireless meshnetworks using the expected transmission time (ETT) metric. We apply principal componentanalysis to ETT traces from a wireless mesh network to determine what features in the ETTtraces are important and to extract any meaningful relationships therein. We demonstratethat PCA can be used to efficiently approximate large volumes of ETT values. In particular;the ETT trace for each link can be expressed as a combination of two basis vectors--onefairly stable and the other containing the variations in time. We also show how the extractedfeatures can be employed to simulate ETT for a given network topology with and without …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM Symposium on Performance evaluation of wireless ad hoc; sensor; and ubiquitous networks,2011,*
Security and performance considerations in wireless networks,Konstantinos Pelechrinis,Abstract The open and shared nature of the wireless medium makes it easy for adversariesto launch simple; yet effective; denial of service attacks (DoS attacks). As an example;jamming attacks; involve the uncoordinated transmission of electromagnetic energy on themedium. In a carrier sensing network (eg; 802.11); this attack strategy increases the numberof collisions at the receiver side and/or blocks the medium access to legitimate nodes at thetransmitting side. Both of the above effects degrade the wireless network performancesignificantly. Frequency hopping (FH) has been traditionally used to overcome jammingattacks. However; we analytically and experimentally show that FH is inadequate toefficiently cope with jamming in today's networks.,*,2010,*

In the era of big data one wouldexpect coaching decisions to always be rational with respect to the maximization of theexpected points scored. In order to examine this hypothesis we use data from the NationalFootball League for the past 7 seasons to analyze two specific discrete decisions/choicesthat coaches face several times during a game. In particular; we analyze (i) the Point (s) AfterTouchdown (PAT) and (ii) the fourth down decisions. We use mean-field approximations andfind that despite the statistical evidence available to them through years worth of data;coaches tend to make the status quo decisions; which in the majority of the cases does notlead to point maximization. One of the possible explanations that we put forward for thisbehavior is the fact that their coaching objective might be to minimize the variance of the …,*,*,*
