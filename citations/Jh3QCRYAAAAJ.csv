Efficiently querying large XML data repositories: A survey,Gang Gou; Rada Chirkova,Extensible markup language (XML) is emerging as a de facto standard for informationexchange among various applications on the World Wide Web. There has been a growingneed for developing high-performance techniques to query large XML data repositoriesefficiently. One important problem in XML query processing is twig pattern matching; that is;finding in an XML data tree D all matches that satisfy a specified twig (or path) query patternQ. In this survey; we review; classify; and compare major techniques for twig patternmatching. Specifically; we consider two classes of major XML query processing techniques:the relational approach and the native approach. The relational approach directly utilizesexisting relational database systems to store and query XML data; which enables the use ofall important techniques that have been developed for relational databases; whereas in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,216
A formal perspective on the view selection problem,Rada Chirkova; Alon Y Halevy; Dan Suciu,Abstract The view selection problem is to choose a set of views to materialize over adatabase schema; such that the cost of evaluating a set of workload queries is minimizedand such that the views fit into a prespecified storage constraint. The two main applicationsof the view selection problem are materializing views in a database to speed up queryprocessing; and selecting views to materialize in a data warehouse to answer decisionsupport queries. We describe several fundamental results concerning the view selectionproblem. We consider the problem for views and workloads that consist of equalityselection;project and join queries; and show that the complexity of the problem depends crucially onthe quality of the estimates that a query optimizer has on the size of the views it isconsidering to materialize. When a query optimizer has good estimates of the sizes of the …,VLDB,2001,98

Enabling personalized composition and adaptive provisioning of web services,Quan Z Sheng; Boualem Benatallah; Zakaria Maamar; Marlon Dumas; Anne HH Ngu,Abstract The proliferation of interconnected computing devices is fostering the emergence ofenvironments where Web services made available to mobile users are a commodity.Unfortunately; inherent limitations of mobile devices still hinder the seamless access to Webservices; and their use in supporting complex user activities. In this paper; we describe thedesign and implementation of a distributed; adaptive; and context-aware framework forpersonalized service composition and provisioning adapted to mobile users. Users specifytheir preferences by annotating existing process templates; leading to personalized service-based processes. To cater for the possibility of low bandwidth communication channels andfrequent disconnections; an execution model is proposed whereby the responsibility oforchestrating personalized processes is spread across the participating services and user …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2004,90
Efficient algorithms for evaluating XPath over streams,Gang Gou; Rada Chirkova,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of evaluating XPath queries over streamingXML data. We consider a practical XPath fragment called Univariate XPath; which includesthe commonly used'/'and'//'axes and allows*-node tests and arbitrarily nested predicates. It iswell known that this XPath fragment can be efficiently evaluated in O (| D|| Q|) time in the non-streaming environment; where| D| is the document size and| Q| is the query size. However;this is not necessarily true in the streaming environment; since streaming algorithms have tosatisfy stricter requirement than non-streaming algorithms; in that all data must be readsequentially in one pass. Therefore; it is not surprising that state-of-the-art stream-queryingalgorithms have higher time complexity than O (| D|| Q|). In this paper we revisit the XPathstream-querying problem; and show that Univariate XPath can be efficiently evaluated in …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,86
Materialized views,Rada Chirkova; Jun Yang,Abstract Materialized views are queries whose results are stored and maintained in order tofacilitate access to data in their underlying base tables. In the SQL setting; they are nowconsidered a mature technology implemented by most commercial database systems andtightly integrated into query optimization. They have also helped lay the foundation forimportant topics such as information integration and data warehousing. This monographprovides an introduction and reference to materialized views. We cover three fundamentalproblems:(1) maintaining materialized views efficiently when the base tables change;(2)using materialized views effectively to improve performance and availability; and (3)selecting which views to materialize. We also point out their connections to a few other areasin database research; illustrate the benefit of cross-pollination of ideas with these areas …,Foundations and Trends® in Databases,2012,56
Selecting and using views to compute aggregate queries,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova,Abstract We consider a workload of aggregate queries and investigate the problem ofselecting views that (1) provide equivalent rewritings for all queries; and (2) are optimal; inthat the cost of evaluating the query workload is minimized. We consider conjunctive viewsand rewritings; with or without aggregation; in each rewriting; only one view contributes tocomputing the aggregated query output. We look at query rewriting using existing views andat view selection. In the query-rewriting problem; we give su. cient and necessary conditionsfor a rewriting to exist. For view selection; we prove complexity results. Finally; we givealgorithms for obtaining rewritings and selecting views.,International Conference on Database Theory,2005,48
Dynamic request allocation and scheduling for context aware applications subject to a percentile response time SLA in a distributed cloud,Keerthana Boloor; Rada Chirkova; Yannis Viniotis; Tiia Salo,We consider geographically distributed data centers forming a collectively managed cloudcomputing system; hosting multiple Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based contextaware applications; each subject to Service Level Agreements (SLA). The Service LevelAgreements for each context aware application require the response time of a certainpercentile of the input requests to be less than a specified value for a profit to be charged bythe cloud provider. We present a novel approach of data-oriented dynamic service-requestallocation with gi-FIFO scheduling; in each of the geographically distributed data centers; toglobally increase the profit charged by the cloud computing system. Our evaluation showsthat our dynamic scheme far outperforms the commonly deployed static allocation with eitherFirst in First Out (FIFO) or Weighted Round Robin (WRR) scheduling.,Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom); 2010 IEEE Second International Conference on,2010,47
Exact and inexact methods for selecting views and indexes for OLAP performance improvement,Zohreh Asgharzadeh Talebi; Rada Chirkova; Yahya Fathi; Matthias Stallmann,Abstract In on-line analytical processing (OLAP); precomputing (materializing as views) andindexing auxiliary data aggregations is a common way of reducing query-evaluation timecosts for important data-analysis queries. We consider an OLAP view-and index-selectionproblem stated as an optimization problem; where (i) the inputs include the data-warehouseschema; a set of data-analysis queries of interest; and a storage-limit constraint; and (ii) theoutput is a set of views and indexes that minimizes the costs of the input queries; subject tothe storage limit. While greedy and other heuristic strategies for choosing views or indexesmight help to some extent in improving the costs; it is highly nontrivial to arrive at a globallyoptimum solution; one that reduces the processing costs of typical OLAP queries as much asis theoretically possible. In fact; as observed in [17] and to the best of our knowledge …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,47
Materializing views with minimal size to answer queries,Rada Chirkova; Chen Li,Abstract In this paper we study the following problem. Given a database and a set of queries;we want to find; in advance; a set of views that can compute the answers to the queries; suchthat the size of the viewset (ie; the amount of space; in bytes; required to store the viewset) isminimal on the given database. This problem is important for many applications such asdistributed databases; data warehousing; and data integration. We explore the decidabilityand complexity of the problem for workloads of conjunctive queries. We show that resultsdiffer significantly depending on whether the workload queries have self-joins. If queries canhave self-joins; then a disjunctive viewset can be a better solution than any set ofconjunctive views. We show that the problem of finding a minimal-size disjunctive viewset isdecidable; and give an upper bound on its complexity.

Efficient algorithms for exact ranked twig-pattern matching over graphs,Gang Gou; Rada Chirkova,Abstract Querying large-scale graph-structured data with twig patterns is attracting growinginterest. Generally; a twig pattern could have an extremely large; potentially exponential;number of matches in a graph. Retrieving and returning to the user this many answers mayboth incur high computational overhead and overwhelm the user. In this paper we proposetwo efficient algorithms; DP-B and DP-P; for retrieving top-ranked twig-pattern matches fromlarge graphs. Our first algorithm; DP-B; is able to retrieve exact top-ranked answer matchesfrom potentially exponentially many matches in time and space linear in the size of our datainputs even in the worst case. Further; beyond the linear-cost result of DP-B; our secondalgorithm; DP-P; could take far less than linear time and space cost in practice. To the best ofour knowledge; our algorithms are the first to have these performance properties. Our …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,30
Answering queries using materialized views with minimum size,Rada Chirkova; Chen Li; Jia Li,Abstract In this paper; we study the following problem. Given a database and a set ofqueries; we want to find a set of views that can compute the answers to the queries; suchthat the amount of space; in bytes; required to store the viewset is minimum on the givendatabase.(We also handle problem instances where the input has a set of databaseinstances; as described by an oracle that returns the sizes of view relations for given viewdefinitions.) This problem is important for applications such as distributed databases; datawarehousing; and data integration. We explore the decidability and complexity of theproblem for workloads of conjunctive queries. We show that results differ significantlydepending on whether the workload queries have self-joins. Further; for queries without self-joins we describe a very compact search space of views; which contains all views in at …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2006,30
Query evaluation using overlapping views: completeness and efficiency,Gang Gou; Maxim Kormilitsin; Rada Chirkova,Abstract We study the problem of finding efficient equivalent view-based rewritings ofrelational queries; focusing on query optimization using materialized views under theassumption that base relations cannot contain duplicate tuples. A lot of work in the literatureaddresses the problems of answering queries using views and query optimization. However;most of it proposes solutions for special cases; such as for conjunctive queries (CQs) or foraggregate queries only. In addition; most of it addresses the problems separately under setor bag-set semantics for query evaluation; and some of it proposes heuristics without formalproofs for completeness or soundness. In this paper we look at the two problems byconsidering CQ/A queries-that is; both pure conjunctive and aggregate queries; withaggregation functions SUM; COUNT; MIN; and MAX; the DISTINCT keyword in (SQL …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,30
On rewriting XPath queries using views,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Benny Kimelfeld; Vassia Pavlaki; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract The problem of rewriting a query using a materialized view is studied for a wellknown fragment of XPath that includes the following three constructs: wildcards; descendantedges and branches. In earlier work; determining the existence of a rewriting was shown tobe coNP-hard; but no tight complexity bound was given. While it was argued that Σ 3 p is anupper bound; the proof was based on results that have recently been refuted. Consequently;the exact complexity (and even decidability) of this basic problem has been unknown; andthere have been no practical rewriting algorithms if the query and the view use all the threeconstructs mentioned above. It is shown that under fairly general conditions; there are onlytwo candidates for rewriting and hence; the problem can be practically solved by twocontainment tests. In particular; under these conditions; determining the existence of a …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,28
A formal model for the problem of view selection for aggregate queries,Jingni Li; Zohreh Asgharzadeh Talebi; Rada Chirkova; Yahya Fathi,Abstract We present a formal analysis of the following view-selection problem: Given a set ofqueries and a database; return definitions of views that; when materialized in the database;would reduce the evaluation costs of the queries. Optimizing the layout of stored data usingview selection has a direct impact on the performance of the entire database system. At thesame time; the optimization problem is intractable; even under natural restrictions on thetypes of queries of interest. In this paper we use an integer-programming model to obtainoptimal solutions to the problem of view selection for aggregate queries on datawarehouses. We also report the results of the post-optimality analysis that we performed todetermine/observe the impact of changing certain input characteristics on the optimalsolution.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2005,28
Linearly bounded reformulations of conjunctive databases,Rada Chirkova; Michael R Genesereth,Abstract Database reformulation is the process of rewriting the data and rules of a deductivedatabase in a functionally equivalent manner. We focus on the problem of automaticallyreformulating a database in a way that reduces query processing time while satisfying strongstorage space constraints. In previous work we have investigated database reformulation forthe case of unary databases. In this paper we extend this work to arbitrary arity; whileconcentrating on databases with conjunctive rules. The main result of the paper is that thedatabase reformulation problem is decidable for conjunctive databases.,*,2000,27
Heuristic-based request scheduling subject to a percentile response time sla in a distributed cloud,Keerthana Boloor; Rada Chirkova; Timo Salo; Yannis Viniotis,We consider geographically distributed data centers forming a collectively managed cloudcomputing system hosting multiple applications; each subject to Service Level Agreements(SLA). The Service Level Agreements for each application require the response time of acertain percentile of the input requests to be less than a specified value; with the non-conforming requests being charged a penalty. We present a novel approach of heuristic-based request scheduling at each server; in each of the geographically distributed datacenters; to globally minimize the penalty charged to the cloud computing system. Weevaluate two variants of our heuristic-based approach; one based on the simulatedannealing method of neighborhood searches and another based on gi-FIFO scheduling;which has been analytically proven to be the best schedule for percentile goals in a …,Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010); 2010 IEEE,2010,26
The view-selection problem has an exponential-time lower bound for conjunctive queries and views,Rada Chirkova,Abstract The view-selection problem is to design and materialize a set of views over adatabase schema; such that the choice of views minimizes the cost of evaluating theselected workload of queries; and the combined size of the materialized views does notexceed a prespecified storage limit. Important applications of the view-selection probleminclude query optimization; data warehouse design; and information integration. Weconsider the view-selection problem in relational databases; for conjunctive queries andviews. Suppose somebody wants to design a view-selection algorithm that outputs apolynomial number of views for all query workloads and storage limits and produces optimalselections of views independently of actual database contents.

Tractable XML data exchange via relations,Rada Chirkova; Leonid Libkin; Juan L Reutter,Abstract We consider data exchange for XML documents: given source and target schemas;a mapping between them; and a document conforming to the source schema; construct atarget document and answer target queries in a way that is consistent with sourceinformation. The problem has primarily been studied in the relational context; in which data-exchange systems have also been built. Since many XML documents are stored in relations;it is natural to consider using a relational system for XML data exchange. However; there is acomplexity mismatch between query answering in relational and XML data exchange; whichindicates that restrictions have to be imposed on XML schemas and mappings; and on XMLshredding schemes; to make the use of relational systems possible. We isolate a set of fiverequirements that must be fulfilled in order to have a faithful representation of the XML …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on information and knowledge management,2011,16
Finding equivalent rewritings in the presence of arithmetic comparisons,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Vassia Pavlaki,Abstract The problem of rewriting queries using views has received significant attentionbecause of its applications in a wide variety of data-management problems. For select-project-join SQL (aka conjunctive) queries and views; there are efficient algorithms in theliterature; which find equivalent and maximally contained rewritings. In the presence ofarithmetic comparisons (ACs) the problem becomes more complex. We do not know how tofind maximally contained rewritings in the general case. There are algorithms which findmaximally contained rewritings only for special cases such as when ACs are restricted to besemi-interval. However; we know that the problem of finding an equivalent rewriting (if thereexists one) in the presence of ACs is decidable; yet still doubly exponential. This complexitycalls for an efficient algorithm which will perform better on average than the complete …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,14
Exact and inexact methods for solving the problem of view selection for aggregate queries,Zohreh Asgharzadeh Talebi; Rada Chirkova; Yahya Fathi,We study the following warehouse view-selection problem: Given a data-warehouseschema; a set of parameterised aggregate queries and their frequency distribution; and astorage-limit constraint; find a set of aggregate views that; when materialised in thewarehouse; would minimise the evaluation costs of the frequent queries; subject to a storage-limit constraint. Optimising the layout of stored data using view selection has a direct impacton the performance of data warehouses. We introduce an integer-programming model toobtain optimal solutions for the warehouse view-selection problem; and propose a heuristicto obtain competitive inexact solutions where our exact method is not applicable.,International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data Mining,2009,13
Towards Well-Behaved Schema Evolution.,Rada Chirkova; George HL Fletcher,ABSTRACT We study the problem of schema evolution in the RDF data model. RDF and theRDFS schema language are W3C standards for flexibly modeling and sharing data on theweb. Although schema evolution has been intensively studied in the database andknowledge-representation communities; only recently has progress been made on the studyof RDFS schema evolution. Indeed; the flexible nature of RDF poses novel challenges. Inparticular; since the data model does not strictly distinguish data from metadata; schemaevolution is intimately related to data updates. A major issue encountered during RDFSdatabase updates is a certain type of “nondeterminism” exhibited during schema evolution.In current solutions; such nondeterminism is handled by extralogical rules or heuristics. Is itpossible to characterize the class of RDFS updates which are well-behaved; that is; with a …,WebDB,2009,13
Making SQL queries correct on incomplete databases: A feasibility study,Paolo Guagliardo; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Multiple issues with SQL's handling of nulls have been well documented. Havingefficiency as its key goal; evaluation of SQL queries disregards the standard notion ofcorrectness on incomplete databases-certain answers-due to its high complexity. As a result;it may produce answers that are just plain wrong. It was recently shown that SQL evaluationcan be modified; at least for first-order queries; to return only correct answers. But whilethese modifications came with good theoretical complexity bounds; they have not beentested in practice. The goals of this proof-of-concept paper are to understand whether wronganswers can be produced by SQL queries in real-world scenarios; and whether proposedtechniques for avoiding them can be made practically feasible. We use the TPC-Hbenchmark; and show that for some typical queries involving negation; wrong answers …,Proceedings of the 35th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2016,11
Analysis of response time percentile service level agreements in soa-based applications,Keerthana Boloor; Rada Chirkova; Tiia Salo; Yannis Viniotis,A large number of enterprise; web-based; distributed software applications are designed onService Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles and hosted in large scale datacentersmanaged by cloud providers. Typically; Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are negotiatedbetween the consumers of the cloud platform services and the cloud provider. In this work;we consider SLAs that involve percentiles of response times as part of the performancemetrics; the SLAs stipulate that a penalty be charged to the cloud provider if the SLA targetsare not met. The main motivation for considering such SLAs is their potential for pricedifferentiation. We focus our analysis on the effects the penalty function has on the achievedresponse time percentiles. In particular; we analyze the effect of three commonly deployedchoices (linear; exponential or step-wise functions) to relate the penalty charged and the …,Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2011); 2011 IEEE,2011,10
Query containment,Rada Chirkova,In general; the term Quadtree refers to a class of representations of geometric entities (suchas points; line segments; polygons; regions) in a space of two (or more) dimensions; thatrecursively decompose the space containing these entities into blocks until the data in eachblock satisfy some condition (with respect; for example; to the block size; the number of blockentities; the characteristics of the block entities; etc.). In a more restricted sense; the termQuadtree (Octree) refers to a tree data-structure in which each internal node has four (eight)children and is used for the representation of geometric entities in a two (three) dimensionalspace. The root of the tree represents the whole space/region. Each child of a noderepresents a subregion of the subregion of its parent. The subregions of the siblingsconstitute a partition of the parent's regions. Several variations of quadtrees are possible …,*,2009,10
XML query processing: a survey,Gang Gou; Rada Chirkova,Abstract XML (Extensible Markup Language) is emerging as a de facto standard forinformation exchange among various applications on the web because of its inherent dataself-describing capability and flexibility of organizing data. With increased impact of XML oninformation exchange; it is particularly important to develop high-performance techniques toquery large XML data repositories efficiently. The core of XML query processing is twigpattern matching; ie finding from XML documents all matches that satisfy the twig (or path)pattern specified by a given query. In this survey we will review and compare majortechniques for processing XML twig queries. We categorize these techniques into threeclasses based on the storage format of XML data. First; we review the file approach; in whichXML data have to be stored in commonly used flat files; in the form of just original XML …,*,2005,10
Improving query performance using materialized XML views: A learning-based approach,Ashish Shah; Rada Chirkova,Abstract We consider the problem of improving the efficiency of query processing on an XMLinterface of a relational database; for predefined query workloads. The main contribution ofthis paper is to show that selective materialization of data as XML views reduces query-execution costs in relatively static databases. Our learning-based approach precomputesand stores (materializes) parts of the answers to the workload queries as clustered XMLviews. In addition; the data in the materialized XML clusters are periodically incrementallyrefreshed and rearranged; to respond to the changes in the query workload. Ourexperiments show that the approach can significantly reduce processing costs for frequentand important queries on relational databases with XML interfaces.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2003,10
An integer programming approach for the view and index selection problem,Zohreh Asgharzadeh Talebi; Rada Chirkova; Yahya Fathi,Abstract The view-and index-selection problem is a combinatorial optimization problem thatarises in the context of on-line analytical processing (OLAP) in database-managementsystems. We propose an integer programming (IP) model for this problem and study theproperties of the views and indexes that appear in the optimal solution for this model. Wethen use these properties to remove a number of variables and constraints from thecorresponding IP model and obtain a model that is significantly smaller; yet its optimalsolution is guaranteed to be optimal for the original problem. This allows us to solve realistic-size instances of the problem in reasonable time using commercial IP solvers.Subsequently; we propose heuristic strategies to further reduce the size of this IP model anddramatically reduce its execution time; although we no longer guarantee that the reduced …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2013,9
View selection for real conjunctive queries,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Vassia Pavlaki,Abstract Given a query workload; a database and a set of constraints; the view-selectionproblem is to select views to materialize so that the constraints are satisfied and the viewscan be used to compute the queries in the workload efficiently. A typical constraint; which weconsider in the present work; is to require that the views can be stored in a given amount ofdisk space. Depending on features of SQL queries (eg; the DISTINCT keyword) and onwhether the database relations on which the queries are applied are sets or bags; thequeries may be computed under set semantics; bag-set semantics; or bag semantics. In thispaper we study the complexity of the view-selection problem for conjunctive queries andviews under these semantics. We show that bag semantics is the “easiest to handle”(weshow that in this case the decision version of view selection is in NP); whereas under set …,Acta Informatica,2007,9
Selecting and using views to compute aggregate queries,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova,Abstract We consider a workload of aggregate queries and investigate the problem ofselecting materialized views that (1) provide equivalent rewritings for all the queries; and (2)are optimal; in that the cost of evaluating the query workload is minimized. We considerconjunctive views and rewritings; with or without aggregation; in each rewriting; only oneview contributes to computing the aggregated query output. We look at query rewriting usingexisting views and at view selection. In the query-rewriting problem; we give sufficient andnecessary conditions for a rewriting to exist. For view selection; we prove complexity results.Finally; we give algorithms for obtaining rewritings and selecting views.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2011,8
View and index selection for query-performance improvement: quality-centered algorithms and heuristics,Maxim Kormilitsin; Rada Chirkova; Yahya Fathi; Matthias Stallmann,Abstract Selecting and precomputing indexes and materialized views; with the goal ofimproving query-processing performance; is an important part of database-performancetuning. The significant complexity of the view-and index-selection problem may result in hightotal cost of ownership for database systems. In this paper; we develop efficient methods thatdeliver user-specified quality of the set of selected views and indexes when given view-andindex-based plans as problem inputs. Here; quality means proximity to the globally optimumperformance for the input query workload given the input query plans. Our experimentalresults and comparisons on synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate thecompetitiveness of our approach and show that it provides a winning combination with end-to-end view-and index-selection frameworks such as those of [1; 2].,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,8

Query optimization using restructured views: Theory and experiments,Dongfeng Chen; Rada Chirkova; Fereidoon Sadri,Abstract We study optimization of relational queries using materialized views; where viewsmay be regular or restructured. In a restructured view; some data from the base table (s) arerepresented as metadata—that is; schema information; such as table and attribute names—or vice versa. Using restructured views in query optimization opens up a new spectrum ofviews that were not previously available; and can result in significant additional savings inquery-evaluation costs. These savings can be obtained due to a significantly larger set ofviews to choose from; and may involve reduced table sizes; elimination of self-joins;clustering produced by restructuring; and horizontal partitioning. In this paper we propose ageneral query-optimization framework that treats regular and restructured views in a uniformmanner and is applicable to SQL select-project-join queries and views without or with …,Information Systems,2009,7

Designing and using views to improve performance of aggregate queries,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Shalu Gupta; Charles Loftis,Abstract Data-intensive systems routinely use derived data (eg; indexes or materializedviews) to improve query-evaluation performance. We present a system architecture forQuery-Performance Enhancement by Tuning (QPET); which combines design and use ofderived data in an end-to-end approach to automated query-performance tuning. Our focusis on a tradeo. between (1) the amount of system resources spent on designing derived dataand on keeping the data up to date; and (2) the degree of the resulting improvement in queryperformance. From the technical point of view; the novelty that we introduce is that wecombine aggregate query rewriting techniques [1; 2] and view selection techniques [3] toachieve our goal.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,7
Equivalence and minimization of conjunctive queries under combined semantics,Rada Chirkova,Abstract The problems of query containment; equivalence; and minimization arefundamental problems in the context of query processing and optimization. In their classicwork [2] published in 1977; Chandra and Merlin solved the three problems for the languageof conjunctive queries (CQ queries) on relational data; under the" set-semantics" assumptionfor query evaluation. While the results of [2] have been very influential in database research;it was recognized long ago that the set semantics does not correspond to the semantics ofthe standard commercial query language SQL. Alternative semantics; called bag and bag-set semantics; have been studied since 1993; Chaudhuri and Vardi in [5] outlined necessaryand sufficient conditions for equivalence of CQ queries under these semantics.(Theproblems of containment of CQ bag and bag-set queries remain open to this day.)

Approximate rewriting of queries using views,Foto Afrati; Manik Chandrachud; Rada Chirkova; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract We study approximate; that is contained and containing; rewritings of queries usingviews. We consider conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons (CQACs); whichcapture the full expressive power of SQL select-project-join queries. For containedrewritings; we present a sound and complete algorithm for constructing; for CQAC queriesand views; a maximally-contained rewriting (MCR) whose all CQAC disjuncts have up to apredetermined number of view literals. For containing rewritings; we present a sound andefficient algorithm pruned-MiCR; which computes a CQAC containing rewriting that does notcontain any other CQAC containing rewriting (ie; computes a minimally containing rewriting;MiCR) and that has the minimum possible number of relational subgoals. As a result; theMiCR rewriting produced by our algorithm may be very efficient to execute. Both …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2009,6
Data management for mobile ad-hoc networks,Filip Perich; Anupam Joshi; Rada Chirkova,The overall goal of data management and processing in mobile ad hoc networks is to allowindividual devices to compute what information each device needs; when the device needsit; and how it can obtain the information. This chapter identifies the fundamental challengesand outlines ongoing and needed future work to achieve this goal. Until recently; researchon mobile data management was dominated by the client–proxy–server model requiring aninfrastructure support. In this model; mobile devices connect to the Internet and serve asclient end points. They initiate actions and receive information from servers; which reside onthe network and provide the infrastructure support to the clients. This earlier researchfocused primarily on the development of protocols and techniques that deal withdisconnection management; low bandwidth; and device resource constraints. This allows …,*,2006,6
Cache invalidation and propagation in distributed caching,Pooja Kohli; Rada Y Chirkova,Abstract Replication and caching strategies are increasingly being used to improveperformance and reduce user perceived delays in distributed environments. A query can beanswered much faster by accessing a cached copy than by making a database roundtrip.This setting creates a number of important issues such as maintaining consistency amongcopies of the same data item. Numerous techniques have been proposed to achievecaching and replication while maintaining consistency among the replicas. A closerinvestigation of these schemes reveals that no one scheme can be optimal for allenvironments. In this study we look at invalidation protocols for achieving consistency insystems that use distributed caching. We propose heuristics for dynamic adaptation of theseprotocols for cache consistency. These heuristics aim at propagating invalidations while …,*,2005,6
Wavecluster with differential privacy,Ling Chen; Ting Yu; Rada Chirkova,Abstract WaveCluster is an important family of grid-based clustering algorithms that arecapable of finding clusters of arbitrary shapes. In this paper; we investigate techniques toperform WaveCluster while ensuring differential privacy. Our goal is to develop a generaltechnique for achieving differential privacy on WaveCluster that accommodates differentwavelet transforms. We show that straightforward techniques based on synthetic datageneration and introduction of random noise when quantizing the data; though generallypreserving the distribution of data; often introduce too much noise to preserve usefulclusters. We then propose two optimized techniques; PrivTHR and PrivTHR em; which cansignificantly reduce data distortion during two key steps of WaveCluster: the quantizationstep and the significant grid identification step. We conduct extensive experiments based …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,5
Management of SOA-based context-aware applications hosted in a distributed cloud subject to percentile constraints,Keerthana Boloor; Rada Chirkova; Tiia Salo; Yannis Viniotis,We consider geographically distributed datacenters forming a collectively managed cloudcomputing system. Multiple SaaS providers host their SOA-based; context-awareapplications in the cloud. Typically; the context-aware applications serve multiple classes ofcustomers (end users) classified on economic considerations; which determine the Qualityof Service (QoS) received by each class. This need for differentiated QoS for each customerclass is incorporated into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiated between the context-aware application provider and the cloud provider. A QoS metric that has been explored inlarge distributed applications is the percentile of response times; this metric provides a formof guarantees on the shape of the response time distribution for the customer. Typical SLAsrequire the response time of a certain percentile of the input requests from particular …,Services Computing (SCC); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,5
Query optimization using restructured views,Rada Chirkova; Fereidoon Sadri,Abstract We study optimization of relational queries using materialized views; where viewsmay be regular or restructured. In a restructured view; some data from the base table (s) arerepresented as metadata-that is; schema information; such as table and attribute names-orvice versa. Using restructured views in query optimization opens up a new spectrum ofviews that were not previously available; and can result in significant additional savings inquery-evaluation costs. These savings can be obtained due to a significantly larger set ofviews to choose from; and may involve reduced table sizes; elimination of self-joins;clustering produced by restructuring; and horizontal partitioning. In this paper we propose ageneral query-optimization framework that treats regular and restructured views in a uniformmanner and is applicable to SQL select-project-join queries and views with or without …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,5

Linearly bounded reformulations of unary databases,Rada Chirkova; Michael R Genesereth,Abstract Database reformulation is the process of rewriting the data and rules of a deductivedatabase in a functionally equivalent manner. We focus on the problem of automaticallyreformulating a database in a way that reduces query processing time while satisfying strongstorage space constraints. In this paper we consider one class of deductive databases—those where all stored relations are unary. For this class of so-called unary databases; weshow that the database reformulation problem is decidable if all rules can be expressed innonrecursive datalog with negation; moreover; we show that for such databases therealways exists an “optimal” reformulation. We also suggest how this solution for unarydatabases might be extended to the general case; ie; to that of reformulating databases withstored relations of arbitrary arity.,International Symposium on Abstraction; Reformulation; and Approximation,2000,5
Plan-based view and index selection for query-performance improvement,Maxim Kormilitsin; Rada Chirkova; Yahya Fathi; Matthias Stallman,ABSTRACT Selecting and precomputing indexes and materialized views; with the goal ofimproving query-processing performance in the system; is an important part of database-performance tuning. The significant complexity of the view-and indexselection problem mayresult in high total cost of ownership for database systems.

Cache Invalidation and Update Propagation in Distributed Caches,Pooja Kohli; Rada Chirkova,Abstract We study an emerging setting where data stored on a database server are retrievedand modified by applications via a cluster of application servers; which interface with endusers and are often geographically distributed. This OLTP scenario is typical in manycommercial application domains; including financial; trading; and insurance industries. Asdesirable system functionalities include enterprise-class reliability and scalableperformance; it is often not possible to afford the overhead of having a distributed databasethat takes care of transactional consistency. A popular solution is to cache data onapplication servers; the use of distributed caching necessitates a cache-invalidation policy tokeep copies of data in sync. In this paper we present the results of our experimental study ofcache-invalidation protocols in clusters of multiple logically distributed application servers …,the Proceedings of an International Advanced Database Conference (IADC); San Diego; CA,2005,4
Deriving efficient SQL sequences via read-aheads,A Soydan Bilgin; Rada Y Chirkova; Timo J Salo; Munindar P Singh,Abstract Modern information system architectures place applications in an application serverand persistent objects in a relational database. In this setting; we consider the problem ofimproving application throughput; our proposed solution uses data prefetching (read-aheads) to minimize the total data-access time of an application; in a manner that affectsneither the application code nor the backend DBMS. Our methodology is based onanalyzing and automatically merging SQL queries to produce query sequences with lowtotal response time; in ways that exploit the application's data-access patterns. Theproposed approach is independent of the application domain and can be viewed as acomponent of container managed persistence that can be implemented in middleware.

What should an agentdo when these commitments conflict? We describe Coco; an approach for reasoning aboutwhich specific commitments apply to specific parties in light of general types ofcommitments; specific circumstances; and dominance relations among specificcommitments.

A scalable approach for outlier detection in edge streams using sketch-based approximations,Stephen Ranshous; Steve Harenberg; Kshitij Sharma; Nagiza F Samatova,Abstract Dynamic graphs are a powerful way to model an evolving set of objects and theirongoing interactions. A broad spectrum of systems; such as information; communication;and social; are naturally represented by dynamic graphs. Outlier (or anomaly) detection indynamic graphs can provide unique insights into the relationships of objects and identifynovel or emerging relationships. To date; outlier detection in dynamic graphs has beenstudied in the context of graph streams; focusing on the analysis and comparison of entiregraph objects. However; the volume and velocity of data are necessitating a transition fromoutlier detection in the context of graph streams to outlier detection in the context of edgestreams–where the stream consists of individual graph edges instead of entire graphobjects.

First;even if the number of detected communities grows linearly with the graph size; it becomesimpossible to manually inspect each community for value added to the applicationknowledge base. Mining for communities with query nodes as knowledge priors could allowfor filtering out irrelevant information and for enriching end-users knowledge associated withthe problem of interest; such as discovery of genes functionally associated with theAlzheimer's (AD) biomarker genes. Second; the data-intensive nature of communityenumeration challenges current approaches that often assume that the input graph and thedetected communities fit in memory.

Deterministic view selection for data-analysis queries: Properties and algorithms,Rong Huang; Rada Chirkova; Yahya Fathi,Abstract The view-selection problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that arises inthe context of on-line analytical processing (OLAP) in database management systems. Wepose the problem as an integer programming (IP) model; study its structural properties; andpropose effective techniques for reducing the search space of views and thus the size of thecorresponding IP model. We then use these results to design both exact methods andheuristic algorithms that are effective for solving relatively large realistic-size instances of theproblem.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2012,3
Equivalence of SQL queries in presence of embedded dependencies,Rada Chirkova; Michael R Genesereth,Abstract We consider the problem of finding equivalent minimal-size reformulations of SQLqueries in presence of embedded dependencies [1]. Our focus is on select-project-join (SPJ)queries with equality comparisons; also known as safe conjunctive (CQ) queries; possiblywith grouping and aggregation. For SPJ queries; the semantics of the SQL standard treatsquery answers as multisets (bags); whereas the stored relations are treated either as sets;which is called bag-set semantics; or as bags; which is called bag semantics.(Under setsemantics; both query answers and stored relations are treated as sets.) In the context of theabove Query-Reformulation Problem; we develop a comprehensive framework forequivalence of CQ queries under bag and bag-set semantics in presence of embeddeddependencies; and make a number of conceptual and technical contributions …,Proceedings of the twenty-eighth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2009,3
Designing views to efficiently answer real SQL queries,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Vassia Pavlaki,Abstract The problem of optimizing queries in the presence of materialized views and therelated view-design problem have recently attracted a lot of attention. Significant researchresults have been reported; and materialized views are increasingly used in queryevaluation in commercial data-management systems. At the same time; most results in theliterature assume set-theoretic semantics; whereas SQL queries have bag-theoreticsemantics (duplicates are not eliminated unless explicitly requested). This paper presentsresults on selecting views to answer queries in relational databases under set; bag; and bag-set semantics. The results can be used under each of the three assumptions; to find soundand complete algorithms for designing views and rewriting queries efficiently.,International Symposium on Abstraction; Reformulation; and Approximation,2005,3

Database reformulation with integrity constraints,Rada Chirkova; Michael R Genesereth,Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of reducing the evaluation costs of queries onfinite databases in presence of integrity constraints; by designing and materializing views.Given a database schema; a set of queries defined on the schema; a set of integrityconstraints; and a storage limit; to find a solution to this problem means to find a set of viewsthat satisfies the storage limit; provides equivalent rewritings of the queries under theconstraints (this requirement is weaker than equivalence in the absence of constraints); andreduces the total costs of evaluating the queries. This problem; database reformulation; isimportant for many applications; including data warehousing and query optimization.

Combined-semantics equivalence is decidable for a practical class of conjunctive queries,Rada Chirkova,Abstract: In this paper; we focus on the problem of determining whether two conjunctive ("CQ") queries posed on relational data are combined-semantics equivalent [9]. We continuethe tradition of [2; 5; 9] of studying this problem using the tool of containment betweenqueries. We introduce a syntactic necessary and sufficient condition for equivalence ofqueries belonging to a large natural language of" explicit-wave" combined-semantics CQqueries; this language encompasses (but is not limited to) all set; bag; and bag-set queries;and appears to cover all combined-semantics CQ queries that are expressible in SQL. Ourresult solves in the positive the decidability problem of determining combined-semanticsequivalence for pairs of explicit-wave CQ queries. That is; for an arbitrary pair of combined-semantics CQ queries; it is decidable (i) to determine whether each of the queries is …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1308.4027,2013,2

Knowledge-Guided Maximal Clique Enumeration,Steve Harenberg; Ramona G Seay; Gonzalo A Bello; Rada Y Chirkova; P Murali Doraiswamy; Nagiza F Samatova,Abstract Maximal clique enumeration is a long-standing problem in graph mining andknowledge discovery. Numerous classic algorithms exist for solving this problem. However;these algorithms focus on enumerating all maximal cliques; which may be computationallyimpractical and much of the output may be irrelevant to the user. To address this issue; weintroduce the problem of knowledge-biased clique enumeration; a query-driven formulationthat reduces output space; computation time; and memory usage. Moreover; we introduce adynamic state space indexing strategy for efficiently processing multiple queries over thesame graph. This strategy reduces redundant computations by dynamically indexing theconstituent state space generated with each query. Experimental results over real-worldnetworks demonstrate this strategy's effectiveness at reducing the cumulative query …,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications,2016,1
Exact detection of information leakage in database access control,Farid Alborzi; Rada Chirkova; Ting Yu,Abstract Elaborate security policies often require organizations to restrict user data access ina fine-grained manner; instead of traditional table-or column-level access control. Notsurprisingly; managing fine-grained access control in software is rather challenging. Inparticular; if access is not configured carefully; information leakage may happen: Users mayinfer sensitive information through the data explicitly accessible to them in centralizedsystems or in the cloud. In this paper we formalize this information-leakage problem; bymodeling sensitive information as answers to “secret queries;” and by modeling access-control rules as views. We focus on the scenario where sensitive information can bedeterministically derived by adversaries. We review a natural data-exchange basedinference model for detecting information leakage; and show its capabilities and limitation …,International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery,2015,1
How to Define Certain Answers.,Leonid Libkin,Abstract The standard way of answering queries over incomplete databases is to computecertain answers; defined as the intersection of query answers on all complete databases thatthe incomplete database represents. But is this universally accepted definition correct? Weargue that this “one-size-fitsall” definition can often lead to counterintuitive or just plainwrong results; and propose an alternative framework for defining certain answers. Wecombine three previously used approaches; based on the semantics and representationsystems; on ordering incomplete databases in terms of their informativeness; and on viewingdatabases as knowledge expressed in a logical language; to come up with a well justifiedand principled notion of certain answers. Using it; we show that for queries satisfying somenatural conditions (like not losing information if a more informative input is given) …,IJCAI,2015,1

The rather recent “Big-Data”phenomenon has been shaping a world where extreme quantities of data are collected in anad-hoc; almost accidental; way. Further; the user targets for Big Data are broader than thosetraditionally considered by the database research community. The main goals of this panelare to identify the pain points when end users attempt to extract real value from ad hoccollections of Big Data; and to provide alternative viewpoints on what the databasecommunity should work on; if it is to play a bigger role in bringing the benefits of Big Data tothe masses.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,1
Two-stage stochastic view selection for data-analysis queries,Rong Huang; Rada Chirkova; Yahya Fathi,Abstract We consider the problem of selecting an optimal set of views to answer a givencollection of queries at the present time (stage 1) as well as several collections of queries inthe future (stage 2); with a given probability of occurrence associated with each collection;so as to minimize the expected value of the corresponding query response time; whilekeeping the total size of the views within a given limit. We formulate this problem as a two-stage stochastic programming problem. We show that this model is equivalent to an integerprogramming (IP) model that can be solved via various commercial IP solvers. We also studythe relationship between the queries and the views in this context and use this relationshipto reduce the size of the corresponding IP model; hence increase the scalability of ourproposed approach.,*,2013,1

At the sametime; when ERs and MCRs do not exist; users can still use views to obtain meaningfulinformation on their queries. Emerging applications require a study of the problem ofrewriting queries using views in a variety of new scenarios. For example; in web-searchapplications when MCRs may not exist; users may want to obtain a rewriting that provides allquery answers (but may contain false positives). Even when an MCR is not available;security requirements of other applications may require checking whether any rewritingexists for a query using a set of views expressed in the fixed query language in which userscan pose queries.

At the same time; emerging applications require investigating theproblem of rewriting queries using views in a more general setting; and pose new technicalchallenges.

In this paper; we investigatetechniques to answer k-skyband queries with differential privacy. We first propose a generaltechnique BBS-Priv; which accepts any differentially private spatial decomposition tree asinput and leverages data synthesis to answer k-skyband queries privately. We then showthat; though quite a few private spatial decomposition trees are proposed in the literature;they are mainly designed to answer spatial range queries. Directly integrating them withBBS-Priv would introduce too much noise to generate useful k-skyband results. To addressthis problem; we propose a novel spatial decomposition technique k-skyband tree …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2017,*

It also provides tools for studying practical SQL queries; specificallyimportant types of queries arising in on-line analytical processing. In our study; we introducea containment-based algorithm for deciding combined-semantics equivalence for pairs ofCQ queries that belong to a large well-behaved class of “explicit-wave” queries. Ouralgorithm; as well as our general sufficient condition for containment of combined-semanticsCQ queries; generalizes in a uniform way the tests reported in [3; 6; 11].

Expressing and reasoning about conflicting norms in cybersecurity: poster,Jiaming Jiang; Nirav Ajmeri; Rada Y Chirkova; Jon Doyle; Munindar P Singh,Abstract Secure collaboration requires the collaborating parties to apply the right policies fortheir interaction. We adopt a notion of conditional; directed norms as a way to capture thestandards of correctness for a collaboration. How can we handle conflicting norms? Wedescribe an approach based on knowledge of what norm dominates what norm in whatsituation. Our approach adapts answer-set programming to compute stable sets of normswith respect to their computed conflicts and dominance. It assesses agent compliance withrespect to those stable sets. We demonstrate our approach on a healthcare scenario.,Proceedings of the Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security,2016,*
Determining query readiness for structured data,Farid Alborzi; Rada Chirkova; Jon Doyle; Yahya Fathi,Abstract The outcomes and quality of organizational decisions depend on the characteristicsof the data available for making the decisions and on the value of the data in the decision-making process. Toward enabling management of these aspects of data in analytics; weintroduce and investigate Data Readiness Level (DRL); a quantitative measure of the valueof a piece of data at a given point in a processing flow. Our DRL proposal is amultidimensional measure that takes into account the relevance; completeness; and utility ofdata with respect to a given analysis task. This study provides a formalization of DRL in astructured-data scenario; and illustrates how knowledge of rules and facts; both within andoutside the given data; can be used to identify those transformations of the data that improveits DRL.,International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery,2015,*
DataSlicer: Enabling Data Selection For Visual Data Exploration,Laura Sacerdote; Juan Reutter; Christopher G Healey; Pallavi Sumant Deo; Rada Y Chirkova; F Alborzi,Abstract—Determining how to select and transform the data for visualization is one of thehardest problems faced by dataunfamiliar or inexperienced users when performing a visualexploration to solve an analytical task. Our main hypothesis is that for many data sets andcommon analytical tasks; such as finding outliers or general trends in data; there arerelatively few “data slices” that are key to providing effective visualizations for the task. Byfocusing human users on appropriate and suitably transformed parts of the underlying datasets; these data slices can help the users carry their task to correct completion. To verify thishypothesis; we develop a framework that permits us to capture exemplary data slices in anexploration task; and to explore and parse visual-exploration sequences into a format thatmakes them distinct and easy to compare.

Obtaining Information about Queries Behind Views and Dependencies,Rada Chirkova; Ting Yu,Abstract: We consider the problems of finding and determining certain query answers and ofdetermining containment between queries; each problem is formulated in presence ofmaterialized views and dependencies under the closed-world assumption. We show a tightrelationship between the problems in this setting. Further; we introduce algorithms forsolving each problem for those inputs where all the queries and views are conjunctive; andthe dependencies are embedded weakly acyclic. We also determine the complexity of eachproblem under the security-relevant complexity measure introduced by Zhang andMendelzon in 2005. The problems studied in this paper are fundamental in ensuring correctspecification of database access-control policies; in particular in case of fine-grained accesscontrol. Our approaches can also be applied in the areas of inference control; secure data …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1403.5199,2014,*
The problem of coherence of a distributed hash table,Deepika Balachander; Rada Y Chirkova; Timo J Salo,The fundamental problem being investigated is the maintenance of data consistency in adistributed system setup. Consider a set of some N>= 1 computers sharing a common hashtable stored at a remote centralized repository. Each system is interested in a portion of thehash table; and these portions may overlap. So as to facilitate ease of access; we areallowed to cache a portion of the hash table at each system. Each system can read datacached at its location; or send requests straight to the remote repository. There are threeproblems to be understood and analyzed here. One; when read requests come in from acomputer; we need to figure out whether those requests can be answered by their localcaches or whether such requests need to be propagated to the remote centralizedrepository. Two; based on the trail of read requests coming in from the computers; we …,*,2013,*

On rewriting Xpath Queries Using Views,Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Φώτο Αφράτη; Rada Chirkova; B Kimelfeld; Βάσια Παυλάκη; Y Sagiv; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Foto Afrati; Vassia Pavlaki,The problem of rewriting a query using a materialized view is studied for a well knownfragment of XPath that includes the following three constructs: wildcards; descendant edgesand branches. In earlier work; determining the existence of a rewriting was shown to becoNP-hard; but no tight complexity bound was given. While it was argued that Σ 3 p is anupper bound; the proof was based on results that have recently been refuted. Consequently;the exact complexity (and even decidability) of this basic problem has been unknown; andthere have been no practical rewriting algorithms if the query and the view use all the threeconstructs mentioned above. It is shown that under fairly general conditions; there are onlytwo candidates for rewriting and hence; the problem can be practically solved by twocontainment tests.

View selection for real conjunctive queries,Φώτο Αφράτη; Rada Chirkova; Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Βάσια Παυλάκη; Foto Afrati; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Vassia Pavlaki,Given a query workload; a database and a set of constraints; the view-selection problem isto select views to materialize so that the constraints are satisfied and the views can be usedto compute the queries in the workload efficiently. A typical constraint; which we consider inthe present work; is to require that the views can be stored in a given amount of disk space.Depending on features of SQL queries (eg; the DISTINCT keyword) and on whether thedatabase relations on which the queries are applied are sets or bags; the queries may becomputed under set semantics; bag-set semantics; or bag semantics. In this paper we studythe complexity of the view-selection problem for conjunctive queries and views under thesesemantics. We show that bag semantics is the “easiest to handle”(we show that in this casethe decision version of view selection is in NP); whereas under set and bag-set semantics …,*,2007,*

Finding equivalent rewritings in the presence of arithmetic comparisons,Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Φώτο Αφράτη; Rada Chirkova; Βάσια Παυλάκη; Foto Afrati; Vassia Pavlaki; Manolis Gergatsoulis,The problem of rewriting queries using views has received significant attention because ofits applications in a wide variety of data-management problems. For select-project-join SQL(aka conjunctive) queries and views; there are efficient algorithms in the literature; which findequivalent and maximally contained rewritings. In the presence of arithmetic comparisons(ACs) the problem becomes more complex. We do not know how to find maximallycontained rewritings in the general case. There are algorithms which find maximallycontained rewritings only for special cases such as when ACs are restricted to be semi-interval. However; we know that the problem of finding an equivalent rewriting (if there existsone) in the presence of ACs is decidable; yet still doubly exponential. This complexity callsfor an efficient algorithm which will perform better on average than the complete …,*,2006,*
Designing views to efficiently answer real SQL queries,Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Φώτο Αφράτη; Βάσια Παυλάκη; Rada Chirkova; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Foto Afrati; Vassia Pavlaki,The problem of optimizing queries in the presence of materialized views and the relatedview-design problem have recently attracted a lot of attention. Significant research resultshave been reported; and materialized views are increasingly used in query evaluation incommercial data-management systems. At the same time; most results in the literatureassume set-theoretic semantics; whereas SQL queries have bagtheoretic semantics(duplicates are not eliminated unless explicitly requested). This paper presents results onselecting views to answer queries in relational databases under set; bag; and bag-setsemantics. The results can be used under each of the three assumptions; to find sound andcomplete algorithms for designing views and rewriting queries efficiently.,*,2005,*

Materializing Views with Minimum Size to Answer Queries (Technical Report),Rada Chirkova; Chen Li; Jia Li,Abstract In this paper we study the following problem. Given a database and a set of queries;we want to find a set of views that can compute the answers to the queries; such that the sizeof the viewset (ie; the amount of space; in bytes; required to store the viewset) is minimal onthe given database. This problem is important for applications such as distributeddatabases; data warehousing; and data integration. We explore the decidability andcomplexity of the problem for workloads of conjunctive queries. We show that results differsignificantly depending on whether the workload queries have self-joins. Further; for querieswithout self-joins we describe a very compact search space of views; which contains allviews in at least one optimal viewset. We apply our theoretical results using a real-lifeapplication: In a client-server framework; we devise an efficient practical approach that …,*,2004,*

Designing Views to Improve Query Performance: Current State of Knowledge,Rada Chirkova,The original motivation for view design comes from information-integration applications [19].From several independent databases or other sources of information; an information-integration application builds a database that combines the data from the sources. Oneapproach to information integration; called data warehousing [52]; uses materialized views.In data warehousing; the source data is stored in a central location—a warehouse—afterpossibly being processed in some way (eg; joined; filtered; or aggregated). In addition; thedata from the sources is transformed to conform to the schema of the warehouse. Theproblem of data-warehouse design is to decide which views to store in the warehouse toobtain optimal performance [27; 46; 47; 53]; one direction is to materialize views andindexes for data cubes in online-analytic-processing applications (OLAP)[3; 24; 31] …,*,2003,*

Deterministic Prefetching for Container-Managed Persistence,Ahmet S Bilgin; Rada Y Chirkova; Munindar P Singh; Timo J Salo,Abstract Modern information system architectures place applications in an application serverand persistent objects in a relational database. In this setting; we consider the problem ofimproving application throughput; our proposed solution uses data prefetching to minimizethe total data-access time of an application; in a manner that affects neither the applicationcode nor the backend DBMS. Our methodology is based on analyzing and automaticallymerging SQL queries to produce query sequences with low total response time; in ways thatexploit the application's data-access patterns. The proposed approach is independent of theapplication domain and can be viewed as a component of container-managed persistencethat can be implemented in middleware.

The proposed reformulation algorithm works off-line and consists of twostages. At the first stage; Datalog rules relevant to the queries are rewritten in a way thatyields predicates of smaller arity; or merges several predicates into one. This stageproduces a set of candidates for materialization. At the second stage; decisions are made onwhich candidates to materialize; the criterion here is storage space available for the data.This method makes use of additional knowledge about relations; namely of the informationabout functional dependencies in relations.

Minimizing Data-Communication Costs by Decomposing Query Results in Client-Server Environments (Extended Version),Jia Li; Rada Chirkova; Chen Li,Abstract Many database applications adopt a client-server architecture; in which dataresides on a server that receives queries from a client. For each client's query; the serveroften needs to transfer to the client a large amount of data that is an answer to the query. Thecommunication network in these environments could become a bottleneck in thecomputation. In this paper we study how to minimize the communication costs of transferringanswers to largejoin queries from server to client. We propose a novel technique thatdecomposes the answer into intermediate results; or views; which can reduce theredundancy in the answer. These views are transferred to the client and are used by theclient to compute the final answer. There are several challenges in implementing thistechnique:(1) the number of possible plans to decompose the answers could be very …,*,*,*

Database Reformulation Under strong storage space Constraints (research summary),Rada Chirkova; Michael R Genesereth,Abstract. Database reformulation is the process of rewriting the data and rules of a deductivedatabase in a functionally equivalent manner. We focus on the problem of automaticallyreformulating a database in a way that reduces query processing time while satisfying strongstorage space constraints. Our research objective is to explore how database reformulationcan be automated for databases whose rules are written using successively moreexpressive query languages; ie; various extensions of datalog. In addition; we plan to studyreformulation of databases with integrity constraints. We have already obtained decidabilityresults for unary databases whose rules can be expressed in nonrecursive datalog withnegation [2]; as well as for databases of arbitrary arity whose rules can be expressed asconjunctive queries [1].,*,*,*

We refer to this problem as “view design for query performance;” or “viewdesign” for short; sets of views that satisfy the requirements are called “optimal viewsets.” Ithas been shown that for the storage-limit constraint and under set semantics; the view-design problem is decidable and has an exponential-time lower bound for conjunctivequeries; views; and rewritings. In this paper we explore view design for workloads ofconjunctive queries; under a range of assumptions about databases and query computation.We first look at conjunctive views and rewritings under bag and bag-set semantics.
