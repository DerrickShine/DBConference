Ultrafast viscous water flow through nanostrand-channelled graphene oxide membranes,Hubiao Huang; Zhigong Song; Ning Wei; Li Shi; Yiyin Mao; Yulong Ying; Luwei Sun; Zhiping Xu; Xinsheng Peng,Abstract Pressure-driven ultrafiltration membranes are important in separation applications.Advanced filtration membranes with high permeance and enhanced rejection must bedeveloped to meet rising worldwide demand. Here we report nanostrand-channelledgraphene oxide ultrafiltration membranes with a network of nanochannels with a narrow sizedistribution (3–5 nm) and superior separation performance. This permeance offers a 10-foldenhancement without sacrificing the rejection rate compared with that of graphene oxidemembranes; and is more than 100 times higher than that of commercial ultrafiltrationmembranes with similar rejection. The flow enhancement is attributed to the porous structureand significantly reduced channel length. An abnormal pressure-dependent separationbehaviour is also reported; where the elastic deformation of nanochannels offers tunable …,Nature communications,2013,245
Selective Trans-Membrane Transport of Alkali and Alkaline Earth Cations through Graphene Oxide Membranes Based on Cation− π Interactions,Pengzhan Sun; Feng Zheng; Miao Zhu; Zhigong Song; Kunlin Wang; Minlin Zhong; Dehai Wu; Reginald B Little; Zhiping Xu; Hongwei Zhu,Graphene and graphene oxide (G–O) have been demonstrated to be excellent filters forvarious gases and liquids; showing potential applications in areas such as molecularsieving and water desalination. In this paper; the selective trans-membrane transportproperties of alkali and alkaline earth cations through a membrane composed of stackedand overlapped G–O sheets (“G–O membrane”) are investigated. The thermodynamics ofthe ion transport process reveal that the competition between the generated thermal motionsand the interactions of cations with the G–O sheets results in the different penetrationbehaviors to temperature variations for the considered cations (K+; Mg2+; Ca2+; and Ba2+).The interactions between the studied metal atoms and graphene are quantified by first-principles calculations based on the plane-wave-basis-set density functional theory (DFT) …,ACS nano,2014,134
Pseudo hall–petch strength reduction in polycrystalline graphene,Zhigong Song; Vasilii I Artyukhov; Boris I Yakobson; Zhiping Xu,The fracture of polycrystalline graphene is explored by performing molecular dynamicssimulations with realistic finite-grain-size models; emphasizing the role of grain boundaryends and junctions. The simulations reveal a∼ 50% or more strength reduction due to thepresence of the network of boundaries between polygonal grains; with cracks preferentiallystarting at the junctions. With a larger grain size; a surprising systematic decrease of tensilestrength and failure strain is observed; while the elastic modulus rises. The observed cracklocalization and strength behavior are well-explained by a dislocation-pileup model;reminiscent of the Hall–Petch effect but coming from different underlying physics.,Nano letters,2013,111
Ultrafast Molecule Separation through Layered WS2 Nanosheet Membranes,Luwei Sun; Yulong Ying; Hubiao Huang; Zhigong Song; Yiyin Mao; Zhiping Xu; Xinsheng Peng,Two-dimensional layered materials have joined in the family of size-selective separationmembranes recently. Here; chemically exfoliated tungsten disulfide (WS2) nanosheets areassembled into lamellar thin films and explored as an ultrafast separation membrane forsmall molecules with size of about 3 nm. Layered WS2 membranes exhibit 5-and 2-foldenhancement in water permeance of graphene oxide membranes and MoS2 laminarmembranes with similar rejection; respectively. To further increase the water permeance;ultrathin nanostrands are used as templates to generate more fluidic channel networks inthe WS2 membrane. The water permeation behavior and separation performance in thepressure loading–unloading process reveal that the channels created by the ultrathinnanostrands are cracked under high pressure and result in a further 2-fold increase of the …,ACS nano,2014,59
Defect-Detriment to Graphene Strength Is Concealed by Local Probe: The Topological and Geometrical Effects,Zhigong Song; Vasilii I Artyukhov; Jian Wu; Boris I Yakobson; Zhiping Xu,Defects in solids commonly limit mechanical performance of materials by reducing theirrigidity and strength. However; topological defects also induce a prominent geometricaleffect in addition to local stress buildup; which is especially pronounced in two-dimensionalcrystals. These dual roles of defects modulate mechanical responses of the material underlocal and global probes in very different ways. We demonstrate through atomisticsimulations and theoretical analysis that local response of two-dimensional crystals caneven be stiffened and strengthened by topological defects as the structure under indentationfeatures a positive Gaussian curvature; while softened and weakened mechanicalresponses are measured at locations with negative Gaussian curvatures. These findingsshed lights on mechanical characterization of two-dimensional materials in general. The …,ACS nano,2014,36
Characterizing phonon thermal conduction in polycrystalline graphene,Yanlei Wang; Zhigong Song; Zhiping Xu,Abstract Phonon thermal conduction was explored and discussed through a combinedtheoretical and simulation approach in this work. The thermal conductivity κ of polycrystallinegraphene was calculated by molecular dynamics simulations based on a hexagonal patchmodel in close consistency with microstructural characterization in experiments. The effectsof grain size; alignment; and temperature were identified with discussion on the microscopicphonon scattering mechanisms. The effective thermal conductivity was found to increasewith the grain size and decrease with the mismatch angle and dislocation density at thegrain boundaries (GBs). The∼ T− 1 temperature dependence of κ is significantly weakenedin the polycrystals. The effect of GBs in modifying thermal transport properties of graphenewas characterized by their effective width and thermal conductivity as an individual phase …,Journal of Materials Research,2014,24
Cracks fail to intensify stress in nacreous composites,Haimin Yao; Zhigong Song; Zhiping Xu; Huajian Gao,Abstract Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) implies that crack-like flaws wouldintensify stress in brittle materials with stress intensity scaling up with the square root of thecrack size. Therefore; the apparent strength of materials tends to be much smaller than thetheoretical value. In this paper; we examine the stress state in nacreous composites and findthat in such materials the crack-induced stress intensification and its dependence on cracksize can be suppressed greatly. This feature of nacreous composites can be attributed to theunique “brick-and-mortar”(B-and-M) structure and a synergistic match of the mechanicalproperties between “brick”(eg minerals) and “mortar”(eg proteins) phases. Our findings notonly provide a fundamental insight into the origin of the excellent mechanical properties ofnacreous composites such as high strength; high toughness and flaw tolerance; but also …,Composites Science and Technology,2013,20
How graphene crumples are stabilized?,Cheng Chang; Zhigong Song; Jiao Lin; Zhiping Xu,Forced crumpling of graphene and graphene oxides sheets and their reversibilities areexplored here by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations; with focus on thestabilizing mechanisms and properties of crumples. We find that to balance strain energystored in crumpled sheets; dangling bonds in graphene show significant chemical activity informing covalent crosslinks. Interlayer van der Waals cohesion helps also to maintain thecrumpled conformation after the compressive load is released. A distinct size-dependentbehavior of the process is observed; implying competition between these driven forces.These results suggest possibilities in controlling the reversibility in crumpling graphenesheets into nanoparticles and highlight the effects of chemically active graphene edges;defective sites; van der Waals and hydrogen-bond cohesion in defining microstructures of …,RSC Advances,2013,16
On the Fracture of Supported Graphene Under Pressure,Zhigong Song; Zhiping Xu; Xianliang Huang; Ji-Yeun Kim; Quanshui Zheng,We explore here the structural stability and fracture of supported graphene sheets underpressure loadings normal to the sheets by performing molecular dynamics simulations. Theresults show that; in absence of defects; supported graphene deforms into an inverse bubbleshape and fracture is nucleated at the supported edges. The critical pressure decreasesfrom ideal tensile strength of graphene in biaxial tension as the size of supporting poresincreases. When nanoscale holes are created in the suspended region of graphene; thecritical pressure is further lowered with the area of nanoholes; with additional dependenceon their shapes. The results are explained by analyzing the deformed profile of graphenesheets under pressure and the stress state.,Journal of Applied Mechanics,2013,14
Ultimate Osmosis Engineered by the Pore Geometry and Functionalization of Carbon Nanostructures,Zhigong Song; Zhiping Xu,Abstract Osmosis is the key process in establishing versatile functions of cellular systemsand enabling clean-water harvesting technologies. Membranes with single-atom thicknessnot only hold great promises in approaching the ultimate limit of these functions; but alsooffer an ideal test-bed to explore the underlying physical mechanisms. In this work; weexplore diffusive and osmotic transport of water and ions through carbon nanotube andporous graphene based membranes by performing molecular dynamics simulations. Ourcomparative study shows that the cylindrical confinement in carbon nanotubes offers muchhigher salt rejection at similar permeability in osmosis compared to porous graphene.Moreover; chemical functionalization of the pores modulates the membrane performance byits steric and electrostatic nature; especially at small-size pores due to the fact that the …,Scientific reports,2015,12

Geometrical effect ‘stiffens’ graphene membrane at finite vacancy concentrations,Zhigong Song; Zhiping Xu,Abstract The presence of defects not only modifies the stiffness and strength of materials; butalso changes their morphologies. The latter effect is extremely significant for low-dimensional materials such as graphene. We show in this work that graphene swells whilepoint defects such as mono-vacancies are created at finite concentrations. The distortedgeometry resulted from this areal expansion; in combination with the in-plane softeningeffect; predicts an unusual defect concentration dependence of stiffness measured forsupported graphene membrane in nanoindentation tests; which leads to a defect-inducedstiffening phenomenon. The mechanism is elucidated through an analytical membranemodel as well as numerical simulations at atomistic and continuum levels. In addition toelucidate the counter-intuitive observations in experiments and computer simulations; our …,Extreme Mechanics Letters,2016,10
Mechanical responses of the bio-nano interface: A molecular dynamics study of graphene-coated lipid membrane,Zhigong Song; Yanlei Wang; Zhiping Xu,Abstract Bio-nano interfaces between biological materials and functional nanodevices are ofvital importance in relevant energy and information exchange processes; which thusdemand an in-depth understanding. One of the critical issues from the application viewpointis the stability of the bio-nano hybrid under mechanical perturbations. In this work weexplore mechanical responses of the interface between lipid bilayer and graphene underhydrostatic pressure or indentation loads. We find that graphene coating providesremarkable resistance to the loads; and the intercalated water layer offers additionalprotection. These findings are discussed based on molecular dynamics simulation resultsthat elucidate the molecular level mechanisms; which provide a basis for the rational designof bionanotechnology-enabled applications such as biomedical devices and …,Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters,2015,6
Intrinsic high water/ion selectivity of graphene oxide lamellar membranes in concentration gradient-driven diffusion,Pengzhan Sun; Renzhi Ma; Hui Deng; Zhigong Song; Zhen Zhen; Kunlin Wang; Takayoshi Sasaki; Zhiping Xu; Hongwei Zhu,Although graphene oxide lamellar membranes (GOLMs) are effective in blocking largeorganic molecules and nanoparticles for nanofiltration and ultrafiltration; water desalinationwith GOLM is challenging; with seriously controversial results. Here; a combinedexperimental and molecular dynamics simulation study shows that intrinsic high water/ionselectivity of GOLM was achieved in concentration gradient-driven diffusion; showing greatpromise in water desalination. However; in pressure-driven filtration the salt rejection waspoor. This study unveils a long-overlooked reason behind the controversy in waterdesalination with GOLM and further provides a fundamental understanding on the in-depthmechanism concerning the strong correlation of water/ion selectivity with the appliedpressure and GO nanochannel length. Our calculations and experiments show that the …,Chemical Science,2016,5
Mechanistic transition of heat conduction in two-dimensional solids: A study of silica bilayers,Yanlei Wang; Zhigong Song; Zhiping Xu,Abstract Thermal transport in solids changes its nature from phonon propagation that suffersfrom perturbative scattering to thermally activated hops between localized vibrational modesas the level of disorder increases. Models have been proposed to understand these twodistinct extremes that predict opposite temperature dependence of the thermal conductivitybut not for the transition or the intermediate regime. Here we explore thermal transport in two-dimensional silica with varying levels of disorder α by performing atomistic simulations; aswell as analysis based on the kinetic and Allen-Feldman theories. We demonstrate acrossover between the crystalline and amorphous regimes at α∼ 0.3; which is characterizedby a turnover of the temperature dependence in thermal conductivity and explained by thedominance of thermal hopping processes. This critical disorder level is also identified in …,Physical Review B,2015,4
Unzipping of carbon nanotubes is geometry-dependent,Zhigong Song; Xin Mu; Tengfei Luo; Zhiping Xu,Abstract Carbon nanotube (CNT) unzipping is a facile and efficient technique to producenarrow graphene nanoribbons. The diameter and chirality of CNTs control the geometry ofthe unzipped nanoribbons. In this work; we analyze the energetics of oxidation-andhydrogenation-induced unzipping processes. Empirical reactive potential-based energycalculations show that there is a geometry-dependent energy barrier for oxidation-inducedunzipping; which is absent in the exothermal hydrogenation process. These results arediscussed by considering the unzipping process as crack nucleation and propagationprocesses in a pre-stressed cylindrical shell. Fitting our simulation data through thetheoretical model provides a quantitative way to estimate the key parameters in CNTunzipping that can be used to optimize the experimental procedure.,Nanotechnology,2015,4
Geometrical distortion leads to Griffith strength reduction in graphene membranes,Zhigong Song; Yong Ni; Zhiping Xu,Abstract Geometrical distortion plays an important role in modulating the mechanicalresponses of low-dimensional materials. Upon a structural transition from planar to non-planar conformations; the elastic energy stored in a membrane will be redistributed inbetween the stretching and bending modes of deformation. In this work; we present amolecular simulation based study that demonstrates remarkable reduction in the Griffithstrength of graphene with the presence of out-of-plane distortion. The reduction is muchmore significant in mode II crack where the wrinkles are delocalized compared to the resultsfor mode I crack where localized buckles are activated. Atomistic stress analysis andtheoretical models based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics explain this strengthreduction as a consequence of the out-of-plane distortion that releases in-plane elastic …,Extreme Mechanics Letters,2017,3
Thermal transport in oxidized polycrystalline graphene,Xin Mu; Zhigong Song; Yanlei Wang; Zhiping Xu; David B Go; Tengfei Luo,Abstract Grain boundaries (GBs) and the spontaneous oxidization around GB regions areinherent features of graphene. In this paper; the thermal conductivity (κ) of oxidizedpolycrystalline graphene (PG) is studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The κ ofoxidized PG decreases as oxygen (O) coverage increases; which is due to the phonon-defect scattering. However; the relative κ reduction of oxidized PG is much smallercompared to that of oxidized single-crystalline graphene (SG) with the same O coveragewhen oxidation is localized at the GBs. This is because the GBs themselves are alreadystrong phonon scatterers; such that O atoms residing at the GBs have far less impact on κ ascompared to the O atoms in uniformly oxidized SGs. An effective medium approximationmodel is developed; which predicts that the influence of both GBs and O atoms on the κ of …,Carbon,2016,3
