Solutions for a cultivated planet,Jonathan A Foley; Navin Ramankutty; Kate A Brauman; Emily S Cassidy; James S Gerber; Matt Johnston; Nathaniel D Mueller; Christine O’Connell; Deepak K Ray; Paul C West; Christian Balzer; Elena M Bennett; Stephen R Carpenter; Jason Hill; Chad Monfreda; Stephen Polasky; Johan Rockström; John Sheehan; Stefan Siebert; David Tilman; David PM Zaks,Abstract Increasing population and consumption are placing unprecedented demands onagriculture and natural resources. Today; approximately a billion people are chronicallymalnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land; water;biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security andsustainability needs; food production must grow substantially while; at the same time;agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions tothis dilemma; showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agriculturalexpansion; closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands; increasing cropping efficiency;shifting diets and reducing waste. Together; these strategies could double food productionwhile greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.,Nature,2011,2745
Closing yield gaps through nutrient and water management,Nathaniel D Mueller; James S Gerber; Matt Johnston; Deepak K Ray; Navin Ramankutty; Jonathan A Foley,Abstract In the coming decades; a crucial challenge for humanity will be meeting future fooddemands without undermining further the integrity of the Earth's environmental systems 1; 2;3; 4; 5; 6. Agricultural systems are already major forces of global environmental degradation4; 7; but population growth and increasing consumption of calorie-and meat-intensive dietsare expected to roughly double human food demand by 2050 (ref. 3). Responding to thesepressures; there is increasing focus on 'sustainable intensification'as a means to increaseyields on underperforming landscapes while simultaneously decreasing the environmentalimpacts of agricultural systems 2; 3; 4; 8; 9; 10; 11. However; it is unclear what such effortsmight entail for the future of global agricultural landscapes. Here we present a global-scaleassessment of intensification prospects from closing 'yield gaps'(differences between …,Nature,2012,854
Yield trends are insufficient to double global crop production by 2050,Deepak K Ray; Nathaniel D Mueller; Paul C West; Jonathan A Foley,Several studies have shown that global crop production needs to double by 2050 to meetthe projected demands from rising population; diet shifts; and increasing biofuelsconsumption. Boosting crop yields to meet these rising demands; rather than clearing moreland for agriculture has been highlighted as a preferred solution to meet this goal. However;we first need to understand how crop yields are changing globally; and whether we are ontrack to double production by 2050. Using∼ 2.5 million agricultural statistics; collected for∼13;500 political units across the world; we track four key global crops—maize; rice; wheat;and soybean—that currently produce nearly two-thirds of global agricultural calories. Wefind that yields in these top four crops are increasing at 1.6%; 1.0%; 0.9%; and 1.3% peryear; non-compounding rates; respectively; which is less than the 2.4% per year rate …,PloS one,2013,702
Recent patterns of crop yield growth and stagnation,Deepak K Ray; Navin Ramankutty; Nathaniel D Mueller; Paul C West; Jonathan A Foley,Abstract In the coming decades; continued population growth; rising meat and dairyconsumption and expanding biofuel use will dramatically increase the pressure on globalagriculture. Even as we face these future burdens; there have been scattered reports of yieldstagnation in the world's major cereal crops; including maize; rice and wheat. Here we studydata from∼ 2.5 million census observations across the globe extending over the period1961–2008. We examined the trends in crop yields for four key global crops: maize; rice;wheat and soybeans. Although yields continue to increase in many areas; we find thatacross 24–39% of maize-; rice-; wheat-and soybean-growing areas; yields either neverimprove; stagnate or collapse. This result underscores the challenge of meeting increasingglobal agricultural demands. New investments in underperforming regions; as well as …,Nature Communications,2012,423

Leverage points for improving global food security and the environment,Paul C West; James S Gerber; Peder M Engstrom; Nathaniel D Mueller; Kate A Brauman; Kimberly M Carlson; Emily S Cassidy; Matt Johnston; Graham K MacDonald; Deepak K Ray; Stefan Siebert,Achieving sustainable global food security is one of humanity's contemporary challenges.Here we present an analysis identifying key “global leverage points” that offer the bestopportunities to improve both global food security and environmental sustainability. We findthat a relatively small set of places and actions could provide enough new calories to meetthe basic needs for more than 3 billion people; address many environmental impacts withglobal consequences; and focus food waste reduction on the commodities with the greatestimpact on food security. These leverage points in the global food system can help guide hownongovernmental organizations; foundations; governments; citizens' groups; andbusinesses prioritize actions.,Science,2014,199
Use of agro-climatic zones to upscale simulated crop yield potential,Justin van Wart; Lenny GJ van Bussel; Joost Wolf; Rachel Licker; Patricio Grassini; Andrew Nelson; Hendrik Boogaard; James Gerber; Nathaniel D Mueller; Lieven Claessens; Martin K van Ittersum; Kenneth G Cassman,Abstract Yield gap analysis; which evaluates magnitude and variability of differencebetween crop yield potential (Yp) or water limited yield potential (Yw) and actual farm yields;provides a measure of untapped food production capacity. Reliable location-specificestimates of yield gaps; either derived from research plots or simulation models; areavailable only for a limited number of locations and crops due to cost and time required forfield studies or for obtaining data on long-term weather; crop rotations and managementpractices; and soil properties. Given these constraints; we compare global agro-climaticzonation schemes for suitability to up-scale location-specific estimates of Yp and Yw; whichare the basis for estimating yield gaps at regional; national; and global scales.

Dynamic nature of alterations in the endocrine system of fathead minnows exposed to the fungicide prochloraz,Gerald T Ankley; David C Bencic; Jenna E Cavallin; Kathleen M Jensen; Michael D Kahl; Elizabeth A Makynen; Dalma Martinović; Nathaniel D Mueller; Leah C Wehmas; Daniel L Villeneuve,Abstract The vertebrate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is controlled throughvarious feedback mechanisms that maintain a dynamic homeostasis in the face of changingenvironmental conditions; including exposure to chemicals. We assessed the effects ofprochloraz on HPG axis function in adult fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) atmultiple sampling times during 8-day exposure and 8-day depuration/recovery phases.Consistent with one mechanism of action of prochloraz; inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)19 aromatase activity; the fungicide depressed ex vivo ovarian production and plasmaconcentrations of 17β-estradiol (E2) in female fish. At a prochloraz water concentration of 30μg/l; inhibitory effects on E2 production were transitory and did not persist during the 8-dayexposure phase.

Global malnutrition overlaps with pollinator-dependent micronutrient production,Rebecca Chaplin-Kramer; Emily Dombeck; James Gerber; Katherine A Knuth; Nathaniel D Mueller; Megan Mueller; Guy Ziv; Alexandra-Maria Klein,Pollinators contribute around 10% of the economic value of crop production globally; but thecontribution of these pollinators to human nutrition is potentially much higher. Crops vary inthe degree to which they benefit from pollinators; and many of the most pollinator-dependentcrops are also among the richest in micronutrients essential to human health. This studyexamines regional differences in the pollinator dependence of crop micronutrient contentand reveals overlaps between this dependency and the severity of micronutrient deficiencyin people around the world. As much as 50% of the production of plant-derived sources ofvitamin A requires pollination throughout much of Southeast Asia; whereas other essentialmicronutrients such as iron and folate have lower dependencies; scattered throughoutAfrica; Asia and Central America.

The project includes global simulations of yields; phenologies; and manyland-surface fluxes using 12–15 modeling groups for many crops; climate forcing data sets;and scenarios over the historical period from 1948 to 2012. The primary outcomes of theproject include (1) a detailed comparison of the major differences and similarities amongglobal models commonly used for large-scale climate impact assessment;(2) an evaluationof model and ensemble hindcasting skill;(3) quantification of key uncertainties from climateinput data; model choice; and other sources; and (4) a multi-model analysis of theagricultural impacts of large-scale climate extremes from the historical record.,Geoscientific Model Development,2015,59
DNA barcoding confirms polyphagy in a generalist moth; Homona mermerodes (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae),Jiri Hulcr; Scott E Miller; Gregory P Setliff; Karolyn Darrow; Nathaniel D Mueller; Paul DN Hebert; George D Weiblen,Abstract Recent DNA barcoding of generalist insect herbivores has revealed complexes ofcryptic species within named species. We evaluated the species concept for a commongeneralist moth occurring in New Guinea and Australia; Homona mermerodes; in light ofhost plant records and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I haplotype diversity. Geneticdivergence among H. mermerodes moths feeding on different host tree species was muchlower than among several Homona species. Genetic divergence between haplotypes fromNew Guinea and Australia was also less than interspecific divergence. Whereas molecularspecies identification methods may reveal cryptic species in some generalist herbivores;these same methods may confirm polyphagy when identical haplotypes are reared frommultiple host plant families. A lectotype for the species is designated; and a summarized …,Molecular Ecology Resources,2007,52
Effects of a 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor; trilostane; on the fathead minnow reproductive axis,Daniel L Villeneuve; Lindsey S Blake; Jeffrey D Brodin; Jenna E Cavallin; Elizabeth J Durhan; Kathleen M Jensen; Michael D Kahl; Elizabeth A Makynen; Dalma Martinović; Nathaniel D Mueller; Gerald T Ankley,Abstract A number of environmental contaminants and plant flavonoid compounds havebeen shown to inhibit the activity of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-Δ4 isomerase (3β-HSD). Because 3β-HSD plays a critical role in steroid hormone synthesis; inhibition of 3β-HSD represents a potentially important mode of endocrine disruption that may causereproductive dysfunction in fish or other vertebrates. The objective of this study was to testthe hypothesis that exposure to the model 3β-HSD inhibitor; trilostane; would adverselyaffect reproductive success of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Results of in vitroexperiments with fathead minnow ovary tissue demonstrated that trilostane inhibited 17β-estradiol (E2) production in a concentration-and time-dependent manner; and that the effectwas eliminated by providing a substrate (progesterone) that does not require 3β-HSD …,Toxicological Sciences,2008,50
Use of chemical mixtures to differentiate mechanisms of endocrine action in a small fish model,Gerald T Ankley; Kathleen M Jensen; Michael D Kahl; Elizabeth J Durhan; Elizabeth A Makynen; Jenna E Cavallin; Dalma Martinović; Leah C Wehmas; Nathaniel D Mueller; Daniel L Villeneuve,Abstract Various assays with adult fish have been developed to identify potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which may cause toxicity via alterations in the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis. These assays can be sensitive and highly diagnostic for keymechanisms such as agonism of the estrogen and androgen receptors (ERs; ARs) andinhibition of steroid synthesis. However; most of the tests do not unambiguously identify ARantagonists. The purpose of this work was to explore the utility of a mixture test design withthe fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) for detecting different classes of EDCs includingAR antagonists. Adults of both sexes were exposed via the water to EDCs with diversemechanisms of action in the absence or presence of 17β-trenbolone (TB); a potent ARagonist which masculinizes female fathead minnows. Similar to previous studies with the …,Aquatic toxicology,2010,47
Cooling of US Midwest summer temperature extremes from cropland intensification,Nathaniel D Mueller; Ethan E Butler; Karen A McKinnon; Andrew Rhines; Martin Tingley; N Michele Holbrook; Peter Huybers,Abstract High temperature extremes during the growing season can reduce agriculturalproduction. At the same time; agricultural practices can modify temperatures by altering thesurface energy budget. Here we identify centennial trends towards more favourable growingconditions in the US Midwest; including cooler summer temperature extremes and increasedprecipitation; and investigate the origins of these shifts. Statistically significantcorrespondence is found between the cooling pattern and trends in cropland intensification;as well as with trends towards greater irrigated land over a small subset of the domain. Landconversion to cropland; often considered an important influence on historical temperatures;is not significantly associated with cooling. We suggest that agricultural intensificationincreases the potential for evapotranspiration; leading to cooler temperatures and …,Nature Climate Change,2016,39

A tradeoff frontier for global nitrogen use and cereal production,Nathaniel D Mueller; Paul C West; James S Gerber; Graham K MacDonald; Stephen Polasky; Jonathan A Foley,Abstract Nitrogen fertilizer use across the world's croplands enables high-yieldingagricultural production; but does so at considerable environmental cost. Imbalancesbetween nitrogen applied and nitrogen used by crops contributes to excess nitrogen in theenvironment; with negative consequences for water quality; air quality; and climate change.Here we utilize crop input-yield models to investigate how to minimize nitrogen applicationwhile achieving crop production targets. We construct a tradeoff frontier that estimates theminimum nitrogen fertilizer needed to produce a range of maize; wheat; and rice productionlevels. Additionally; we explore potential environmental consequences by calculatingexcess nitrogen along the frontier using a soil surface nitrogen balance model. We findconsiderable opportunity to achieve greater production and decrease both nitrogen …,Environmental Research Letters,2014,37
Global wheat production potentials and management flexibility under the representative concentration pathways,Juraj Balkovič; Marijn van der Velde; Rastislav Skalský; Wei Xiong; Christian Folberth; Nikolay Khabarov; Alexey Smirnov; Nathaniel D Mueller; Michael Obersteiner,Abstract Wheat is the third largest crop globally and an essential source of calories in humandiets. Maintaining and increasing global wheat production is therefore strongly linked to foodsecurity. A large geographic variation in wheat yields across similar climates points tosizeable yield gaps in many nations; and indicates a regionally variable flexibility to increasewheat production. Wheat is particularly sensitive to a changing climate thus limitingmanagement opportunities to enable (sustainable) intensification with potentially significantimplications for future wheat production. We present a comprehensive global evaluation offuture wheat yields and production under distinct Representative Concentration Pathways(RCPs) using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agro-ecosystem model.We project; in a geographically explicit manner; future wheat production pathways for …,Global and Planetary Change,2014,36
Closing the gap: global potential for increasing biofuel production through agricultural intensification,Matt Johnston; R Licker; J Foley; T Holloway; ND Mueller; C Barford; C Kucharik,Abstract Since the end of World War II; global agriculture has undergone a period of rapidintensification achieved through a combination of increased applications of chemicalfertilizers; pesticides; and herbicides; the implementation of best management practicetechniques; mechanization; irrigation; and more recently; through the use of optimized seedvarieties and genetic engineering. However; not all crops and not all regions of the worldhave realized the same improvements in agricultural intensity. In this study we examine boththe magnitude and spatial variation of new agricultural production potential from closingof'yield gaps' for 20 ethanol and biodiesel feedstock crops. With biofuels coming underincreasing pressure to slow or eliminate indirect land-use conversion; the use of targetedintensification via established agricultural practices might offer an alternative for …,Environmental research letters,2011,34

This study employed both real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and a15;000 gene oligonucleotide microarray to examine variation in the fathead minnow(Pimephales promelas) ovarian transcriptional profile as a function of quantitative andqualitative differences in ovarian histology. The objectives were to provide data that couldpotentially aid interpretation of future toxicogenomics experiments; identify putative stage-related transcriptional markers; and generate insights into basic biological regulation ofasynchronous oocyte development.

A calibration procedure to improve global rice yield simulations with EPIC,Wei Xiong; Juraj Balkovič; Marijn van der Velde; Xuesong Zhang; R César Izaurralde; Rastislav Skalský; Erda Lin; Nathan Mueller; Michael Obersteiner,Abstract Crop models are increasingly used to assess impacts of climate change/variabilityand management practices on productivity and environmental performance of alternativecropping systems. Calibration is an important procedure to improve reliability of modelsimulations; especially for large area applications. However; global-scale crop modelcalibration has rarely been exercised due to limited data availability and expensivecomputing cost. Here we present a simple approach to calibrate Environmental PolicyIntegrated Climate (EPIC) model for a global implementation of rice. We identify fourparameters (potential heat unit–PHU; planting density–PD; harvest index–HI; and biomassenergy ratio–BER) and calibrate them regionally to capture the spatial pattern of reportedrice yield in 2000.

Spatially explicit estimates of N2O emissions from croplands suggest climate mitigation opportunities from improved fertilizer management,James S Gerber; Kimberly M Carlson; David Makowski; Nathaniel D Mueller; Iñaki Garcia de Cortazar‐Atauri; Petr Havlík; Mario Herrero; Marie Launay; Christine S O'Connell; Pete Smith; Paul C West,Abstract With increasing nitrogen (N) application to croplands required to support growingfood demand; mitigating N 2 O emissions from agricultural soils is a global challenge.National greenhouse gas emissions accounting typically estimates N 2 O emissions at thecountry scale by aggregating all crops; under the assumption that N 2 O emissions arelinearly related to N application. However; field studies and meta-analyses indicate anonlinear relationship; in which N 2 O emissions are relatively greater at higher Napplication rates. Here; we apply a super-linear emissions response model to crop-specific;spatially explicit synthetic N fertilizer and manure N inputs to provide subnational accountingof global N 2 O emissions from croplands. We estimate 0.66 Tg of N 2 ON direct globalemissions circa 2000; with 50% of emissions concentrated in 13% of harvested area …,Global change biology,2016,20

Food systems; however; face continued increases in demand andgrowing environmental pressures. Most prominently; human-caused climate change willinfluence the quality and quantity of food we produce and our ability to distribute it equitably.Our capacity to ensure food security and nutritional adequacy in the face of rapidly changingbiophysical conditions will be a major determinant of the next century's global burden ofdisease.

The role of Latin America’s land and water resources for global food security: environmental trade-offs of future food production pathways,Insa Flachsbarth; Bárbara Willaarts; Hua Xie; Gauthier Pitois; Nathaniel D Mueller; Claudia Ringler; Alberto Garrido,One of humanity's major challenges of the 21st century will be meeting future food demandson an increasingly resource constrained-planet. Global food production will have to rise by70 percent between 2000 and 2050 to meet effective demand which poses majorchallenges to food production systems. Doing so without compromising environmentalintegrity is an even greater challenge. This study looks at the interdependencies betweenland and water resources; agricultural production and environmental outcomes in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean (LAC); an area of growing importance in internationalagricultural markets. Special emphasis is given to the role of LAC's agriculture for (a) globalfood security and (b) environmental sustainability.

Nitrogen use in the global food system: past trends and future trajectories of agronomic performance; pollution; trade; and dietary demand,Luis Lassaletta; Gilles Billen; Josette Garnier; Lex Bouwman; Eduardo Velazquez; Nathaniel D Mueller; James S Gerber,Abstract Nitrogen (N) limits crop and grass production; and it is an essential component ofdietary proteins. However; N is mobile in the soil-plant system and can be lost to theenvironment. Estimates of N flows provide a critical tool for understanding and improving thesustainability and equity of the global food system. This letter describes an integratedanalysis of changes in N in human diets; N use efficiency (NUE) of cropping and livestocksystems; N pollution and N in traded food and feed products for 12 world regions for theperiod 1960–2050.

Farmer perceptions of climate change: Associations with observed temperature and precipitation trends; irrigation; and climate beliefs,Meredith T Niles; Nathaniel D Mueller,Abstract How individuals perceive climate change is linked to whether individuals supportclimate policies and whether they alter their own climate-related behaviors; yet climateperceptions may be influenced by many factors beyond local shifts in weather. Infrastructuredesigned to control or regulate natural resources may serve as an important lens throughwhich people experience climate; and thus may influence perceptions. Likewise;perceptions may be influenced by personal beliefs about climate change and whether it ishuman-induced. Here we examine farmer perceptions of historical climate change; howperceptions are related to observed trends in regional climate; how perceptions are relatedto the presence of irrigation infrastructure; and how perceptions are related to beliefs andconcerns about climate change.

Closing yield gaps: consequences for the global food supply; environmental quality & food security,Nathaniel D Mueller; Seth Binder,The social; economic; and environmental costs of feeding a burgeoning and increasinglyaffluent human population will depend; in part; on how we increase crop production onunder-yielding agricultural landscapes; and by how much. Such areas have a “yield gap”between the crop yields they achieve and the crop yields that could be achieved under moreintensive management. Crop yield gaps have received increased attention in recent yearsdue to concerns over land scarcity; stagnating crop yield trends in some importantagricultural areas; and large projected increases in food demand. Recent analyses of globaldata sets and results from field trials have improved our understanding of where yield gapsexist and their potential contribution to increasing the food supply.

Neuroendocrine-active chemicals in the environment havepotential to interfere with and/or alter these processes. A companion study with thedopamine 2 receptor antagonist; haloperidol; found no evidence of a direct effect of thechemical on fish reproduction. This study considered haloperidol's potential effects onbehavior and ovarian gene expression.

Declining spatial efficiency of global cropland nitrogen allocation,Nathaniel D Mueller; Luis Lassaletta; Bryan C Runck; Gilles Billen; Josette Garnier; James S Gerber,Abstract Efficiently allocating nitrogen (N) across space maximizes crop productivity for agiven amount of N input and reduces N losses to the environment. Here we quantifychanges in the global spatial efficiency of cropland N use by calculating historical trade-offfrontiers relating N inputs to possible N yield assuming efficient allocation. Time seriescropland N budgets from 1961 to 2009 characterize the evolution of N input-yield responsefunctions across 12 regions and are the basis for constructing trade-off frontiers.Improvements in agronomic technology have substantially increased cropping system yieldpotentials and expanded N-driven crop production possibilities. However; we find that thesegains are compromised by the declining spatial efficiency of N use across regions.

We evaluated a machine-learning method;Random Forests (RF); for its ability to predict crop yield responses to climate and biophysicalvariables at global and regional scales in wheat; maize; and potato in comparison withmultiple linear regressions (MLR) serving as a benchmark. We used crop yield data fromvarious sources and regions for model training and testing: 1) gridded global wheat grainyield; 2) maize grain yield from US counties over thirty years; and 3) potato tuber and maizesilage yield from the northeastern seaboard region. RF was found highly capable ofpredicting crop yields and outperformed MLR benchmarks in all performance statistics thatwere compared.

Global relationships between cropland intensification and summer temperature extremes over the last 50 years,Nathaniel D Mueller; Andrew Rhines; Ethan E Butler; Deepak K Ray; Stefan Siebert; N Michele Holbrook; Peter Huybers,Abstract Conversion of native ecosystems to cropland and the use of irrigation areconsidered dominant pathways through which agricultural land-use change alters regionalclimate. Recent research proposes that increases in cropland productivity; or intensification;also influences climate through increasing evapotranspiration. Increases inevapotranspiration are expected to have the greatest temperature influence on extremelyhot summer days with high vapor pressure deficits. Here; the generalizability andimportance of such relationships are assessed by examining historical land-use and climatetrends in seven regions across the globe; each containing a major temperate or subtropicalcropping area. Trends in summer high-temperature extremes are sequentially comparedagainst trends in cropland area; area equipped for irrigation; precipitation; and summer …,Journal of Climate,2017,3
Social and ecological analysis of commercial integrated crop livestock systems: Current knowledge and remaining uncertainty,RD Garrett; MT Niles; JDB Gil; A Gaudin; R Chaplin-Kramer; A Assmann; TS Assmann; K Brewer; PC de Faccio Carvalho; O Cortner; R Dynes; K Garbach; E Kebreab; N Mueller; C Peterson; JC Reis; V Snow; J Valentim,Abstract Crops and livestock play a synergistic role in global food production and farmerlivelihoods. Increasingly; however; crops and livestock are produced in isolation; particularlyin farms operating at the commercial scale. It has been suggested that re-integrating cropand livestock systems at the field and farm level could help reduce the pollution associatedwith modern agricultural production and increase yields. Despite this potential; there hasbeen no systematic review to assess remaining knowledge gaps in both the social andecological dimensions of integrated crop and livestock systems (ICLS); particularly withincommercial agricultural systems. Based on a multi-disciplinary workshop of internationalexperts and additional literature review; we assess the current knowledge and remaininguncertainties about large-scale; commercial ICLS and identify the source of remaining …,*,2017,2
A study of temporal effects of the model anti-androgen flutamide on components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in adult fathead minnows,Rebecca Milsk; Jenna E Cavallin; Elizabeth J Durhan; Kathleen M Jensen; Michael D Kahl; Elizabeth A Makynen; Dalma Martinović-Weigelt; Nathan Mueller; Anthony Schroeder; Daniel L Villeneuve; Gerald T Ankley,Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate temporal changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) treated with themodel androgen receptor (AR) antagonist flutamide. Reproductively-mature fish wereexposed in a flow-through test to analytically-confirmed concentrations of either 50 or 500 μgflutamide/L for 8 d; followed by an 8-d recovery period in clean water. Fish were sampled at1; 2; 4 and 8 days during each phase of the experiment. Flutamide (500 μg/L) causedsignificant reductions in relative gonad size of the females on day 8 of the exposure and day1 of the recovery; and reduced expression of secondary sex characteristics in males duringthe exposure phase of the experiment. Ex vivo gonadal synthesis of testosterone in bothsexes (and 17β-estradiol in females) was reduced in the 500 μg/L treatment within 2 d of …,Aquatic Toxicology,2016,1
Quantifying the limitation to world cereal production due to soil phosphorus status,Marko Kvakić; Sylvain Pellerin; Philippe Ciais; David L Achat; Laurent Augusto; Pascal Denoroy; James S Gerber; Daniel Goll; Alain Mollier; Nathaniel D Mueller; Xuhui Wang; Bruno Ringeval,Abstract Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for plant growth. Low P availability in soilsis likely to limit crop yields in many parts of the world; but this effect has never beenquantified at the global scale by process-based models. Here we attempt to estimate Plimitation in 3 major cereals worldwide for the year 2000 by combining information on soil Pdistribution in croplands and a generic crop model; while accounting for the nature of soil-plant P transport. As a global average; the diffusion limited soil P supply meets the crop's Pdemand corresponding to the climatic yield potential; due to the legacy soil P in highlyfertilized areas. However; when focusing on the spatial distribution of P supply vs. demand;we found strong limitation in regions like North and South America; Africa and EasternEurope. Averaged over grid-cells where P supply is lower than demand; the global yield …,Global Biogeochemical Cycles,2018,*
Feeding a Full Planet,Nathaniel D Mueller,The End of Plenty. Bourne grew up as a farm kid in North Carolina; studied agronomy atNorth Carolina State University; and ended up pursuing a career in journalism; coveringagricultural issues for National Geographic as public interest in the topic soared followingrecent foodprice spikes. Bourne's background gives him a unique perspective; one that isrefreshingly nondogmatic; objective; and earnest. Introducing himself to the reader; Bournedescribes his childhood joy in exploring and hunting quail on the family farm—and hissubsequent disappointment as his hunting grounds disappeared amid Secretary ofAgriculture Earl Butz's call for farmers to plant crops “fencerow to fencerow.” He describes aland that seems to have lost its magic as wildlife habitat was lost; soil eroded away; andfields were increasingly bathed in chemicals. He became somewhat disillusioned with …,*,2016,*
