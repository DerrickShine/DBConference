Classification; subtype discovery; and prediction of outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia by gene expression profiling,Eng-Juh Yeoh; Mary E Ross; Sheila A Shurtleff; W Kent Williams; Divyen Patel; Rami Mahfouz; Fred G Behm; Susana C Raimondi; Mary V Relling; Anami Patel; Cheng Cheng; Dario Campana; Dawn Wilkins; Xiaodong Zhou; Jinyan Li,Abstract Treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is based on the conceptof tailoring the intensity of therapy to a patient's risk of relapse. To determine whether geneexpression profiling could enhance risk assignment; we used oligonucleotide microarrays toanalyze the pattern of genes expressed in leukemic blasts from 360 pediatric ALL patients.Distinct expression profiles identified each of the prognostically important leukemiasubtypes; including T-ALL; E2A-PBX1; BCR-ABL; TEL-AML1; MLL rearrangement; andhyperdiploid> 50 chromosomes. In addition; another ALL subgroup was identified based onits unique expression profile. Examination of the genes comprising the expressionsignatures provided important insights into the biology of these leukemia subgroups.Further; within some genetic subgroups; expression profiles identified those patients that …,Cancer cell,2002,1979
Exploiting indirect neighbours and topological weight to predict protein function from protein–protein interactions,Hon Nian Chua; Wing-Kin Sung; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Motivation: Most approaches in predicting protein function from protein–proteininteraction data utilize the observation that a protein often share functions with proteins thatinteracts with it (its level-1 neighbours). However; proteins that interact with the sameproteins (ie level-2 neighbours) may also have a greater likelihood of sharing similarphysical or biochemical characteristics. We speculate that functional similarity between aprotein and its neighbours from the two different levels arise from two distinct forms offunctional association; and a protein is likely to share functions with its level-1 and/or level-2neighbours. We are interested in finding out how significant is functional associationbetween level-2 neighbours and how they can be exploited for protein function prediction.Results: We made a statistical study on recent interaction data and observed that …,Bioinformatics,2006,510
CAEP: Classification by aggregating emerging patterns,Guozhu Dong; Xiuzhen Zhang; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,Abstract Emerging patterns (EPs) are itemsets whose supports change significantly from onedataset to another; they were recently proposed to capture multi-attribute contrasts betweendata classes; or trends over time. In this paper we propose a new classifier; CAEP; using thefollowing main ideas based on EPs:(i) Each EP can sharply differentiate the classmembership of a (possibly small) fraction of instances containing the EP; due to the bigdifference between its supports in the opposing classes; we define the differentiating powerof the EP in terms of the supports and their ratio; on instances containing the EP.(ii) For eachinstance t; by aggregating the differentiating power of a fixed; automatically selected set ofEPs; a score is obtained for each class. The scores for all classes are normalized and thelargest score determines t's class. CAEP is suitable for many applications; even those …,2nd International Conference on Discovery Science; Tokyo; Japan; December 1999,1999,496

Principles of programming with complex objects and collection types,Peter Buneman; Shamim Naqvi; Val Tannen; Limsson Wong,Abstract We present a new principle for the development of database query languages thatthe primitive operations should be organized around types. Viewing a relational database asconsisting of sets of records; this principle dectates that we should investigate separatelyoperations for records and sets. There are two immediate advantages of this approach;which is partly inspired by basic ideas from category theoryl. First; it provides a language forstructures in which record and set types may be freely combined: nested relations orcomplex objects. Second; the fundamental operations for sets are closely related to those forother “collection types” such as bags or lists; and this suggests how database languagesmay be uniformly extended to these new types. the most general operation on sets; that ofstructural recursion; is one in which not all programs are well-defined.

Complex discovery from weighted PPI networks,Guimei Liu; Limsoon Wong; Hon Nian Chua,Abstract Motivation: Protein complexes are important for understanding principles of cellularorganization and function. High-throughput experimental techniques have produced a largeamount of protein interactions; which makes it possible to predict protein complexes fromprotein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. However; protein interaction data produced byhigh-throughput experiments are often associated with high false positive and false negativerates; which makes it difficult to predict complexes accurately. Results: We use an iterativescoring method to assign weight to protein pairs; and the weight of a protein pair indicatesthe reliability of the interaction between the two proteins. We develop an algorithm calledCMC (clustering-based on maximal cliques) to discover complexes from the weighted PPInetwork. CMC first generates all the maximal cliques from the PPI networks; and then …,Bioinformatics,2009,299
Comprehension syntax,Peter Buneman; Leonid Libkin; Dan Suciu; Val Tannen; Limsoon Wong,Abstract The syntax of comprehensions is very close to the syntax of a number of practicaldatabase query languages and is; we believe; a better starting point than first-order logic forthe development of database languages. We give an informal account of a language basedon comprehension syntax that deals uniformly with a variety of collection types; it alsoincludes pattern matching; variant types and function definition. We show; again informally;how comprehension syntax is a natural fragment of structural recursion; a much morepowerful programming paradigm for collection types. We also show that a very small"abstract syntax language" can serve as a basis for the implementation and optimization ofcomprehension syntax.,ACM Sigmod Record,1994,288

These data sourcesinclude conventional relational databases with SQL interfaces; formatted text files on top ofwhich indexing is provided for efficient retrieval (ASN. 1-Entrez); and binary files that can beinterpreted textually or graphically via special purpose interfaces (ACeDB).

Naturally embedded query languages,Val Breazu-Tannen; Peter Buneman; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We investigate the properties of a simple programming language whose maincomputational engine is structural recursion on sets. We describe a progression ofsublanguages in this paradigm that (1) have increasing expressive power; and (2) illustraterobust conceptual restrictions thus exhibiting interesting additional properties. Theseproperties suggest that we consider our sublanguages as candidates for “query languages”.Viewing query languages as restrictions of our more general programming language hasseveral advantages. First; there is no “impedance mismatch” problem; the query languagesare already there; so they share common semantic foundation with the general language.Second; we suggest a uniform characterization of nested relational and complex-objectalgebras in terms of some surprisingly simple operators; and we can make comparisons …,4th International Conference on Database Theory; Berlin; Germany; October 1992,1992,218
Identifying good diagnostic gene groups from gene expression profiles using the concept of emerging patterns,Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Motivations and Results: Gene groups that are significantly related to a disease canbe detected by conducting a series of gene expression experiments. This work is aimed atdiscovering special types of gene groups that satisfy the following property. In each group;its member genes are found to be one-to-one contained in pre-determined intervals of geneexpression level with a large frequency in one class of cells but are never foundunanimously in these intervals in the other class of cells. We call these gene groupsemerging patterns; to emphasize the patterns' frequency changes between two classes ofcells. We use effective discretization and gene selection methods to obtain the mostdiscriminatory genes. We also use efficient algorithms to derive the patterns from thesegenes.

The optimal analysis requires an accounting and control of the many sources ofvariance within the system; an understanding of the limitations of the statistical approaches;and the ability to make sense of the results through intelligent database interrogation.,*,2002,189

To investigate cell cycle-regulatedtranscriptional programs in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe; we developed awhole-genome oligonucleotide-based DNA microarray. Microarray analysis of both wild-type and cdc25 mutant cell cultures was performed to identify transcripts whose levelsoscillated during the cell cycle. Using an unsupervised algorithm; we identified 747 genesthat met the criteria for cell cycle-regulated expression. Peaks of gene expression werefound to be distributed throughout the entire cell cycle. Furthermore; we found that fourpromoter motifs exhibited strong association with cell cycle phase-specific expression.Examination of the regulation of MCB motif-containing genes through the perturbation of …,Molecular Biology of the Cell,2005,178
A data transformation system for biological data sources,Peter Buneman; Susan B Davidson; Kyle Hart; Chris Overton; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Scientific data of importance to biologists in the Human Genome Project resides notonly in conventional databases; but in structured files maintained in a number of differentformats (eg ASN. 1 and ACE) as well as sequence analysis packages (eg BLAST andFASTA). These formats and packages contain a number of data types not found inconventional databases; such as lists and variants; and may be deeply nested. We presentin this paper techniques for querying and transforming such data; and illustrate their use in aprototype system developed in conjunction with the Human Genome Center forChromosome 22. We also describe optimizations performed by the system; a crucial issuefor bulk data.,21st International Conference on Very Large Data Bases; Zurich; Switzerland; September 1995,1995,168

Simple rules underlying gene expression profiles of more than six subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients,Jinyan Li; Huiqing Liu; James R Downing; Allen Eng-Juh Yeoh; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Motivations and Results: For classifying gene expression profiles or other types ofmedical data; simple rules are preferable to non-linear distance or kernel functions. This isbecause rules may help us understand more about the application in addition to performingan accurate classification. In this paper; we discover novel rules that describe the geneexpression profiles of more than six subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)patients. We also introduce a new classifier; named PCL; to make effective use of the rules.PCL is accurate and can handle multiple parallel classifications. We evaluate this method byclassifying 327 heterogeneous ALL samples. Our test error rate is competitive to that ofsupport vector machines; and it is 71% better than C4. 5; 50% better than Naive Bayes; and43% better than k-nearest neighbour.

A query language for multidimensional arrays: design; implementation; and optimization techniques,Leonid Libkin; Rona Machlin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract While much recent research has focussed on extending databases beyond thetraditional relational model; relatively little has been done to develop database tools forquerying data organized in (multidimensional) arrays. The scientific computing communityhas made little use of available database technology. Instead; multidimensional scientificdata is typically stored in local files conforming to various data exchange formats andqueried via specialized access libraries tied in to general purpose programming languages.To allow such data to be queried using known database techniques; we design andimplement a query language for multidimensional arrays. Our main design decision is totreat arrays as functions from index sets to values rather than as collection types.

DeEPs: A new instance-based lazy discovery and classification system,Jinyan Li; Guozhu Dong; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Distance is widely used in most lazy classification systems. Rather than usingdistance; we make use of the frequency of an instance's subsets of features and thefrequency-change rate of the subsets among training classes to perform both knowledgediscovery and classification. We name the system DeEPs. Whenever an instance isconsidered; DeEPs can efficiently discover those patterns contained in the instance whichsharply differentiate the training classes from one to another. DeEPs can also predict a classlabel for the instance by compactly summarizing the frequencies of the discovered patternsbased on a view to collectively maximize the discriminating power of the patterns. Manyexperimental results are used to evaluate the system; showing that the patterns arecomprehensible and that DeEPs is accurate and scalable.,Machine Learning,2004,145

Query languages for bags and aggregate functions,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Theoretical foundations for querying databases based on bags are studied in thispaper. We fully determine the strength of many polynomial-time bag operators relative to anambient query language. Then we obtain BQL; a query language for bags; by picking thestrongest combination of these operators. The relationship between the nested relationalalgebra and various fragments of BQL is investigated. The precise amount of extra powerthat BQL possesses over the nested relational algebra is determined. It is shown that theadditional expressiveness of BQL amounts to adding aggregate functions to a relationallanguage. The expressive power of BQL and related languages is investigated in depth. Weprove that these languages possess the conservative extension property. That is; theexpressibility of queries in these languages is independent of the nesting height of …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1997,135
Normal Forms and Conservative Extension Properties for Query Languages over Collection Types,Limsoon Wong,Abstract Strong normalization results are obtained for a general language for collectiontypes. An induced normal form for sets and bags is then used to show that the class offunctions whose input has height (that is; the maximal depth of nestings of sets/bags/lists inthe complex object) at mostiand output has height at mostodefinable in a nested relationalquery language withoutpowersetoperator isindependentof the height of intermediateexpressions used.

Discovery of significant rules for classifying cancer diagnosis data,Jinyan Li; Huiqing Liu; See-Kiong Ng; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Methods and Results: We introduce a new method to discover many diversified andsignificant rules from high dimensional profiling data. We also propose to aggregate thediscriminating power of these rules for reliable predictions. The discovered rules are foundto contain low-ranked features; these features are found to be sometimes necessary forclassifiers to achieve perfect accuracy. The use of low-ranked but essential features in ourmethod is in constrast to the prevailing use of an ad-hoc number of only top-ranked features.On a wide range of data sets; our method displayed highly competitive accuracy comparedto the best performance of other kinds of classification models. In addition to accuracy; ourmethod also provides comprehensible rules to help elucidate the translation between rawdata and useful knowledge.

Mining statistically important equivalence classes and delta-discriminative emerging patterns,Jinyan Li; Guimei Liu; Limsoon Wong,Abstract The support-confidence framework is the most common measure used in itemsetmining algorithms; for its antimonotonicity that effectively simplifies the search lattice. Thiscomputational convenience brings both quality and statistical flaws to the results asobserved by many previous studies. In this paper; we introduce a novel algorithm thatproduces itemsets with ranked statistical merits under sophisticated test statistics such as chi-square; risk ratio; odds ratio; etc. Our algorithm is based on the concept of equivalenceclasses. An equivalence class is a set of frequent itemsets that always occur together in thesame set of transactions. Therefore; itemsets within an equivalence class all share the samelevel of statistical significance regardless of the variety of test statistics. As an equivalenceclass can be uniquely determined and concisely represented by a closed pattern and a …,13th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; San Jose; California; 12-15 August 2007,2007,119
Effective pruning techniques for mining quasi-cliques,Guimei Liu; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Many real-world datasets; such as biological networks and social networks; can bemodeled as graphs. It is interesting to discover densely connected subgraphs from thesegraphs; as such subgraphs represent groups of objects sharing some common properties.Several algorithms have been proposed to mine quasi-cliques from undirected graphs; butthey have not fully utilized the minimum degree constraint for pruning. In this paper; wepropose an efficient algorithm called Quick to find maximal quasi-cliques from undirectedgraphs. The Quick algorithm uses several effective pruning techniques based on the degreeof the vertices to prune unqualified vertices as early as possible; and these pruningtechniques can be integrated into existing algorithms to improve their performance as well.Our experiment results show that Quick is orders of magnitude faster than previous work …,European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML/PKDD); Antwerp; Belgium; 15-19 September 2008,2008,94
Maximal biclique subgraphs and closed pattern pairs of the adjacency matrix: A one-to-one correspondence and mining algorithms,Jinyan Li; Guimei Liu; Haiquan Li; Limsoon Wong,Maximal biclique (also known as complete bipartite) subgraphs can model manyapplications in Web mining; business; and bioinformatics. Enumerating maximal bicliquesubgraphs from a graph is a computationally challenging problem; as the size of the outputcan become exponentially large with respect to the vertex number when the graph grows. Inthis paper; we efficiently enumerate them through the use of closed patterns of theadjacency matrix of the graph. For an undirected graph G without self-loops; we prove that 1)the number of closed patterns in the adjacency matrix of G is even; 2) the number of theclosed patterns is precisely double the number of maximal biclique subgraphs of G; and 3)for every maximal biclique subgraph; there always exists a unique pair of closed patternsthat matches the two vertex sets of the subgraph. Therefore; the problem of enumerating …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,83
Emerging patterns and gene expression data,Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,抄録 One important purpose of conducting gene expression experiments is to understandthe correlation of gene expression profiles to disease states. Based on the notion ofemerging patterns and an entropy-oriented discretization method; we discover groups ofgenes that are correlated to disease states in a significant way. In each group; everymember gene constrained by a specific expression interval; unanimously occurs only in onetype of cells with a maximally large frequency; but never unanimously happens in the othertypes of cells. According to our studies on the colon tumor dataset; such gene groups (alsocalled patterns) can reach a frequency of 90%; providing good insight into the correlation ofgene expression profiles to disease states. The patterns can be used to correctly predictwhether a new cell is normal or cancerous.,12th Workshop on Genome Informatics; Tokyo; Japan; December 2001,2001,83

Some properties of query languages for bags,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract In this paper we study the expressive power of query languages for nested bags.We define the ambient bag language by generalizing the constructs of the relationallanguage of Breazu-Tannen; Buneman and Wong; which is known to have precisely thepower of the nested relational algebra. Relative strength of additional polynomial constructsis studied; and the ambient language endowed with the strongest combination of thoseconstructs is chosen as a candidate for the basic bag language; which is called BQL (BagQuery Language). We prove that achieveing the power of BQL in the relational languageamounts to adding simple arithmetic to the latter. We show that BQL has shortcomings of therelational algebra: it can not express recursive queries. In particular; parity test is notdefinable in BQL.

Minimum description length principle: Generators are preferable to closed patterns,Jinyan Li; Haiquan Li; Limsoon Wong; Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong,Abstract The generators and the unique closed pattern of an equivalence class of itemsetsshare a common set of transactions. The generators are the minimal ones among theequivalent itemsets; while the closed pattern is the maximum one. As a generator is usuallysmaller than the closed pattern in cardinality; by the Minimum Description Length Principle;the generator is preferable to the closed pattern in inductive inference and classification. Toefficiently discover frequent generators from a large dataset; we develop a depth-firstalgorithm called Gr-growth. The idea is novel in contrast to traditional breadth-first bottom-upgenerator-mining algorithms. Our extensive performance study shows that Gr-growth issignificantly faster (an order or even two orders of magnitudes when the support thresholdsare low) than the existing generator mining algorithms. It can be also faster than the state …,21st National Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Boston; Mass; July 2006,2006,77

Semantic Representations and Query Languages for Or-sets,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Or-sets were introduced by Imielinski; Naqvi; and Vadaparty for dealing with limitedforms of disjunctive information in database queries. Independently; Rounds used a similarnotion for representing disjunctive and conjunctive information in the context of situationtheory. In this paper we formulate a query language with adequate expressive power for or-sets. Using the notion of normalization of or-sets; queries at the “structural” and “conceptual”levels are distinguished. Losslessness of normalization is established for a large class ofqueries. We obtain upper bounds for the cost of normalization. An approach related to that ofRounds is used to provide semantics for or-sets. We also treat or-sets in the context of partialinformation in databases.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1996,75

Consistency; comprehensiveness; and compatibility of pathway databases,Donny Soh; Difeng Dong; Yike Guo; Limsoon Wong,It is necessary to analyze microarray experiments together with biological information tomake better biological inferences. We investigate the adequacy of current biologicaldatabases to address this need. Our results show a low level of consistency;comprehensiveness and compatibility among three popular pathway databases (KEGG;Ingenuity and Wikipathways). The level of consistency for genes in similar pathways acrossdatabases ranges from 0% to 88%. The corresponding level of consistency for interactinggenes pairs is 0%-61%. These three original sources can be assumed to be reliable in thesense that the interacting gene pairs reported in them are correct because they are curated.However; the lack of concordance between these databases suggests each source hasmissed out many genes and interacting gene pairs. Researchers will hence find it …,BMC bioinformatics,2010,72
Logics with aggregate operators,Lauri Hella; Leonid Libkin; Juha Nurmonen; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We study adding aggregate operators; such as summing up elements of a columnof a relation; to logics with counting mechanisms. The primary motivation comes fromdatabase applications; where aggregate operators are present in all real life querylanguages. Unlike other features of query languages; aggregates are not adequatelycaptured by the existing logical formalisms. Consequently; all previous approaches toanalyzing the expressive power of aggregation were only capable of producing partialresults; depending on the allowed class of aggregate and arithmetic operations. Weconsider a powerful counting logic; and extend it with the set of all aggregate operators. Weshow that the resulting logic satisfies analogs of Hanf's and Gaifman's theorems; meaningthat it can only express local properties.

Using feature generation and feature selection for accurate prediction of translation initiation sites,Fanfan Zeng; Roland HC Yap; Limsoon Wong,抄録 Correct prediction of the translation initiation site (TIS) is an important issue in genomicresearch. We show that feature generation together with correlation based feature selectioncan be used with a variety of machine learning algorithms to give highly accurate translationinitiation site prediction. Only very few features are needed and the results achievecomparable accuracy to the best existing approaches. Our approach has the advantage thatit does not require one to devise a special prediction method; rather standard machinelearning classifiers are shown to give very good performance on the selected features. Theraw and generated features which we have found to be important are the following: positions-3 and-1 in the sequence; upstream k-grams for k= 3; 4; and 5; stop-codon frequency;downstream in-frame 3-gram; and the distance of ATG to the beginning of the sequence …,13th International Conference on Genome Informatics; Tokyo; Japan; December 2002,2002,68
Technologies for integrating biological data,Limsoon Wong,Abstract The process of building a new database relevant to some field of study inbiomedicine involves transforming; integrating and cleansing multiple data sources; as wellas adding new material and annotations. This paper reviews some of the requirements of ageneral solution to this data integration problem. Several representative technologies andapproaches to data integration in biomedicine are surveyed. Then some interesting featuresthat separate the more general dataintegration technologies from the more specialised onesare highlighted.,Briefings in bioinformatics,2002,67
Using indirect protein interactions for the prediction of Gene Ontology functions,Hon Chua; Wing-Kin Sung; Limsoon Wong,Protein-protein interaction has been used to complement traditional sequence homology toelucidate protein function. Most existing approaches only make use of direct interactions toinfer function; and some have studied the application of indirect interactions for functionalinference but are unable to improve prediction performance. We have previously proposedan approach; FS-Weighted Averaging; which uses topological weighting and level-2 indirectinteractions (protein pairs connected via two interactions) for predicting protein function fromprotein interactions and have found that it yields predictions with superior precision on yeastproteins over existing approaches. Here we study the use of this technique to predictfunctional annotations from the Gene Ontology for seven genomes: Saccharomycescerevisiae; Drosophila melanogaster; Caenorhabditis elegans; Arabidopsis thaliana …,BMC Bioinformatics,2007,66
Discovering motif pairs at interaction sites from protein sequences on a proteome-wide scale,Haiquan Li; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Motivation: Protein–protein interaction; mediated by protein interaction sites; isintrinsic to many functional processes in the cell. In this paper; we propose a novel methodto discover patterns in protein interaction sites. We observed from protein interactionnetworks that there exist a kind of significant substructures called interacting protein grouppairs; which exhibit an all-versus-all interaction between the two protein-sets in such a pair.The full-interaction between the pair indicates a common interaction mechanism shared bythe proteins in the pair; which can be referred as an interaction type. Motif pairs at theinteraction sites of the protein group pairs can be used to represent such interaction type;with each motif derived from the sequences of a protein group by standard motif discoveryalgorithms. The systematic discovery of all pairs of interacting protein groups from large …,Bioinformatics,2006,66
New techniques for studying set languages; bag languages and aggregate functions,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We provide new techniques for the analysis of the expressive power of querylanguages for nested collections. These languages may use set or bag semantics and maybe further complicated by the presence of aggregate functions. We exhibit certain classes ofgraphs and prove that the properties of these graphs that can be tested in such languagesare either finite or cofinite. This result settles the conjectures of Grumbach; Milo; andParedaens that parity test; transitive closure; and balanced binary tree test are notexpressible in bag languages like the PTIME fragment of BALG of Grumbach and Milo andBQL of Libkin and Wong. Moreover; it implies that many recursive queries; including simpleones like the test for a chain; cannot be expressed in a nested relational language evenwhen aggregate functions are available. In an attempt to generalize the finite-cofiniteness …,13th ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems; Minneapolis; Minnesota; May 1994,1994,66
Relative risk and odds ratio: A data mining perspective,Haiquan Li; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong; Mengling Feng; Yap-Peng Tan,Abstract We are often interested to test whether a given cause has a given effect. If wecannot specify the nature of the factors involved; such tests are called model-free studies.There are two major strategies to demonstrate associations between risk factors (ie.patterns) and outcome phenotypes (ie. class labels). The first is that of prospective studydesigns; and the analysis is based on the concept of" relative risk": What fraction of theexposed (ie. has the pattern) or unexposed (ie. lacks the pattern) individuals have thephenotype (ie. the class label)? The second is that of retrospective designs; and the analysisis based on the concept of" odds ratio": The odds that a case has been exposed to a riskfactor is compared to the odds for a case that has not been exposed.

An empirical comparison of several recent epistatic interaction detection methods,Yue Wang; Guimei Liu; Mengling Feng; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Motivation: Many new methods have recently been proposed for detecting epistaticinteractions in GWAS data. There is; however; no in-depth independent comparison of thesemethods yet. Results: Five recent methods—TEAM; BOOST; SNPHarvester; SNPRuler andScreen and Clean (SC)—are evaluated here in terms of power; type-1 error rate; scalabilityand completeness. In terms of power; TEAM performs best on data with main effect andBOOST performs best on data without main effect. In terms of type-1 error rate; TEAM andBOOST have higher type-1 error rates than SNPRuler and SNPHarvester. SC does notcontrol type-1 error rate well. In terms of scalability; we tested the five methods using adataset with 100 000 SNPs on a 64 bit Ubuntu system; with Intel (R) Xeon (R) CPU 2.66GHz; 16 GB memory.

An efficient strategy for extensive integration of diverse biological data for protein function prediction,Hon Nian Chua; Wing-Kin Sung; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Motivation: With the increasing availability of diverse biological information; proteinfunction prediction approaches have converged towards integration of heterogeneous data.Many adapted existing techniques; such as machine-learning and probabilistic methods;which have proven successful on specific data types. However; the impact of theseapproaches is hindered by a couple of factors. First; there is little comparison betweenexisting approaches. This is in part due to a divergence in the focus adopted by differentworks; which makes comparison difficult or even fuzzy. Second; there seems to be over-emphasis on the use of computationally demanding machine-learning methods; which runscounter to the surge in biological data. Analogous to the success of BLAST for sequencehomology search; we believe that the ability to tap escalating quantity; quality and …,Bioinformatics,2007,60
Increasing the reliability of protein interactomes,Hon Nian Chua; Limsoon Wong,Protein interactions are crucial components of all cellular processes. An in-depth knowledgeof the full complement of protein interactions in a cell; therefore; provides insight into thestructure; properties and functions of the cell and its components. An accurate andcomprehensive protein interaction network is; thus; an invaluable framework to study proteinregulation in disease. Although the amount of protein–protein interaction data has grownsignificantly because of advances in high-throughput experimental techniques; these high-throughput methods are highly susceptible to noise. Therefore; computational techniques forassessing the reliability of a protein–protein interaction are highly desirable. We review herecomputational techniques for assessing and improving the reliability of protein–proteininteraction data from these high-throughput experiments.,Drug Discovery Today,2008,59

An in-silico method for prediction of polyadenylation signals in human sequences,Huiqing Liu; Hao Han; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,抄録 This paper presents a machine learning method to predict polyadenylation signals(PASes) in human DNA and mRNA sequences by analysing features around them. Thismethod consists of three sequential steps of feature manipulation: generation; selection andintegration of features. In the first step; new features are generated using k-gram nucleotideacid or amino acid patterns. In the second step; a number of important features are selectedby an entropy-based algorithm. In the third step; support vector machines are employed torecognize true PASes from a large number of candidates. Our study shows that true PASesin DNA and mRNA sequences can be characterized by different features; and also showsthat both upstream and downstream sequence elements are important for recognizingPASes from DNA sequences. We tested our method on several public data sets as well …,14th International Conference on Genome Informatics (GIW); Yokohama; December 2003,2003,56
Non-redundant sequential rules---Theory and algorithm,David Lo; Siau-Cheng Khoo; Limsoon Wong,Abstract A sequential rule expresses a relationship between two series of events happeningone after another. Sequential rules are potentially useful for analyzing data in sequentialformat; ranging from purchase histories; network logs and program execution traces. In thiswork; we investigate and propose a syntactic characterization of a non-redundant set ofsequential rules built upon past work on compact set of representative patterns. A rule isredundant if it can be inferred from another rule having the same support and confidence.When using the set of mined rules as a composite filter; replacing a full set of rules with anon-redundant subset of the rules does not impact the accuracy of the filter. We considerseveral rule sets based on composition of various types of pattern sets—generators;projected-database generators; closed patterns and projected-database closed patterns …,Information Systems,2009,55
Assessing and predicting protein interactions using both local and global network topological metrics,Guimei Liu; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract High-throughput protein interaction data; with ever-increasing volume; arebecoming the foundation of many biological discoveries. However; high-throughput proteininteraction data are often associated with high false positive and false negative rates. It isdesirable to develop scalable methods to identify these errors. In this paper; we develop acomputational method to identify spurious interactions and missing interactions from high-throughput protein interaction data. Our method uses both local and global topologicalinformation of protein pairs; and it assigns a local interacting score and a global interactingscore to every protein pair. The local interacting score is calculated based on the commonneighbors of the protein pairs. The global interacting score is computed using globallyinteracting protein group pairs. The two scores are then combined to obtain a final score …,19th International Conference on Genome Informatics (GIW); Gold Coast; Australia; 3 December 2008,2008,54
Use of extreme patient samples for outcome prediction from gene expression data,Huiqing Liu; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Motivation: Patient outcome prediction using microarray technologies is animportant application in bioinformatics. Based on patients' genotypic microarray data;predictions are made to estimate patients' survival time and their risk of tumor metastasis orrecurrence. So; accurate prediction can potentially help to provide better treatment forpatients. Results: We present a new computational method for patient outcome prediction. Inthe training phase of this method; we make use of two types of extreme patient samples:short-term survivors who got an unfavorable outcome within a short period and long-termsurvivors who were maintaining a favorable outcome after a long follow-up time. Theseextreme training samples yield a clear platform for us to identify relevant genes whoseexpression is closely related to the outcome. The selected extreme samples and the …,Bioinformatics,2005,52

How advancement in biological network analysis methods empowers proteomics,Wilson WB Goh; Yie H Lee; Maxey Chung; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Proteomics provides important information-that may not be inferable from indirectsources such as RNA or DNA-on key players in biological systems or disease states.However; it suffers from coverage and consistency problems. The advent of network-basedanalysis methods can help in overcoming these problems but requires careful applicationand interpretation. This review considers briefly current trends in proteomics technologiesand understanding the causes of critical issues that need to be addressed-ie; incompletedata coverage and inter-sample inconsistency. On the coverage issue; we argue that holisticanalysis based on biological networks provides a suitable background on which morerobust models and interpretations can be built upon; and we introduce some recentlydeveloped approaches.

Distance based subspace clustering with flexible dimension partitioning,Guimei Liu; Jinyan Li; Kelvin Sim; Limsoon Wong,Traditional similarity or distance measurements usually become meaningless when thedimensions of the datasets increase; which has detrimental effects on clusteringperformance. In this paper; we propose a distance-based subspace clustering model; callednCluster; to find groups of objects that have similar values on subsets of dimensions. Insteadof using a grid based approach to partition the data space into non-overlapping rectanglecells as in the density based subspace clustering algorithms; the nCluster model uses amore flexible method to partition the dimensions to preserve meaningful and significantclusters. We develop an efficient algorithm to mine only maximal nClusters. A set ofexperiments are conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and theeffectiveness of the new model in preserving significant clusters.,23rd IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering; Istanbul; Turkey; April 2007,2007,45
Aggregate functions; conservative extension; and linear orders,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Practical database query languages are usually equipped with some aggregatefunctions. For example;“find mean of column” can be expressed in SQL. However; themanner in which aggregate functions were introduced in these query languages leavessomething to be desired. Breazu-Tannen; Buneman; and Wong [3] introduced a nestedrelational language NRC (=) based on monads [16; 24] and structural recursion [1; 2]. It wasshown in Wong [27] that this language is equivalent to the nested relational algebras ofThomas and Fischer [22]; Schek and Scholl [20]; and Colby [4]. NRC (=) enjoys certainadvantages over these languages: it is naturally embedded in functional languages; it isreadily extensible; and it has a compact equational theory. Therefore; it is used in this reportas a basis for investigating aggregate functions.,4th International Workshop on Database Programming Languages; Manhattan; New York; August 1993,1993,45
A new concise representation of frequent itemsets using generators and a positive border,Guimei Liu; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract A complete set of frequent itemsets can get undesirably large due to redundancywhen the minimum support threshold is low or when the database is dense. Several conciserepresentations have been previously proposed to eliminate the redundancy. Generatorbased representations rely on a negative border to make the representation lossless.However; the number of itemsets on a negative border sometimes even exceeds the totalnumber of frequent itemsets. In this paper; we propose to use a positive border together withfrequent generators to form a lossless representation. A positive border is usually orders ofmagnitude smaller than its corresponding negative border. A set of frequent generators plusits positive border is always no larger than the corresponding complete set of frequentitemsets; thus it is a true concise representation.

Using amino acid patterns to accurately predict translation initiation sites,Huiqing Liu; Hao Han; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract The translation initiation site (TIS) prediction problem is about how to correctlyidentify TIS in mRNA; cDNA; or other types of genomic sequences. High prediction accuracycan be helpful in a better understanding of protein coding from nucleotide sequences. Thisis an important step in genomic analysis to determine protein coding from nucleotidesequences. In this paper; we present an in silico method to predict translation initiation sitesin vertebrate cDNA or mRNA sequences. This method consists of three sequential steps asfollows. In the first step; candidate features are generated using k-gram amino acid patterns.In the second step; a small number of top-ranked features are selected by an entropy-basedalgorithm. In the third step; a classification model is built to recognize true TISs by applyingsupport vector machines or ensembles of decision trees to the selected features.

Method and apparatus for classification of data by aggregating emerging patterns,*,Emerging patterns (EPs) are itemsets having supports that change significantly from onedataset to another. A classifier; CAEP; is disclosed using the following main ideas based onEPs:(i) Each EP can sharply differentiate the class membership of a (possibly small) fractionof instances containing the EP; due to the big difference between the EP's supports in theopposing classes; the differentiating power of the EP is defined in terms of the EP's supportsand ratio; on instances containing the EP.(ii) For each instance t; by aggregating (124) thedifferentiating power of a fixed; automatically selected set of EPs; a score is obtained foreach class (126). The scores for all classes are normalized (144) and the largest scoredetermines t's class (146). CAEP is suitable for many applications; even those with largevolumes of high dimensional data. CAEP does not depend on dimension reduction on …,*,2003,43
Maintaining transitive closure of graphs in SQL,Guozhu Dong; Leonid Libkin; Jianwen Su; Limsoon Wong,Abstract It is common knowledge that relational calculus and even SQL are not expressiveenough to express recursive queries such as the transitive closure. In a real databasesystem; one can overcome this problem by storing a graph together with its transitive closureand maintaining the latter whenever updates to the former occur. This leads to the concept ofan incremental evaluation system; or IES.,International Journal of Information Technology,1999,42

Epidemic reemergence in adaptive complex networks,Jie Zhou; Gaoxi Xiao; Siew Ann Cheong; Xiuju Fu; Lim Soon Wong; Stefan Ma; Tee Hiang Cheng,Abstract The dynamic nature of a system gives rise to dynamical features of epidemicspreading; such as oscillation and bistability. In this paper; by studying the epidemicspreading in growing networks; in which susceptible nodes may adaptively break theconnections with infected ones yet avoid being isolated; we reveal a phenomenon; epidemicreemergence; where the number of infected nodes is incubated at a low level for a long timeand then erupts for a short time. The process may repeat several times before the infectionfinally vanishes. Simulation results show that all three factors; namely the network growth;the connection breaking; and the isolation avoidance; are necessary for epidemicreemergence to happen. We present a simple theoretical analysis to explain the process ofreemergence in detail. Our study may offer some useful insights; helping explain the …,Physical Review E,2012,40
Maximal quasi-bicliques with balanced noise tolerance: Concepts and co-clustering applications,Jinyan Li; Kelvin Sim; Guimei Liu; Limsoon Wong,Abstract The rigid all-versus-all adjacency required by a maximal biclique for its two vertexsets is extremely vulnerable to missing data. In the past; several types of quasi-bicliqueshave been proposed to tackle this problem; however their noise tolerance is usuallyunbalanced and can be very skewed. In this paper; we improve the noise tolerance ofmaximal quasi-bicliques by allowing every vertex to tolerate up to the same number; or thesame percentage; of missing edges. This idea leads to a more natural interaction betweenthe two vertex sets—a balanced most-versus-most adjacency. This generalization is alsonon-trivial; as many large-size maximal quasi-biclique subgraphs do not contain anymaximal bicliques. This observation implies that direct expansion from maximal bicliquesmay not guarantee a complete enumeration of all maximal quasi-bicliques.

Mean-entropy discretized features are effective for classifying high-dimensional bio-medical data,Jinyan Li; Huiqing Liu; Limsoon Wong,Abstract This paper studies an empirical feature selection heuristics for classifying high-dimensional bio-medical data. A feature's discriminating power can be measured by itsentropy value. Based on this idea; we do not consider those features that are ignored by theentropy idea. Such a selection can usually reduce the dimensionality of the data by 90-95%.Then we rank the remaining features; and select features whose entropy is smaller than theaverage of all the remaining features' entropies. This round of selection can usually furtherreduce two thirds of the features. So; we can achieve a reduction from tens of thousands offeatures to only hundreds of important features. Furthermore; we also observe that learningalgorithms; including our new tree-committee classifier; generally improve their accuracyafter the feature selection. This heuristics appears to be more systematic than the …,Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Data Mining in Bioinformatics,2003,40
Local properties of query languages,Guozhu Dong; Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Expressiveness of database query languages remains the major motivation forresearch in finite model theory. However; most techniques in finite model theory are basedon Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games; whose application often involves a rather intricate argument.Furthermore; most tools apply to first-order logic and some of its extensions; but not tolanguages that resemble real query languages; like SQL. In this paper we use locality toanalyze expressiveness of query languages. A query is local if; to determine if a tuplebelongs to the output; one only has to look at a certain predetermined portion of the input.We study local properties of queries in a context that goes beyond the pure first-order case;and then apply the resulting tools to analyze expressive power of SQL-like languages.

LP removes NCOR and RBPJ repressive complexes from promoters; enhancers;and matrix-associated deacetylase bodies; whereas E2 activates transcription from distalenhancers. LP ChIP-seq analyses identified 19;224 LP sites of which∼ 50% were±2 kb of atranscriptional start site.

DNAFSMiner: A web-based software toolbox to recognize two types of functional sites in DNA sequences,Huiqing Liu; Hao Han; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Summary: DNAFSMiner (DNA Functional Sites Miner) is a web-based softwaretoolbox to recognize functional sites in nucleic acid sequences. Currently in this toolbox; weprovide two software: TIS Miner and Poly (A) Signal Miner. The TIS Miner can be used topredict translation initiation sites in vertebrate DNA/mRNA/cDNA sequences; and the Poly(A) Signal Miner can be used to predict polyadenylation [poly (A)] signals in human DNAsequences. The prediction results are better than those by literature methods on twobenchmark applications. This good performance is mainly attributable to our unique learningmethod.

We propose here a novel method in proteomics that utilizes alldetected proteins. We demonstrate its efficacy in a proteomics screen of 5 and 7 liver cancerpatients in the moderate and late stage; respectively. Utilizing biological complexes as acluster vector; and augmenting it with submodules obtained from partitioning an integratedand cleaned protein–protein interaction network; we calculate a Proteomics SignatureProfile (PSP) for each patient based on the hit rates of their reported proteins; in the absenceof fold change thresholds; against the cluster vector. Using this; we demonstrated thatmoderate-and late-stage patients segregate with high confidence.

Using rules to analyse bio-medical data: A comparison between C4. 5 and PCL,Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract For easy comprehensibility; rules are preferrable to non-linear kernel functions inthe analysis of bio-medical data. In this paper; we describe two rule induction approaches—C4. 5 and our PCL classifier—for discovering rules from both traditional clinical data andrecent gene expression or proteomic profiling data. C4. 5 is a widely used method; but it hastwo weaknesses; the single coverage constraint and the fragmentation problem; that affectits accuracy. PCL is a new rule-based classifier that overcomes these two weaknesses ofdecision trees by using many significant rules. We present a thorough comparison to showthat our PCL method is much more accurate than C4. 5; and it is also superior to Baggingand Boosting in general.,4th International Conference on Web-Age Information Management (WAIM); Chengdu; China; August 2003,2003,36

Intrinsically disordered proteins aggregate at fungal cell-to-cell channels and regulate intercellular connectivity,Julian Lai; Chuan Hock Koh; Monika Tjota; Laurent Pieuchot; Vignesh Raman; Karthik Balakrishna Chandrababu; Daiwen Yang; Limsoon Wong; Gregory Jedd,Abstract Like animals and plants; multicellular fungi possess cell-to-cell channels (septalpores) that allow intercellular communication and transport. Here; using a combination ofMS of Woronin body-associated proteins and a bioinformatics approach that identifiesrelated proteins based on composition and character; we identify 17 septal pore-associated(SPA) proteins that localize to the septal pore in rings and pore-centered foci. SPA proteinsare not homologous at the primary sequence level but share overall physical properties withintrinsically disordered proteins. Some SPA proteins form aggregates at the septal pore; andin vitro assembly assays suggest aggregation through a nonamyloidal mechanism involvingmainly α-helical and disordered structures. SPA loss-of-function phenotypes includeexcessive septation; septal pore degeneration; and uncontrolled Woronin body activation …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA,2012,35
On two forms of structural recursion,Dan Suciu; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We investigate and compare two forms of recursion on sets for querying nestedcollections. The first one is called sri and it corresponds to sequential processing of data.The second one is called sru and it corresponds to data-parallel processing. A uniform first-order translation from sru into sri was known from previous work. The converse translation isby necessity more difficult and we have obtained three main results concerning it. First; weexhibit a uniform translation of sri queries into sru queries over the nested relational algebra.We observe that this translation maps PTIME algorithms into exponential-space queries. Thesecond result proves that any uniform translation of sri queries into sru queries over thenested relational algebra must map some PTIME queries into exponential-space ones. Infact; in the presence of certain external functions; we provide a PTIME sri query for which …,5th International Conference on Database Theory; Prague; Czech Republic; January 1995,1995,34
IntPath--an integrated pathway gene relationship database for model organisms and important pathogens,Hufeng Zhou; Jingjing Jin; Haojun Zhang; Bo Yi; Michal Wozniak; Limsoon Wong,Pathway data are important for understanding the relationship between genes; proteins andmany other molecules in living organisms. Pathway gene relationships are crucialinformation for guidance; prediction; reference and assessment in biochemistry;computational biology; and medicine. Many well-established databases--eg; KEGG;WikiPathways; and BioCyc--are dedicated to collecting pathway data for public access.However; the effectiveness of these databases is hindered by issues such as incompatibledata formats; inconsistent molecular representations; inconsistent molecular relationshiprepresentations; inconsistent referrals to pathway names; and incomprehensive data fromdifferent databases. In this paper; we overcome these issues through extraction;normalization and integration of pathway data from several major public databases …,BMC Systems Biology,2012,33
Finding consistent disease subnetworks across microarray datasets,Donny Soh; Difeng Dong; Yike Guo; Limsoon Wong,While contemporary methods of microarray analysis are excellent tools for studyingindividual microarray datasets; they have a tendency to produce different results fromdifferent datasets of the same disease. We aim to solve this reproducibility problem byintroducing a technique (SNet). SNet provides both quantitative and descriptive analysis ofmicroarray datasets by identifying specific connected portions of pathways that aresignificant. We term such portions within pathways as “subnetworks”. We tested SNet onindependent datasets of several diseases; including childhood ALL; DMD and lung cancer.For each of these diseases; we obtained two independent microarray datasets produced bydistinct labs on distinct platforms. In each case; our technique consistently produced almostthe same list of significant nontrivial subnetworks from two independent sets of microarray …,BMC Bioinformatics,2011,33
Finding consistent disease subnetworks using PFSNet,Kevin Lim; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Motivation: Microarray data analysis is often applied to characterize diseasepopulations by identifying individual genes linked to the disease. In recent years; effortshave shifted to focus on sets of genes known to perform related biological functions (ie in thesame pathways). Evaluating gene sets reduces the need to correct for false positives inmultiple hypothesis testing. However; pathways are often large; and genes in the samepathway that do not contribute to the disease can cause a method to miss the pathway. Inaddition; large pathways may not give much insight to the cause of the disease. Moreover;when such a method is applied independently to two datasets of the same diseasephenotypes; the two resulting lists of significant pathways often have low agreement.Results: We present a powerful method; PFSNet; that identifies smaller parts of pathways …,Bioinformatics,2014,32
Finding minimum representative pattern sets,Guimei Liu; Haojun Zhang; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Frequent pattern mining often produces an enormous number of frequent patterns;which imposes a great challenge on understanding and further analysis of the generatedpatterns. This calls for finding a small number of representative patterns to best approximateall other patterns. An ideal approach should 1) produce a minimum number ofrepresentative patterns; 2) restore the support of all patterns with error guarantee; and 3)have good efficiency. Few existing approaches can satisfy all the three requirements. In thispaper; we develop two algorithms; MinRPset and FlexRPset; for finding minimumrepresentative pattern sets. Both algorithms provide error guarantee. MinRPset produces thesmallest solution that we can possibly have in practice under the given problem setting; andit takes a reasonable amount of time to finish. FlexRPset is developed based on …,18th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2012,31
Bioinformatics adventures in database research,Jinyan Li; See-Kiong Ng; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Informatics has helped launch molecular biology into the genomic era. It appearscertain that informatics will remain a major contributor to molecular biology in the post-genome era. We discuss here data integration and datamining in bioinformatics; as well asthe role that database theory played in these topics. We also describe LIMS as a third keytopic in bioinformatics where advances in database system and theory can be very relevant.,9th International Conference on Database Theory; Siena; Italy; January 2003,2003,31
Geography of differences between two classes of data,Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Easily comprehensible ways of capturing main differences between two classes ofdata are investigated in this paper. In addition to examining individual di. erences; we alsoconsider their neighbourhood. The new concepts are applied to three gene expressiondatasets to discover diagnostic gene groups. Based on the idea of prediction by collectivelikelihoods (PCL); a new method is proposed to classify testing samples. Its performance iscompetitive to several state-of-the-art algorithms.,6th European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery; Helsinki; Finland; August 2002,2002,31
Kleisli; its Exchange Format; Supporting Tools; and an Application in Protein Interaction Extraction,Limsoon Wong,“When sequence databases were first created the amount of data was small and it was importantthat the database entries were human readable. ... The re- sult of this effort has been to createa large number of different databases; all in different formats; typically using non-standard dataquery software; and only re- ally properly accessible to bioinformatics experts” [2]. It is a big challengeif these pieces have to be used to- gether in complex ways to answer new questions in biol-ogy. Clearly; simple retrieval of data is not sufficient for modern bioinformatics. The challengeis how to manip- ulate the retrieved data derived from various databases and re-structure thedata in such a way to investigate specific biological problems.

Predicting Protein Functions from Protein Interaction Networks,Hon Nian Chua; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Functional characterization of genes and their protein products is essential tobiological and clinical research. Yet; there is still no reliable way of assigning functionalannotations to proteins in a high-throughput manner. In this article; the authors provide anintroduction to the task of automated protein function prediction. They discuss about themotivation for automated protein function prediction; the challenges faced in this task; aswell as some approaches that are currently available. In particular; they take a closer look atmethods that use protein-protein interaction for protein function prediction; elaborating ontheir underlying techniques and assumptions; as well as their strengths and limitations.,*,2009,30
A correspondence between maximal complete bipartite subgraphs and closed patterns,Jinyan Li; Haiquan Li; Donny Soh; Limsoon Wong,Abstract For an undirected graph G without self-loop; we prove:(i) that the number of closedpatterns in the adjacency matrix of G is even;(ii) that the number of the closed patterns isprecisely double the number of maximal complete bipartite subgraphs of G;(iii) that for everymaximal complete bipartite subgraph; there always exists a unique pair of closed patternsthat matches the two vertex sets of the subgraph. Therefore; we can enumerate all maximalcomplete bipartite subgraphs by using efficient algorithms for mining closed patterns whichhave been extensively studied in the data mining field.,9th European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases; Porto; Portugal; October 2005,2005,29
Stringent homology-based prediction of H. sapiens-M. tuberculosis H37Rv protein-protein interactions,Hufeng Zhou; Shangzhi Gao; Nam Ninh Nguyen; Mengyuan Fan; Jingjing Jin; Bing Liu; Liang Zhao; Geng Xiong; Min Tan; Shijun Li; Limsoon Wong,H. sapiens-M. tuberculosis H37Rv protein-protein interaction (PPI) data are essential forunderstanding the infection mechanism of the formidable pathogen M. tuberculosis H37Rv.Computational prediction is an important strategy to fill the gap in experimental H. sapiens-M. tuberculosis H37Rv PPI data. Homology-based prediction is frequently used in predictingboth intra-species and inter-species PPIs. However; some limitations are not properlyresolved in several published works that predict eukaryote-prokaryote inter-species PPIsusing intra-species template PPIs. We develop a stringent homology-based predictionapproach by taking into account (i) differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteinsand (ii) differences between inter-species and intra-species PPI interfaces.

Decomposing PPI Networks for Complex Discovery,Guimei Liu; Chern Han Yong; Hon Nian Chua; Limsoon Wong,Protein complexes are important for understanding principles of cellular organization andfunctions. With the availability of large amounts of high-throughput protein-proteininteractions (PPI); many algorithms have been proposed to discover protein complexes fromPPI networks. However; existing algorithms generally do not take into consideration the factthat not all the interactions in a PPI network take place at the same time. As a result;predicted complexes often contain many spuriously included proteins; precluding them frommatching true complexes. We propose two methods to tackle this problem:(1) Thelocalization GO term decomposition method: We utilize cellular component Gene Ontology(GO) terms to decompose PPI networks into several smaller networks such that the proteinsin each decomposed network are annotated with the same cellular component GO term …,Proteome Science,2011,28
eCEO: An efficient Cloud Epistasis cOmputing model in genome-wide association study,Zhengkui Wang; Yue Wang; Kian-Lee Tan; Limsoon Wong; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Motivation: Recent studies suggested that a combination of multiple singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could have more significant associations with a specificphenotype. However; to discover epistasis; the epistatic interactions of SNPs; in a largenumber of SNPs; is a computationally challenging task. We are; therefore; motivated todevelop efficient and effective solutions for identifying epistatic interactions of SNPs. Results:In this article; we propose an efficient Cloud-based Epistasis cOmputing (eCEO) model forlarge-scale epistatic interaction in genome-wide association study (GWAS). Given a largenumber of combinations of SNPs; our eCEO model is able to distribute them to balance theload across the processing nodes. Moreover; our eCEO model can efficiently process eachcombination of SNPs to determine the significance of its association with the phenotype …,Bioinformatics,2011,28
Incremental recomputation of recursive queries with nested sets and aggregate functions,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We examine the power of incremental evaluation systems that use an SQL-likelanguage for maintaining recursively-defined views. We show that recursive queries such astransitive closure; and “alternating paths” can be incrementally maintained in a nestedrelational language; when some auxiliary relations are allowed. In the presence ofaggregate functions; even more queries can be maintained; for example; the “samegeneration” query. In contrast; it is still an open problem whether such queries aremaintainable in relational calculus. We then restrict the language so that no nested relationsare involved (but we keep the aggregate functions). Such a language captures the capabilityof most practical relational database systems. We prove that this restriction does not reducethe incremental computational power; that is; any query that can be maintained in a …,6th International Workshop on Database Programming Languages; Estes Park; Colorado; August 1997,1997,28
Methods for protein complex prediction and their contributions towards understanding the organisation; function and dynamics of complexes,Sriganesh Srihari; Chern Han Yong; Ashwini Patil; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Complexes of physically interacting proteins constitute fundamental functional unitsresponsible for driving biological processes within cells. A faithful reconstruction of the entireset of complexes is therefore essential to understand the functional organisation of cells. Inthis review; we discuss the key contributions of computational methods developed till date(approximately between 2003 and 2015) for identifying complexes from the network ofinteracting proteins (PPI network). We evaluate in depth the performance of these methodson PPI datasets from yeast; and highlight their limitations and challenges; in particular atdetecting sparse and small or sub-complexes and discerning overlapping complexes. Wedescribe methods for integrating diverse information including expression profiles and 3Dstructures of proteins with PPI networks to understand the dynamics of complex formation …,*,2015,27
FastTagger: An efficient algorithm for genome-wide tag SNP selection using multi-marker linkage disequilibrium,Guimei Liu; Yue Wang; Limsoon Wong,Human genome contains millions of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) andthese SNPs play an important role in understanding the association between geneticvariations and human diseases. Many SNPs show correlated genotypes; or linkagedisequilibrium (LD); thus it is not necessary to genotype all SNPs for association study. Manyalgorithms have been developed to find a small subset of SNPs called tag SNPs that aresufficient to infer all the other SNPs. Algorithms based on the r2 LD statistic have gainedpopularity because r2 is directly related to statistical power to detect disease associations.Most of existing r2 based algorithms use pairwise LD. Recent studies show that multi-markerLD can help further reduce the number of tag SNPs. However; existing tag SNP selectionalgorithms based on multi-marker LD are both time-consuming and memory-consuming …,BMC Bioinformatics,2010,27
Increasing confidence of protein-protein interactomes,Jin Chen; Hon Nian Chua; Wynne Hsu; Mong-Li Lee; See-Kiong Ng; Rintaro Saito; Wing-Kin Sung; Limsoon Wong,抄録 High-throughput experimental methods; such as yeast-two-hybrid and phage display;have fairly high levels of false positives (and false negatives). Thus the list of protein-proteininteractions detected by such experiments would need additional wet laboratory validation. Itwould be useful if the list could be prioritized in some way. Advances in computationaltechniques for assessing the reliability of protein-protein interactions detected by such high-throughput methods are reviewed in this paper; with a focus on techniques that rely only ontopological information of the protein interaction network derived from such high-throughputexperiments. In particular; we discuss indices that are abstract mathematicalcharacterizations of networks of reliable protein-protein interactions-eg;“interactiongenerality”(IG);“interaction reliability by alternatve pathways”(IRAP); and “functional …,17th International Conference on Genome Informatics; Yokohama; Japan; 18-20 December 2006,2006,27
Mining succinct systems of minimal generators of formal concepts,Guozhu Dong; Chunyu Jiang; Jian Pei; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Formal concept analysis has become an active field of study for data analysis andknowledge discovery. A formal concept C is determined by its extent (the set of objects thatfall under C) and its intent (the set of properties or attributes covered by C). The intent for C;also called a closed itemset; is the maximum set of attributes that characterize C. Theminimal generators for C are the minimal subsets of C's intent which can similarlycharacterize C. This paper introduces the s uccinct s ystem of m inimal g enerators (SSMG)as a minimal representation of the minimal generators of all concepts; and gives an efficientalgorithm for mining SSMGs. The SSMGs are useful for revealing the equivalencerelationship among the minimal generators; which may be important for medical and otherscientific discovery; and for revealing the extent-based semantic equivalence among …,10th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications; Beijing; China; April 2005,2005,27
Conservativity of nested relational calculi with internal generic functions,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Queries in nested relational calculus are independent of the depth of set nesting inthe intermediate data; even in the presence of aggregate functions. We prove that thiscontinues to be true if the calculus is augmented with any internal generic family of functions.,Information Processing Letters,1994,27
Comparative analysis and assessment of M. tuberculosis H37Rv protein-protein interaction datasets,Hufeng Zhou; Limsoon Wong,M. tuberculosis is a formidable bacterial pathogen. There is thus an increasing demand onunderstanding the function and relationship of proteins in various strains of M. tuberculosis.Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) data are crucial for this kind of knowledge. However; thequality of the main available M. tuberculosis PPI datasets is unclear. This hampers theeffectiveness of research works that rely on these PPI datasets. Here; we analyze the twomain available M. tuberculosis H37Rv PPI datasets. The first dataset is the high-throughputB2H PPI dataset from Wang et al's recent paper in Journal of Proteome Research. Thesecond dataset is from STRING database; version 8.3; comprising entirely of H37Rv PPIspredicted using various methods. We find that these two datasets have a surprisingly lowlevel of agreement. We postulate the following causes for this low level of agreement:(i) …,BMC Genomics,2011,26
Controlling False Positives in Association Rule Mining,Guimei Liu; Haojun Zhang; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Association rule mining is an important problem in the data mining area. Itenumerates and tests a large number of rules on a dataset and outputs rules that satisfy user-specified constraints. Due to the large number of rules being tested; rules that do notrepresent real systematic effect in the data can satisfy the given constraints purely byrandom chance. Hence association rule mining often suffers from a high risk of false positiveerrors. There is a lack of comprehensive study on controlling false positives in associationrule mining. In this paper; we adopt three multiple testing correction approaches---the directadjustment approach; the permutation-based approach and the holdout approach---tocontrol false positives in association rule mining; and conduct extensive experiments tostudy their performance. Our results show that (1) Numerous spurious rules are …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,25
Protein complex prediction based on k-connected subgraphs in protein interaction network,Mahnaz Habibi; Changiz Eslahchi; Limsoon Wong,Protein complexes play an important role in cellular mechanisms. Recently; several methodshave been presented to predict protein complexes in a protein interaction network. In thesemethods; a protein complex is predicted as a dense subgraph of protein interactions.However; interactions data are incomplete and a protein complex does not have to be acomplete or dense subgraph. We propose a more appropriate protein complex predictionmethod; CFA; that is based on connectivity number on subgraphs. We evaluate CFA usingseveral protein interaction networks on reference protein complexes in two benchmark datasets (MIPS and Aloy); containing 1142 and 61 known complexes respectively. We compareCFA to some existing protein complex prediction methods (CMC; MCL; PCP and RNSC) interms of recall and precision. We show that CFA predicts more complexes correctly at a …,BMC Systems Biology,2010,25
On the power of aggregation in relational query languages,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract It is a folk result that relational algebra or calculus extended with aggregatefunctions cannot compute the transitive closure. However; proving folk results is sometimesa nontrivial task. In this paper; we tell the story of the work on expressive power of relationallanguages with aggregate functions. We also prove by far the most powerful result thatdescribes the expressiveness of such languages. There are four main features of our resultthat distinguish it from previous ones: 1. It does not rely on any unproven assumptions; suchas separation of complexity classes. 2. It establishes a general property of queries definablewith the help of aggregate functions. This property can easily be applied to prove manyexpressiveness bounds. 3. The class of aggregate functions is much larger than anypreviously considered. 4. The proof is “non-syntactic.” That is; it does not depend on a …,6th International Workshop on Database Programming Languages; Estes Park; Colorado; August 1997,1997,25
A consensus linkage map of oil palm and a major QTL for stem height,May Lee; Jun Hong Xia; Zhongwei Zou; Jian Ye; Yuzer Alfiko; Jingjing Jin; Jessica Virginia Lieando; Maria Indah Purnamasari; Chin Huat Lim; Antonius Suwanto; Limsoon Wong; Nam-Hai Chua; Gen Hua Yue,Abstract Oil palm (Elaeis guinensis Jacquin) is the most important source of vegetable oiland fat. Several linkage maps had been constructed using dominant and co-dominantmarkers to facilitate mapping of QTL. However; dominant markers are not easily transferableamong different laboratories. We constructed a consensus linkage map for oil palm using co-dominant markers (ie microsatellite and SNPs) and two F 1 breeding populations generatedby crossing Dura and Pisifera individuals. Four hundreds and forty-four microsatellites and36 SNPs were mapped onto 16 linkage groups. The map length was 1565.6 cM; with anaverage marker space of 3.72 cM. A genome-wide scan of QTL identified a major QTL forstem height on the linkage group 5; which explained 51% of the phenotypic variation. Genesin the QTL were predicted using the palm genome sequence and bioinformatic tools. The …,Scientific Reports,2015,24
Next generation sequencing unravels the biosynthetic ability of Spearmint (Mentha spicata) peltate glandular trichomes through comparative transcriptomics,Jingjing Jin; Deepa Panicker; Qian Wang; Mi J Kim; Jun Liu; Jun-Lin Yin; Limsoon Wong; In-Cheol Jang; Nam-Hai Chua; Rajani Sarojam,Plant glandular trichomes are chemical factories with specialized metabolic capabilities toproduce diverse compounds. Aromatic mint plants produce valuable essential oil inspecialised glandular trichomes known as peltate glandular trichomes (PGT).

Antibody-specific B-cell epitope prediction in line with the principle of context-awareness,Liang Zhao; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,Abstract Context-awareness is a characteristic in the recognition between antigens andantibodies; highlighting the reconfiguration of epitope residues when an antigen interactswith a different antibody. A coarse binary classification of antigen regions into epitopes; ornonepitopes without specifying antibodies may not accurately reflect this biological reality.Therefore; we study an antibody-specified epitope prediction problem in line with thisprinciple. This problem is new and challenging as we pinpoint a subset of the antigenicresidues from an antigen when it binds to a specific antibody. We introduce two kinds ofassociations of the contextual awareness: 1) residues-residues pairing preference; and 2)the dependence between sets of contact residue pairs. Preference plays a bridging role tolink interacting paratope and epitope residues while dependence is used to extend the …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,2011,24
Local properties of query languages,Guozhu Dong; Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract In this paper we study the expressiveness of local queries. By locality we mean—informally—that in order to check if a tuple belongs to the result of a query; one only has tolook at a certain predetermined portion of the input. Examples include all relational calculusqueries. We start by proving a general result describing outputs of local queries. This resultleads to many easy inexpressibility proofs for local queries. We then consider a closelyrelated property; namely; the bounded degree property. It describes the outputs of localqueries on structures that locally look “simple.” Every query that is local is shown to have thebounded degree property. Since every relational calculus (first-order) query is local; thegeneral results proved for local queries can be viewed as “off-the-shelf” strategies forproving inexpressibility results; which are often easier to apply than Ehrenfeucht …,Theoretical Computer Science,2000,24
Random forests on Hadoop for genome-wide association studies of multivariate neuroimaging phenotypes,Yue Wang; Wilson Goh; Limsoon Wong; Giovanni Montana,Multivariate quantitative traits arise naturally in recent neuroimaging genetics studies; inwhich both structural and functional variability of the human brain is measured non-invasively through techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is growinginterest in detecting genetic variants associated with such multivariate traits; especially ingenome-wide studies. Random forests (RFs) classifiers; which are ensembles of decisiontrees; are amongst the best performing machine learning algorithms and have beensuccessfully employed for the prioritisation of genetic variants in case-control studies. RFscan also be applied to produce gene rankings in association studies with multivariatequantitative traits; and to estimate genetic similarities measures that are predictive of thetrait.

Accurate prediction of hot spot residues through physicochemical characteristics of amino acid sequences,Peng Chen; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong; Hiroyuki Kuwahara; Jianhua Huang; Xin Gao,ABSTRACT Hot spot residues of proteins are fundamental interface residues that helpproteins perform their functions. Detecting hot spots by experimental methods is costly andtime-consuming. Sequential and structural information has been widely used in thecomputational prediction of hot spots. However; structural information is not alwaysavailable. In this article; we investigated the problem of identifying hot spots using onlyphysicochemical characteristics extracted from amino acid sequences. We first extracted132 relatively independent physicochemical features from a set of the 544 properties inAAindex1; an amino acid index database. Each feature was utilized to train a classificationmodel with a novel encoding schema for hot spot prediction by the IBk algorithm; anextension of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm.

Comparative network-based recovery analysis and proteomic profiling of neurological changes in valproic acid-treated mice,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Marek Sergot; Judy Sng; Limsoon Wong,Despite its prominence for characterization of complex mixtures; LC–MS/MS frequently failsto identify many proteins. Network-based analysis methods; based on protein–proteininteraction networks (PPINs); biological pathways; and protein complexes; are useful forrecovering non-detected proteins; thereby enhancing analytical resolution. However;network-based analysis methods do come in varied flavors for which the respectiveefficacies are largely unknown. We compare the recovery performance and functionalinsights from three distinct instances of PPIN-based approaches; viz.; Proteomics ExpansionPipeline (PEP); Functional Class Scoring (FCS); and Maxlink; in a test scenario of valproicacid (VPA)-treated mice.

The Kleisli query system as a backbone for bioinformatics data integration and analysis,Jing Chen; S Chung; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Kleisli is a data transformation and integration system that can be used for anyapplication where the data is typed. It has proven to be especially useful for bioinformaticsapplications. It extends the conventional at relational data model supported by the querylanguage SQL to a complex object data model supported by a\nested-relationalized" versionof SQL called sSQL. It also opens up the closed nature of commercial relational datamanagement systems to an easily extensible system that performs complex transformationson autonomous data sources that are heterogeneous and geographically dispersed.

On impossibility of decremental recomputation of recursive queries in relational calculus and SQL,Guozhu Dong; Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We study the problem of maintaining recursively-de ned views; such as thetransitive closure of a relation; in traditional relational languages that do not have recursionmechanisms. In particular; we show that the transitive closure cannot be maintained inrelational calculus under deletion of edges. We use new proof techniques to show thisresult. These proof techniques generalize to other languages; for example; to the languagefor nested relations that also contains a number of aggregate functions. Such a language isconsidered in this paper as a theoretical reconstruction of SQL. Our proof techniques alsogeneralize to other recursive queries. Consequently; we show that a number of recursivequeries cannot be maintained in an SQL-like language. We show that this continues to betrue in the presence of certain auxiliary relations. We also relate the complexity of …,5th International Workshop on Database Programming Languages; Gubbio; Italy; September 1995,1995,23
Enhancing the utility of Proteomics Signature Profiling (PSP) with Pathway Derived Subnets (PDSs); performance analysis and specialised ontologies,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Mengyuan Fan; Hong Sang Low; Marek Sergot; Limsoon Wong,Proteomics Signature Profiling (PSP) is a novel hit-rate based method that proved useful inresolving consistency and coverage issues in proteomics.

Supervised maximum-likelihood weighting of composite protein networks for complex prediction,Chern Han Yong; Guimei Liu; Hon Nian Chua; Limsoon Wong,Protein complexes participate in many important cellular functions; so finding the set ofexistent complexes is essential for understanding the organization and regulation ofprocesses in the cell. With the availability of large amounts of high-throughput protein-protein interaction (PPI) data; many algorithms have been proposed to discover proteincomplexes from PPI networks. However; such approaches are hindered by the high rate ofnoise in high-throughput PPI data; including spurious and missing interactions. Furthermore;many transient interactions are detected between proteins that are not from the samecomplex; while not all proteins from the same complex may actually interact. As a result;predicted complexes often do not match true complexes well; and many true complexes goundetected. We address these challenges by integrating PPI data with other …,BMC Systems Biology,2012,22
Mining Iterative Generators and Representative Rules for Software Specification Discovery,David Lo; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong; Siau-Cheng Khoo,Billions of dollars are spent annually on software-related cost. It is estimated that up to 45percent of software cost is due to the difficulty in understanding existing systems whenperforming maintenance tasks (ie; adding features; removing bugs; etc.). One of the rootcauses is that software products often come with poor; incomplete; or even without anydocumented specifications. In an effort to improve program understanding; Lo et al. haveproposed iterative pattern mining which outputs patterns that are repeated frequently withina program trace; or across multiple traces; or both. Frequent iterative patterns reflect frequentprogram behaviors that likely correspond to software specifications. To reduce the number ofpatterns and improve the efficiency of the algorithm; Lo et al. have also introduced miningclosed iterative patterns; ie; maximal patterns without any superpattern having the same …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,22
Exploring essential attributes for detecting microRNA precursors from background sequences,Yun Zheng; Wynne Hsu; Mong Lee; Limsoon Wong,Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The hairpin structure is a key characteristic of themicroRNAs precursors (pre-miRNAs). How to encode their hairpin structures is a critical stepto correctly detect the pre-miRNAs from background sequences; ie; pseudo miRNAprecursors. In this paper; we have proposed to encode the hairpin structures of the pre-miRNA with a set of features; which captures both the global and local structurecharacteristics of the pre-miRNAs. Furthermore; we find that four essential attributes arediscriminatory for classifying human pre-miRNAs and background sequences with aninformation theory approach. The experimental results show that the number of conservedessential attributes decreases when the phylogenetic distance between the species …,2006 VLDB Workshop on Data Mining in Bioinformatics; Seoul; Korea; September 2006,2006,21
On representation and querying incomplete information in databases with bags,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We extend the approach to representation of partial information based on orderingson objects from sets to multisets. We characterize orderings arising under closed-and open-world assumptions and analyze their complexity. In contrast to the set case; where orderingsare first-order definable and are thus expressible in standard database query languages; theorderings on bags are not expressible in standard bag languages. We give an example of aquery on nested relations whose inexpressibility in the extension of relational algebra tonested objects cannot be proved by reduction to the first-order case.,Information Processing Letters,1995,21
Networks in proteomics analysis of cancer,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Limsoon Wong,Proteomics provides direct biological information on proteins but is still a limited platform.Borrowing from genomics; its cancer-specific applications can be broadly categorized as (1)pure diagnostics;(2) biomarkers;(3) identification of root causes and (4) identification ofcancer-specific network rewirings. Biological networks capture complex relationshipsbetween proteins and provide an appropriate means of contextualization. While playingsignificantly larger roles; especially in 1 and 3; progress in proteomics-specific network-based methods is lagging as compared to genomics. Rapid hardware advances andimprovements in proteomic identification and quantification have given rise to much betterquality data alongside advent of new network-based analysis methods. However; a tighterintegration between analytics and hardware is still essential for network analysis to play …,Current Opinion in Biotechnology,2013,20
Discovery of protein complexes with core-attachment structures from TAP data,Min Wu; Xiao-li Li; Chee-Keong Kwoh; See-Kiong Ng; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Many cellular functions involve protein complexes that are formed by multipleinteracting proteins. Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) is a popular experimental method fordetecting such multi-protein interactions. However; current computational methods thatpredict protein complexes from TAP data require converting the co-complex relationships inTAP data into binary interactions. The resulting pairwise protein-protein interaction (PPI)network is then mined for densely connected regions that are identified as putative proteincomplexes. Converting the TAP data into PPI data not only introduces errors but also losesuseful information about the underlying multi-protein relationships that can be exploited todetect the internal organization (ie; core-attachment structures) of protein complexes. In thisarticle; we propose a method called CACHET that detects protein complexes with C ore-A …,Journal of Computational Biology,2012,20
Efficient mining of distance‐based subspace clusters,Guimei Liu; Kelvin Sim; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Traditional similarity measurements often become meaningless when dimensionsof datasets increase. Subspace clustering has been proposed to find clusters embedded insubspaces of high-dimensional datasets. Many existing algorithms use a grid-basedapproach to partition the data space into nonoverlapping rectangle cells; and then identifyconnected dense cells as clusters. The rigid boundaries of the grid-based approach maycause a real cluster to be divided into several small clusters. In this paper; we propose touse a sliding-window approach to partition the dimensions to preserve significant clusters.We call this model nCluster model. The sliding-window approach generates more bins thanthe grid-based approach; thus it incurs higher mining cost. We develop a deterministicalgorithm; called MaxnCluster; to mine nClusters efficiently. MaxnCluster uses several …,Statistical Analysis and Data Mining: The ASA Data Science Journal,2009,20

The functional guts of the Kleisli query system,Limsoon Wong,Abstract Kleisli is a modern data integration system that has made a significant impact onbioinformatics data integration. The primary query language provided by Kleisli is calledCPL; which is a functional query language whose surface syntax is based on thecomprehension syntax. Kleisli is itself implemented using the functional language SML. Thispaper describes the influence of functional programming research that benefits the Kleislisystem; especially the less obvious ones at the implementation level.,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,2000,20
Efficient mining of frequent XML query patterns with repeating-siblings,Liang Huai Yang; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Decai Huang; Limsoon Wong,Abstract A recent approach to improve the performance of XML query evaluation is to cachethe query results of frequent query patterns. Unfortunately; discovering these frequent querypatterns is an expensive operation. In this paper; we develop a two-pass mining algorithm2PXMiner that guarantees the discovery of frequent query patterns by scanning thedatabase at most twice. By exploiting a transaction summary data structure; and anenumeration tree; we are able to determine the upper bounds of the frequencies of thecandidate patterns; and to quickly prune away the infrequent patterns. We also design anindex to trace the repeating candidate subtrees generated by sibling repetition; thusavoiding redundant computations. Experiments results indicate that 2PXMiner is bothefficient and scalable.,Information and Software Technology,2008,19

Inferring synthetic lethal interactions from mutual exclusivity of genetic events in cancer,Sriganesh Srihari; Jitin Singla; Limsoon Wong; Mark A Ragan,Synthetic lethality (SL) refers to the genetic interaction between two or more genes whereonly their co-alteration (eg by mutations; amplifications or deletions) results in cell death. Inrecent years; SL has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer: bytargeting the SL partners of altered genes in cancer cells; these cells can be selectivelykilled while sparing the normal cells. Consequently; a number of studies have attemptedprediction of SL interactions in human; a majority by extrapolating SL interactions inferredthrough large-scale screens in model organisms. However; these predicted SL interactionseither do not hold in human cells or do not include genes that are (frequently) altered inhuman cancers; and are therefore not attractive in the context of cancer therapy. Here; wedevelop a computational approach to infer SL interactions directly from frequently altered …,Biology Direct,2015,18
An approach to identifying drug resistance associated mutations in bacterial strains,Michal Wozniak; Jerzy Tiuryn; Limsoon Wong,Drug resistance in bacterial pathogens is an increasing problem; which stimulates research.However; our understanding of drug resistance mechanisms remains incomplete.Fortunately; the fast-growing number of fully sequenced bacterial strains now enables us todevelop new methods to identify mutations associated with drug resistance. We present anew comparative approach to identify genes and mutations that are likely to be associatedwith drug resistance mechanisms. In order to test the approach; we collected genotype andphenotype data of 100 fully sequenced strains of S. aureus and 10 commonly used drugs.Then; applying the method; we re-discovered the most common genetic determinants ofdrug resistance and identified some novel putative associations. Firstly; the collected datamay help other researchers to develop and verify similar techniques. Secondly; the …,BMC Genomics,2012,18
Towards exploratory hypothesis testing and analysis,Guimei Liu; Mengling Feng; Yue Wang; Limsoon Wong; See-Kiong Ng; Tzia Liang Mah; Edmund Jon Deoon Lee,Hypothesis testing is a well-established tool for scientific discovery. Conventional hypothesistesting is carried out in a hypothesis-driven manner. A scientist must first formulate ahypothesis based on his/her knowledge and experience; and then devise a variety ofexperiments to test it. Given the rapid growth of data; it has become virtually impossible for aperson to manually inspect all the data to find all the interesting hypotheses for testing. Inthis paper; we propose and develop a data-driven system for automatic hypothesis testingand analysis. We define a hypothesis as a comparison between two or more sub-populations. We find sub-populations for comparison using frequent pattern miningtechniques and then pair them up for statistical testing. We also generate additionalinformation for further analysis of the hypotheses that are deemed significant.

Decomposing PPI networks for complex discovery,Guimei Liu; Chern Han Yong; Hon Nian Chua; Limsoon Wong,Protein complexes are important for understanding principles of cellular organization andfunctions. With the availability of large amounts of high-throughput protein-proteininteractions (PPI); many algorithms have been proposed to discover protein complexes fromPPI networks. However; existing algorithms generally do not take into consideration the factthat not all the interactions in a PPI network take place at the same time. As a result;predicted complexes often contain many spuriously included proteins; precluding them frommatching true complexes. We propose two methods to tackle this problem:(1) Thelocalization GO term decomposition method: We utilize cellular component Gene Ontology(GO) terms to decompose PPI networks into several smaller networks such that the proteinsin each decomposed network are annotated with the same cellular component GO term …,4th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM); Hong Kong; December 2010,2010,18
Enabling more sophisticated gene expression analysis for understanding diseases and optimizing treatments,Donny Soh; Difeng Dong; Yike Guo; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We survey the progress in the analysis of gene expression data for the purposes ofdisease subtype diagnosis; new subtype discovery; and understanding of diseases andtreatment responses. We find existing works fall short on several issues: these works providelittle information on the interplay between selected genes; the collection of pathways thatcan be used; evaluated; and ranked against the observed expression data is limited; and acomprehensive set of rules for reasoning about relevant molecular events has not beencompiled and formalized. We thus envision an advanced integrated framework; and aredeveloping a system based on it; to provide biologically inspired solutions.

Incremental recomputation in local languages,Guozhu Dong; Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We study the problem of maintaining recursively defined views; such as thetransitive closure of a relation; in traditional relational languages that do not have recursionmechanisms. The main results of this paper are negative ones: we show that a certainproperty of query languages implies impossibility of such incremental maintenance. Theproperty we use is locality of queries; which is known to hold for relational calculus andvarious extensions; including those with grouping and aggregate constructs (essentially;plain SQL).,Information and Computation,2003,18
AssocExplorer: An association rule visualization system for exploratory data analysis,Guimei Liu; Andre Suchitra; Haojun Zhang; Mengling Feng; See-Kiong Ng; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We present a system called AssocExplorer to support exploratory data analysis viaassociation rule visualization and exploration. AssocExplorer is designed by following thevisual information-seeking mantra: overview first; zoom and filter; then details on demand. Iteffectively uses coloring to deliver information so that users can easily detect things that areinteresting to them. If users find a rule interesting; they can explore related rules for furtheranalysis; which allows users to find interesting phenomenon that are difficult to detect whenrules are examined separately. Our system also allows users to compare rules and inspectrules with similar item composition but different statistics so that the key factors thatcontribute to the difference can be isolated.,18th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2012,17
Protein interactome analysis for countering pathogen drug resistance,Limsoon Wong; Guimei Liu,Abstract Drug-resistant varieties of pathogens are now a recognized global threat. Insightsinto the routes for drug resistance in these pathogens are critical for developing moreeffective antibacterial drugs. A systems-level analysis of the genes; proteins; andinteractions involved is an important step to gaining such insights. This paper discussessome of the computational challenges that must be surmounted to enable such an analysis;viz.; unreliability of bacterial interactome maps; paucity of bacterial interactome maps; andidentification of pathways to bacterial drug resistance.,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2010,17
CPS-tree: A compact partitioned suffix tree for disk-based indexing on large genome sequences,Swee-Seong Wong; Wing-Kin Sung; Limsoon Wong,Suffix tree is an important data structure for indexing a long sequence (like a genomesequence) or a concatenation of sequences. It finds many applications in practice;especially in the domain of bioinformatics. Suffix tree allows for efficient pattern search withtime independent of the sequence length. However; the performance of disk-based suffixtree is a concern as it is slowed down significantly by poor localized access resulting in high10 disk access. The focus of this paper is to design an IO-efficient and compact partitionedsuffix tree representation (CPS-tree) on disk. We show that representing suffix tree usingCPS-tree has several advantages. First; our representation allows us to visit any node in thesuffix tree by accessing at most log n pages of the tree where n is the length of thesequence. Second; our storage scheme improves the access pattern and reduces the …,23rd IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE); Istanbul; Turkey; April 2007,2007,17
Stringent DDI-based Prediction of H. sapiens-M. tuberculosis H37Rv Protein-Protein Interactions,Hufeng Zhou; Javad Rezaei; Willy Hugo; Shangzhi Gao; Jingjing Jin; Mengyuan Fan; Chern-Han Yong; Michal Wozniak; Limsoon Wong,H. sapiens-M. tuberculosis H37Rv protein-protein interaction (PPI) data are very importantinformation to illuminate the infection mechanism of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. But current H.sapiens-M. tuberculosis H37Rv PPI data are very scarce. This seriously limits the study ofthe interaction between this important pathogen and its host H. sapiens. Computationalprediction of H. sapiens-M. tuberculosis H37Rv PPIs is an important strategy to fill in the gap.Domain-domain interaction (DDI) based prediction is one of the frequently usedcomputational approaches in predicting both intra-species and inter-species PPIs. However;the performance of DDI-based host-pathogen PPI prediction has been rather limited. Wedevelop a stringent DDI-based prediction approach with emphasis on (i) differencesbetween the specific domain sequences on annotated regions of proteins under the same …,BMC Systems Biology,2013,16
Integrative toxicoproteomics implicates impaired mitochondrial glutathione import as off-target effect of troglitazone,Yie Hou Lee; Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Choon Keow Ng; Manfred Raida; Limsoon Wong; Qingsong Lin; Urs A Boelsterli; Maxey Ching Ming Chung,Troglitazone; a first-generation thiazolidinedione of antihyperglycaemic properties; waswithdrawn from the market due to unacceptable idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Despiteintensive research; the underlying mechanism of troglitazone-induced liver toxicity remainsunknown. Here we report the use of the Sod2+/–mouse model of silent mitochondrialoxidative-stress-based and quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to track themitochondrial proteome changes induced by physiologically relevant troglitazone doses. Byquantitative untargeted proteomics; we first globally profiled the Sod2+/–hepaticmitochondria proteome and found perturbations including GSH metabolism that enhancedthe toxicity of the normally nontoxic troglitazone.

A protein patent query system powered by Kleisli,Jing Chen; Limsoon Wong; Louxin Zhang,Kleisli [5] is an integration technology that is rather suitable in the bioinformatics arena.Many bioinformatics problems (1) require access to data sources that are highlyheterogeneous; geographically distributed; highly complex; constantly evolving; and high involume;(2) require solutions that involve multiple carefully sequenced steps; and (3) requireinformation to be passed smoothly between the steps. Kleisli is designed to handle theserequirements directly. In particular; Kleisli provides the high-level query language CPL [4]that can be used to express complicated transformation across multiple data sources in asimple way. We developed a prototype system to more effectively query protein patents. Thissystem uses Kleisli to tie together the following sources to answer queries on protein patentsthat are considerably more demanding than simple free-text search:(1) the protein section …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,16
Evaluating feature-selection stability in next-generation proteomics,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Limsoon Wong,Identifying reproducible yet relevant features is a major challenge in biological research.This is well documented in genomics data. Using a proposed set of three reliabilitybenchmarks; we find that this issue exists also in proteomics for commonly used feature-selection methods; eg t-test and recursive feature elimination. Moreover; due to high testvariability; selecting the top proteins based on p-value ranks—even when restricted to high-abundance proteins—does not improve reproducibility. Statistical testing based on networksare believed to be more robust; but this does not always hold true: The commonly usedhypergeometric enrichment that tests for enrichment of protein subnets performs abysmallydue to its dependence on unstable protein pre-selection steps. We demonstrate here for thefirst time the utility of a novel suite of network-based algorithms called ranked-based …,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,2016,15
Quantitative proteomics signature profiling based on network contextualization,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Tiannan Guo; Ruedi Aebersold; Limsoon Wong,We present a network-based method; namely quantitative proteomic signature profiling(qPSP) that improves the biological content of proteomic data by converting proteinexpressions into hit-rates in protein complexes. We demonstrate; using two clinicalproteomics datasets; that qPSP produces robust discrimination between phenotype classes(eg normal vs. disease) and uncovers phenotype-relevant protein complexes. Regardless ofacquisition paradigm; comparisons of qPSP against conventional methods (eg t-test orhypergeometric test) demonstrate that it produces more stable and consistent predictions;even at small sample size. We show that qPSP is theoretically robust to noise; and that thisrobustness to noise is also observable in practice. Comparative analysis of hit-rates andprotein expressions in significant complexes reveals that hit-rates are a useful means of …,Biology Direct,2015,15
A quantum leap in the reproducibility; precision; and sensitivity of gene expression prole analysis even when sample size is extremely small,Kevin Lim; Zhenhua Li; Kwok Pui Choi; Limsoon Wong,Transcript-level quantification is often measured across two groups of patients to aid thediscovery of biomarkers and detection of biological mechanisms involving these biomarkers.Statistical tests lack power and false discovery rate is high when sample size is small. Yet;many experiments have very few samples (≤ 5). This creates the impetus for a method todiscover biomarkers and mechanisms under very small sample sizes. We present apowerful method; ESSNet; that is able to identify subnetworks consistently acrossindependent datasets of the same disease phenotypes even under very small sample sizes.The key idea of ESSNet is to fragment large pathways into smaller subnetworks andcompute a statistic that discriminates the subnetworks in two phenotypes. We do not greedilyselect genes to be included based on differential expression but rely on gene-expression …,Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,2015,15
Discovery of small protein complexes from PPI networks with size-specific supervised weighting.,C Yong; Osamu Maruyama; Limsoon Wong,The prediction of small complexes (consisting of two or three distinct proteins) is animportant and challenging subtask in protein complex prediction from protein-proteininteraction (PPI) networks. The prediction of small complexes is especially susceptible tonoise (missing or spurious interactions) in the PPI network; while smaller groups of proteinsare likelier to take on topological characteristics of real complexes by chance. We propose atwo-stage approach; SSS and Extract; for discovering small complexes. First; the PPInetwork is weighted by size-specific supervised weighting (SSS); which integratesheterogeneous data and their topological features with an overall topological isolatednessfeature. SSS uses a naive-Bayes maximum-likelihood model to weight the edges with twoposterior probabilities: that of being in a small complex; and of being in a large complex …,BMC Systems Biology,2014,15
A flexible approach to finding representative pattern sets,Guimei Liu; Haojun Zhang; Limsoon Wong,Frequent pattern mining often produces an enormous number of frequent patterns; whichimposes a great challenge on visualizing; understanding and further analysis of thegenerated patterns. This calls for finding a small number of representative patterns to bestapproximate all other patterns. In this paper; we develop an algorithm called MinRPset tofind a minimum representative pattern set with error guarantee. MinRPset produces thesmallest solution that we can possibly have in practice under the given problem setting; andit takes a reasonable amount of time to finish when the number of frequent closed patterns isbelow one million. MinRPset is very space-consuming and time-consuming on some densedatasets when the number of frequent closed patterns is large. To solve this problem; wepropose another algorithm called FlexRPset; which provides one extra parameter K to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,15
Detection of outlier residues for improving interface prediction in protein heterocomplexes,Peng Chen; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,Abstract Sequence-based understanding and identification of protein binding interfaces is achallenging research topic due to the complexity in protein systems and the imbalanceddistribution between interface and noninterface residues. This paper presents an outlierdetection idea to address the redundancy problem in protein interaction data. The cleanedtraining data are then used for improving the prediction performance. We use three novelmeasures to describe the extent a residue is considered as an outlier in comparison to theother residues: the distance of a residue instance from the center instance of all residueinstances of the same class label (Dist); the probability of the class label of the residueinstance (PCL); and the importance of within-class and between-class (IWB) residueinstances. Outlier scores are computed by integrating the three factors; instances with a …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB),2012,15

Lower bounds for invariant queries in logics with counting,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We study the expressive power of counting logics in the presence of auxiliaryrelations such as orders and preorders. The simplest such logic is the first-order logic withcounting. This logic captures the complexity class TC 0 over ordered structures. We alsoconsider first-order logic with arbitrary unary quantifiers and with infinitary extensions. Westart by giving a simple direct proof that first-order logic with counting; in the presence of pre-orders that are almost-everywhere linear orders; cannot express the transitive closure of abinary relation. The proof is based on locality of formulae. We then show that the techniquecannot be extended to linear orders. We further show that this result does not say anythingabout the power of invariant queries in first-order logic with counting vs. the class TC 0; inthe presence of these preorders. In the second part of the paper; we prove a separation …,Theoretical Computer Science,2002,15
B-cell epitope prediction through a graph model,Liang Zhao; Limsoon Wong; Lanyuan Lu; Steven C. H. Hoi; Jinyan Li,Prediction of B-cell epitopes from antigens is useful to understand the immune basis ofantibody-antigen recognition; and is helpful in vaccine design and drug development.Tremendous efforts have been devoted to this long-studied problem; however; existingmethods have at least two common limitations. One is that they only favor prediction of thoseepitopes with protrusive conformations; but show poor performance in dealing with planarepitopes. The other limit is that they predict all of the antigenic residues of an antigen asbelonging to one single epitope even when multiple non-overlapping epitopes of an antigenexist. In this paper; we propose to divide an antigen surface graph into subgraphs by using aMarkov Clustering algorithm; and then we construct a classifier to distinguish thesesubgraphs as epitope or non-epitope subgraphs. This classifier is then taken to predict …,BMC Bioinformatics,2012,14

However there is a lack of quantitative studies onperformance of the combination of individual interventions under different temporal settings.Methodology/Principal Findings To better understand the problem; we develop an individual-based simulation model running on top of contact networks based on real-life contact data inSingapore. We model and evaluate the spread of influenza epidemic with interventionstrategies of workforce shift and its combination with school closure; and examine theimpacts of temporal factors; namely the trigger threshold and the duration of an intervention.By comparing simulation results for intervention scenarios with different temporal factors; wefind that combined interventions do not always outperform individual interventions and …,PLoS ONE,2012,14
The role of miRNAs in complex formation and control,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Hirotaka Oikawa; Judy Chia Ghee Sng; Marek Sergot; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Summary: microRibonucleic acid (miRNAs) are small regulatory molecules that actby mRNA degradation or via translational repression. Although many miRNAs areubiquitously expressed; a small subset have differential expression patterns that may giverise to tissue-specific complexes. Motivation: This work studies gene targeting patternsamongst miRNAs with differential expression profiles; and links this to control and regulationof protein complexes. Results: We find that; when a pair of miRNAs are not expressed in thesame tissues; there is a higher tendency for them to target the direct partners of the samehub proteins. At the same time; they also avoid targeting the same set of hub-spokes.Moreover; the complexes corresponding to these hub-spokes tend to be specific andnonoverlapping. This suggests that the effect of miRNAs on the formation of complexes is …,Bioinformatics,2011,14
Unary quantifiers; transitive closure; and relations of large degree,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract This paper studies expressivity bounds for extensions of first-order logic withcounting and unary quantifiers in the presence of relations of large degree. There areseveral motivations for this work. First; it is known that first-order logic with countingquantifiers captures uniform TC° over ordered structures. Thus; proving expressivity boundsfor first-order with counting can be seen as an attempt to show TC°⊂≠ DLOG usingtechniques of descriptive complexity. Second; the presence of auxiliary built-in relations (eg;order; successor) is known to make a big impact on expressivity results in finite-model theoryand database theory. Our goal is to extend techniques from “pure” setting to that of auxiliaryrelations. Until now; all known results on the limitations of expressive power of the countingand unary-quantifier extensions of first-order logic dealt with auxiliary relations of “small” …,15th Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science; Paris; France; February 1998,1998,14
Why batch effects matter in omics data; and how to avoid them,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Wei Wang; Limsoon Wong,Effective integration and analysis of new high-throughput data; especially gene-expressionand proteomic-profiling data; are expected to deliver novel clinical insights and therapeuticoptions. Unfortunately; technical heterogeneity or batch effects (different experiment times;handlers; reagent lots; etc.) have proven challenging. Although batch effect-correctionalgorithms (BECAs) exist; we know little about effective batch-effect mitigation: even now;new batch effect-associated problems are emerging. These include false effects due tomisapplying BECAs and positive bias during model evaluations. Depending on the choice ofalgorithm and experimental set-up; biological heterogeneity can be mistaken for batcheffects and wrongfully removed.

Improved statistical model checking methods for pathways analysis,Chuan Hock Koh; Sucheendra K Palaniappan; PS Thiagarajan; Limsoon Wong,Statistical model checking techniques have been shown to be effective for approximatemodel checking on large stochastic systems; where explicit representation of the state spaceis impractical. Importantly; these techniques ensure the validity of results with statisticalguarantees on errors. There is an increasing interest in these classes of algorithms incomputational systems biology since analysis using traditional model checking techniquesdoes not scale well. In this context; we present two improvements to existing statistical modelchecking algorithms. Firstly; we construct an algorithm which removes the need of the userto define the indifference region; a critical parameter in previous sequential hypothesistesting algorithms. Secondly; we extend the algorithm to account for the case when theremay be a limit on the computational resources that can be spent on verifying a property; ie …,BMC Bioinformatics,2012,13
Temporal Factors in School Closure Policy for Mitigating the Spread of Influenza,Tianyou Zhang; Xiuju Fu; Chee Keong Kwoh; Gaoxi Xiao; Limsoon Wong; Stefan Ma; Harold Soh; Gary Kee Khoon Lee; Terence Hung; Michael Lees,Abstract Is school closure effective in mitigating influenza outbreaks? For Singapore; wedeveloped an individual-based simulation model using real-life contact data. We evaluatedthe impacts of temporal factors–trigger threshold and duration–on the effectiveness of schoolclosure as a mitigation policy. We found an upper bound of the duration of school closure;where further extension beyond which will not bring additional benefits to suppressing theattack rate and peak incidence. For school closure with a relatively short duration (< 6weeks); it is more effective to start closure after a relatively longer delay from the first day ofinfection; if the duration of school closure is long (> 6 weeks); however; it is better to start itas early as reasonable. Our studies reveal the critical importance of timing in school closure;especially in cost-cautious situations. Our studies also demonstrate the great potential of …,Journal of Public Health Policy,2011,13
A Probabilistic Graph‐Theoretic Approach to Integrate Multiple Predictions for the Protein–Protein Subnetwork Prediction Challenge,Hon Nian Chua; Willy Hugo; Guimei Liu; Xiaoli Li; Limsoon Wong; See‐Kiong Ng,Abstract The protein–protein subnetwork prediction challenge presented at the 2ndDialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM2) conference is animportant computational problem essential to proteomic research. Given a set of proteinsfrom the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) genome; the task is to rank all possibleinteractions between the proteins from the most likely to the least likely. To tackle this task;we adopt a graph-based strategy to combine multiple sources of biological data andcomputational predictions. Using training and testing sets extracted from existing yeastprotein–protein interactions; we evaluate our method and show that it can produce betterpredictions than any of the individual data sources. This technique is then used to produceour entry for the protein–protein subnetwork prediction challenge.,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2009,13
Positive borders or negative borders: How to make lossless generator-based representations concise,Guimei Liu; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong; Wynne Hsu,Abstract A complete set of frequent itemsets can get undesirably large due to redundancy.Several representations have been proposed to eliminate the redundancy. Existinggenerator based representations rely on a negative border to make the representationlossless. However; negative borders of generators are often very large. The number ofitemsets on a negative border sometimes even exceeds the total number of frequentitemsets. In this paper; we propose to use a positive border together with frequentgenerators to form a lossless representation. A set of frequent generators plus its positiveborder is always no larger than the corresponding complete set of frequent itemsets; thus itis a true concise representation. The generalized form of this representation is alsoproposed.

Data mining techniques for the practical bioinformatician,Jinyan Li; Huiqing Liu; Anthony Tung; Limsoon Wong,Abstract The use of computing to organize; manage; and analyse biological and clinical datahas become an important element of biology and medical research. In the 1990s; largequantities of DNA sequence data were generated by the Human Genome Project and othergenome sequencing efforts. Computing projects in algorithms; software; and databaseswere crucial in the automated assembly and analysis of the genomic data. In the 2000s; weenter the so-called post-genome era. Many genomes have already been completelysequenced. Genome research migrates from raw data generation into scientific knowledgediscovery. Computing shifts correspondingly from managing and integrating sequencedatabases to discovering knowledge from such biological data.

Fast filter-and-refine algorithms for subsequence selection,Beng Chin Ooi; Hwee Hwa Pang; Hao Wang; Limsoon Wong; Cui Yu,Large sequence databases; such as protein; DNA and gene sequences in biology; arebecoming increasingly common. An important operation on a sequence database isapproximate subsequence matching; where all subsequences that are within some distancefrom a given query string are retrieved. This paper proposes a filter-and-refine algorithm thatenables efficient approximate subsequence matching in large DNA sequence databases. Itemploys a bitmap indexing structure to condense and encode each data sequence into ashorter index sequence. During query processing; the bitmap index is used to filter out mostof the irrelevant subsequences; and false positives are removed in the final refinement step.Analytical and experimental studies show that the proposed strategy is capable of reducingresponse time substantially while incurring only a small space overhead.,International Data Engineering and Applications Symposium (IDEAS); Edmonton; Canada; July 2002,2002,13
The Collection Programming Language,Limsoon Wong,Based on some of the ideas described in 6]; I have built a prototype query system calledKleisli.(See The Kleisli Query System Reference Manual.) The system is designed as adatabase engine to be connected to the host programming language ML 23] via a collectionof libraries of routines. These routines are parameterized for more open and better control sothat expert users do not have to resort to wily evasion of restriction in their quest forperformance.(There is strong evidence 29] that experts demonstrate a canny persistence inuncovering necessary detail to satisfy their concern for performance.) I have included animplementation of a high-level query language; for non-expert users; called CPL with theprototype. CPL stands for Collection Programming Language.

Advancing clinical proteomics via analysis based on biological complexes: A tale of five paradigms,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Limsoon Wong,Despite advances in proteomic technologies; idiosyncratic data issues; for example;incomplete coverage and inconsistency; resulting in large data holes; persist. Moreover;because of naïve reliance on statistical testing and its accompanying p values; differentialprotein signatures identified from such proteomics data have little diagnostic power. Thus;deploying conventional analytics on proteomics data is insufficient for identifying novel drugtargets or precise yet sensitive biomarkers. Complex-based analysis is a new analyticalapproach that has potential to resolve these issues but requires formalization. We categorizecomplex-based analysis into five method classes or paradigms and propose an even-handed yet comprehensive evaluation rubric based on both simulated and real data. Thefirst four paradigms are well represented in the literature. The fifth and newest paradigm …,Journal of proteome research,2016,12
From the static interactome to dynamic protein complexes: Three challenges,Chern Han Yong; Limsoon Wong,Protein interactions and complexes behave in a dynamic fashion; but this dynamism is notcaptured by interaction screening technologies; and not preserved in protein–proteininteraction (PPI) networks. The analysis of static interaction data to derive dynamic proteincomplexes leads to several challenges; of which we identify three. First; many proteinsparticipate in multiple complexes; leading to overlapping complexes embedded withinhighly-connected regions of the PPI network. This makes it difficult to accurately delimit theboundaries of such complexes. Second; many condition-and location-specific PPIs are notdetected; leading to sparsely-connected complexes that cannot be picked out by clusteringalgorithms. Third; the majority of complexes are small complexes (made up of two or threeproteins); which are extra sensitive to the effects of extraneous edges and missing co …,Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,2015,12
A network-based maximum link approach towards MS identifies potentially important roles for undetected ARRB1/2 and ACTB in liver cancer progression,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Yie Hou Lee; Zubaidah M Ramdzan; Maxey CM Chung; Limsoon Wong; Marek J Sergot,Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the deadliest of cancers and has a complexetiology. Proteomics analysis using iTRAQ provides a direct way to analyse perturbations inprotein expression during HCC progression from early-to late-stage but suffers fromconsistency and coverage issues. Appropriate use of network-based analytical methods canhelp to overcome these issues. We built an integrated and comprehensive Protein-ProteinInteraction Network (PPIN) by merging several major databases. Additionally; the networkwas filtered for GO coherent edges. Significantly differential genes (seeds) were selectedfrom iTRAQ data and mapped onto this network. Undetected proteins linked to seeds (linkedproteins) were identified and functionally characterised.

Recognition of polyadenylation sites from Arabidopsis genomic sequences,Chuan Hock Koh; Limsoon Wong,Abstract A polyadenine tail is found at the 3'end of nearly every fully processed eukaryoticmRNA and has been suggested to influence virtually all aspects of mRNA metabolism. Theability to predict polyadenylation site will allow us to define gene boundaries; predict numberof genes present in a particular gene locus and perhaps better understand mRNAmetabolism. To this end; we built an arabidopsis polyadenylation prediction model. Theprediction model uses a machine learning method which consists of four sequential steps:feature generation; feature selection; feature integration and cascade classifier. We havetested our model on public datasets and achieved more than 97% sensitivity and specificity.We have also directly compared with another arabidopsis prediction model; PASS 1.0; andhave achieved better results.,18th International Conference on Genome Informatics (GIW);  Singapore; 3-5 December 2007,2007,12
The use of emerging patterns in the analysis of gene expression profiles for the diagnosis and understanding of diseases,Guozhu Dong; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Microarrays are glass surfaces bearing arrays of DNA fragments at discrete addresses.These DNA fragments on the microarray are hybridized to a complex sample of fluorescentlylabeled DNA or RNA in solution. After a washing and staining process; the addresses atwhich hybridization has taken place can be determined and the expression level of thecorresponding genes derived. Today; a single microarray can contain several tens ofthousands of DNA fragments. Thus; microarrays are a technology for simultaneouslyprofiling the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes in a patient sample. It is hopefulthat better diagnosis methods and better understanding of disease mechanisms can bederived from a careful analysis of microarray measurements of gene expression profiles.This chapter discusses several types of analysis of such gene expression profiles using a …,*,2005,12

CEO: A Cloud Epistasis cOmputing model in GWAS,Zhengkui Wang; Yue Wang; Kian-Lee Tan; Limsoon Wong; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract—The 1000 Genome project has made available a large number of singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However;the large number of SNPs has also rendered the discovery of epistatic interactions of SNPscomputationally expensive. Parallelizing the computation offers a promising solution. In thispaper; we propose a cloud-based epistasis computing (CEO) model that examines all k-locus SNPs combinations to find statistically significant epistatic interactions efficiently. OurCEO model uses the MapReduce framework which can be executed both on user's ownclusters or on a cloud environment. Our cloud-based solution offers elastic computingresources to users; and more importantly; makes our approach affordable and available toall end-users. We evaluate our CEO model on a cluster of more than 40 nodes. Our …,4th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM); Hong Kong; December 2010,2010,11

Solving the fragmentation problem of decision trees by discovering boundary emerging patterns,Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,The single coverage constraint discourages a decision tree to contain many significant rules.The loss of significant rules leads to a loss in accuracy. On the other hand; the fragmentationproblem causes a decision tree to contain too many minor rules. The presence of minorrules decreases the accuracy. We propose to use emerging patterns to solve theseproblems. In our approach; many globally significant rules can be discovered. Extensiveexpert. mental results on gene expression datasets show that our approach are moreaccurate than single C4. 5 trees; and are also better than bagged or boosted C4. 5 trees.,IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM); Maebashi City; Japan; December 2002,2002,11

Integrating networks and proteomics: Moving forward,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Limsoon Wong,Networks can resolve many analytical problems in proteomics; including incompletecoverage and inconsistency. Despite high expectations; network-related research inproteomics has experienced only modest growth. In practice; most current researchexamines non-quantitative usages; for example determining physical interactions amongproteins or contextualizing a differential protein list; rather than addressing practicalquantitative usages; for example predicting missing proteins or making sample-classpredictions. Moreover; many applications are irreproducible and are not widely adoptedowing to a lack of common standards; particularly evaluation criteria and gold-standarddatasets.

Design principles for clinical network-based proteomics,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Limsoon Wong,Integrating biological networks with proteomics is a tantalizing option for system-levelanalysis; for example it can help remove false-positives from proteomics data and improvecoverage by detecting false-negatives; as well as resolving inconsistent inter-sample proteinexpression due to biological heterogeneity. Yet; designing a robust network-based analysisstrategy on proteomics data is nontrivial. The issues include dealing with test set biascaused by; for example; inappropriate normalization procedure; devising appropriatebenchmarking criteria and formulating statistically robust feature-selection techniques.

Structural analysis of the hot spots in the binding between H1N1 HA and the 2D1 antibody: Do mutations of H1N1 from 1918 to 2009 affect much on this binding?,Qian Liu; Steven CH Hoi; Chinh TT Su; Zhenhua Li; Chee-Keong Kwoh; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,Abstract Motivation: Worldwide and substantial mortality caused by the 2009 H1N1 influenzaA has stimulated a new surge of research on H1N1 viruses. An epitope conservation hasbeen learned in the HA1 protein that allows antibodies to cross-neutralize both 1918 and2009 H1N1. However; few works have thoroughly studied the binding hot spots in those twoantigen–antibody interfaces which are responsible for the antibody cross-neutralization.Results: We apply predictive methods to identify binding hot spots at the epitope sites of theHA1 proteins and at the paratope sites of the 2D1 antibody. We find that the six mutations atthe HA1's epitope from 1918 to 2009 should not harm its binding to 2D1. Instead; the changeof binding free energy on the whole exhibits an increased tendency after these mutations;making the binding stronger. This is consistent with the observation that the 1918 H1N1 …,Bioinformatics,2011,10

Heterogeneous query optimization using maximal subqueries,Anne HH Ngu; Ling-Ling Yan; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We propose a query optimization strategy in a loosely coupled multidatabaseenvironment. The goal of our query optimization is to exploit both the global and the locallevels of optimization to reduce the overall cost of evaluating a query. This requires finding away to decompose a global query in the best possible way. We argue that finding maximalsub-queries in a global query is a way of ensuring that sub-queries sent to the local DBMSare in a form which can take advantage of local query optimization as well as reducing thenumber of queries required to be sent. This reduces the processing cost in a multidatabasesystem because sub-queries that are sent to the local databases have to be converted. Thelesser number of sub-queries implies less conversion cost.,3rd International Symposium on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA); Taejon; Korea; April 1993,1993,10

A Performance Study of Three Disk-based Structures for Indexing and Querying Frequent Itemsets,Guimei Liu; Andre Suchitra; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Frequent itemset mining is an important problem in the data mining area. Extensiveefforts have been devoted to developing efficient algorithms for mining frequent itemsets.However; not much attention is paid on managing the large collection of frequent itemsetsproduced by these algorithms for subsequent analysis and for user exploration. In thispaper; we study three structures for indexing and querying frequent itemsets: inverted files;signature files and CFP-tree. The first two structures have been widely used for indexinggeneral set-valued data. We make some modifications to make them more suitable forindexing frequent itemsets. The CFP-tree structure is specially designed for storing frequentitemsets. We add a pruning technique based on length-2 frequent itemsets to make it moreefficient for processing superset queries.

CAMBer: An approach to support comparative analysis of multiple bacterial strains,Michal Wozniak; Limsoon Wong; Jerzy Tiuryn,There is a large amount of inconsistency in gene structure annotations of bacterial strains.This inconsistency is a frustrating impedance to effective comparative genomic analysis ofbacterial strains in promising applications such as gaining insights into bacterial drugresistance. Here; we propose CAMBer as an approach to support comparative analysis ofmultiple bacterial strains. CAMBer produces what we called multigene families.

DBAC: A simple prediction method for protein binding hot spots based on burial levels and deeply buried atomic contacts,Zhenhua Li; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,A protein binding hot spot is a cluster of residues in the interface that are energeticallyimportant for the binding of the protein with its interaction partner. Identifying protein bindinghot spots can give useful information to protein engineering and drug design; and can alsodeepen our understanding of protein-protein interaction. These residues are usually buriedinside the interface with very low solvent accessible surface area (SASA). Thus SASA iswidely used as an outstanding feature in hot spot prediction by many computationalmethods. However; SASA is not capable of distinguishing slightly buried residues; of whichmost are non hot spots; and deeply buried ones that are usually inside a hot spot. Wepropose a new descriptor called “burial level” for characterizing residues; atoms and atomiccontacts. Specifically; burial level captures the depth the residues are buried.

Network proteomics on the other hand has to developfurther on two critical factors:(1) expanded data coverage and consistency; and (2) suitablereference network libraries; and data mining from them. Concerning (1) we discuss severalcontemporary themes that can improve data quality; which in turn will boost the outcome ofdownstream network analysis. For (2); we focus on network analysis developments;specifically; the need for context-specific networks and essential considerations for localizednetwork analysis.,*,2013,8

Datamining: Discovering information from bio-data,Limsoon Wong,This chapter is an introduction to what has come to be known as datamining and knowledgediscovery in the biomedical context. The major reason that datamining has attractedincreasing attention in the biomedical industry in recent years is due to the increasedavailability of a huge amount of biomedical data and the imminent need to turn such datainto useful information and knowledge. The knowledge gained can lead to improved drugtargets; improved diagnostics; and improved treatment plans. Datamining is the task ofdiscovering patterns from large amounts of potentially noisy data where the data can be keptin regular relational databases or other forms of information repositories such as the flat textfiles commonly used by biologists.

Finitely representable nested relations,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Advanced temporal and spatial applications require both the representation ofcomplex objects and the ability to finitely represent infinite relations. Representing such datarequires combining the constraint relational model (allowing finite representation of infiniteinformation) and either the nested relational or the object-oriented model (allowingrepresentation of complex objects). In this paper; we extend the nested relational calculus todeal with finitely representable relations. The aim of the language we propose; called frNRC; is to provide the right formal foundations to analyze nested constraint querylanguages; overcoming some limitations of already existing languages. As an example ofthe theoretical foundations of fr NRC; we show that it is effectively computable and has lowdata complexity.

In a paper that had not been widely circulatedin the database community; Remy presented in programming language context a constant-time implementation of the record projection operation that does not have such arequirement. This paper introduces his technique and suggests an improvement to histechnique in the context of database queries.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,8
Transcriptome and functional analysis reveals hybrid vigor for oil biosynthesis in oil palm,Jingjing Jin; Yanwei Sun; Jing Qu; Rahmadsyah; Chin-Huat Lim; Yuzer Alfiko; Nur Estya Bte Rahman; Antonius Suwanto; Genhua Yue; Limsoon Wong; Nam Hai Chua; Jian Ye,Abstract Oil palm is the most productive oil crop in the world and composes 36% of the worldproduction. However; the molecular mechanisms of hybrids vigor (or heterosis) betweenDura; Pisifera and their hybrid progeny Tenera has not yet been well understood. Here wecompared the temporal and spatial compositions of lipids and transcriptomes for two oilyielding organs mesocarp and endosperm from Dura; Pisifera and Tenera. Multiple lipidbiosynthesis pathways are highly enriched in all non-additive expression pattern inendosperm; while cytokinine biosynthesis and cell cycle pathways are highly enriched bothin endosperm and mesocarp. Compared with parental palms; the high oil content in Tenerawas associated with much higher transcript levels of EgWRI1; homolog of Arabidopsisthaliana WRINKLED1. Among 338 identified genes in lipid synthesis; 207 (61%) has …,Scientific Reports,2017,7
Prediction of problematic complexes from PPI networks: Sparse; embedded; and small complexes,Chern Han Yong; Limsoon Wong,The prediction of protein complexes from high-throughput protein-protein interaction (PPI)data remains an important challenge in bioinformatics. Three groups of complexes havebeen identified as problematic to discover. First; many complexes are sparsely connected inthe PPI network; and do not form dense clusters that can be derived by clustering algorithms.Second; many complexes are embedded within highly-connected regions of the PPInetwork; which makes it difficult to accurately delimit their boundaries. Third; manycomplexes are small (composed of two or three distinct proteins); so that traditionaltopological markers such as density are ineffective. We have previously proposed threeapproaches to address these challenges. First; Supervised Weighting of CompositeNetworks (SWC) integrates diverse data sources with supervised weighting; and …,Biology Direct,2015,7
Integrating water exclusion theory into ß contacts to predict binding free energy changes and binding hot spots,Qian Liu; Steven CH Hoi; Chee Keong Kwoh; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,Binding free energy and binding hot spots at protein-protein interfaces are two importantresearch areas for understanding protein interactions. Computational methods have beendeveloped previously for accurate prediction of binding free energy change upon mutationfor interfacial residues. However; a large number of interrupted and unimportant atomiccontacts are used in the training phase which caused accuracy loss. This work proposes anew method; β ACV ASA; to predict the change of binding free energy after alaninemutations. β ACV ASA integrates accessible surface area (ASA) and our newly defined βcontacts together into an atomic contact vector (ACV). A β contact between two atoms is adirect contact without being interrupted by any other atom between them. A β contact'spotential contribution to protein binding is also supposed to be inversely proportional to …,BMC Bioinformatics,2014,7
Structural and functional analysis of multi-interface domains,Liang Zhao; Steven CH Hoi; Limsoon Wong; Tobias Hamp; Jinyan Li,A multi-interface domain is a domain that can shape multiple and distinctive binding sites tocontact with many other domains; forming a hub in domain-domain interaction networks. Thefunctions played by the multiple interfaces are usually different; but there is no strict bijectionbetween the functions and interfaces as some subsets of the interfaces play the samefunction. This work applies graph theory and algorithms to discover fingerprints for themultiple interfaces of a domain and to establish associations between the interfaces andfunctions; based on a huge set of multi-interface proteins from PDB. We found that about40% of proteins have the multi-interface property; however the involved multi-interfacedomains account for only a tiny fraction (1.8%) of the total number of domains. The interfacesof these domains are distinguishable in terms of their fingerprints; indicating the functional …,PLoS ONE,2012,7
CMPF: Class-switching minimized pathfinding in metabolic networks,Kevin Lim; Limsoon Wong,The metabolic network is an aggregation of enzyme catalyzed reactions that converts onecompound to another. Paths in a metabolic network are a sequence of enzymes thatdescribe how a chemical compound of interest can be produced in a biological system. Asthe number of such paths is quite large; many methods have been developed to score pathsso that the k-shortest paths represent the set of paths that are biologically meaningful orefficient. However; these approaches do not consider whether the sequence of enzymes canbe manufactured in the same pathway/species/localization. As a result; a predictedsequence might consist of groups of enzymes that operate in distinct pathway/species/localization and may not truly reflect the events occurring within cell. We propose a pathweighting method CMPF (Class-switching Minimized Pathfinder) to search for routes in a …,BMC Bioinformatics,2012,7
Effects of fear factors in disease propagation,Yubo Wang; Gaoxi Xiao; Limsoon Wong; Xiuju Fu; Stefan Ma; Tee Hiang Cheng,Abstract Upon an outbreak of a dangerous infectious disease; people generally tend toreduce their contacts with others in fear of getting infected. Such typical actions apparentlyhelp slow down the spreading of infection. Thanks to today's broad public media coverage;the fear factor may even contribute to preventing an outbreak from happening. We aremotivated to study such effects by adopting a complex network approach. First we evaluatethe simple case where connections between individuals are randomly removed due to thefear factor. Then we consider a different case where each individual keeps at least a fewconnections after contact reduction. Such a case is arguably more realistic since people maychoose to keep a few social contacts; eg; with their family members and closest friends; atany cost. Finally; a study is conducted on the case where connection removals are carried …,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,2011,7

Protein complex-based analysis is resistant to the obfuscating consequences of batch effects---a case study in clinical proteomics,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Limsoon Wong,In proteomics; batch effects are technical sources of variation that confounds properanalysis; preventing effective deployment in clinical and translational research. Usingsimulated and real data; we demonstrate existing batch effect-correction methods do notalways eradicate all batch effects. Worse still; they may alter data integrity; and introducefalse positives. Moreover; although Principal component analysis (PCA) is commonly usedfor detecting batch effects. The principal components (PCs) themselves may be used asdifferential features; from which relevant differential proteins may be effectively traced. Batcheffect are removable by identifying PCs highly correlated with batch but not class effect.However; neither PC-based nor existing batch effect-correction methods address well subtlebatch effects; which are difficult to eradicate; and involve data transformation and/or …,BMC Genomics,2017,6
Valproic acid mediates miR-124 to down-regulate a novel protein target; GNAI1,Hirotaka Oikawa; Wilson WB Goh; Vania KJ Lim; Limsoon Wong; Judy CG Sng,Abstract Valproic acid (VPA) is an anti-convulsant drug that is recently shown to haveneuroregenerative therapeutic actions. In this study; we investigate the underlying molecularmechanism of VPA and its effects on Bdnf transcription through microRNAs (miRNAs) andtheir corresponding target proteins. Using in silico algorithms; we predicted from our miRNAmicroarray and iTRAQ data that miR-124 is likely to target at guanine nucleotide bindingprotein alpha inhibitor 1 (GNAI1); an adenylate cyclase inhibitor. With the reduction of GNAI1mediated by VPA; the cAMP is enhanced to increase Bdnf expression. The levels of GNAI1protein and Bdnf mRNA can be manipulated with either miR-124 mimic or inhibitor. Insummary; we have identified a novel molecular mechanism of VPA that induces miR-124 torepress GNAI1.

Comparative Transcriptomics Unravel Biochemical Specialization of Leaf Tissues of Stevia for Diterpenoid Production,Mi Jung Kim; Jingjing Jin; Junshi Zheng; Limsoon Wong; Nam-Hai Chua; In-Cheol Jang,Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) produces not only a group of diterpenoid glycosides known assteviol glycosides (SGs); but also other labdane-type diterpenoids that may be spatiallyseparated from SGs. However; their biosynthetic routes and spatial distribution in leaftissues have not yet been elucidated. Here; we integrate metabolome and transcriptomeanalyses of Stevia to explore the biosynthetic capacity of leaf tissues for diterpenoidmetabolism. Tissue-specific chemical analyses confirmed that SGs were accumulated in leafcells but not in trichomes. On the other hand; Stevia leaf trichomes stored other labdane-typediterpenoids such as oxomanoyl oxide and agatholic acid. RNA sequencing analyses fromtwo different tissues of Stevia provided a comprehensive overview of dynamic metabolicactivities in trichomes and leaf without trichomes.

Hoi; Zhenhua Li; Limsoon Wong; Hung Nguyen; Jinyan Li,Abstract Coupling graphs are newly introduced in this paper to meet many applicationneeds particularly in the field of bioinformatics. A coupling graph is a two-layer graphcomplex; in which each node from one layer of the graph complex has at least oneconnection with the nodes in the other layer; and vice versa. The coupling graph model issufficiently powerful to capture strong and inherent associations between subgraph pairs incomplicated applications. The focus of this paper is on mining algorithms of frequentcoupling subgraphs and bioinformatics application. Although existing frequent subgraphmining algorithms are competent to identify frequent subgraphs from a graph database; theyperform poorly on frequent coupling subgraph mining because they generate manyirrelevant subgraphs.

A database of annotated promoters of genes associated with common respiratory and related diseases.,Rajesh Chowdhary; Sin Lam Tan; Giulio Pavesi; Jingjing Jin; Difeng Dong; Sameer K Mathur; Arthur Burkart; Vipin Narang; Ingrid Glurich; Benjamin A Raby; Scott T Weiss; Limsoon Wong; Jun S Liu; Vladimir B Bajic,Many genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of common respiratory and relateddiseases (RRDs); yet the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Differential geneexpression patterns in diseased and healthy individuals suggest that RRDs affect or areaffected by modified transcription regulation programs. It is thus crucial to characterizeimplicated genes in terms of transcriptional regulation. For this purpose; we conducted apromoter analysis of genes associated with 11 common RRDs including allergic rhinitis;asthma; bronchiectasis; bronchiolitis; bronchitis; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;cystic fibrosis; emphysema; eczema; psoriasis; and urticaria; many of which are thought tobe genetically related.

Progressive dry-core-wet-rim hydration trend in a nested-ring topology of protein binding interfaces,Zhenhua Li; Ying He; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,Water is an integral part of protein complexes. It shapes protein binding sites by fillingcavities and it bridges local contacts by hydrogen bonds. However; water molecules areusually not included in protein interface models in the past; and few distribution profiles ofwater molecules in protein binding interfaces are known. In this work; we use a tripartiteprotein-water-protein interface model and a nested-ring atom re-organization method todetect hydration trends and patterns from an interface data set which involves immobilizedinterfacial water molecules. This data set consists of 206 obligate interfaces; 160 non-obligate interfaces; and 522 crystal packing contacts. The two types of biological interfacesare found to be drier than the crystal packing interfaces in our data; agreeable to a hydrationpattern reported earlier although the previous definition of immobilized water is pure …,BMC Bioinformatics,2012,6

Selection of patient samples and genes for outcome prediction,Huiqing Liu; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Gene expression profiles with clinical outcome data enable monitoring of diseaseprogression and prediction of patient survival at the molecular level. We present a newcomputational method for outcome prediction. Our idea is to use an informative subset oforiginal training samples. This subset consists of only short-term survivors who died within ashort period and long-term survivors who were still alive after a long follow-up time. Theseextreme training samples yield a clear platform to identify genes whose expression is relatedto survival. To find relevant genes; we combine two feature selection methods-entropymeasure and Wilcoxon rank sum test-so that a set of sharp discriminating features areidentified. The selected training samples and genes are then integrated by a support vectormachine to build a prediction model; by which each validation sample is assigned a …,IEEE Bioinformatics Proceedings (CSB2004); Stanford; CA; August 2004,2004,6
A graphical interface to genome multidatabases,Wang Chiew Tan; Ke Wang; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Formulating queries to access multiple databases can be a formidable taskespecially when many terms from various databases and complex constraints are involved.To specify a multidatabase query; the user usually has to search through documents forexact database terms and learn the multidatabase language. This report presents QUICK(QUery Interface to CPL-Kleisli); a graphical user interface to multiple databases. CPL(Collection Programming Language) is a high-level multidatabase language built on top ofan open query system Kleisli.

Some Relationships between the FOIES and Sigma-1-1 Arity Hierarchies,Guozhu Dong; Limsoon Wong,A first-order incremental evaluation system (foies) uses first-order queries to maintain adatabase view which is defined by a non-first-order query some auxiliary relations (views)may also need to be maintained similarly. In foies; monadic auxiliary relations were knownto be strictly weaker than binary ones however; it is open whether k-ary auxiliary relationsare strictly weaker than (k+ 1)-ary ones for k> 2 if we limit the arity of the input relations to beat most k.(In the full version of the PODS'95 paper DS95b] which will appear in JCSS; it isshown that the answer to this question is positive if we do not limit the arity of the inputrelations.) It appears hard to generalize the techniques used for current separation results tosolve the above problem. On the other hand; the arity hierarchy of 1 1 was shown to be strict.The purposes of this note are two folds: Firstly; we aim to explore the relationship …,Bulletin of the EATCS,1997,6
Visual Attention Model and Relevant Feedback based Image Retrieval,Zhijiang Li; Jiaxian Long; Chuan Dong,To improve the efficiency and accuracy of Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) for specificimages; a new method is presented in the paper. The method focuses on 3 key problems.Firstly; considering the impaction of saliency point near the attention focus; an improvedsaliency region extraction algorithm is proposed to locate object of interest more accurately.Then; the construction of Bag-of-Features (BoF) feature vector is improved by our visualattention model to extract features more effectively.

Supporting exploratory hypothesis testing and analysis,Guimei Liu; Haojun Zhang; Mengling Feng; Limsoon Wong; See-Kiong Ng,Abstract Conventional hypothesis testing is carried out in a hypothesis-driven manner. Ascientist must first formulate a hypothesis based on what he or she sees and then devise avariety of experiments to test it. Given the rapid growth of data; it has become virtuallyimpossible for a person to manually inspect all data to find all of the interesting hypothesesfor testing. In this article; we propose and develop a data-driven framework for automatichypothesis testing and analysis. We define a hypothesis as a comparison between two ormore subpopulations. We find subpopulations for comparison using frequent pattern miningtechniques and then pair them up for statistical hypothesis testing. We also generateadditional information for further analysis of the hypotheses that are deemed significant. Thenumber of hypotheses generated can be very large; and many of them are very similar …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2015,5
eCAMBer: Efficient support for large-scale comparative analysis of multiple bacterial strains,Michal Wozniak; Limsoon Wong; Jerzy Tiuryn,Inconsistencies are often observed in the genome annotations of bacterial strains. Moreover;these inconsistencies are often not reflected by sequence discrepancies; but are caused bywrongly annotated gene starts as well as mis-identified gene presence. Thus; tools areneeded for improving annotation consistency and accuracy among sets of bacterial straingenomes. We have developed eCAMBer; a tool for efficiently supporting comparativeanalysis of multiple bacterial strains within the same species. eCAMBer is a highly optimizedrevision of our earlier tool; CAMBer; scaling it up for significantly larger datasets comprisinghundreds of bacterial strains. eCAMBer works in two phases. First; it transfers geneannotations among all considered bacterial strains. In this phase; it also identifieshomologous gene families and annotation inconsistencies. Second; eCAMBer; tries to …,BMC Bioinformatics,2014,5
Using Biological Networks in Protein Function Prediction and Gene Expression Analysis,Limsoon Wong,Abstract While sequence homology search has been the main workhorse in protein functionprediction; it is not applicable to a significant portion of novel proteins that do not haveinformative homologues in sequence databases. Similarly; while statistical tests andlearning algorithms based purely on gene expression profiles have been popular foranalyzing disease samples; critical issues remain in the understanding of diseases basedon the differentially expressed genes suggested by these methods. In the past decade; alarge number of databases providing information on various types of biological networkshave become available. These databases make it possible to tackle these and otherbiological problems in novel ways.

Dragon Promoter Mapper (DPM): a Bayesian framework for modelling promoter structures,Rajesh Chowdhary; Sin Lam Tan; R Ayesha Ali; Brent Boerlage; Limsoon Wong; Vladimir B Bajic,Abstract Summary: Dragon Promoter Mapper (DPM) is a tool to model promoter structure ofco-regulated genes using methodology of Bayesian networks. DPM exploits an exhaustiveset of motif features (such as motif; its strand; the order of motif occurrence and mutualdistance between the adjacent motifs) and generates models from the target promotersequences; which may be used to (1) detect regions in a genomic sequence which aresimilar to the target promoters or (2) to classify other promoters as similar or not to the targetpromoter group. DPM can also be used for modelling of enhancers and silencers.Availability: Contact: vlad@ sanbi. ac. za Supplementary information: Manual for using DPMweb server is provided at,Bioinformatics,2006,5
Structural geography of the space of emerging patterns,Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Describing and capturing significant differences between two classes of data is animportant data mining and classification research topic. In this paper; we use emergingpatterns to describe these significant differences. Such a pattern occurs in one class ofsamples–its" home" class–with a high frequency but does not exist in the other class; so itcan be considered as a characteristic property of its home class. We call the collection of allsuch patterns a space. Beyond the space; there are patterns that occur in both of the classesor that do not occur in any of the two classes. Within the space; the most general and mostspecific patterns bound the other patterns in a lossless convex way. We decompose thespace into a terrace of pattern plateaus based on their frequency. We use the most generalpatterns to construct accurate classifiers. We also use these patterns in the bio-medical …,Intelligent Data Analysis,2005,5

A Conservative Property of a Nested Relational Query Language,Limsoon Wong,Abstract We proposed in [7] a nested relational calculus and a nested relational algebrabased on structural recursion [6; 5] and on monads [27; 16]. In this report; we describerelative set abstraction as our third nested relational query language. This query language issimilar to the well known list comprehension mechanism in functional programminglanguages such as Haskell [ll]; Miranda [24]; KRC [23]; etc. This language is equivalent toour earlier query languages both in terms of semantics and in terms of equational theories.This strong sense of equivalence allows our three query languages to be freely combinedinto a nested relational query language that is robust and user-friendly.,*,1992,5
Spectra-first feature analysis in clinical proteomics — A case study in renal cancer,Wilson Wen Bin GOH; Limsoon WONG,In proteomics; useful signal may be unobserved or lost due to the lack of confident peptide-spectral matches. Selection of differential spectra; followed by associative peptide/proteinmapping may be a complementary strategy for improving sensitivity andcomprehensiveness of analysis (spectra-first paradigm). This approach is complementary tothe standard approach where functional analysis is performed only on the finalized proteinlist assembled from identified peptides from the spectra (protein-first paradigm). Based on acase study of renal cancer; we introduce a simple spectra-binning approach; MZ-bin. Wedemonstrate that differential spectra feature selection using MZ-bin is class-discriminativeand can trace relevant proteins via spectra associative mapping. Moreover; proteinsidentified in this manner are more biologically coherent than those selected directly from …,Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,2016,4
Hi-Jack: A novel computational framework for pathway-based inference of host-pathogen interactions,Dimitrios Kleftogiannis; Limsoon Wong; John AC Archer; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Motivation: Pathogens infect their host and hijack the host machinery to producemore progeny pathogens. Obligate intracellular pathogens; in particular; require resourcesof the host to replicate. Therefore; infections by these pathogens lead to alterations in themetabolism of the host; shifting in favor of pathogen protein production. Some computationalidentification of mechanisms of host–pathogen interactions have been proposed; but itseems the problem has yet to be approached from the metabolite-hijacking angle. Results:We propose a novel computational framework; Hi-Jack; for inferring pathway-basedinteractions between a host and a pathogen that relies on the idea of metabolite hijacking.Hi-Jack searches metabolic network data from hosts and pathogens; and identifiescandidate reactions where hijacking occurs.

Embracing noise to improve cross-batch prediction accuracy,Chuan Hock Koh; Limsoon Wong,One important application of microarray in clinical settings is for constructing a diagnosis orprognosis model. Batch effects are a well-known obstacle in this type of applications.Recently; a prominent study was published on how batch effects removal techniques couldpotentially improve microarray prediction performance. However; the results were not veryencouraging; as prediction performance did not always improve. In fact; in up to 20% of thecases; prediction accuracy was reduced. Furthermore; it was stated in the paper that thetechniques studied require sufficiently large sample sizes in both batches (train and test) tobe effective; which is not a realistic situation especially in clinical settings. In this paper; wepropose a different approach; which is able to overcome limitations faced by conventionalmethods.

We have shown previously that single agent treatmentof BH3-mimetics like ABT-737 and obatoclax (GX15-070) resulted in a dose dependentapoptotic cell death and synergistic with prednisolone. However; little is known about themechanisms and genomic responses underlying these BH3-mimetics. Since ABT-737 is aBad-like mimetic while obatoclax is a Bim-like mimetic; we hypothesized that combination ofthese two different BH3-mimetics will increase the efficacy of cell death and enable reduceddoses. Methods: Seven ALL cell lines and a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562) wereused in this study. The 8 cells lines were exposed to ABT-737 or obatoclax as well as a …,*,2010,4
Efficiently finding the best parameter for the emerging pattern-based classifier PCL,Thanh-Son Ngo; Mengling Feng; Guimei Liu; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Emerging patterns are itemsets whose frequencies change sharply from one classto the other. PCL is an example of efficient classification algorithms that leverage theprediction power of emerging patterns. It first selects the top-K emerging patterns of eachclass that match a testing instance; and then uses these selected patterns to decide theclass label of the testing instance. We study the impact of the parameter K on the accuracy ofPCL. We have observed that in many cases; the value of K is critical to the performance ofPCL. This motivates us to develop an algorithm to find the best value of K for PCL. Ourresults show that finding the best K can improve the accuracy of PCL greatly; and employingincremental frequent itemset maintenance techniques reduces the running time of ouralgorithm significantly.,14th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD); Hyderabad; India; June 2010.,2010,4

A query interface for heterogeneous biological data sources,Kyle Hart; Limsoon Wong,At the University of Pennsylvania Human Genome Center for Chromosome 22; we areregularly required to write programs to query biological data. The task of writing theseprograms is taxing for two reasons. First; the information needed often resides in severaldata sources of very di erent nature; some are relational databases; some are structured textles; and others include output from special application programs. There is currently no high-level tool for combining data across such a diverse spectrum of sources. This makes it di cultto write programs that implement the queries because the programmer is forced to use manydi erent application programming interfaces and programming languages such as SQLembedded in C. Second; the programmer must often resort to storing intermediate results forsubsequent processing because the available tools are not exible enough to retrieve the …,Manuscript; February,1994,4
On canonical and noncanonical classifications,Anne Ngu; Limsoon Wong; Surjatini Widjojo,Abstract We distinguish the concepts of types; used for structure and behavioral sharing inobject-oriented programming languages; from classes; used as collections in databases.Consequently; our class is not a type. Types are used strictly for structure; a type can beused as the structure for multiple; semantically unrelated; classes. Objects belonging tothese classes are said to have the same canonical structure. Classes are collections ofobjects enhanced with additional features to describe context sensitive information; thussupporting non-canonical view of objects in the class. With the above two classifications ofobjects; an object may be a member of several classes that are unrelated by the subclasssuperclass relationships; each class membership models the different roles played by anobject in the real world.

Z-score biological significance of binding hot spots of protein interfaces by using crystal packing as the reference state,Qian Liu; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,Abstract Characterization of binding hot spots of protein interfaces is a fundamental study inmolecular biology. Many computational methods have been proposed to identify binding hotspots. However; there are few studies to assess the biological significance of binding hotspots. We introduce the notion of biological significance of a contact residue for capturingthe probability of the residue occurring in or contributing to protein binding interfaces. Wetake a statistical Z-score approach to the assessment of the biological significance. Themethod has three main steps. First; the potential score of a residue is defined by using aknowledge-based potential function with relative accessible surface area calculations. A nulldistribution of this potential score is then generated from artifact crystal packing contacts.Finally; the Z-score significance of a contact residue with a specific potential score is …,Biochim Biophys Acta---Proteins and Proteomics,2012,3

Overcoming drug resistance by co-targeting,Marzieh Ayati; Golnaz Taheri; Shahriar Arab; Limsoon Wong; Changiz Eslahchi,Removal or suppression of key proteins in an essential pathway of a pathogen is expectedto disrupt the pathway and prohibit the pathogen from performing a vital function. Thusdisconnecting multiple essential pathways should disrupt the survival of a pathogen evenwhen it has multiple pathways to drug resistance. We consider a scenario where the drug-resistance pathways are unknown. To disrupt these pathways; we consider a cut set S of G;where G is a connected simple graph representing the protein interaction network of thepathogen; so that GS splits to two partitions such that the endpoints of each pathway are indifferent partitions. If the difference between the sizes of the two partitions is high; theprobability of existence of a functioning pathway in one partition is increased. Thus; we needto partition the graph into two balanced partitions.

Mining Conditional Contrast Patterns,Guozhu Dong; Jinyan Li; Guimei Liu; Limsoon Wong,This chapter considers the problem of “conditional contrast pattern mining.” It is related tocontrast mining; where one considers the mining of patterns/models that contrast two ormore datasets; classes; conditions; time periods; and so forth. Roughly speaking; conditionalcontrasts capture situations where a small change in patterns is associated with a bigchange in the matching data of the patterns. More precisely; a conditional contrast is a triple(B; F1; F2) of three patterns; B is the condition/context pattern of the conditional contrast; andF1 and F2 are the contrasting factors of the conditional contrast. Such a conditional contrastis of interest if the difference between F1 and F2 as itemsets is relatively small; and thedifference between the corresponding matching dataset of B∪ F1 and that of B∪ F2 isrelatively large. It offers insights on “discriminating” patterns for a given condition B …,*,2009,3
Properties of Languages That Make Recursive Views Unmaintainable,Guozhu Dong; Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We study the problem of maintaining recursively-de ned views; such as thetransitive closure of a relation; in traditional relational languages that do not have recursionmechanisms. The main results of this paper show that in most cases such incrementalmaintenance is impossible if either no auxiliary relations are used or they are limited to bedeterministic. Instead of concentrating on proving these results for some particularlanguages; we try to identify properties of query languages that make such incrementalmaintenance impossible. That is; we want to use known results on expressive power oflanguages to derive new results on expressiveness of incremental recomputation. Weidentify two properties; studied previously in the literature on expressive power of querylanguages and nite-model theory; that imply unmaintainability of several recursive …,*,2007,3

Pattern Recognition in Bioinformatics: An Introduction,J Rajapakse; Limsoon Wong; Raj Acharya,Abstract The information stored in DNA; a chain of four nucleotides (A; T; G; and C); is firstconverted to mRNA through the process of transcription and then converted to the functionalform of life; proteins; through the process of translation. Only about 5% of the genomecontains useful patterns of nucleotides; or genes; that code for proteins. The initiation oftranslation or transcription process is determined by the presence of specific patterns of DNAor RNA; or motifs. Research on detecting specific patterns of DNA sequences such asgenes; protein coding regions; promoters; etc.; leads to uncover functional aspects of cells.Comparative genomics focus on comparisons across the genomes to find conservedpatterns over the evolution; which possess some functional significance.

LinkageTracker: A discriminative pattern tracking approach to linkage disequilibrium mapping,Li Lin; Limsoon Wong; Tzeyun Leong; Pohsan Lai,Abstract Linkage disequilibrium mapping is a process of inferring the disease gene locationfrom observed associations of marker alleles in affected patients and normal controls. Inreality; the presence of disease-associated chromosomes in affected population is relativelylow (usually 10% or less). Hence; it is a challenge to locate these disease genes on thechromosomes. In this paper; we propose an algorithm known as LinkageTracker for linkagedisequilibrium mapping. Comparing with some of the existing work; LinkageTracker is morerobust and does not require any population ancestry information. Furthermore our algorithmis shown to find the disease locations more accurately than a closely related existing work;by reducing the average sum-square error by more than half (from 80.71 to 30.83) over onehundred trials.

These DNA fragments on the microarray are hybridized toa complex sample of fluorescently labeled DNA or RNA in solution. After a washing andstaining process; the addresses at which hybridization has taken place can be determinedand the expression level of the corresponding genes derived. Today; a single microarraycan contain several tens of thousands of DNA fragments.

Second; we want to demonstrate how thegeneral bioinformatics database integration system called Kleisli can help build such asystem easily.

Polymorphic queries across sets; bags; and lists,Limsoon Wong,Abstract Bulk data types such as sets; bags; and lists are an important component of amodern query language. It is desirable that operations on one bulk data type (such as sets)that have analogous counterparts in other bulk data types (such as bags and list) beexpressed using the same expression. This kind of uniformity is achieved only to a limiteddegree in object-oriented languages; as these languages have the type information lossproblem. Languages based on parametric polymorphism achieve this uniformity in a muchbetter way; but only upto\bracket-switching." That is; in these languages; a query over bagsthat is analogous to a query over sets; are identical upto interchanging the set and bagbrackets. This paper presents a simple extension to a popular parametric polymorphic typesystem. We show that it is possible to construct a query language around this type system …,SIGPLAN Notices,1995,3

To address this; many current methods use multiple evidence from differentsources of information to compute reliability scores for such PPIs. However; they oftencombine the evidence without taking into account the uncertainty of the evidence values;potential dependencies between the information sources used and missing values fromsome information sources. We propose to formulate the task of scoring PPIs using multipleinformation sources as a multi-criteria decision making problem that can be solved usingdata fusion to model potential interactions between the multiple information sources.

To avoid using structural alignment; we propose a solvated sequence method toanalyse water conservation properties in protein interfaces. We first use water information tolabel the residues; and then align interfacial residues in a fashion similar to normalsequence alignment. Our results show that; for a water-contacting interfacial residue;substituting it into hydrophobic residues tends to desolvate the local area. Surprisingly;residues with short side chains also tend not to lose their contacting water; emphasising therole of water in shaping binding sites.

Protein Function Prediction: Using Protein–Protein Interaction Networks,Hon Nian Chua; Guimei Liu; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Proteins perform biological functions by participating in a large number ofinteractions; ranging from transient interactions in signaling pathways to permanentinteractions within stable complexes. Studies have shown that the immediate interactionneighborhood of a protein can be used to infer its functions. While using only such directinteractions limits prediction coverage; extending the interaction neighborhood to includeindirect interaction partners reduces precision significantly; making functional inferenceunviable. In a series of studies; we find that the extent of partner-sharing between two non-interacting proteins makes a good estimator for their co-participation in similar function. Thisallows us to include indirect interactions in network-based functional inference with littlecompromise in precision. We also extend this idea to the related problems of protein …,*,2011,2

The generator representation is a concise and losslessrepresentation of frequent patterns. We effectively maintain the generator representation bysystematically expanding its Negative Generator Border. In the literature; very few work hasaddressed the maintenance of the generator representation. To illustrate the proposedmaintenance idea; a new algorithm is developed to maintain the generator representationfor support threshold adjustment. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithmis significantly faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms.

High-quality protein-protein interaction maps are useful for a deeper understanding of how proteins may togetherto carry out specific functions. However; high-throughput methods are known to yield a non-negligible rate of false positives; and to miss a fraction of existing interactions [28; 26; 10]. Asa result; further carefully-focused small-scale experiments are often needed to complementthe large-scale methods to validate the detected interactions.

Finding functional promoter motifs by computational methods: A word of caution,Rajesh Chowdhary; Limsoon Wong; Vladimir B Bajic,The standard practice in the analysis of promoters is to select promoter regions ofconvenient length. This may lead to false results when searching for Transcription FactorBinding Sites (TFBSs); since the sequences may contain coding segments. In such cases;motif detection may single out motifs from the coding regions. The mapping of TFBSs topromoters may result in a misleading picture of'promoter'content. We illustrate these issuesusing the example of histones H2A and H2B and show how such analysis could bemisleading if care is not exercised to eliminate coding regions from the presumed promotersequences.,International Journal of Bioinformatics Research and Applications,2006,2

The forerunners of such databases include KEGG1; DIP2; BIND3; amongothers. Such databases are still small in size and are largely hand curated. A factor that canaccelerate their growth is the development of reliable literature data mining technologies…,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing 2002; Hawaii; January 2002,2002,2

The Simplified SQL Reference Manual,Limsoon Wong,For the last several years; CPL has been the only high-level query language for the KleisliQuery System. CPL has a syntax that is familiar to functional programming languagecommunity.

A bounded degree property and finite-cofiniteness of graph queries,Leonid Libkin; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We provide new techniques for the analysis of the expressive power of querylanguages for nested collections. These languages may use set or bag semantics and maybe further complicated by the presence of aggregate functions. We exhibit certain classes ofgraphics and prove that properties of these graphics that can be tested in such languagesare either finite or cofinite. This result settles that conjectures of Grumbach; Milo; andParedaens that parity test; transitive closure; and balanced binary tree test are notexpressible in bah languages like BALG of Grumbach and Milo and BQL of Libkin andWong. Moreover; it implies that many recursive queries; including simple ones like test for achain; cannot be expressed in a nested relational language even when aggregate functionsare available. In an attempt to generalize the finite-cofiniteness result; we study the …,Technical Reports (CIS),1993,2

Redhyte: a self-diagnosing; self-correcting; and helpful hypothesis analysis platform,Wei Zhong Toh; Kwok Pui Choi; Limsoon Wong,ABSTRACT An interactive platform for 'Rapid exploration of data and hypothesis testing';named Redhyte; is described in this article. Redhyte provides a more efficient andencompassing hypothesis testing procedure than the conventional statistical hypothesistesting framework; by integrating the latter with data-mining techniques. Redhyte is self-diagnosing (it tries to detect whether the user is doing a valid statistical test); self-correcting(it tries to propose and make corrections to the user's statistical test); and helpful (it searchesfor promising or interesting hypotheses related to the initial user-specified hypothesis).Hypothesis mining in Redhyte consists of the following steps: context mining; mined-hypothesis formulation; mined-hypothesis scoring on interestingness; and statisticaladjustments. And Redhyte supports multiple hypothesis-mining metrics (eg several forms …,Journal of Information and Telecommunication,2017,1
Class‐paired Fuzzy SubNETs: A paired variant of the rank‐based network analysis family for feature selection based on protein complexes,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Identifying reproducible yet relevant protein features in proteomics data is a majorchallenge. Analysis at the level of protein complexes can resolve this issue and we havedeveloped a suite of feature-selection methods collectively referred to as Rank-BasedNetwork Analysis (RBNA). RBNAs differ in their individual statistical test setup but are similarin the sense that they deploy rank-defined weights among proteins per sample. Thisprocedure is known as gene fuzzy scoring. Currently; no RBNA exists for paired-samplescenarios where both control and test tissues originate from the same source (eg samepatient). It is expected that paired tests; when used appropriately; are more powerful thanapproaches intended for unpaired samples. We report that the class-paired RBNA;PPFSNET; dominates in both simulated and real data scenarios. Moreover; for the first …,Proteomics,2017,1
Can Peripheral Blood-Derived Gene Expressions Characterize Individuals at Ultra-high Risk for Psychosis?,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Judy Chia-Ghee Sng; Jie Yin Yee; Yuen Mei See; Tih-Shih Lee; Limsoon Wong; Jimmy Lee,The ultra-high risk (UHR) state was originally conceived to identify individuals at imminentrisk of developing psychosis. Although recent studies have suggested that most individualsdesignated UHR do not; they constitute a distinctive group; exhibiting cognitive andfunctional impairments alongside multiple psychiatric morbidities. UHR characterizationusing molecular markers may improve understanding; provide novel insight intopathophysiology; and perhaps improve psychosis prediction reliability.

Regularizing predicted complexes by mutually exclusive protein-protein interactions,Osamu Maruyama; Limsoon Wong,Protein complexes are key entities in the cell responsible for various cellular mechanismsand biological processes. We propose here a method for predicting protein complexes froma protein-protein interaction (PPI) network; using information on mutually exclusive PPIs. Iftwo interactions are mutually exclusive; they are not allowed to exist simultaneously in thesame predicted complex. We introduce a new regularization term which checks whetherpredicted complexes are connected by mutually exclusive PPIs. This regularization term isadded into the scoring function of our earlier protein complex prediction tool; PPSampler2.We show that PPSampler2 with mutually exclusive PPIs outperforms the original one.Furthermore; the performance is superior to well-known representative conventional proteincomplex prediction methods. Thus; it is is effective to use mutual exclusiveness of PPIs in …,Proceedings of IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2015,2015,1
Two scenarios for overcoming drug resistance by co–targeting,Golnaz Taheri; Marzieh Ayati; Limsoon Wong; Changiz Eslahchi,Removal of proteins on an essential pathway of a pathogen is expected to prohibit thepathogen from performing a vital function. To disrupt these pathways; we consider a cut setS of simple graph G; where G representing the PPI network of the pathogen. After removingS; if the difference of sizes of two partitions is high; the probability of existence of afunctioning pathway is increased. We need to partition the graph into balanced partitionsand approximate it with spectral bipartitioning. We consider two scenarios: in the first; we donot have any information on drug targets; in second; we consider information on drugtargets. Our databases are E. coli and C. jejuni. In the first scenario; 20% and 17% ofproteins in cut of E. coli and C. jejuni are drug targets and in the second scenario 53% and63% of proteins in cut are drug targets respectively.,International Journal of Bioinformatics Research and Applications,2015,1

Gene Ontology (GO) is the de facto standard function annotationscheme for gene products. Identification of both explicit and implicit lipid-related GO termswill help lipid research in many ways; eg assigning lipid function in protein functionprediction. Results: We have constructed a Web site 'LipidGO'that facilitates browsing andsearching lipid-related GO terms. An expandable hierarchical GO tree is constructed thatallows users to find lipid-related GO terms easily. To support large-scale analysis; a user isable to upload a list of gene products or a list of GO terms to find out which of them is lipidrelated. Finally; we demonstrate the usefulness of 'LipidGO'by two applications:(i) …,Bioinformatics,2014,1

A dichotomy in the intensional expressive power of nested relational calculi augmented with aggregate functions and a powerset operator,Limsoon Wong,Abstract The extensional aspect of expressive power---ie; what queries can or cannot beexpressed---has been the subject of many studies of query languages. Paradoxically;although efficiency is of primary concern in computer science; the intensional aspect ofexpressive power---ie; what queries can or cannot be implemented efficiently---has beenmuch neglected. Here; we discuss the intensional expressive power of NRC (Q;+;·;‏;÷; Σ;powerset); a nested relational calculus augmented with aggregate functions and a powersetoperation. We show that queries on structures such as long chains; deep trees; etc. have adichotomous behaviour: Either they are already expressible in the calculus without using thepowerset operation or they require at least exponential space. This result generalizes inthree significant ways several old dichotomy-like results; such as that of Suciu and …,32nd ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS2013),2013,1
Disruption of protein complexes,GOLNAZ TAHERI; MAHNAZ HABIBI; LIMSOON WONG; CHANGIZ ESLAHCHI,Protein complexes are a cornerstone of many biological processes and; together; they formvarious types of molecular machinery that perform a vast array of biological functions.Different complexes perform different functions and; the same complex can perform verydifferent functions that depend on a variety of factors. Thus disruption of protein complexescan be lethal to an organism. It is interesting to identify a minimal set of proteins whoseremoval would lead to a massive disruption of protein complexes and; to understand thebiological properties of these proteins. A method is presented for identifying a minimumnumber of proteins from a given set of complexes so that a maximum number of thesecomplexes are disrupted when these proteins are removed. The method is based onspectral bipartitioning. This method is applied to yeast protein complexes. The identified …,Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,2013,1

Patient Survival Prediction from Gene Expression Data,Huiqing Liu; Limsoon Wong; Ying Xu,A patient outcome study is used to analyze the time required for an event of interest to occur.This event is usually a clinical prognosis; and it can be either unfavorable or favorable; suchas death; recurrence of a tumor; cancer distant metastasis; transplant rejection; restoration ofrenal function; or discharge from a hospital. Among these events; survival status is the mostimportant; especially for cancer patients. In current practice; medical doctors assess the riskprofile of a cancer patient based primarily on various clinical characteristics. For example;the prognostic indicators used to identify the appropriate therapy for acute myeloid leukemiapatients include age; cytogenetic findings; white-cell count; and the presence or absence ofrecurrent cytogenetic aberrations [7]. However; these factors do not fully reflect the molecularheterogeneity of the disease; and treatment stratification is difficult. Another example is …,*,2007,1

Use of built-in features in the interpretation of high-dimensional cancer diagnosis data,Jinyan Li; Huiquing Liu; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Cancer diagnosis data; for example microarray gene expression profiling data andproteomic profiling data; are often described by thousands of features. To computationallymake a diagnosis for new samples; these data are usually input to a learning algorithm; thealgorithm then induces a classifier; the classifier then predicts a class label for any testsample. As the data is so high-dimensional; most of the resulting classifiers are verycomplicated particularly those based on kernel-functions such as support vector machines---the interpretation of the decision results must need all the features to be involved. In thispaper; we discuss built-in features and use them to concisely characterize the data and toeasily interpret the decisions. Built-in features are features that are used only in theclassifiers; and that are only a small subset of the original features; eg; the features in a …,2nd Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference;  Dunedin; New Zealand; January 18-22; 2004,2004,1
Mining of Correlated Rules in Genome Sequences,Li Lin; Limsoon Wong; Tze-Yun Leong; PS Lai,Methods. Association rule mining was first introduced in 1993 by [1]. An association rule is ofthe form x--y; where x and y are sets of items and xny= 0. The main task of association rulemining is to extract from the database all rules that satisfy the minimum support and theminimum confidence constraints specified by the user. Given a database with records eachwith a class label; classification rule mining aims to extracta set of concise rules for eachclass to form an accurate classifier. The main difference between classification rules andassociation rules is that association rules do not have predetermined target or consequent;whereas classification rules have a pre-determined target; which is the class. The integrationof association rule mining with classification rule mining to mine rules whose consequentsare restricted to the classification class attribute was first introduced by [2].

From Sequence to Structure To Literature: The Protocol Approach to Biolnformation,OP Wu; KT Seow; L Wong; SY Chung; S Subbiah,Abstract: Until the recent advent of high-throughput experimentaldata-acquisition in biology;the computational analysis of the biological data was predominantly on an ad hoc basis-iethe application of a given piece of software on the biological data depended on the need ofthe moment. This" functional approach" often resulted in piecemeal computational analysiswith large amount of intervening" deadtime".

An IES (L) for maintaining the query Q isa system consisting of input database I; an answer database A; an optional auxiliarydatabase; and a nite set of\update" functions that correspond to the di erent kinds ofpermissible update to the input database. These update functions take as input; thecorresponding update; the input database; the answer database; and the auxiliary database;and collectively produce as output the updated input database; the updated answerdatabase; and the updated auxiliary database.

Pruning nested data values using branch expressions with wildcards,Kyle Hart; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Branch expressions are presented as a means of expressing structural queries overnested data contained in data exchange formats. We demonstrate their utility in pruninglarge data structures by using them to specify a form of parse optimization; and we show thattheir evaluation can be done in linear time with a constant amount of memory. Wildcards thatrange over subtrees of a data structure are introduced and a method for eliminatingwildcards is described. We then demonstrate how we have embedded branch expressionsinto a more general system to express a richer class of queries. Finally; optimizations formigrating operations from the general system into the more e cient branch expressionsystem are described.,2nd Meeting on the Interconnection of Molecular Biology Databases; Cambridge; England,1995,1

Dealing with Confounders in Omics Analysis,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Limsoon Wong,The Anna Karenina effect is a manifestation of the theory–practice gap that exists whentheoretical statistics are applied on real-world data. In the course of analyzing biologicaldata for differential features such as genes or proteins; it derives from the situation where thenull hypothesis is rejected for extraneous reasons (or confounders); rather than because thealternative hypothesis is relevant to the disease phenotype. The mechanics of applyingstatistical tests therefore must address and resolve confounders. It is inadequate to simplyrely on manipulating the P-value. We discuss three mechanistic elements (hypothesisstatement construction; null distribution appropriateness; and test-statistic construction) andsuggest how they can be designed to foil the Anna Karenina effect to select phenotypicallyrelevant biological features.,*,2018,*
OrthoGNC: A Software for Accurate Identification of Orthologs Based on Gene Neighborhood Conservation,Soheil Jahangiri-Tazehkand; Limsoon Wong; Changiz Eslahchi,Abstract Orthology relations can be used to transfer annotations from one gene (or protein)to another. Hence; detecting orthology relations has become an important task in the post-genomic era. Various genomic events; such as duplication and horizontal gene transfer; cancause erroneous assignment of orthology relations. In closely-related species; geneneighborhood information can be used to resolve many ambiguities in orthology inference.Here we present OrthoGNC; a software for accurately predicting pairwise orthology relationsbased on gene neighborhood conservation. Analyses on simulated and real data reveal thehigh accuracy of OrthoGNC. In addition to orthology detection; OrthoGNC can be employedto investigate the conservation of genomic context among potential orthologs detected byother methods.

Understanding missing proteins: a functional perspective,Longjian Zhou; Limsoon Wong; Wilson Wen Bin Goh,A missing protein (MP) is an unconfirmed genetic sequence for which a protein product isnot yet detected. Currently; MPs are tiered based on supporting evidence mainly in the formof protein existence (PE) classification. As we discuss here; this definition is overly restrictivebecause proteins go missing in day-to-day proteomics as a result of low abundance; lack ofsequence specificity; splice variants; and so on. Thus; we propose a broader functionalclassification of MPs that complements PE classification; discuss major causes; andexamine three corresponding solution tiers:. biological; technical; and informatics. We assertthat informatics-driven solutions would have a major role in resolving the MP problem(MPP).,*,2017,*
Advanced bioinformatics methods for practical applications in proteomics,Wilson Wen Bin Goh; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has undergone rapid advancements inrecent years; creating challenging problems for bioinformatics. We focus on four aspectswhere bioinformatics plays a crucial role (and proteomics is needed for clinical application):peptide-spectra matching (PSM) based on the new data-independent acquisition (DIA)paradigm; resolving missing proteins (MPs); dealing with biological and technicalheterogeneity in data and statistical feature selection (SFS). DIA is a brute-force strategy thatprovides greater width and depth but; because it indiscriminately captures spectra such thatsignal from multiple peptides is mixed; getting good PSMs is difficult. We consider twostrategies: simplification of DIA spectra to pseudo-data-dependent acquisition spectra or;alternatively; brute-force search of each DIA spectra against known reference libraries …,Briefings in Bioinformatics,2017,*

Efficient mining of pan-correlation patterns from time course data,Qian Liu; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao,Abstract There are different types of correlation patterns between the variables of a timecourse data set; such as positive correlations; negative correlations; time-laggedcorrelations; and those correlations containing small interrupted gaps. Usually; thesecorrelations are maintained only on a subset of time points rather than on the whole span ofthe time points which are traditionally required for correlation definition. As these types ofpatterns underline different trends of data movement; mining all of them is an important stepto gain a broad insight into the dependencies of the variables. In this work; we prove thatthese diverse types of correlation patterns can be all represented by a generalized form ofpositive correlation patterns. We also prove a correspondence between positive correlationpatterns and sequential patterns.

Burial level change defines a high energetic relevance for protein binding interfaces,Zhenhua Li; Ying He; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,Abstract Protein-protein interfaces defined through atomic contact or solvent accessibilitychange are widely adopted in structural biology studies. But; these definitions cannotprecisely capture energetically important regions at protein interfaces. The burial depth of anatom in a protein is related to the atom's energy. This work investigates how closely thechange in burial level of an atom/residue upon complexation is related to the binding. Buriallevel change is different from burial level itself. An atom deeply buried in a monomer with ahigh burial level may not change its burial level after an interaction and it may have littleburial level change. We hypothesize that an interface is a region of residues all undergoingburial level changes after interaction.

Effective Response Metric (ERM-D8) Using Time-Series Gene Expression Profiling at Diagnosis and Day 8 of Remission-Induction Therapy Is a Novel Early Progno...,Allen Eng Juh Yeoh; Zhenhua Li; Difeng Dong; Yi Lu; Jan Trka; Shirley Kow Yin Kham; Ah Moy Tan; Hany Ariffin; Limsoon Wong,BACKGROUND ALL is the most common form of childhood cancer with> 80% cured withcontemporary treatment protocols. Accurate risk stratification in childhood ALL is essential toavoid under-and over-treatment. Currently; we use presenting clinical; biological features;and minimal residual disease (MRD) quantitation to risk stratify patients. Although wholegenome gene expression profiling (GEP) can accurately classify patients with ALL intovarious WHO 2008 defined subgroups; its value in predicting relapse remained to bedefined. We hypothesized that global time-series GEPs of bone marrow (BM) samples atdiagnosis and specific points during initial remission-induction therapy can measure thesuccess of cytoreduction and be used for relapse prediction.

A semi-automated methodology for finding lipid-related GO terms,Mengyuan Fan; Hong Sang Low; Markus R Wenk; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Motivation: Although semantic similarity in Gene Ontology (GO) and otherapproaches may be used to find similar GO terms; there is yet a method to systematicallyfind a class of GO terms sharing a common property with high accuracy (eg involving humancuration). Results: We have developed a methodology to address this issue and applied it toidentify lipid-related GO terms; owing to the important and varied roles of lipids in manybiological processes. Our methodology finds lipid-related GO terms in a semi-automatedmanner; requiring only moderate manual curation. We first obtain a list of lipid-related gold-standard GO terms by keyword search and manual curation. Then; based on the hypothesisthat co-annotated GO terms share similar properties; we develop a machine learningmethod that expands the list of lipid-related terms from the gold standard.

The Dichotomous Intensional Expressive Power of the Nested Relational Calculus with Powerset,Limsoon Wong,Abstract Most existing studies on the expressive power of query languages have focused onwhat queries can be expressed and what queries cannot be expressed in a query language.They do not tell us much about whether a query can be implemented efficiently in a querylanguage. Yet; paradoxically; efficiency is a key concern in computer science. In this paper;the efficiency of queries in NRC(powerset); a nested relational calculus with a powersetoperation; is discussed. A dichotomy in the efficiency of these queries on a large generalclass of structures—which include long chains; deep trees; etc.—is proved. In particular; it isshown that these queries are either already expressible in the usual nested relationalcalculus or require at least exponential space. This Dichotomy Theorem; when coupled withthe bounded degree and locality properties of the usual nested relational calculus …,*,2013,*
Transformation and Integration,Susan B Davidson; Limsoon Wong,Summary. Kleisli is a data transformation and integration system that can be used for anyapplication where the data is typed; and has proven especially useful for bioinformaticsapplications. It extends the conventional flat relational data model supported by the querylanguage SQL to a complex object data model supported by the collection programminglanguage CPL. It also opens up the closed nature of commercial relational datamanagement systems to an easily extensible system that performs complex transformationson autonomous data sources that are heterogeneous and geographically dispersed.

A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO SOME RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYLOGENETIC NETWORK RECONSTRUCTION; GENOME MAPPING; GENE EXPRESSION ANA...,LIMSOON WONG,Phylogenetic network is a way to describe evolutionary histories that have undergoneevolutionary events such as recombination; hybridization; or horizontal gene transfer. Thelevel; k; of a network determines how non-treelike the evolution can be; with level-0networks being trees. A number of methods for constructing rooted phylogenetic networkfrom triplets have been proposed in the past. 1; 2 In this issue; Gambette et al. 3 discuss howto generalize these methods to construct unrooted phylogenetic network from quartets. Thepaper has three main contributions:(1) it gives an Oðn5ð1 þ ðn; nÞÞÞ time algorithm tocompute the set of quartets of a network;(2) it shows that level-1 quartet consistency is NP-hard; and (3) given a set Q of quartets; it shows that Oðn4Þ time is su±cient to compute theunrooted level-1 network N such that Q ¼ QðNÞ; if it exists.

Response: an empirical comparison of several recent epistatic interaction detection methods,Yue Wang; Guimei Liu; Mengling Feng; Limsoon Wong,As mentioned by Wan et al.(2011); the two common procedures for testing statisticalepistasis are as follows:(i)'two-locus interaction'as used in BOOST (Wan et al.; 2010a); and(ii)'twolocus association allowing for interaction'as used in SNPRuler (Wan et al.; 2010b);SNPHarvester (Yang et al.; 2009); TEAM (Zhang et al.; 2010) and Screen and Clean (Wu etal.; 2010). In our paper; we tested BOOST; TEAM; SNPRuler; SNPHarvester; and Screenand Clean using both types of epistatic interactions. We believe this is a more realistic andmore comprehensive treatment because; in practice; researchers may have no idea whetherthe underlying epistatic interactions in their data have main effects or not. Our resultssuggest that researchers should apply both TEAM and BOOST to their data.

A Preliminary Study on the Effects of Fear Factors in Disease Propagation,Yubo Wang; Jie Hu; Gaoxi Xiao; Limsoon Wong; Stefan Ma; Tee Hiang Cheng,Abstract Upon an outbreak of a dangerous infectious disease; people generally tend toreduce their contacts with others in fear of getting infected. Such typical actions apparentlyhelp to reduce the outbreak size. Thanks to today's broad media coverage; the fear factormay also contribute to preventing an outbreak from happening at all. We are motivated toconduct a careful study on modeling and evaluating such effects with a complex networkapproach. As a first step of this study; we consider the relatively simple case where involvedindividuals randomly remove a certain fraction of links between them. Analytical andsimulation results show that such an action cannot effectively prevent an epidemic outbreakfrom happening. However; it may significantly reduce the fraction of all the people evergetting infected when an outbreak does happen.,1st International Conference on Complex Sciences: Theory and Applications (Complex'2009); Shanghai; China; 23-25 February 2009,2009,*

As a result; more protein complexes are been identified[2]. A protein complex is a group of two or more associated proteins. Protein complex is aform of quaternary structure. Similar to phosphorylation; complex formation often serves toactivate or inhibit one or more of the associated proteins. Many protein complexes areestablished; particularly in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bakers' yeast).With a wealth of and constantly increasing size of PPI datasets; efficient and accurateintelligent tools for identification of protein complexes are of great importance.

A distributed constraint optimization solution to the P2P video streaming problem,Theodore Elhourani; Nathan Denny; Michael Marefat,Abstract The future success of application layer video multicast depends on the availabilityof video stream distribution methods that can scale in the number of stream senders andreceivers. Previous work on the problem of application layer video streaming has noteffectively addressed scalability in the number of receivers and senders. Therefore; newsolutions that are amenable to analysis and can achieve scalable P2P video streaming areneeded. In this work we propose the use of automated negotiation algorithms to constructvideo streaming trees at the application layer. We show that automated negotiation caneffectively solve the problem of distributing a video stream to a large number of receivers.,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,2007,*

The human transmissibleavian influenza cases might initially start their infections without public awareness. Thecommunity clinics are vulnerable to the spread of avian influenza transimissions especiallyat the early stage. As a country with high population density; the infections occured in clinicsmight lead to relatively large scale spread quickly. It is important to simulate and analyze thespread of avian influenza beforehand.

CCGinvestigators have shown that Day-7 and Day-14 BM blast counts were prognosticallyimportant although there is great inter-observer variability. BFM group have shown that day8 prednisolone (PRED) response is highly predictive of the treatment outcome. While geneexpression profiling (GEP) of diagnostic marrow can discern a pattern of PRED sensitivity asdetermined by in vitro MTT assay; the accuracy was low at only 70%. We hypothesized thatchanges in global GEP after therapy have a higher likelihood to predict response as thesignatures of sensitivity and resistance may be unmasked during the therapy.

Ourevidences are as follows: Firstly; this zinc finger gene; denoted Z3-7; has significant C2H2-ZNF domains (e-value< 0.05) in its two ORFs in different reading frames. Secondly; the twoORFs are overlapped; with a common promoter; a common transcription start site; but withdifferent start codons; different Kozak patterns; different PolyA sites and different PolyAsignals. Thirdly; in the mRNA of this gene; we found a significant pseudoknot and a likelyframeshifting sites UUUCCU; five upstream nucleotides before this pseudoknot; Moreover;each of the two ORFs of Z3-7 significantly matches two reading frames of seven human …,Biotechnology,2005,*

Diagnosis of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia and Optimization of Risk-Benefit Ratio of Therapy,Limsoon Wong,Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common form of childhoodcancer. Though it looks identical under the microscope; childhood ALL is a highlyheterogeneous disease; with as many as 6 different subtypes that have widely differingtreatment outcome. To avoid undertreatment; which causes relapse and eventual death; orover-treatment; which causes severe long-term side-effects; accurate diagnostic subgroupmust be assigned upfront so that the correct intensity of therapy can be delivered to ensurethat the child is accorded the highest chance for cure [1]. Contemporary approaches to thediagnosis of childhood ALL require an extensive range of procedures including morphology;immunophenotyping; cytogenetics; and molecular diagnostics [1].

An Example in Kleisli: Codon Usage Extraction Made Easy,Jiren Wang; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Codon usage information was useful to many molecular biologists in designingappropriate degenerate oligonucleotides and in optimizing expression of genes. It couldalso be used in improving the sensitivity of alignment tools in detection of short codingregions. We had two objectives in this paper. First; we wanted to build a system that couldextract coding sequences of a speci ed organism from public DNA sequence databases andcould compute their codon usage. Second; we wanted to demonstrate how the generaldatabase integration system called Kleisli could help build such a system and othersophisticated bioinformatics applications easily. We achieved these two objectives byshowing that short and clear programs could be written in Kleisli; using its high-level querylanguage CPL; to build such a system.

A Data Exchange Format and Some Supporting Tools,Jing Chen; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We describe the concept of an open query system based on a nested relationaldata model and a self-describing data exchange format. The Kleisli Query System is such anopen query system. We present the data model and exchange format of the Kleisli QuerySystem. Many data sources in bioinformatics can be easily mapped onto them. Then wedescribe Kleisli/CPL and Kleisli/Perl; which are two tools for manipulating objectsconforming to the data model and exchange format; through an extended example on Kozaksequences. The example also shows that it is simple to use the Kleisli Query System toperform fairly complex integration; transformation; and analysis.,*,1998,*

We describe in this paper two such tools. The rst iscalled SeqIndex. It consists of a technology for indexing very long sequences and a suite ofprograms that uses the index to e cient search for patterns. The second is called Kleisli. It isa powerful integration system and provides a high-level query language CPL to expresscomplex queries. Real-life queries posed by molecular biologists are used for illustration.Topic.

MSF to FASTA Conversion Using Kleisli,Limsoon Wong,An MSF le has two parts; the part above the//is the header information and the part belowthe//is the alignment information. We want to extract the protein sequences from thealignment information part of an MSF le and put these sequences into FASTA format. Whyare we doing this? There are two reasons. The rst is that the popular READSEQ program inthe web1 does not perform this conversion correctly. The second is that this conversion is agood exercise on some of the string manipulation capability in our Kleisli/CPL system 1].,*,1998,*

EXTENSION PROPERTIES FOR QUERY,Limsoon Wong,Abstract Strong normalization results are obtained for a general language for collectiontypes. An induced normal form for sets and bags is then used to show that the class offunctions whose input has height (that is; the maximal depth of nestings of sets/bags/lists inthe complex object) at most i and output has height at most o definable in a nested relationalquery language without powerset operator is independent of the height of intermediateexpressions used. Our proof holds regardless of whether the language is used for queryingsets; bags; or lists; even in the presence of variant types. Moreover; the normal forms areuseful in a general approach to query optimization. Paredaens and Van Gucht proved asimilar result for the special case when i= o= 1. Their result is complemented by Hull and Suwho demonstrated the failure of independence when powerset operator is present and i …,*,1995,*

Left: MS proteinlist (Paragon and Mascot) is first filtered for seed proteins. The expansion step is done on thecleaned integrated PPIN. Clique analysis is then performed to obtain tightly connectedclusters. The clusters are then scored and ranked. For pathway analysis; we used anintegrated pathway database (Pathway API). Similarly; the MS protein list is expanded bylocating shared neighbors in the list of pathways. Pathways significant in mod and poorrespectively were identified. The shortest path distances between the mod to poor pathwayswere then identified on an integrated gene network combining both pathway and PPINinformation.,*,*,*

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES,Liang Zhao; Qingfeng Chen; Wencui Li; Peng Jiang; Limsoon Wong; Jinyan Li,We use the tuple (κ; j; i; ι) to denote an occurrence of the k-mer; κ; starting at the ith positionof the paired-end read rj having mate index ι. The indices i and j are 0-based. For example;suppose the input set of paired-end reads is R={AGTTCG··· GGCTCA; TTCGAC··· GAGGAC;TCTCAG··· TTAGGC}. Then the tuples representing occurrences of the 3-mer TCA are (TCA;0; 3; 1) and (TCA; 2; 2; 0). A hash function is used to map a k-mer κ to a group Gκ; whichcorresponds to a node in the computing cluster. The set of tuples in group Gκ is denoted byG (κ). Some groups G (κ) are much larger than other groups. In such a case; the k-mer κ islikely from repeat regions or has low sequence complexity. We discard such groups. Thethreshold on group size for the decision to discard a group is determined as follows. Themean and standard deviation of the number of paired-end reads of each group are …,*,*,*

Turning Relational DBMS into Nested Relational DBMS,Jing Chen; Limsoon Wong,ABSTRACT We describe an interface to relational database management systems usingSML and CML. This interface is used within the broad-scale bioinformatics data integrationsystem called Kleisli. It extends the conventional at relational data model supported by thequery language SQL to a complex object data model. As a result; by going through thisinterface; a conventional at relational data management system can be used transparentlyas a complex object store.,*,*,*
