Relevance feedback: a power tool for interactive content-based image retrieval,Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Michael Ortega; Sharad Mehrotra,Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has become one of the most active research areas inthe past few years. Many visual feature representations have been explored and manysystems built. While these research efforts establish the basis of CBIR; the usefulness of theproposed approaches is limited. Specifically; these efforts have relatively ignored twodistinct characteristics of CBIR systems:(1) the gap between high-level concepts and low-level features; and (2) the subjectivity of human perception of visual content. This paperproposes a relevance feedback based interactive retrieval approach; which effectively takesinto account the above two characteristics in CBIR.

Executing SQL over encrypted data in the database-service-provider model,Hakan Hacigümüş; Bala Iyer; Chen Li; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Rapid advances in networking and Internet technologies have fueled theemergence of the" software as a service" model for enterprise computing. Successfulexamples of commercially viable software services include rent-a-spreadsheet; electronicmail services; general storage services; disaster protection services." Database as aService" model provides users power to create; store; modify; and retrieve data fromanywhere in the world; as long as they have access to the Internet. It introduces severalchallenges; an important issue being data privacy. It is in this context that we specificallyaddress the issue of data privacy. There are two main privacy issues. First; the owner of thedata needs to be assured that the data stored on the service-provider site is protectedagainst data thefts from outsiders. Second; data needs to be protected even from the …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,1309
Dimensionality reduction for fast similarity search in large time series databases,Eamonn Keogh; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Michael Pazzani; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract. The problem of similarity search in large time series databases has attracted muchattention recently. It is a non-trivial problem because of the inherent high dimensionality ofthe data. The most promising solutions involve first performing dimensionality reduction onthe data; and then indexing the reduced data with a spatial access method. Three majordimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed: Singular Value Decomposition(SVD); the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT); and more recently the Discrete WaveletTransform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique whichwe call Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). We theoretically and empiricallycompare it to the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority. In addition to beingcompetitive with or faster than the other methods; our approach has numerous other …,Knowledge and information Systems,2001,1279
Content-based image retrieval with relevance feedback in MARS,Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Sharad Mehrotra,Technology advances in the areas of image processing (IP) and information retrieval (IR)have evolved separately for a long time. However; successful content-based image retrievalsystems require the integration of the two. There is an urgent need to develop integrationmechanisms to link the image retrieval model to text retrieval model; such that the wellestablished text retrieval techniques can be utilized. Approaches of converting image featurevectors (IF domain) to weighted-term vectors (IR domain) are proposed in this paper.Furthermore; the relevance feedback technique from the IR domain is used in content-basedimage retrieval to demonstrate the effectiveness of this conversion. Experimental resultsshow that the image retrieval precision increases considerably by using the proposedintegration approach.,Image Processing; 1997.

Providing database as a service,Hakan Hacigumus; Bala Iyer; Sharad Mehrotra,We explore a novel paradigm for data management in which a third party service providerhosts" database as a service"; providing its customers with seamless mechanisms to create;store; and access their databases at the host site. Such a model alleviates the need fororganizations to purchase expensive hardware and software; deal with software upgrades;and hire professionals for administrative and maintenance tasks which are taken over by theservice provider. We have developed and deployed a database service on the Internet;called NetDB2; which is in constant use. In a sense; a data management model supportedby NetDB2 provides an effective mechanism for organizations to purchase datamanagement as a service; thereby freeing them to concentrate on their core businesses.Among the primary challenges introduced by" database as a service" are the additional …,Data Engineering; 2002.

Adaptive key frame extraction using unsupervised clustering,Yueting Zhuang; Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Sharad Mehrotra,Key frame extraction has been recognized as one of the important research issues in videoinformation retrieval. Although progress has been made in key frame extraction; the existingapproaches are either computationally expensive or ineffective in capturing salient visualcontent. We first discuss the importance of key frame selection; and then review andevaluate the existing approaches. To overcome the shortcomings of the existingapproaches; we introduce a new algorithm for key frame extraction based on unsupervisedclustering. The proposed algorithm is both computationally simple and able to adapt to thevisual content. The efficiency and effectiveness are validated by large amount of real-worldvideos.,Image Processing; 1998. ICIP 98. Proceedings. 1998 International Conference on,1998,648
A privacy-preserving index for range queries,Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra; Gene Tsudik,Abstract Database outsourcing is an emerging data management paradigm which has thepotential to transform the IT operations of corporations. In this paper we address privacythreats in database outsourcing scenarios where trust in the service provider is limited.Specifically; we analyze the data partitioning (bucketization) technique and algorithmicallydevelop this technique to build privacy-preserving indices on sensitive attributes of arelational table. Such indices enable an untrusted server to evaluate obfuscated rangequeries with minimal information leakage. We analyze the worst-case scenario of inferenceattacks that can potentially lead to breach of privacy (eg; estimating the value of a dataelement within a small error margin) and identify statistical measures of data privacy in thecontext of these attacks. We also investigate precise privacy guarantees of data …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,480
Constructing table-of-content for videos,Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract. A fundamental task in video analysis is to extract structures from the video tofacilitate user's access (browsing and retrieval). Motivated by the important role that the tableof content (ToC) plays in a book; in this paper; we introduce the concept of ToC in the videodomain. Some existing approaches implicitly use the ToC; but are mainly limited to low-levelentities (eg; shots and key frames). The drawbacks are that low-level structures (1) containtoo many entries to be efficiently presented to the user; and (2) do not capture the underlyingsemantic structure of the video based on which the user may wish to browse/retrieve. Toaddress these limitations; in this paper; we present an effective semantic-level ToCconstruction technique based on intelligent unsupervised clustering. It has thecharacteristics of better modeling the time locality and scene structure. Experiments …,Multimedia systems,1999,377

Local dimensionality reduction: A new approach to indexing high dimensional spaces,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Many emerging application domains require database systems to support efficientaccess over highly multidimensional datasets. The current state-of-the-art technique toindexing high dimensional data is to first reduce the dimensionality of the data usingPrincipal Component Analysis and then indexing the reduceddimensionality space using amultidimensional index structure. The above technique; referred to as global dimensionalityreduction (GDR); works well when the data set is globally correlated; ie most of the variationin the data can be captured by a few dimensions. In practice; datasets are often not globallycorrelated. In such cases; reducing the data dimensionality using GDR causes significantloss of distance information resulting in a large number of false positives and hence a highquery cost. Even when a global correlation does not exist; there may exist subsets of data …,VLDB,2000,327
The hybrid tree: An index structure for high dimensional feature spaces,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Sharad Mehrotra,Feature-based similarity searching is emerging as an important search paradigm indatabase systems. The technique used is to map the data items as points into a high-dimensional feature space which is indexed using a multidimensional data structure.Similarity searching then corresponds to a range search over the data structure. Althoughseveral data structures have been proposed for feature indexing; none of them is known toscale beyond 10-15 dimensional spaces. This paper introduces the hybrid tree-amultidimensional data structure for indexing high-dimensional feature spaces. Unlike othermultidimensional data structures; the hybrid tree cannot be classified as either a pure datapartitioning (DP) index structure (such as the R-tree; SS-tree or SR-tree) or a pure spacepartitioning (SP) one (such as the KDB-tree or hB-tree); rather it combines the positive …,Data Engineering; 1999.

Efficient record linkage in large data sets,Liang Jin; Chen Li; Sharad Mehrotra,This paper describes an efficient approach to record linkage. Given two lists of records; therecord-linkage problem consists of determining all pairs that are similar to each other wherethe overall similarity between two records is defined based on domain-specific similaritiesover individual attributes constituting the record. The record-linkage problem arises naturallyin the context of data cleansing that usually precedes data analysis and mining. We explorea novel approach to this problem. For each attribute of records; we first map values to amultidimensional Euclidean space that preserves domain-specific similarity. Many mappingalgorithms can be applied; and we use the FastMap approach as an example.

The information entities of such databases have both spatialand textual descriptions. Likewise; queries issued to the databases also contain spatial andtextual components; for example;" Find shelters with emergency medical facilities in OrangeCounty;" or" Find earthquake-prone zones in Southern California." We refer to such queriesas spatial-keyword queries or SK queries for short.

Efficient execution of aggregation queries over encrypted relational databases,Hakan Hacıgümüş; Bala Iyer; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Encryption is a common method to assure privacy of stored data. In many practicalsituations; decrypting data before applying logic compromises privacy. The challenge is tocome up with logic transformation techniques and result-mapping methods so that the exactresult of applying logic to data-in-the-clear is obtained by applying the transformed logic toencrypted data and mapping the result produced. In the scope of relational aggregationqueries and in the presence of logical predicates; we show how to support neededtransformations and mappings.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,240
Exploring video structure beyond the shots,Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Sharad Mehrotra,While existing shot-based video analysis approaches provide users with better access to thevideo than the raw data stream does; they are still not sufficient for meaningful videobrowsing and retrieval; since:(1) the shots in a long video are still too many to be presentedto the user; and (2) shots do not capture the underlying semantic structure of the video;based on which the user may wish to browse/retrieve the video. To explore video structure atthe semantic level this paper presents an effective approach for video scene structureconstruction; in which shots are grouped into semantic-related scenes. The output of theproposed algorithm provides a structured video that greatly facilitates user's access.Experiments based on real-world movie videos validate the effectiveness of the proposedapproach.,Multimedia Computing and Systems; 1998.

Progressive approximate aggregate queries with a multi-resolution tree structure,Iosif Lazaridis; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Answering aggregate queries like SUM; COUNT; MIN; MAX; AVG in anapproximate manner is often desirable when the exact answer is not needed or too costly tocompute. We present an algorithm for answering such queries in multi-dimensionaldatabases; using selective traversal of a Multi-Resolution Aggregate (MRA) tree structurestoring point data. Our approach provides 100% intervals of confidence on the value of theaggregate and works iteratively; coming up with improving quality answers; until some errorrequirement is satisfied or time constraint as reached. Using the same technique we canalso answer aggregate queries exactly and our experiments indicate that even for exactanswering the proposed data structure and algorithm are very fast.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,228

A transaction model for multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz; Henry F Korth,A transaction model for multidatabase system (MDBS) applications in which globalsubtransactions may be either compensatable or retriable is presented. In this modelcompensation and retrying are used for recovery purposes. However; since such executionsmay no longer consist of atomic transactions; a correctness criterion that ensures thattransactions see consistent database states is necessary. A commit protocol and aconcurrency control scheme that ensures that all generated schedules are correct are alsopresented. The commit protocol eliminates the problem of blocking; which is characteristicsof the standard 2PC protocol. The concurrency control protocol can be used in any MDBSenvironment irrespective of the concurrency control protocol followed by the local DBMSs inorder to ensure serializability.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1992.; Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on,1992,207
Query refinement for multimedia similarity retrieval in MARS,Kriengkrai Porkaew; Kaushik Chakrabarti,Sharad Mehrotra Information and Computer Science Department University of California atIrvine 1 introduction Advances in image processing; database management; and informationretrieval has resulted in content-based multimedia retrieval to emerge as an important areaof research. Typical content-based retrieval systems allow users to specify queries byproviding examples of objects similar to the ones they wish to retrieve. Due to the subjectivenature of retrieval; it is unlikely that the answers to the 'starting query'will satisfy the user'sinformation need. Rather; among answers retrieved; the user may find one or more objectsthat are closer to what she has in mind compared to the original examples. In the MultimediaAnalysis and Retrieval System (MARS); we have explored query refinement techniques tomodify the query based on the relevance feedback of the user on the retrieved objects …,MULTIMEDIA '99 Proceedings of the seventh ACM international conference on Multimedia (Part 1),1999,203
Capturing sensor-generated time series with quality guarantees,Iosif Lazaridis; Sharad Mehrotra,We are interested in capturing time series generated by small wireless electronic sensors.Battery-operated sensors must avoid heavy use of their wireless radio which is a key causeof energy dissipation. When many sensors transmit; the resources of the recipient of the dataare taxed; hence; limiting communication will benefit the recipient as well. We show howtime series generated by sensors can be captured and stored in a database system(archive). Sensors compress time series instead of sending them in raw form. We proposean optimal online algorithm for constructing a piecewise constant approximation (PCA) of atime series which guarantees that the compressed representation satisfies an error boundon the L/sub/spl infin//distance. In addition to the capture task; we often want to estimate thevalues of a time series ahead of time; eg; to answer real-time queries. To achieve this …,Data Engineering; 2003.

Specifically; weconsider a situation where entities in the database are referred to using descriptions (eg; aset of instantiated attributes). The objective of reference disambiguation is to identify theunique entity to which each description corresponds. The key difference between theapproach we propose (called RelDC) and the traditional techniques is that RelDC analyzesnot only object features but also inter-object relationships to improve the disambiguationquality. Our extensive experiments over two real data sets and over synthetic datasets showthat analysis of relationships significantly improves quality of the result.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,185
A relevance feedback architecture for content-based multimedia information retrieval systems,Yong Rui Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Sharad Mehrotra; Michael Ortega,Content-based multimedia information retrieval (MIR) has become one of the most activeresearch areas in the past few years. Many retrieval approaches based on extracting andrepresenting visual properties of multimedia data have been developed. While theseapproaches establish the viability of MIR based on visual features; techniques forincorporating human expertise directly during the query process to improve retrievalperformance have not drawn enough attention. To address this limitation; this paperintroduces a human-computer interaction based approach to MIR in which the user guidesthe system during retrieval using relevance feedback.

INCAs: Managing dynamic workflows in distributed environments,Daniel Barbara; Sharad Mehrotra; Marek Rusinkiewicz,Abstract A workflow is a long-duration multi-step activity. In this paper we are interested inworkflows that execute under the control of various processing stations that may be locatedat different nodes of a distributed system. The stations may be autonomous and only partiallyautomated. We present the design and a proposed implementation of a new model forworkflow management that is based on a concept of an Information Carriers (INCA).Workflow computations are carried out as interactions between INCAs and the processingstations with the locus of control of a computation migrating with the workflow. The modelpresented is modular in the sense that modification of a sub-activities of the workflow doesnot necessarily require changes to the workflow specification.

Secure multidimensional range queries over outsourced data,Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra; Mustafa Canim; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of supporting multidimensional range querieson encrypted data. The problem is motivated by secure data outsourcing applications wherea client may store his/her data on a remote server in encrypted form and want to executequeries using server's computational capabilities. The solution approach is to compute asecure indexing tag of the data by applying bucketization (a generic form of datapartitioning) which prevents the server from learning exact values but still allows it to check ifa record satisfies the query predicate. Queries are evaluated in an approximate mannerwhere the returned set of records may contain some false positives. These records thenneed to be weeded out by the client which comprises the computational overhead of ourscheme. We develop a bucketization procedure for answering multidimensional range …,The VLDB Journal,2012,156
Query optimization for massively parallel data processing,Sai Wu; Feng Li; Sharad Mehrotra; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract MapReduce has been widely recognized as an efficient tool for large-scale dataanalysis. It achieves high performance by exploiting parallelism among processing nodeswhile providing a simple interface for upper-layer applications. Some vendors haveenhanced their data warehouse systems by integrating MapReduce into the systems.However; existing MapReduce-based query processing systems; such as Hive; fall short ofthe query optimization and competency of conventional database systems. Given an SQLquery; Hive translates the query into a set of MapReduce jobs sentence by sentence.

Query reformulation for content based multimedia retrieval in MARS,Kriengkrai Porkaew; Michael Ortega; S Mehrota,Unlike traditional database management systems; in content-based multimedia retrievaldatabases; it is difficult for users to express their exact information need directly in a precisequery. A typical interface allows users to express their information need using examples ofobjects similar to the ones they wish to retrieve. Such a user interface; however; requiresmechanisms to learn the query representation from the examples. In this paper; we describethe query refinement framework implemented in the Multimedia Analysis and RetrievalSystem (MARS) for learning query representations using relevance feedback. The proposedframework uses a query expansion approach towards modifying the query representation inwhich relevant objects are added to the query. Furthermore; query reweighting techniquesare used to adjust similarity functions.,Multimedia Computing and Systems; 1999. IEEE International Conference on,1999,130

However; treating security and privacy issues as an afterthought oftenresults in inefficient implementations. Some notable RDBMS storage models (such as the N-ary Storage Model) suffer from this problem. In this work; we analyze issues in storagesecurity and discuss a number of trade-offs between security and efficiency.

Energy efficient data collection in distributed sensor environments,Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Sensors are typically deployed to gather data about the physical world and its artifacts for avariety of purposes that range from environment monitoring; control; to data analysis. Sincesensors are resource constrained; often sensor data is collected into a sensor database thatresides at (more powerful) servers. A natural tradeoff exists between the sensor resources(bandwidth; energy) consumed and the quality of data collected at the server. Blindlytransmitting sensor updates at a fixed periodicity to the server results in a suboptimalsolution due to the differences in stability of sensor values and due to the varying applicationneeds that impose different quality requirements across sensors. We propose adaptive datacollection mechanisms for sensor environments that adjusts to these variations while at thesame time optimizing the energy consumption of sensors.

A type of such information is mobile objects;ie; objects whose location changes continuously with time. Various techniques have beenproposed to address problems of incorporating such objects in databases. In this paper; weintroduce new query processing techniques for dynamic queries over mobile objects; ie;queries that are themselves continuously changing with time. Dynamic queries are natural insituational awareness systems when an observer is navigating through space. All objectsvisible by the observer must be retrieved and presented to her at very high rates; to ensure ahigh-quality visualization. We show how our proposed techniques offer a great performanceimprovement over a traditional approach of multiple instantaneous queries.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,108
Querying mobile objects in spatio-temporal databases,Kriengkrai Porkaew; Iosif Lazaridis; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract In dynamic spatio-temporal environments where objects may continuously move inspace; maintaining consistent information about the location of objects and processingmotion-specific queries is a challenging problem. In this paper; we focus on indexing andquery processing techniques for mobile objects. Specifically; we develop a classification ofdifferent types of selection queries that arise in mobile environments and explore efficientalgorithms to evaluate them. Query processing algorithms are developed for both nativespace and parametric space indexing techniques. A performance study compares the twoindexing strategies for different types of queries.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,108

The concurrency control problem in multidatabases: Characteristics and solutions,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Yuri Breitbart; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract A Multidatabase System (MDBS) is a collection of local database managementsystems; each of which may follow a different concurrency control protocol. Thisheterogeneity makes the task of ensuring global serializability in an MDBS environmentdifficult. In this paper; we reduce the problem of ensuring global serializability to the problemof ensuring serializability in a centralized database system. We identify characteristics of theconcurrency control problem in an MDBS environment; and additional requirements onconcurrency control schemes for ensuring global serializability. We then develop a range ofconcurrency control schemes that ensure global serializability in an MDBS environment; andat the same time meet the requirements. Finally; we study the tradeoffs between thecomplexities of the various schemes and the degree of concurrency provided by each of …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1992,99
DrillSim: a simulation framework for emergency response drills,Vidhya Balasubramanian; Daniel Massaguer; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Responding to natural or man-made disasters in a timely and effective manner canreduce deaths and injuries; contain or prevent secondary disasters; and reduce the resultingeconomic losses and social disruption. Appropriate IT solutions can improve this response.However; exhaustive and realistic validation of these IT solutions is difficult; proofs are notavailable; simulations lack realism; and drills are expensive and cannot be reproduced. Thispaper presents DrillSim: a simulation environment that plays out the activities of a crisisresponse (eg; evacuation). It has capabilities to integrate real-life drills into a simulatedresponse activity using an instrumented environment with sensing and communicationcapabilities.

Non-serializable executions in heterogeneous distributed database systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,The concept of serializability has been the traditionally accepted notion of correctness indatabase systems. However; in a heterogeneous distributed database system (HDBMS)environment; ensuring serializability is a difficult task mainly due to the desire of preservingthe local autonomy of the participating local database systems. The authors introduce a newcorrectness criterion fur HDBMSs; two-level serializability (2LSR); and show that it preservesdatabase consistency in several HDBMS models. Further; they present a simple protocol forensuring that schedules in an HDBMS environment are 2LSR. This protocol is easilyimplementable and does not violate the local autonomy of sites.,Parallel and Distributed Information Systems; 1991.; Proceedings of the First International Conference on,1991,85
Exploiting relationships for object consolidation,Zhaoqi Chen; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Data mining practitioners frequently have to spend significant portion of their projecttime on data preprocessing before they can apply their algorithms on real-world datasets.Such a preprocessing is required because many real-world datasets are not perfect; butrather they contain missing; erroneous; duplicate data and other data cleaning problems. Itis a well established fact that; in general; if such problems with data are not corrected;applying data mining algorithm can lead to wrong results. The latter is known as the"garbage in; garbage out" principle. Given the significance of the problem; numerous datacleaning techniques have been designed in the past to address the aforementionedproblems with data. In this paper; we address one of the data cleaning challenges; calledobject consolidation. This important challenge arises because objects in datasets are …,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Information quality in information systems,2005,84
Adaptive target tracking in sensor networks,Xingbo Yu; Koushik Niyogi; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Recent advances in processor; memory and radio technology have enabled cheapnodes capable of sensing; communication and processing. Networks of distributedmicrosensors are rapidly emerging as a feasible solution to a wide range of data gatheringapplications. However; the key impediments to successful deployment of microsensor nodesare their energy and longevity constraints. We propose a quality aware informationcollection protocol in sensor networks for tracking applications. The protocol explores trade-off between energy and application quality to significantly reduce energy consumption in thesensor network thereby enhancing the lifetimes of sensor nodes. Simulation results overelementary movement patterns in a tracking application scenario strengthen the merits ofour adaptive information collection framework.,Communication Networks and Distributed Systems Modeling and Simulation Conference (CNDS’04),2004,84

Adaptive graphical approach to entity resolution,Zhaoqi Chen; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Entity resolution is a very common Information Quality (IQ) problem with manydifferent applications. In digital libraries; it is related to problems of citation matching andauthor name disambiguation; in Natural Language Processing; it is related to coreferencematching and object identity; in Web application; it is related to Web page disambiguation.The problem of Entity Resolution arises because objects/entities in real world datasets areoften referred to by descriptions; which might not be unique identifiers of these entities;leading to ambiguity. The goal is to group all the entity descriptions that refer to the samereal world entities. In this paper we present a graphical approach for entity resolution. Itcomplements the traditional methodology with the analysis of the entity-relationship graphconstructed for the dataset being analyzed.

Automatic matching tool selection using relevance feedback in MARS,Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Sharad Mehrotra; Michael Ortega,ABSTRACT For a given visual feature; due to the diversity of human's subjective judgment; avisual information retrieval system that supports a single prefixed similarity measure willresult in poor retrieval performance. To address this problem; this paper proposes theconcept of similarity matching toolkit which consists of different similarity measuressimulating human's perceptions of the given feature from different aspects. The toolkitsupports a feedback-driven tool selection mechanism which adapts to the similarity measurethat best fits the user's perception. To illustrate the advantage of the proposed toolkitapproach; we apply it to shape-based image retrieval.

Web people search via connection analysis,Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Zhaoqi Chen; Sharad Mehrotra; Rabia Nuray-Turan,Nowadays; searches for Webpages of a person with a given name constitute a notablefraction of queries to web search engines. Such a query would normally return Webpagesrelated to several namesakes; who happened to have the queried name; leaving the burdenof disambiguating and collecting pages relevant to a particular person (from among thenamesakes) on the user. In this article we develop a Web People Search approach thatclusters Webpages based on their association to different people. Our method exploits avariety of semantic information extracted from Web pages; such as named entities andhyperlinks; to disambiguate among namesakes referred to on the Web pages. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by testing the efficacy of the disambiguationalgorithms and its impact on person search.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,73
Multi-agent simulation of disaster response,Daniel Massaguer; Vidhya Balasubramanian; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,ABSTRACT Information Technology has the potential of improving the quality and theamount of information humans receive during emergency response. Testing this technologyin realistic and flexible environments is a non-trivial task. DrillSim is an augmented realitysimulation environment for testing IT solutions. It provides an environment where scientistsand developers can bring their IT solutions and test their effectiveness on the context ofdisaster response. The architecture of DrillSim is based on a multi-agent simulation. Thesimulation of the disaster response activity is achieved by modeling each person involved asan agent. This finer granularity provides extensibility to the system since new scenarios canbe defined by defining new agents. This paper presents the architecture of DrillSim andexplains in detail how DrillSim deals with the edition and addition of agent roles.,First international workshop on agent technology for disaster management,2006,73
Exploiting context analysis for combining multiple entity resolution systems,Zhaoqi Chen; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Entity Resolution (ER) is an important real world problem that has attractedsignificant research interest over the past few years. It deals with determining which objectdescriptions co-refer in a dataset. Due to its practical significance for data mining and dataanalysis tasks many different ER approaches has been developed to address the ERchallenge. This paper proposes a new ER Ensemble framework. The task of ER Ensembleis to combine the results of multiple base-level ER systems into a single solution with thegoal of increasing the quality of ER. The framework proposed in this paper leverages theobservation that often no single ER method always performs the best; consistentlyoutperforming other ER techniques in terms of quality. Instead; different ER solutionsperform better in different contexts.

An approach to integrating query refinement in SQL,Michael Ortega-Binderberger; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract With the emergence of applications that require contentbased similarity retrieval;techniques to support such a retrieval paradigm over database systems have emerged as acritical area of research. User subjectivity is an important aspect of such queries; ie; whichobjects are relevant to the user and which are not depends on the perception of the user.Query refinement is used to handle user subjectivity in similarity search systems. This paperexplores how to enhance database systems with query refinement for content-based(similarity) searches in object-relational databases.

Evaluating refined queries in top-k retrieval systems,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Michael Ortega-Binderberger; Sharad Mehrotra; Kriengkrai Porkaew,In many applications; users specify target values for certain attributes/features withoutrequiring exact matches to these values in return. Instead; the result is typically a ranked listof" top k" objects that best match the specified feature values. User subjectivity is animportant aspect of such queries; ie; which objects are relevant to the user and which are notdepends on the perception of the user. Due to the subjective nature of top-k queries; theanswers returned by the system to an user query often do not satisfy the users need rightaway; either because the weights and the distance functions associated with the features donot accurately capture the users perception or because the specified target values do notfully capture her information need or both. In such cases; the user would like to refine thequery and resubmit it in order to get back a better set of answers.

Method for proximity searching with range testing and range adjustment,*,A method of searching a database having a plurality of objects is provided. Each objectincludes attributes and; for each attribute; a number of values. A query specifies twoattributes and a maximum distance. A respective set of ranges is established for each objectthat has a value for the first attribute. Each set includes a range for each value of the firstattribute. Each range is defined by minimum and maximum location values. A test range isestablished for one of the ranges. The test range has values equal to the minimum andmaximum values of one of the ranges. The test range is adjusted; if necessary; so that itincludes one of the values of the second attribute of the corresponding object. The test rangeis added to a group of ranges corresponding to the object if the minimum and maximum testvalues do not differ from one another by more than the maximum distance.

The proposedrepresentation is invariant to scale; translation and rotation. The representation is amenableto indexing using existing multidimensional index structures and can thus support efficientsimilarity retrieval.

Dynamic granular locking approach to phantom protection in r-trees,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Sharad Mehrotra,Over the last decade (1988-98); the R tree has emerged as one of the most robustmultidimensional access methods. However; before the R tree can be integrated as anaccess method to a commercial strength database management system; efficient techniquesto provide transactional access to data via R trees need to be developed. Concurrent accessto data through a multidimensional data structure introduces the problem of protectingranges specified in the retrieval from phantom insertions and deletions (the phantomproblem). Existing approaches to phantom protection in B trees (namely; key range locking)cannot be applied to multidimensional data structures since they rely on a total order overthe key space on which the B tree is designed.

Multimedia analysis and retrieval system,Sharad Mehrotra; Yong Rui; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Micheal Ortega; Thomas S Huang,With the advances in storage technology and the advent of the World Wide Web; there hasbeen an explosion in the amount and complexity of digital information being generated;analyzed; stored; accessed and transmitted. Most of this data is multimedia in nature;including digital images; video; audio and simple text data. To make use of this vast amountof multimedia data; we need to develop techniques to e ciently retrieve information overlarge multimedia repositories based on their content. Due to the di culty in capturing thecontent of multimedia objects using textual annotations and the non-scalability of theapproach to large data sets (due to a high degree of manual e ort required in de ning theannotations); the approach based on supporting content-based retrieval over visual featureshas become a promising research direction.

Efficient query refinement in multimedia databases,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Kriengkrai Porkaew; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Large repositories of multimedia objects containing digital images; video; audio andtext documents are becoming common. There is an increasing application need to searchthese repositories based on their content. Examples include online shopping (eg;“Find meall shirts that look like this one); medical applications (eg;“Find all tumors similar to a givenpattern”); face recognition; trademark searches; audio retrieval and content-based videobrowsing/searching. To address this need; we are building the Multimedia Analysis andRetrieval System (MARS); a system for effective and efﬁcient content-based searching andbrowsing of large scale multimedia repositories [2].

Efficient concurrency control in multidimensional access methods,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract The importance of multidimensional index structures to numerous emergingdatabase applications is well established. However; before these index structures can besupported as access methods (AMs) in a “commercial-strength” database managementsystem (DBMS); efficient techniques to provide transactional access to data via the indexstructure must be developed. Concurrent accesses to data via index structures introduce theproblem of protecting ranges specified in the retrieval from phantom insertions and deletions(the phantom problem).

W 3-privacy: understanding what; when; and where inference channels in multi-camera surveillance video,Mukesh Saini; Pradeep K Atrey; Sharad Mehrotra; Mohan Kankanhalli,Abstract Huge amounts of video are being recorded every day by surveillance systems.Since video is capable of recording and preserving an enormous amount of informationwhich can be used in many applications; it is worth examining the degree of privacy loss thatmight occur due to public access to the recorded video. A fundamental requirement ofprivacy solutions is an understanding and analysis of the inference channels than can leadto a breach of privacy. Though inference channels and privacy risks are well studied intraditional data sharing applications (eg; hospitals sharing patient records for data analysis);privacy assessments of video data have been limited to the direct identifiers such aspeople's faces in the video. Other important inference channels such as location (Where);time (When); and activities (What) are generally overlooked. In this paper we propose a …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2014,51

Similarity search using multiple examples in MARS,Kriengkrai Porkaew; Sharad Mehrotra; Michael Ortega; Kaushik Chakrabarti,Abstract Unlike traditional database management systems; in multimedia databases thatsupport content-based retrieval over multimedia objects; it is difficult for users to expresstheir exact information need directly in the form of a precise query. A typical interfacesupported by content-based retrieval systems allows users to express their query in the formof examples of objects similar to the ones they wish to retrieve. Such a user interface;however; requires mechanisms to learn the query representation from the examplesprovided by the user. In our previous work; we proposed a query refinement mechanism inwhich a query representation is modified by adding new relevant examples based on userfeedback. In this paper; we describe query processing mechanisms that can efficientlysupport query expansion using multidimensional index structures.,International Conference on Advances in Visual Information Systems,1999,48

Relevance feedback techniques in the MARS image retrieval system,Michael Ortega-Binderberger; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has become one of the most active researchareas in the past few years. Many visual feature representations have been explored andmany systems built. In this paper; we focus on an important component of these systems-relevance feedback-and how we incorporated it into the MARS retrieval system. Relevancefeedback techniques are based on an interactive retrieval approach to effectively take intoaccount user preferences to provide an improved search experience. We present a series ofcoherent strategies; from single-point to multipoint and multifeature approaches that wehave seamlessly integrated into our system and present experimental results to show theirretrieval performance characteristics.

Towards breaking the quality curse.: a web-querying approach to web people search.,Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Rabia Nuray-Turan; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Searching for people on the Web is one of the most common query types to the websearch engines today. However; when a person name is queried; the returned webpagesoften contain documents related to several distinct namesakes who have the queried name.The task of disambiguating and finding the webpages related to the specific person ofinterest is left to the user. Many Web People Search (WePS) approaches have beendeveloped recently that attempt to automate this disambiguation process. Nevertheless; thedisambiguation quality of these techniques leaves a major room for improvement. Thispaper presents a new server-side WePS approach. It is based on collecting co-occurrenceinformation from theWeb and thus it uses theWeb as an external data source.

Ensuring the integrity of encrypted databases in the database-as-a-service model,Hakan Hacigümüş; Bala Iyer; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract In the database-as-a-service model; a service provider hosts the clients' data andallows access to the data through the Internet. Database-as-a-service model offersconsiderable benefits to organizations with data management needs by allowing them tooutsource their data management infrastructures. Yet; the model introduces many significantchallenges; in particular that of data privacy and security. Ensuring the integrity of thedatabase; which is hosted by a service provider; is a critical and challenging problem in thiscontext. We propose an encrypted database integrity assurance scheme; which allows theowner of the data to ensure the integrity of the database hosted at the service provider site;in addition to the security of the stored data against malicious attacks.,*,2004,43

A unified framework for context assisted face clustering,Liyan Zhang; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Automatic face clustering; which aims to group faces referring to the same peopletogether; is a key component for face tagging and image management. Standard faceclustering approaches that are based on analyzing facial features can already achieve high-precision results. However; they often suffer from low recall due to the large variation offaces in pose; expression; illumination; occlusion; etc. To improve the clustering recallwithout reducing the high precision; we leverage the heterogeneous context information toiteratively merge the clusters referring to same entities.

Privacy-protecting video surveillance,Jehan Wickramasuriya; Mohanned Alhazzazi; Mahesh Datt; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Forms of surveillance are very quickly becoming an integral part of crime control policy;crisis management; social control theory and community consciousness. In turn; it has beenused as a simple and effective solution to many of these problems. However; privacy-relatedconcerns have been expressed over the development and deployment of this technology.Used properly; video cameras help expose wrongdoing but typically come at the cost ofprivacy to those not involved in any maleficent activity. This work describes the design andimplementation of a real-time; privacy-protecting data collection infrastructure that fusesadditional sensor information (eg Radio-frequency) with video streams and an accesscontrol framework in order to make decisions about how and when to display the individualsunder surveillance.

Applying semantic association to support content-based video retrieval,Yueting Zhuang; Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Sharad Mehrotra,ABSTRACT The traditional approach to video retrieval is to rst annotate the video by textual information(titles and key words) and then the queries will be searched based on this keyword set. Sinceautomatic annotation has not yet been available; this work needs great amount of labor and hasbeen proved to be unrealistic in appli- cations. Another approach; which seems to be at the otherextreme; is to utilize the low-level video content; such as color; texture; shape; motion featuresand so on; in an attempt to get rid of the need of key words annotation. We hold the view in thispaper that a user preferable query form should include both the keywords and videocontents. In this paper; we will explore the seman- tic aspect based on video TOC structuring1]. Close- captioning is used to extract a basic keywords set. Word- Net; an electronic lexicalsystem; is used to provide semantic association. The approach has been applied in Web …,Proc. of IEEE VLBV98 workshop,1998,37
Crisis management,Sharad Mehrotra; Taieb Znati; Craig W Thompson,Crisis Response Depending on a disaster's magnitude; crisis response might be alarge-scale; multi-organizational operation involving many layers of government; public au- thorities(such as state-managed utility companies); commercial entities; volun- teer organizations; mediaorganizations; and the public. In a crisis; these entities work together as a loosely coupledvir- tual organization to save lives; preserve infrastructure and community resourc- es; and reestablishnormalcy within the community. This virtual organization's operation can span multiplelevels. Field-level operations such as crisis containment; evacuation; traffic man- agement;triage; decontamination; and medical services' provision are usually under the control of anon-site incident commander who reports back to a cen- tral emergency operations center(EOC).

Progressive approach to relational entity resolution,Yasser Altowim; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract This paper proposes a progressive approach to entity resolution (ER) that allowsusers to explore a trade-off between the resolution cost and the achieved quality of theresolved data. In particular; our approach aims to produce the highest quality result given aconstraint on the resolution budget; specified by the user. Our proposed method monitorsand dynamically reassesses the resolution progress to determine which parts of the datashould be resolved next and how they should be resolved. The comprehensive empiricalevaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its significant advantage in terms ofefficiency over the traditional ER techniques for the given problem settings.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,34
Efficient processing of proximity queries for large databases,Walid G Aref; Daniel Barbara; Stephen Johnson; Sharad Mehrotra,Emerging multimedia applications require database systems to provide support for newtypes of objects and to process queries that may have no parallel in traditional databaseapplications. One such important class of queries are the proximity queries that aims toretrieve objects in the database that are related by a distance metric in a way that isspecified by the query. The importance of proximity queries has earlier been realized indeveloping constructs for visual languages. In this paper; we present algorithms foranswering a class of proximity queries-fixed-radius nearest-neighbor queries over pointobject. Processing proximity queries using existing query processing techniques results inhigh CPU and I/O costs. We develop new algorithms to answer proximity queries overobjects that lie in the one-dimensional space (eg; words in a document). The algorithms …,Data Engineering; 1995.

Efficient key updates in encrypted database systems,*,A system; method and programmed article of manufacture to perform efficient encryption keyupdates in encrypted database-as-a-service (DAS) environments using a key registry andkey locks. A database as a service environment allows organizations to send their datamanagement infrastructures to a database service provider. The service provider employsdata encryption techniques to ensure the privacy of hosted data. The security of encryptiontechniques relies on the confidentiality of the encryption keys. The dynamic nature of theencrypted database in the DAS model adds complexity and raises specific requirements onkey management techniques. The solution is provided by the key registry and by the keyupdate lock; key management process and log management process to allow data updateaccess to data concurrently with encryption key update for the same data.,*,2010,33
Browsing and retrieving video content in a unified framework,Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Sharad Mehrotra,In this paper; we first review the recent research progress in video analysis; representation;browsing; and retrieval. Motivated by the mechanism used to access a book's content; wethen present novel techniques for constructing video table-of-contents and index to facilitateaccessing video's content. We further explore the relationship between video browsing andretrieval and propose a unified framework to incorporate both entities in a seamless way.Preliminary research results justify our proposed framework for providing access to videosbased on their content.,Multimedia Signal Processing; 1998 IEEE Second Workshop on,1998,33
On correctness of nonserializable executions,Rajeev Rastogi; Sharad Mehrotra; Yuri Breitbart; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract In a number of application environments (eg; computer aided design);serializability; the traditionally accepted notion of correctness has been found to be toorestrictive; and a number of alternate criteria have been proposed in the literature. One suchcriterion ispredicate-wise serializability (PWSR) which requires only restrictions of schedulesthat access subsets of the database over which integrity constraints are defined to beserializable. In this paper; we identify restrictions on the structure of transaction programs;their concurrent execution; and their access characteristics under which PWSR schedulespreserve database consistency.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1998,33
OMP: A RISC-based multiprocessor using orthogonal-access memories and multiple spanning buses,Kai Hwang; Michel Dubois; Dhabaleswar K Panda; S Rao; Shisheng Shang; A Uresin; W Mao; H Nair; M Lytwyn; F Hsieh; J Liu; Sharad Mehrotra; Chien-Ming Cheng,Abstract This paper presents the architectural design and RISC based implementation of aprototype supercomputer; namely the Orthogonal MultiProcessor (OMP). The OMP system isconstructed with 16 Intel 1860 RISC microprocessors and 256 parallel memory modules;which are 2-D interleaved and orthogonally accessed using custom-designed spanningbuses. The architectural design has been validated by a CSIM-based multiprocessorsimulator. The design choices are based on worst-case delay analysis and simulationvalidation.

Context-based person identification framework for smart video surveillance,Liyan Zhang; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra; Ronen Vaisenberg,Abstract Smart video surveillance (SVS) applications enhance situational awareness byallowing domain analysts to focus on the events of higher priority. SVS approaches operateby trying to extract and interpret higher “semantic” level events that occur in video. One of thekey challenges of SVS is that of person identification where the task is for each subject thatoccurs in a video shot to identify the person it corresponds to. The problem of personidentification is especially challenging in resource-constrained environments wheretransmission delay; bandwidth restriction; and packet loss may prevent the capture of high-quality data. Conventional person identification approaches which primarily are based onanalyzing facial features are often not sufficient to deal with poor-quality data. To addressthis challenge; we propose a framework that leverages heterogeneous contextual …,Machine Vision and Applications,2014,31

Architecture for an automatic customized warning system,Mirko Montanari; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Public communication during natural and man-made disasters is a key issue that must beaddressed to protect lives and properties. The choice of the best protective actions to takedepends on a global situation-awareness that is not available to the general public.Emergency personnel and public authorities have the duty to inform the population before;during and after catastrophic events to support the disaster response. In this paper wedescribe the design and the implementation of PWS (Policy-driven Warning System); asystem for public warning dissemination. PWS is not intended to replace existing systems orprocedures; but to serve on top of them in order to leverage the current emergency responseknowledge.,Intelligence and Security Informatics; 2007 IEEE,2007,31
Approximate selection queries over imprecise data,Iosif Lazaridis; Sharad Mehrotra,We examine the problem of evaluating selection queries over imprecisely representedobjects. Such objects are used either because they are much smaller in size than theprecise ones (eg; compressed versions of time series); or as imprecise replicas of fast-changing objects across the network (eg; interval approximations for time-varying sensorreadings). It may be impossible to determine whether an imprecise object meets theselection predicate. Additionally; the objects appearing in the output are also imprecise.Retrieving the precise objects themselves (at additional cost) can be used to increase thequality of the reported answer. We allow queries to specify their own answer qualityrequirements. We show how the query evaluation system may do the minimal amount ofwork to meet these requirements.

Search on encrypted data,Hakan Hacıgümüş; Bijit Hore; Bala Iyer; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract The proliferation of a new breed of data management applications that store andprocess data at remote locations has led to the emergence of search over encrypted data asan important research problem. In a typical setting of the problem; data is stored at theremote location in an encrypted form. A query generated at the clientside is transformed intoa representation such that it can be evaluated directly on encrypted data at the remotelocation. The results might be processed by the client after decryption to determine the finalanswers.,*,2007,30
Querying encrypted XML documents,Ravi Chandra Jammalamadaka; Sharad Mehrotra,This paper proposes techniques to query encrypted XML documents. Such a problempredominantly occurs in" database as a service"(DAS) architectures; where a client mayoutsource data to a service provider that provides data management services. Security is ofparamount concern; as the service provider itself may be untrusted. Encryption offers anatural solution to preserve the confidentiality of the client's data. The challenge now is toexecute queries over the encrypted data; without decrypting them at the server side. In thispaper we develop: 1) primitives using which a client can specify the sensitive parts of theXML documents; 2) mechanisms to map the XML documents to encrypted representationthat hides sensitive portions of the documents; and 3) techniques to run SPJ (selection-projection-join) queries over encrypted XML documents.

We propose a principled frameworkfor distributing data and processing in a hybrid cloud that meets the conflicting goals ofperformance; sensitive data disclosure risk and resource allocation costs. The proposedsolution is implemented as an add-on tool for a Hadoop and Hive based cloud computinginfrastructure. Our experiments demonstrate that the developed mechanism can lead to amajor performance gain by exploiting both the hybrid cloud components without violatingany pre-determined public cloud usage constraints.,Cloud Computing (CLOUD); 2012 IEEE 5th International Conference on,2012,28
Toward managing uncertain spatial information for situational awareness applications,Yiming Ma; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Situational awareness (SA) applications monitor the real world and the entities therein tosupport tasks such as rapid decision-making; reasoning; and analysis.

Location is oneof the most important attributes of events; useful for a variety of SA tasks. In this article; weconsider the problem of reaching situation awareness from textual input. We propose anapproach to probabilistically model and represent (potentially uncertain) event locationsdescribed by human reporters in the form of free text. We analyze several types of spatialqueries of interest in SA applications. We design techniques to store and index the models;to support the efficient processing of queries.

Flexible anonymization for privacy preserving data publishing: A systematic search based approach,Bijit Hore; Ravi Chandra Jammalamadaka; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract k-anonymity is a popular measure of privacy for data publishing: It measures therisk of identity-disclosure of individuals whose personal information are released in the formof published data for statistical analysis and data mining purposes (eg census data). Highervalues of k denote higher level of privacy (smaller risk of disclosure). Existing techniques toachieve k-anonymity use a variety of “generalization” and “suppression” of cell values formulti-attribute data. At the same time; the released data needs to be as “information-rich” aspossible to maximize its utility. Information loss becomes an even greater concern as morestringent privacy constraints are imposed [4]. The resulting optimization problems haveproven to be computationally intensive for data sets with large attribute-domains. In thispaper; we develop a systematic enumeration based branch-and-bound technique that …,*,2007,28
Ensuring consistency in multidatabases by preserving two-level serializability,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract The concept of serializability has been the traditionally accepted correctnesscriterion in database systems. However in multidatabase systems (MDBSs); ensuring globalserializability is a difficult task. The difficulty arises due to the heterogeneity of theconcurrency control protocols used by the participating local database managementsystems (DBMSs); and the desire to preserve the autonomy of the local DBMSs. In general;solutions to the global serializability problem result in executions with a low degree ofconcurrency. The alternative; relaxed serializability; may result in data inconsistency. In thisarticle; we introduce a systematic approach to relaxing the serializability requirement inMDBS environments. Our approach exploits the structure of the integrity constraints and thenature of transaction programs to ensure consistency without requiring executions to be …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1998,28
Flashback: A peer-to-peerweb server for flash crowds,Mayur Deshpande; Abhishek Amit; Mason Chang; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Sharad Mehrotra,We present Flashback; a ready-to-use system for scalably handling large unexpected trafficspikes on web-sites. Unlike previous systems; our approach does not rely on anyintermediate nodes to cache content. Instead; the clients (browsers) create a dynamic; self-scaling peer-to-peer (P2P) Web-server that grows and shrinks according to the load. Thisapproach translates into a challenging problem-a P2P data exchange protocol that canoperate in churn rates where more than 90% of peers can leave the overlay in under 10seconds. This is at least an order of magnitude higher churn rate than previously addressedresearch. Additionally; our system operates under two strict constraints-users are assuredthat they upload only as much as they download and second; end-user browsing experienceis preserved; ie; low latency downloads and zero configuration or download of any …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2007.

Supporting efficient record linkage for large data sets using mapping techniques,Chen Li; Liang Jin; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract This paper describes an efficient approach to record linkage. Given two lists ofrecords; the record-linkage problem consists of determining all pairs that are similar to eachother; where the overall similarity between two records is defined based on domain-specificsimilarities over individual attributes. The record-linkage problem arises naturally in thecontext of data cleansing that usually precedes data analysis and mining. Since thescalability issue of record linkage was addressed in [21]; the repertoire of databasetechniques dealing with multidimensional data sets has significantly increased. Specifically;many effective and efficient approaches for distance-preserving transforms and similarityjoins have been developed. Based on these advances; we explore a novel approach torecord linkage. For each attribute of records; we first map values to a multidimensional …,World Wide Web,2006,27

On summarization and timeline generation for evolutionary tweet streams,Zhenhua Wang; Lidan Shou; Ke Chen; Gang Chen; Sharad Mehrotra,Short-text messages such as tweets are being created and shared at an unprecedentedrate. Tweets; in their raw form; while being informative; can also be overwhelming. For bothend-users and data analysts; it is a nightmare to plow through millions of tweets whichcontain enormous amount of noise and redundancy. In this paper; we propose a novelcontinuous summarization framework called Sumblr to alleviate the problem. In contrast tothe traditional document summarization methods which focus on static and small-scale dataset; Sumblr is designed to deal with dynamic; fast arriving; and large-scale tweet streams.Our proposed framework consists of three major components.

Building disclosure risk aware query optimizers for relational databases,Mustafa Canim; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Many DBMS products in the market provide built in encryption support to deal withthe security concerns of the organizations. This solution is quite effective in preventing dataleakage from compromised/stolen storage devices. However; recent studies show that asignificant part of the leaked records have been done so by using specialized malwares thatcan access the main memory of systems. These malwares can easily capture the sensitiveinformation that are decrypted in the memory including the cryptographic keys used todecrypt them. This can further compromise the security of data residing on disk that areencrypted with the same keys. In this paper we quantify the disclosure risk of encrypted datain a relational DBMS for main memory-based attacks and propose modifications to thestandard query processing mechanism to minimize such risks. Specifically; we propose …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,25

Index for fast retrieval of uncertain spatial point data,Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Yiming Ma; Sharad Mehrotra; Ramaswamy Hariharan,Abstract Location information gathered from a variety of sources in the form of sensor data;video streams; human observations; and so on; is often imprecise and uncertain and needsto be represented approximately. To represent such uncertain location information; the useof a probabilistic model that captures the imprecise location as a probability density function(pdf) has been recently proposed. The pdfs can be arbitrarily complex depending on thetype of application and the source of imprecision. Hence; efficiently representing; storing andquerying pdfs is a very challenging task. While the current state of the art indexingapproaches treat the representation and storage of pdfs as a black box; in this paper; wetake the challenge of representing and storing any complex pdf in an efficient way.

Privacy modeling for video data publication,Mukesh Saini; Pradeep K Atrey; Sharad Mehrotra; Sabu Emmanuel; Mohan Kankanhalli,Video cameras are being extensively used in many applications. Huge amounts of video arebeing recorded and stored everyday by surveillance systems. Any proposed application ofthis data raises severe privacy concerns. An assessment of privacy loss is necessary beforeany potential application of the data. In traditional methods of privacy modeling; researchershave focused on explicit means of identity leakage like facial information; etc. However;other implicit inference channels through which individual's an identity can be learned havenot been considered. For example; an adversary can observe the behavior; look at theplaces visited and combine that with the temporal information to infer the identity of theperson in the video. In this work; we thoroughly investigate privacy issues involved with thevideo data considering both implicit and explicit channels.

Middleware for pervasive spaces: Balancing privacy and utility,Daniel Massaguer; Bijit Hore; Mamadou H Diallo; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Middleware for pervasive spaces has to meet conflicting requirements. It has to bothmaximize the utility of the information exposed and ensure that this information does notviolate users' privacy. In order to resolve these conflicts; we propose a framework groundedin utility theory where users dynamically control the level of disclosure about theirinformation. We begin by providing appropriate definitions of privacy and utility for the type ofapplications that would support collaborative work in an office environment—currentdefinitions of privacy and anonymity do not apply in this context. We propose a distributedsolution that; given a user's background knowledge; maximizes the utility of the informationbeing disclosed to information recipients while meeting the privacy requirements of users.We implement our solution in the context of a real pervasive space middleware and …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2009,23

A semantics-based approach for speech annotation of images,Dmitri Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra; Jie Xu; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Associating textual annotations/tags with multimedia content is among the most effectiveapproaches to organize and to support search over digital images and multimediadatabases. Despite advances in multimedia analysis; effective tagging remains largely amanual process wherein users add descriptive tags by hand; usually when uploading orbrowsing the collection; much after the pictures have been taken. This approach; however; isnot convenient in all situations or for many applications; eg; when users would like to publishand share pictures with others in real time. An alternate approach is to instead utilize aspeech interface using which users may specify image tags that can be transcribed intotextual annotations by employing automated speech recognizers. Such a speech-basedapproach has all the benefits of human tagging without the cumbersomeness and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,22
Anonymous surveillance,Mukesh Saini; Pradeep Atrey; Sharad Mehrotra; Mohan Kankanhalli,Video surveillance is a very effective tool of surveillance that enables a single security agentto monitor wide areas. However; it compromises the privacy of the individuals. There havebeen attempts to obfuscate face and silhouette regions of the images to hide the identity ofindividuals. We recognize that in traditional surveillance systems; the viewer generally hassufficient contextual knowledge about location of the camera; time; and activity patterns;which can lead to identity leakage even when the visual cues (face and appearance) are notpresent. In this way; the viewer can relate the identity of individuals to the sensitiveinformation in the video causing privacy loss. In order to provide robust privacy preservation;the context knowledge needs to be decoupled from the video; however; human monitoringof the videos is also necessary for the assessment of the situation.

RADcast: Enabling reliability guarantees for content dissemination in ad hoc networks,Bo Xing; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,This paper deals with the problem of reliable and fast broadcast of mission-critical data withrich content over ad hoc networks. Existing approaches to dissemination reliability oftenassume network size knowledge; or that receivers know about the dissemination inadvance. Without making similar assumptions; we propose a distinct approach whichaccommodates the varying reliability needs of applications. We develop the RADcast(reliable application data broadcast) protocol as an integration of two components:(a)Peddler; which ensures that receivers obtain the dissemination metadata; and (b) Pryer;which delivers the actual data to dissemination-aware receivers. We indicate how reliabilityguarantees/performance tradeoffs can be achieved by a careful instantiation of Peddler andPryer.

Furthermore; the proposed architecture provides a fast event disseminationinfrastructure that significantly reduces subscription and publication dissemination traffic andload on event brokers.

Relevance feedback in multimedia databases,Michael Ortega-Binderberger; Sharad Mehrotra,The popularity of web search engines has familiarized countless users with the similaritysearch paradigm. In this paradigm a user provides an example or simple sketch of desiredinformation to a system and receives a list of items that “best” match the informationprovided. These results are typically sorted by a system-generated estimate of how closelythey match the sketch/requirement provided by users. Consider a typical web search engine.The users' sketch takes the form of keywords and the search engine finds the web pagesthat best match those keywords.

High dimensional feature indexing using hybrid trees,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Feature based similarity search is emerging as an important search paradigm indatabase systems. The technique used is to map the data items as points into a highdimensional feature space which is indexed using a multidimensional data structure.Similarity search then corresponds to a range search over the data structure. Traditionalmultidimensional data structures (eg; R-tree; KDB-tree; grid les) are of limited use for featureindexing since (1); their performance deteriorates rapidly with the increase in thedimensionality of the feature space (referred to as the\dimensionality curse") and (2); they donot support range queries based on arbitrary distance functions; a situation that occurscommonly in multimedia feature spaces. This paper introduces the hybrid tree {amultidimensional data structure for indexing high dimensional feature spaces.

Bigsecret: A secure data management framework for key-value stores,Erman Pattuk; Murat Kantarcioglu; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Huseyin Ulusoy; Sharad Mehrotra,Data storage is one of the most popular cloud services; and is therefore offered by mostservice providers. Among the various cloud based data storage services; key-value storeshas emerged as a popular option for storing and retrieving billions of key-value pairs.Although using such cloud based key-value store services could generate many benefits;companies are reluctant to utilize such services due to security concerns. For example; ifkeys are used to represent social security numbers of health insurance customers; andvalues are their medical claim details; then outsourcing such key-value pairs to a publiccloud could create significant privacy and security risks. To mitigate such risks; we proposeBigSecret; a framework that enables secure outsourcing and processing of encrypted dataover public key-value stores. Furthermore; our proposed framework could automatically …,Cloud Computing (CLOUD); 2013 IEEE Sixth International Conference on,2013,21
Privacy aware publication of surveillance video,Mukesh K Saini; Pradeep K Atrey; Sharad Mehrotra; Mohan S Kankanhalli,Current surveillance systems record an enormous amount of video footage everyday. Thisvideo contains events and activities of real life which are useful in many applications. In thispaper; we explore privacy preserving publication surveillance video footage; which requiresrobust privacy modelling and selection of appropriate data transformation function.Traditional privacy protection methods only consider implicit channels of privacy loss (suchas facial information); ignoring other implicit channels. The proposed privacy modelconsolidates the identity leakage through both implicit and explicit channels. To choose datatransformation function; we propose computational models for privacy loss and utility lossand study the tradeoff between these two. Experiments show that the hybrid datatransformation method (using a combination of quantisation and blurring) provides the …,International Journal of Trust Management in Computing and Communications,2013,21
Exploiting web querying for web people search in weps2,Rabia Nuray-Turan; Zhaoqi Chen; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrota,ABSTRACT Searching for people on the Web is one of the most common query types to theweb search engines today. However; when a person name is queried; the returned resultoften contains webpages related to several distinct namesakes who have the queried name.The task of disambiguating and finding the webpages related to the specific person ofinterest is left to the user. Many Web People Search (WePS) approaches have beendeveloped recently that attempt to automate this disambiguation process. Nevertheless; thedisambiguation quality of these techniques leaves a major room for improvement. In thispaper we describe our experience of applying our WePS approaches developed in [20] inthe context of WePS-2 Clustering Task [14].

Self-tuning in graph-based reference disambiguation,Rabia Nuray-Turan; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Nowadays many data mining/analysis applications use the graph analysistechniques for decision making. Many of these techniques are based on the importance ofrelationships among the interacting units. A number of models and measures that analyzethe relationship importance (link structure) have been proposed (eg; centrality; importanceand page rank) and they are generally based on intuition; where the analyst intuitivelydecides a reasonable model that fits the underlying data. In this paper; we address theproblem of learning such models directly from training data. Specifically; we study a way tocalibrate a connection strength measure from training data in the context of referencedisambiguation problem. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed modelsurpasses the best model used for reference disambiguation in the past; leading to better …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,21
The Gold text indexing engine,Daniel Barbará; Sharad Mehrotra; Padmavathi Vallabhaneni,The proliferation of electronic communication including computer mail; faxes; voice mail; andnet news has led to a variety of disjoint applications and usage paradigms that forces usersto deal with multiple different user interfaces and access related information arriving over thedifferent communication media separately. To enable users to cope with the overload ofinformation arriving over heterogeneous communication media; we have developed theGold document handling system that allows users to access all of these forms ofcommunication at once; or to intermix them. The Gold system provides users with anintegrated way to send and recieve messages using different media; efficiently store themessages; retrieve the messages based on their contents; and to access a variety of othersources of useful information.

Attribute and object selection queries on objects with probabilistic attributes,Rabia Nuray-Turan; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra; Yaming Yu,Abstract Modern data processing techniques such as entity resolution; data cleaning;information extraction; and automated tagging often produce results consisting of objectswhose attributes may contain uncertainty. This uncertainty is frequently captured in the formof a set of multiple mutually exclusive value choices for each uncertain attribute along with ameasure of probability for alternative values. However; the lay end-user; as well as someend-applications; might not be able to interpret the results if outputted in such a form. Thus;the question is how to present such results to the user in practice; for example; to supportattribute-value selection and object selection queries the user might be interested in.Specifically; in this article we study the problem of maximizing the quality of these selectionqueries on top of such a probabilistic representation. The quality is measured using the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,20

Adaptive transformation for robust privacy protection in video surveillance,Mukesh Saini; Pradeep K Atrey; Sharad Mehrotra; Mohan Kankanhalli,Abstract Privacy is a big concern in current video surveillance systems. Due to privacyissues; many strategic places remain unmonitored leading to security threats. The mainproblem with existing privacy protection methods is that they assume availability of accurateregion of interest (RoI) detectors that can detect and hide the privacy sensitive regions suchas faces. However; the current detectors are not fully reliable; leading to breaches in privacyprotection. In this paper; we propose a privacy protection method that adopts adaptive datatransformation involving the use of selective obfuscation and global operations to providerobust privacy even with unreliable detectors. Further; there are many implicit privacyleakage channels that have not been considered by researchers for privacy protection. Weblock both implicit and explicit channels of privacy leakage.

Sensor scheduling for aggregate monitoring inwireless sensor networks,Xingbo Yu; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Most of the applications of wireless sensor networks involve primarily data collection with in-network processing in which continuous aggregate queries are posed and processed. Thereare two principle concerns with this type of applications. First; due to the use of batteries;limited power resource has been identified as a major challenge in deploying wirelesssensor networks. Second; data is usually expected to be gathered as soon as possible tofacilitate the monitoring of and the response to the physical phenomena. In this paper; wetackle these challenges through sensor state scheduling.

Concurrency control in hierarchical multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Over the past decade; significant research has been done towards developingtransaction management algorithms for multidatabase systems. Most of this work assumes amonolithic architecture of the multidatabase system with a single software module thatfollows a single transaction management algorithm to ensure the consistency of data storedin the local databases. This monolithic architecture is not appropriate in a multidatabaseenvironment where the system spans multiple different organizations that are distributedover various geographically distant locations. In this paper; we propose an alternativemultidatabase transaction management architecture; where the system is hierarchical innature. Hierarchical architecture has consequences on the design of transactionmanagement algorithms.

Adaptive connection strength models for relationship-based entity resolution,Rabia Nuray-Turan; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Entity Resolution (ER) is a data quality challenge that deals with ambiguousreferences in data and whose task is to identify all references that co-refer. Due to practicalsignificance of the ER problem; many creative ER techniques have been proposed in thepast; including those that analyze relationships that exist among entities in data. Suchapproaches view the database as an entity-relationship graph; where direct and indirectrelationships correspond to paths in the graph. These techniques rely on measuring theconnection strength among various nodes in the graph by using a connection strength (CS)model. While such approaches have demonstrated significant advantage over traditional ERtechniques; currently they also have a significant limitation: the CS models that they use areintuition-based fixed models that tend to behave well in general; but are very generic and …,Journal of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ),2013,18

A probabilistic model for entity disambiguation using relationships,Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Graphs representing relationships among sets of entities are of increasing focus ofinterest in the context of data analysis applications. These graphs are typically constructedfrom existing datasets from which entities and relationships are extracted. For some of theentities; values in certain attributes would refer to other entities–such references determinerelationships. Often; for certain datasets such references are given in the form of (string)descriptions. Each such description alone may not uniquely identify one entity as it issupposed to; but rather can match descriptions of multiple entities. Such cases areespecially common if the datasets are collected not from one but multiple heterogeneoussources. Thus the correct linking of entities via relationships can be a nontrivial challengewhich; if done incorrectly; can in turn impede further graph-based analyses.

Indexing encrypted documents for supporting efficient keyword search,Bijit Hore; Ee-Chien Chang; Mamadou H Diallo; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract We propose a scheme to index encrypted documents on an untrusted server andevaluate keyword search queries against them. The proposed scheme provides bettersecurity than deterministic encryption schemes and is far more efficient than existingsearchable encryption schemes in literature. Furthermore; it provides the user with a set ofcontrol parameters to adjust the level of exposure against the efficiency of the indexingscheme. It also allows easy updates and deletions unlike most existing encrypted searchingschemes. We carry out preliminary experiments to test the effectiveness of the proposedscheme and give an intuition for the security properties along with a fairly detailed outline ofthe security formalism that we are currently developing to analyze the security of ourscheme.,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2012,17

In the DAS model; a service provider employs data encryption techniquesto ensure the privacy of hosted data. The security of encryption techniques relies on theconfidentiality of the encryption keys. The dynamic nature of the encrypted database in theDAS model adds complexity and rises specific requirements on the key managementtechniques.

While similarity joins have been extensively explored in the literature; theproblem of similarity string joins has received comparatively less attention. The string-joinproblem can be specified as follows: Given two large sets of strings; a distance metric (eg;edit distance) between strings; and a predefined threshold k; how to find all the pairs fromthe two sets such that their distance is no greater than k? Such a problem arises naturally ina variety of applications such as data cleansing and data integration. We propose a noveltwo-step process for string join.,*,2002,16

Indexing text data under space constraints,Bijit Hore; Hakan Hacigumus; Bala Iyer; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract An important class of queries is the LIKE predicate in SQL. In the absence of anindex; LIKE queries are subject to performance degradation. The notion of indexing onsubstrings (or< i> q</i>-grams) has been explored earlier without sufficient consideration ofefficiency.< i> q</i>-grams are used to prune away rows that do not qualify for the query. Theproblem is to identify a finite number of grams subject to storage constraint that givesmaximal pruning for a given query workload.

Application-aware integration of data collection and power management in wireless sensor networks,Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Sensors are typically deployed to gather data about the physical world and itsartifacts for a variety of purposes that range from environment monitoring; control; to dataanalysis. Since sensors are resource constrained; often sensor data is collected into sensordatabases that reside at (more powerful) servers. A natural tradeoff exists betweenresources (bandwidth; energy) consumed and the quality of data collected at the server.Blindly transmitting sensor updates at a fixed periodicity to the server results in a suboptimalsolution due to the differences in stability of sensor values and due to the varying applicationneeds that impose different quality requirements across sensors. In order to adapt to thesevariations while at the same time optimizing the energy consumption of sensors; this paperproposes three different models and corresponding data collection protocols.

A multimedia information retrieval model based on semantic and visual content,Yueting Zhuang; Sharad Mehrotra; Thomas S Huang,ABSTRACT Unlike text-based information retrieval model; information retrieval based onmultimedia lacks a good IR model. In this paper; the goal is to present a retrieval modelbased on both semantic and visual content about the multimedia object. First; we survey thefour basic IR models: boolean model; cluster-based model; vector-based model andprobabilistic model. Considering the fact that a user's query will always contain both thetextual information as well as the visual information; we work out an algorithm for thedistance measurement.,Proc. 5th international conference for young computer scientists (ICYCS); Nanjing; China,1999,13
Farecast: Fast; reliable application layer multicast for flash dissemination,Kyungbaek Kim; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract To disseminate messages from a single source to a large number of targetedreceivers; a natural approach is the tree-based application layer multicast (ALM). However;in time-constrained flash dissemination scenarios; eg earthquake early warning; where timeis of the essence; the tree-based ALM has a single point of failure; its reliable extensionsusing ack-based failure recovery protocols cannot support reliable dissemination in thetimeframe needed. In this paper; we exploit path diversity; ie exploit the use of multiple datapaths; to achieve fast and reliable data dissemination. First; we design a forest-based M2M(Multiple parents-To-Multiple children) ALM structure where every node has multiplechildren and multiple parents. The intuition is to enable lower dissemination latency throughmultiple children; while enabling higher reliability through multiple parents. Second; we …,Proceedings of the ACM/IFIP/USENIX 11th International Conference on Middleware,2010,12
Exploiting semantics for scheduling data collection from sensors on real-time to maximize event detection,Ronen Vaisenberg; Sharad Mehrotra; Deva Ramanan,ABSTRACT A distributed camera network allows for many compelling applications such aslarge-scale tracking or event detection. In most practical systems; resources are constrained.Although one would like to probe every camera at every time instant and store every frame;this is simply not feasible. Constraints arise from network bandwidth restrictions; I/O and diskusage from writing images; and CPU usage needed to extract features from the images.Assume that; due to resource constraints; only a subset of sensors can be probed at anygiven time unit. This paper examines the problem of selecting the “best” subset of sensors toprobe under some user-specified objective-eg; detecting as much motion as possible. Withthis objective; we would like to probe a camera when we expect motion; but would not like towaste resources on a non-active camera.

Quality-driven approximate methods for integrating GIS data,Ramaswamy Hariharan; Michal Shmueli-Scheuer; Chen Li; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract GIS data distributed in local; state; federal; and private data clearinghouses arebeing made accessible through the efforts of organizations such as Federal GeographicData Committee (FGDC) and GeoData. gov. Many database applications; such as disastermanagement; transportation; and national infrastructure protection; need to access GISinformation from such various data sources. In this paper we study how to answer keyword-based spatial queries approximately using information from heterogeneous GIS sources. Anexample query specifies the region of Orange County and keywords" junior schools;" whichasks for geospatial objects relevant to junior schools in Orange County. The answers to sucha query provided by different sources differ widely in their content and quality.

Energy efficient communication for reliability and quality aware sensor networks,Cristiano Pereira; Sumit Gupta; Koushik Niyogi; Iosif Lazaridis; Sharad Mehrotra; Rajesh Gupta,Advances in microelectronic systems have made it possible to provide truly mobile;networked 'nodes' that enable distributed data gathering and computation. These nodeshave enabled a range of applications; many of which fall under the broad category of sensornetworks [15; 6; 2; 7; 13]. In many sensor network applications; nodes in the network have tofrequently communicate data with each other or with a central server. Also; sensor nodeshave limited power sources and communication over wireless radios is a key cause ofbattery drain in these devices [12]. The focus of this work; therefore; is to reduce the amountof data communication and thereby; the power consumed by the radio. The applicationdomain targeted by our approach is a network of sensors that send collect data from the fieldand sent it to a server for further processing.

Mars and its applications to MPEG-7,Yong Rui; Thomas S Huang; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract: To address the emerging needs of access to and retrieval of multimedia objects inmany applications; we have started a Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval Systems project atthe University of Illinois. This project addresses three main aspects in Multimedia InformationRetrieval; ie feature extraction; multimedia object description; and retrieval algorithm.Although MPEG-7 will concentrate only on multimedia object description; such a goal will bebetter accomplished if its interfaces to feature extraction and retrieval algorithm areappropriate defined. In this proposal; we will first give a brief overview of the MARS system.Then we propose a multimedia object model for MPEG-7's content description interface. Theproposed model allows information abstraction at various semantic levels.

Ccd: efficient customized content dissemination in distributed publish/subscribe,Hojjat Jafarpour; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub)framework that enables a pub/sub system to accommodate richer content formats includingmultimedia publications with image and video content. The pub/sub system besides beingresponsible for matching and routing the published content; is also responsible forconverting the content into the suitable (target) format for each subscriber. Contentconversion is achieved through a set of content adaptation operators (eg; image transcoder;document translator; etc.) at different nodes in the overlay network. We study algorithms forplacement of such operators in the pub/sub broker overlay in order to minimize thecommunication and computation resource consumption. Our experimental results show thatcareful placement of these operators in pub/sub overlay network can lead to significant …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Middleware,2009,11

In particular; we develop techniques to detectevents without disclosing any identifying information unless necessary. We characterize thenature of inference channels that arise and model privacy preserving event detection as anoptimization problem that attempts to balance disclosure with performance.

Grouping and aggregate queries over semantic web databases,Dawit Seid; Sharad Mehrotra,As a growing number of applications represent data as semantic graphs like RDF (ResourceDescription Format) and the many entity-attribute-value formats; query languages for suchdata are being required to support operations beyond graph pattern matching and inferencequeries. Specifically the ability to express aggregate queries is an important feature which iseither lacking or is implemented with little attention to the peculiarities of the data model. Inthis paper; we study the meaning and implementation of grouping and aggregate queriesover RDF graphs. We first define grouping and aggregate operators algebraically and thenshow how the SPARQL query language can be extended to express grouping andaggregate queries.,Semantic Computing; 2007.

Maintaining Database Consistency in Heterogeneous Distributed DatabaseSystems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract The concept of serializability has been the traditionally accepted notion ofcorrectness in database systems. However; in a heterogeneous distributed database system(HDBMS) environment; ensuring serializability is a difficult task mainly due to the desire ofpreserving the various participating local database systems. In this paper; we introduce anew correctness criterion for HDBMSs; two level serializability (2LSR). We identifyrestrictions under which 2LSR schedules preserve database consistency. Further; wepresent a simple protocol for ensuring schedules are 2LSR. This protocol is easilyimplementable and does not violate the local autonomy of sites.,*,1991,11

Such a framework enablesthe pub/sub system to accommodate richer content formats including multimediapublications with image and video content. In our proposed framework; users (consumers) inaddition to specifying their information needs (subscription queries); also specify their profilewhich includes the information about their receiving context which includes characteristics ofthe device used to receive the content (eg; resolution of a PDA used by a consumer).

Video entity resolution: Applying er techniques for smart video surveillance,Liyan Zhang; Ronen Vaisenberg; Sharad Mehrotra; Dmitri V Kalashnikov,Smart Video Surveillance (SVS) applications enhance situational awareness by allowingdomain analysts to focus on the events of higher priority. This in turn leads to improveddecision making; allows for better resource management; and helps to reduce informationoverload. SVS approaches operate by trying to extract and interpret higher “semantic” levelevents that occur in video. On of the key challenges of Smart Video Surveillance is that ofperson identification where the task is for each subject that occur in a video shot to identifythe person it corresponds to. The problem of person identification is very complex in theresource constrained environments where transmission delay; bandwidth restriction; andpacket loss may prevent the capture of high quality data. In this paper we connect theproblem of person identification in video data with the problem of entity resolution that is …,Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,10
Dynamic load balancing for cluster-based publish/subscribe system,Hojjat Jafarpour; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In this paper we present load balancing techniques for Cluster-based pub/sub frameworkthat include both static and dynamic load balancing. The static load balancing is donethrough a multi-cluster architecture for broker overlay network which is based onsubscription distribution knowledge in the event space. The dynamic load balancing; on theother hand; is achieved through exploiting multiple inter-cluster and intra-clusterconnections to dynamically distribute publication and subscription forwarding load amongbrokers during run time. Our experimental results show that the proposed load balancingtechniques effectively prevent overloaded brokers without having significant effect oncontent dissemination efficiency.,Applications and the Internet; 2009.

Optimization of multi-version expensive predicates,Iosif Lazaridis; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Modern query optimizers need to take into account the performance of expensiveuser-defined predicates. Existing research has shown how to incorporate such predicates ina traditional cost-based query optimizer. In this paper we deal with the optimization of theexpensive predicates themselves; showing how their cost can be reduced by utilizingcheaper; but less accurate; versions of the predicates to pre-filter tuples. We discuss thegeneralized tuple handling mechanism; which processes tuples along a fixed sequence ofversions; as well as adaptive approaches that either split tuple streams into groups; or makerouting decisions at the individual tuple level. We identify the lower bound to the problem ofevaluating a multi-version selection predicate by an ideal individualized plan (IIP); anddevelop an optimal generalized plan (OGP). We then show how realistic individualized or …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,10

Overcoming heterogeneity and autonomy in multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Yuri Breitbart; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract A multidatabase system (MDBS) is a software system for integration of preexistingand independent local database management systems (DBMSs). The transactionmanagement problem in MDBSs consists of designing appropriate software; on top of localDBMSs; such that users can execute transactions that span multiple local DBMSs withoutjeopardizing database consistency. The difficulty in transaction management in MDBSsarises due to the heterogeneity of the transaction management algorithms used by the localDBMSs; and the desire to preserve their local autonomy. In this paper; we develop aframework for designing fault-tolerant transaction management algorithms for MDBSenvironments that effectively overcomes the heterogeneity-and autonomy-inducedproblems.

Context-assisted face clustering framework with human-in-the-loop,Liyan Zhang; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Automatic face clustering; which aims to group faces referring to the same peopletogether; is a key component for face tagging and image management. Standard faceclustering approaches that are based on analyzing facial features can already achieve high-precision results. However; they often suffer from low recall due to the large variation offaces in pose; expression; illumination; occlusion; etc. To improve the clustering recallwithout reducing the high precision; we leverage the heterogeneous context information toiteratively merge the clusters referring to same entities. We first investigate the appropriatemethods to utilize the context information at the cluster level; including using of “commonscene”; people co-occurrence; human attributes; and clothing.

Effective summarization of large collections of personal photos,Pinaki Sinha; Sharad Mehrotra; Ramesh Jain,The amount of personal photos uploaded to social networks (eg; Facebook; Myspace etc)and photo sharing sites (eg; Flickr; Picasa etc) has been increasing rapidly. According tocurrent estimates; three billion photos are uploaded on Facebook per month [2]. Currentphoto hosting systems allow users to arrange their personal photos in albums. Anyinformation need requires the user to drill down through the entire collection of photos; usingthe album/directory structure. This manual browsing may be tedious and inefficient. In thisresearch; we propose a framework for generation of overview summaries from largepersonal photo collections.

Developing effective situational awareness (SA) systems has thepotential to radically improve decision support in crises by improving the accuracy andreliability of the information available to the decision-makers. In an evolving crisis; rawsituational information comes from a variety of sources in the form of situational reports; liveradio transcripts; sensor data; video streams. Much of the data resides (or can be converted)in the form of free text; from which events of interest are extracted. Spatial or locationinformation is one of the fundamental attributes of the events; and is useful for a variety ofsituational awareness (SA) tasks.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,9

Raf: An activation framework for refining similarity queries using learning techniques,Yiming Ma; Sharad Mehrotra; Dawit Yimam Seid; Qi Zhong,Abstract In numerous applications that deal with similarity search; a user may not have anexact specification of his information need and/or may not be able to formulate a query thatexactly captures his notion of similarity. A promising approach to mitigate this problem is toenable the user to submit a rough approximation of the desired query and use relevancefeedback on retrieved objects to refine the query. In this paper; we explore such a refinementstrategy for a general class of structured similarity queries. Our approach casts therefinement problem as that of learning concepts using the tuples on which the user providesfeedback as a labeled training set. Under this setup; similarity query refinement consists oftwo learning tasks: learning the structure of the query and learning the relative importance ofquery components.

Satware: a semantic approach for building sentient spaces,Daniel Massaguer; Sharad Mehrotra; Ronen Vaisenberg; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract This chapter describes the architecture of a semantic-based middlewareenvironment for building sensor-driven sentient spaces. The proposed middleware explicitlymodels sentient space semantics (ie; entities; spaces; activities) and supports mechanismsto map sensor observations to the state of the sentient space. We argue how such asemantic approach provides a powerful programming environment for building sensorspaces. In addition; the approach provides natural ways to exploit semantics for variety ofpurposes including scheduling under resource constraints and sensor recalibration.,*,2011,7
Fault tolerant evaluation of continuous selection queries over sensor data,Iosif Lazaridis; Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,We consider the problem of evaluating continuous selection queries over sensor-generatedvalues in the presence of faults. Small sensors are fragile; have finite energy and memory;and communicate over a lossy medium; hence; tuples produced by them may not reach thequerying node; resulting in an incomplete and ambiguous answer; as any of the non-reporting sensors may have produced a tuple which was lost. We develop a protocol; FAultTolerant Evaluation of Continuous Selection Queries (FATE-CSQ); which guarantees a user-requested level of quality in an efficient manner. When many faults occur; this may not beachievable; in that case; we aim for the best possible answer; under the query's timeconstraints. FATE-CSQ is designed to be resilient to different kinds of failures.

Using semantics for speech annotation of images,Chaitanya Desai; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Digital cameras and multimedia capture devices are becoming increasingly popular to takepictures. Annotating these pictures is important to support their browsing and retrieval. Fullyautomatic image annotation techniques typically rely entirely on visual properties of theimage. The state of the art image annotation systems of this kind work well in detectinggeneric object classes: car; horse; motorcycle; airplane; etc. However; certain characteristicsof the image are hard to capture using strictly the visual properties. These include location(Paris; California; San Francisco; etc); event (birthday; wedding; graduation ceremony; etc);people (John; Jane; brother; etc) and abstract qualities referring to objects in the image(beautiful; funny; sweet; etc) among others. The more conventional method of annotationthat relies completely on human input has several limitations as well. Typing tags using …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Recently the problem of Web PeopleSearch (WePS) has attracted significant attention from both the industry and academia. Inthe classic formulation of WePS problem the user issues a query to a web search enginethat consists of a name of a person of interest. For such a query; a traditional search enginesuch as Yahoo or Google would return webpages that are related to any people whohappened to have the queried name. The goal of WePS; instead; is to output a set of clustersof webpages; one cluster per each distinct person; containing all of the webpages related tothat person. The user then can locate the desired cluster and explore the webpages itcontains.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,7
Discovering GIS sources on the web using summaries,Ramaswamy Hariharan; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract In this paper; we consider the problem of discovering GIS data sources on the web.Source discovery queries for GIS data are specified using keywords and a region of interest.A source is considered relevant if it contains data that matches the keywords in the specifiedregion. Existing techniques simply rely on textual metadata accompanying such datasets tocompute relevance to user-queries.

Exploiting semantics for sensor re-calibration in event detection systems,Ronen Vaisenberg; Shengyue Ji; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Event detection from a video stream is becoming an important and challenging task insurveillance and sentient systems. While computer vision has been extensively studied tosolve different kinds of detection problems over time; it is still a hard problem and even in acontrolled environment only simple events can be detected with a high degree of accuracy.Instead of struggling to improve event detection using image processing only; we bring insemantics to direct traditional image processing. Semantics are the underlying facts thathide beneath video frames; which can not be" seen" directly by image processing. In thiswork we demonstrate that time sequence semantics can be exploited to guide unsupervisedre-calibration of the event detection system. We present an instantiation of our ideas byusing an appliance as an example--Coffee Pot level detection based on video data--to …,Multimedia Computing and Networking 2008,2008,7
Approximate monitoring in wireless sensor networks,Xingbo Yu; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Weiwen Yang,Abstract In this paper; we develop an energy efficient approach to processing continuousaggregate queries in sensor networks with bounded quality constraints. Specifically; weexploit quality-aware in-network aggregation of query information to reduce communicationcosts. Given cluster structures over sensor nodes; we develop an adaptive approximate dataprocessing protocol to aggregate data and process queries given error tolerance on userqueries. The protocol enforces group quality constraints on clusters and adjusts errorbounds to balance workload of clusters and reduce communication cost. It also tries toinitiate local communication instead of global communication in the effort of minimizingoverall communication overhead. Our experimental results indicate that significant benefitscan be achieved by using our adaptive protocol.,Technical Report 382; UCI ICS,2004,7
Failure handling in an optimized two-safe approach to maintaining primary-backup systems,Kexiang Hu; Sharad Mehrotra; Simon Kaplan,In a primary backup database system; transaction processing takes place at the primary andthe log records generated are propagated to the backup which uses them to reconstruct thedatabase state at the primary. If the primary fails; the backup takes over to provide continuedservice. Most existing designs of primary backup database systems have concentrated ontechniques to tolerate complete failures in which the entire primary fails; say due to adisaster. In multiprocessor environments; where the primary and the backup databases arepartitioned across multiple computers; a more common case is a partial failure in whichsome database partitions fail but the system as a whole survives. Existing approaches eitherignore partial failures; or require the failed database partition to be unavailable. We explorea design of the primary backup database system that uses the backup not only for …,Reliable Distributed Systems; 1998. Proceedings. Seventeenth IEEE Symposium on,1998,7

TIPPERS: A privacy cognizant IoT environment,Sharad Mehrotra; Alfred Kobsa; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Siva Raj Rajagopalan,IoT environments are important and challenging application domains for privacy studies; fortwo reasons: data collection about people is nearly invisible; and IoT environments typicallydo not support interfaces that allow users to specify their privacy preferences or to control thepersonal data collection practices of the environment. It is also well known that IoTenvironments present rich challenges in managing privacy choices. We present two systemsthat will support powerful mechanisms to embed and test a diverse set of privacytechnologies in an IoT environment in a large School building.,Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,6
Query aware determinization of uncertain objects,Jie Xu; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,This paper considers the problem of determinizing probabilistic data to enable such data tobe stored in legacy systems that accept only deterministic input. Probabilistic data may begenerated by automated data analysis/enrichment techniques such as entity resolution;information extraction; and speech processing. The legacy system may correspond to pre-existing web applications such as Flickr; Picasa; etc. The goal is to generate a deterministicrepresentation of probabilistic data that optimizes the quality of the end-application built ondeterministic data. We explore such a determinization problem in the context of two differentdata processing tasks-triggers and selection queries. We show that approaches such asthresholding or top-1 selection traditionally used for determinization lead to suboptimalperformance for such applications. Instead; we develop a query-aware strategy and show …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2015,6
Efficient and reliable application layer multicast for flash dissemination,Kyungbaek Kim; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,To disseminate messages from a single source to a large number of targeted receivers; anatural approach is the tree-based application layer multicast (ALM). In time-constrainedflash dissemination scenarios; eg earthquake early warning; where time is of the essence;the reliable extensions of the tree-based ALM using ack-based failure recovery protocolscannot support reliable dissemination in the timeframe needed. In this paper; we proposeFaReCast which exploits path diversity; ie; exploit the use of multiple data paths; to achievefast and reliable data dissemination. First; we design a forest-based M2M (Multiple parents-To-Multiple children) ALM structure where every node has multiple children and multipleparents. The intuition is to enable lower dissemination latency through multiple children;while enabling higher reliability through multiple parents. In order to maintain the M2M …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2014,6
Scheduling sensors for monitoring sentient spaces using an approximate POMDP policy,Ronen Vaisenberg; Alessio Della Motta; Sharad Mehrotra; Deva Ramanan,Abstract We present a framework for sensor actuation and control in sentient spaces; inwhich sensors are used to observe a physical phenomena. We focus on sentient spaces thatenable pervasive computing applications; such as smart video surveillance and situationalawareness in instrumented office environments. Our framework utilizes the spatio-temporalstatistical properties of an observed phenomena; with the goal of maximizing an application-specified reward. Specifically; we define an observation of a phenomena by assigning it adiscrete value (state) and we model its semantics as the transition between these values(states). This semantic model is used to predict the future states in which the phenomena islikely to be at; based on partially-observed past states.

Risk-aware data processing in hybrid clouds,Vaibhav Khadilkar; Kerim Y Oktay; Bijit Hore; Murat Kantarcioglu; Sharad Mehrotra; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract: This paper explores query processing in a hybrid cloud model where a user's localcomputing capability is exploited alongside public cloud services to deliver an efficient andsecure data management solution. Hybrid clouds offer numerous economic advantagesincluding the ability to better manage data privacy and confidentiality; as well as exertingcontrol on monetary expenses of consuming cloud services by exploiting local resources.Nonetheless; query processing in hybrid clouds introduces numerous challenges; theforemost of which is; how to partition data and computation between the public and privatecomponents of the cloud. The solution must account for the characteristics of the workloadthat will be executed; the monetary costs associated with acquiring/operating cloud servicesas well as the risks affiliated with storing sensitive data on a public cloud.

Practical experiences in enabling and ensuring quality sensing in emergency response applications,Chris Davison; Daniel Massaguer; Lilia Paradis; M Reza Rahimi; Bo Xing; Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Situational awareness in emergency response is critical. Knowing the status of the hazards;the rescue workers; and the building occupants; etc.; can greatly help the incidentcommander make the right decisions in responding emergencies; and as a result; savelives. Such situational awareness can be achieved by using existing sensing andcommunication infrastructures and/or having rescue practitioners dynamically deploy theirown.

Dealing with partial failures in multiple processor primary-backup systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Kexiang Hu; Simon Kaplan,Abstract Remote backup systems provide database availability even in case Of &JaJterJ i!hUt cause Complete database failure. In a remote backup system a backup tracks thetranaactionprocessing at the primary and in the event of the primary failure takes ouertransaction processing without causing users to observe a breach in service. Remotebackup algorithms have been developed for a variety of system architectures including thecase in which primary and backup consist of multiple processors connected via multiplecommunication lines. A limitation of ezisting algorithms for such environments is that they ig-nore the issue of partial primary and backup failures in which one or more of the primary/backupprocessors fail but the~ ys-tern as a whole survives.

Towards data confidentiality and a vulnerability analysis framework for cloud computing,Kerim Y Oktay; Mahadevan Gomathisankaran; Murat Kantarcioglu; Sharad Mehrotra; Anoop Singhal,Abstract This chapter explores two related challenges in the context of secure processing incloud computing. The first is the concern of “loss of control” that results from outsourcing dataand computation to the clouds. While loss of control has multiple manifestations; the chapterfocusses on the potential loss of data privacy and confidentiality when cloud providers areuntrusted. Instead of using a well studied (but still unsolved) approach of encrypting datawhen outsourcing it and computing on the encrypted domain; the paper advocates risk-based processing over a hybrid cloud architecture as a possible solution. Hybrid clouds area composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private; community; or public) thatremain unique entities; but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technologythat enables data and application portability.

This involves the rapid dissemination of richinformation to a large number of recipients in a very short period of time. A key characteristicof Flash Dissemination is its unpredictability (eg; natural hazards); but when invoked it mustharness all possible resources to ensure timely delivery of information. Additionally; it mustscale to a large number of recipients and perform efficiently in highly heterogeneous (data;network) and failure prone environments.

One of the limitations of the simulators is that they are developed by domainexperts who have an in-depth understanding of the phenomena being modeled andtypically designed to be executed and evaluated independently.

Towards reliable application data broadcast in wireless ad hoc networks,Bo Xing; Mayur Deshpande; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Sharad Mehrotra; D Bren,Application data broadcast in ad hoc networks is an important primitive that has receivedlittle systematic research-the main focus of prior research being on control data broadcast. Inthis paper; we show why control data broadcast and even multicast techniques areinsufficient for reliable application data broadcast; in fact their reliability degrades sharplywith increasing application data size. We discover the root cause of this to be IP fragmentingthe application data but not providing good reliability control on the fragments. We hencepropose READ (reliable and efficient application-data dissemination); a protocol based onhigher-layer fragmentation with fragment-level reliability control.

Query refinement in similarity retrieval systems,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Michael Ortega; Kriengkrai Porkaew; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract In many applications; users specify target values for certain attributes/featureswithout requiring exact matches to these values in return. Instead; the result is typically aranked list of the top k objects that best match the specified feature values. User subjectivityis an important aspect of such queries; ie; which objects are relevant to the user and whichare not depends on the perception of the user. Due to the subjective nature of similarity-based retrieval; the answers returned by the system to a user query often do not satisfy theuser's information need right away; either because the weights and the distance functionsassociated with the features do not accurately capture the user's perception or because thespecified target values do not fully capture her information need or both. The most commonlyused technique to overcome this problem is query refinement. In this technique; the user …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2001,5

Search over encrypted data,Ali Bagherzandi; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra,Background Search over encrypted data has been primarily studied in the context of dataoutsourcing where a client stores potentially confidential information on a remote server thatmay reside in an “untrusted” environment. The client employs encryption to protect thesensitive contents in the data. Typically; a “curious intruder” model is assumed; wherein theattacker is assumed to be curious about the content of the data; but is not malicious; so as toalter the data itself. The problem is then; how can the client issue queries which the servercan evaluate against the encrypted representation of the data and return only the matchingrecords to the client. Techniques to support search over encrypted data function are basedon storing additional information (ie; metadata) which by itself does not leak informationabout the data but enables the predicates to be evaluated over the encrypted …,*,2011,4

Fault-Tolerant Queries over Sensor Data.,Iosif Lazaridis; Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating continuous selection queries over sensor-generated values in the presence of faults. Small sensors are fragile; have finite energy andmemory; and communicate over a lossy medium; hence; tuples produced by them may notreach the querying node; resulting in an incomplete and ambiguous answer; as any of thenon-reporting sensors may have produced a tuple which was lost. We develop a protocol;FAult Tolerant Evaluation of Continuous Selection Queries (FATE-CSQ); which guarantees auser-requested level of quality in an efficient manner. When many faults occur; this may notbe achievable; in that case; we aim for the best possible answer; under the query's timeconstraints. FATECSQ is designed to be resilient to different kinds of failures. Our designdecisions are based on an analytical model of different fault tolerance strategies based …,COMAD,2006,4
Learning importance of relationships for reference disambiguation,Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of reference disambiguation. Specifically; weconsider a situation where entities in the database are referred to using descriptions (eg; aset of instantiated attributes). The objective of reference disambiguation is to identify theunique entity to which each description corresponds. The key difference between ourapproach and the traditional techniques is that it analyzes not only object features but alsointer-object relationships to improve the disambiguation quality. To analyze relationships ourapproach utilizes a model that measures the degree of interconnectivity of two entities toeach other via chains of relationships that exist between them. Such a model is a keycomponent of the proposed technique. In this paper we concentrate on a method forlearning such a model by learning the importance of different relationships from the data …,Submitted for Publication,2004,4

Database support for situational awareness,Iosif Lazaridis; Sharad Mehrotra; Kriengkrai Porkaew; Robert Winkler,Abstract. Providing database support for interactive 3D Visualization and SituationalAwareness (SA) is one of the keys to making such systems scale to the complexity of real-world scenarios. It is desirable that SA systems be highly realistic and intuitive to use. From adatabase perspective these requirements translate into (i) support for large amount ofheterogeneous spatio-temporal data (to provide a convincing virtual environment;approximating the complexity of reality);(ii) support for highly dynamic situations in which thedata may change frequently;(iii) support for mechanisms to deal with inherent imprecision inthe underlying information; and;(iv) powerful query interface that allows users to pose variedand interesting queries that are answered with minimum time delay.

Attribute and object selection queries on objects with probabilistic attributes,RABIA Nuray-Turan; DMITRI V Kalashnikov; SHARAD Mehrotra; YAMING Yu,Modern data processing techniques such as entity resolution; data cleaning; informationextraction; and automated tagging often produce results consisting of objects whoseattributes may contain uncertainty. This uncertainty is frequently captured in the form of a setof multiple mutually exclusive value choices for each uncertain attribute along with ameasure of probability for alternative values. However; the lay end-user; as well as someend-applications; might not be able to interpret the results if outputted in such a form. Thus;the question is how to present such results to the user in practice; eg; to support attribute-value selection and object selection queries the user might be interested in. Specifically; inthis paper we study the problem of maximizing the quality of these selection queries on topof such a probabilistic representation. The quality is measured using the standard and …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (ACM TODS),2011,3
Exploring quality in multisensor pervasive systems-a localization case study,Stefano Bonetti; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,This paper addresses quality vs. cost tradeoffs in multisensor pervasive spaces. Specifically;we focus on a case study that uses location sensing in instrumented pervasive spacesexecuting a variety of applications ranging from social networking to surveillance andsecurity. Location sensing is vital in creating effective situational awareness for missioncritical applications; eg localization of firefighters and rescue personnel in emergencyresponse scenarios as well as general purpose location based services.

Extraction and Annotation,Naveen Ashish; Sharad Mehrotra,The authors present the XAR framework that allows for free text information extraction andsemantic annotation. The language underpinning XAR; the authors argue; allows for theinclusion of probabilistic reasoning with the rule language; provides higher level predicatescapturing text features and relationships; and defines and supports advanced features suchas token consumption and stratified negotiation in the rule language and semantics. TheXAR framework also allows the incorporation of semantic information as integrity constraintsin the extraction and annotation process. The XAR framework aims to fill in a gap; theauthors claim; in the Web based information extraction systems. XAR provides an extractionand annotation framework by permitting the integrated use of hand-crafted extraction rules;machine-learning based extractors; and semantic information about the particular domain …,Cases on Semantic Interoperability for Information Systems Integration: Practices and Applications: Practices and Applications,2009,3

This paper focuses on information that isdisseminated to the public at large specifically to encourage self-protective actions; such asevacuation from dangerous areas; sheltering-in-place; and other actions designed to reduceexposure to natural and human-induced threats. Specifically; we have developed anunderstanding of the key factors in effective dissemination to the public and designedtechnology innovations to convey accurate and timely information to those who are actuallyat risk (or likely to be); while providing reassuring information to those who are not at riskand therefore do not need to take self-protective action.

A middleware approach for managing privacy of outsourced personal data,Sharad Mehrotra; Bijit Hore,Advances in networking and web service technologies coupled with the ever increasingneed for fast; reliable; and cost-effective storage has made data outsourcing an importanttrend in the software industry. The outsourcing model offers numerous advantages includingimproved availability: the data can be accessed 24/7 from any computer connected to theInternet; lower cost: the service provider can amortize the cost over several clients; andimproved service: the service providers typically employ experts to provide better qualityservice. While outsourcing is of potential benefit to all data producers big and small; much ofthe recent commercial interest has focused on the personal data management spacewherein individual users can outsource their personal data (files; pictures; video; medicalrecords; etc.) to third party storage.

Pbca-prediction based channel allocation,Jinsu Wang; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Cellular infrastructures as they exist today are statically configured; and do not providescalable; flexible and adaptive radio resource reconfiguration. In GSM networks; manydynamic channel allocation (DCA) schemes have been proposed to improve the networkperformance and user experience. DCA schemes can be categorized into cell basedcentralized; cell based distributed; and mobile handset based solutions. However; most ofthese existing schemes are event-driven and are reactively triggered by the arrival of activecalls; which has a delayed response to network traffic condition. In order to adjust networkconfiguration to the changing traffic conditions; a new class of information driven adaptationschemes are needed.

Heuristics for flash-dissemination in heterogenous networks,Mayur Deshpande; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Flash Dissemination is a particularly useful form of data broadcast that arises inmany mission-critical applications. The goal is rapid distribution of medium amounts of datain as short a time period as possible. While optimal algorithms are available for a highlyconstrained case (all nodes having the same bandwidth and latency); there is relatively littlework in the context of heterogenous networks. Most systems and protocols today either usetrees or randomized mesh-based techniques to deal with heterogeneity and work with localknowledge. We argue that a protocol with global knowledge can perform much better. In thispaper; we propose two centralized heuristics–DIM-Rank and DIM-Time that use globalknowledge to schedule data transfer between nodes. The heuristics are based upon insightsfrom broadcast theory. We perform experimental evaluation of these two heuristics with …,International Conference on High-Performance Computing,2006,3

Efficient evaluation of relevance feedback for multidimensional all-pairs retrieval,Michael Ortega; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract New retrieval applications support flexible comparison for all-pairs best matchoperations based on a notion of similarity or distance. The distance between items isdetermined by some arbitrary distance function. Users that pose queries may change theirdefinition of the distance metric as they progress. The distance metric change may beexplicit or implicit in an application (eg; using relevance feedback). Recomputing fromscratch the results with the new distance metric is wasteful. In this paper; we present anefficient approach to recomputing the all-pairs best match (join) operation using the newdistance metric by re-using the work already carried out for the old distance metric. Ourapproach reduces significantly the work required to compute the new result; as compared toa naive re-evaluation.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2003,3
An architecture for large multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Over the past decade; substantial research has been done towards developingtransaction management algorithms for multidatabase systems. Most of these research eorts have concentrated on the problems that arise due to the heterogeneity and theautonomy of the various local databases that are integrated into a multidatabaseenvironment. One issue that has been relatively ignored is that of the architecture ofmultidatabase systems. We believe that a large multidatabase system spanning multipleorganizations that are distributed over various geographically distant locations will not bedeveloped as a single monolithic system. Rather; it will be developed hierarchically. As aresult; the transaction management algorithms followed by a multidatabase system must becomposable in such a way that it is feasible to incorporate individual multidatabase …,*,1993,3
Efficient global transaction management in multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Yuri Breitbart; Henry P Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Concurrency control schemes for ensuring global serial-izability in a multidatabasesystem (MDBS) environment are complicated due to the autonomy of local databasemanagement systems (DBMSs). In this paper; we develop concurrency control schemes; forthe MDBS environment; that are simple; permit a high degree of concurrency and incurminimal overhead under two different assumptions on the nature of schedules produced bythe local DBMSs:(1) each local DBMS produces rigorous schedules;(2) each local DBMSproduces strongly recoverable schedules. Our interest in rigorous schedules stems from thefact that the majority of commercial DBMSs offer a concurrency control protocol thatgenerates rigorous schedules. However; the class of rigorous schedules is quite restrictivein terms of the amount of concurrency permitted. We; therefore; also consider the class of …,*,1993,3
Secure and efficient query processing over hybrid clouds,Kerim Yasin Oktay; Murat Kantarcioglu; Sharad Mehrotra,This paper explores secure data processing in hybrid clouds wherein local computingcapability is exploited alongside public cloud services to deliver an efficient and secure datamanagement solution. Hybrid clouds offer numerous advantages including the ability toselectively outsource data and computations based on sensitivity/confidentiality. Dataprocessing in hybrid clouds must address two interrelated challenges:(i) data distribution:how is data distributed across public and private machines; and (ii) distributed queryprocessing: how are queries executed efficiently without leaking sensitive data to untrustedpublic machines. This paper addresses these challenges and incorporates the respectivesolutions into an add-on tool for a Hadoop; Spark; and Hive based cloud computinginfrastructure.

Building a Mobile Applications Knowledge Base for the Linked Data Cloud.,Primal Pappachan; Roberto Yus; Prajit Kumar Das; Sharad Mehrotra; Tim Finin; Anupam Joshi,Abstract. The number of mobile applications (apps) in major app stores exceeded onemillion in 2013. While app stores provide a central point for storing app metadata; they oftenimpose restrictions on the access to this information thus limiting the potential to developtools to search; recommend; and analyze app information. A few projects have circumventedthese limitations and managed to create a dataset with a substantial number of apps.However; accessing this information; especially for the purpose of an integrated view; isdifficult as there is no common standard for publishing data. We present Mobipedia; an effortto gather this information from various sources and publish it as RDF Linked Data.

We aim to facilitate the process of fusing together the independentlycreated simulators into an integrated simulation environment wherein we can model andexecute complex scenarios involving multiple simulators. In this paper; we focus onsolutions for the synchronization problem in multisimulation to orchestrate consistentinformation flow through multiple simulators.

Risk aware approach to data confidentiality in cloud computing,Kerim Yasin Oktay; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Murat Kantarcioglu; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract This paper explores the issue of “loss of control” that results when users outsourcedata and computation to the clouds. While loss of control has multiple manifestations; wefocus on the data privacy and confidentiality implications when cloud providers areuntrusted. Instead of following the well studied (but still unsolved) path of encrypting datawhen outsourcing and computing on the encrypted domain; the paper advocates a risk-based approach over a hybrid cloud architecture as a possible solution. Hybrid clouds are acomposition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private; community; or public) thatremain unique entities; but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technologythat enables data and application portability. Hybrid clouds offer an opportunity to selectivelyoutsource data and computation based on the level of sensitivity involved. The paper …,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2013,2

Interoperability of Multiple Autonomous Simulators in Integrated Simulation Environments,Leila Jalali; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,ABSTRACT: In this paper; we propose a methodology for integrating multiple autonomouspre-existing simulation models into an integrated simulation environment. One of the limitationsof the simulators is that they are developed by domain experts who have an in-depth understandingof the phenomena being modelled and typically designed to be executed and evaluatedindependently. Therefore the grand challenge is to facilitate the process of pulling all of independentlycreated models together into an interoperating simulation model where decision makers canexplore different alternatives and conduct low cost experiments. We aim to build such integratedsimulation environments by creating a loosely coupled federation of pre-existing simulators.Unlike the significant code rewrite required in the HLA case; our framework permits individualsimulators to maintain their autonomy (ie retain their internal representations of time/state …,Spring SIW,2011,2
Disruption-tolerant spatial dissemination,Bo Xing; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Spatial dissemination is a specific form of information dissemination that enables mobileusers to send information to other mobile users who are or will appear at a specific location(a user-defined region). Such geo-messaging services are on the rise; they typically are builtupon centralized solutions and require users to have reliable access to a stable backendinfrastructure for storing and communicating content. In this paper; we develop a distributedsolution to spatial dissemination; that can work without the need for such an infrastructure.Our solution utilizes the concepts from disruption-tolerant networking to build a flexible/best-effort service that leverages the intermittent ad-hoc connectivity between users. We proposeSticker; a spatial dissemination protocol that aims to maximize delivery reliability withoutincurring significant storage/transmission overheads.

A semantic approach for building pervasive spaces,Daniel Massaguer; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Large and pervasive sensing; communications; and computing infrastructures areenabling the realization of pervasive spaces. Enabling such spaces; however; encompassesa set of challenges. First; programming each application such that it connects to each sensorand it interprets the data being sensed requires a concentration of expertise that is rarelyavailable. Second; achieving a wise and fair usage of the infrastructures is impossible withcurrent approaches due to their lack of awareness of domain and application semantics.This paper summarizes a PhD dissertation that focuses on designing and implementing amiddleware that addresses these challenges and overcomes the limitations of previousapproaches by featuring a distributed streaming architecture and by being aware of thesemantics of the space and applications.

Exploiting semantics for scheduling real-time data collection from sensors to maximize event detection,Ronen Vaisenberg; Sharad Mehrotra; Deva Ramanan,A distributed camera network allows for many compelling applications such as large-scaletracking or event detection. In most practical systems; resources are constrained. Althoughone would like to probe every camera at every time instant and store every frame; this issimply not feasible. Constraints arise from network bandwidth restrictions; I/O and diskusage from writing images; and CPU usage needed to extract features from the images.Assume that; due to resource constraints; only a subset of sensors can be probed at anygiven time unit. This paper examines the problem of selecting the" best" subset of sensors toprobe under some user-specified objective-eg; detecting as much motion as possible. Withthis objective; we would like to probe a camera when we expect motion; but would not like towaste resources on a non-active camera.

Integrating similarity retrieval and skyline exploration via relevance feedback,Yiming Ma; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Similarity retrieval have been widely used in many practical search applications. Asimilarity query model can be viewed as a logical combination of a set of similaritypredicates. A user can initialize a query model; but model parameters or the model itself maybe inadequately specified. As a result; a retrieval system cannot guarantee that it haspresented all the relevant tuples to the user. In this paper; we propose a framework thatintegrates the similarity retrieval and skyline exploration. Using the relevance feedback as away to constrain the search space; our framework can intelligently explore only a necessaryportion of data that contains all the relevant tuples. Our framework is also flexible enough toincorporate model refinement techniques to retrieving relevant results as early as possible.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,2
SURCH: distributed aggregation over wireless sensor networks,Xingbo Yu; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In this paper; we present SURCH; a novel decentralized algorithm for efficient processing ofqueries generated in sensor networks. Unlike existing techniques; SURCH is fullydistributed and does not require the existence or construction of a communicationinfrastructure. It exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to optimize querypropagation and evaluation. In SURCH; partial results are aggregated en route while thequery spreads through the network. The key features of SURCH include its ability to avoidunnecessary communication; balanced node workload; and resilience to node failures.Performance results illustrate that SURCH outperforms alternative techniques for a variety ofaggregation and selection queries,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2006.

Efficient relationship pattern mining using multi-relational data cubes,Dawit Yimam Seid; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract A large class of data mining applications involve data sets that pertain to multipleentities and relationship. This has led to the suggestion of multi-relational data mining(MRDM) that aims to incorporate and exploit the heterogeneous and semantically richrelationships that exist among entity types. Specifically; given a database consisting ofmultiple tables linked through foreign key joins; a target table (that typically represents acertain real-world entity type) and; optionally; a target attribute (eg a class label attribute);MRDM aims to discover patterns and models spanning all the tables and links that eitherdescribe or predict the target entity or attribute. In this paper; we study one class of MRDMtask; namely multi-relational association rule mining. For this task; we distinguish two typesof target tables; namely entity and relationship target tables.

Refining top-k selection queries based on user feedback,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Kriengkrai Porkaew; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract In many applications; users specify target values for certain attributes/features;without requiring exact matches to these values in return. Instead; the result is typically aranked list of “top k” objects that best match the specified feature values. User subjectivity isan important aspect of such queries ie which objects are relevant to the user and which arenot depends on the perception of the user. Due to the subjective nature of top-k queries; theanswers returned by the system to an user query often does not satisfy the user's need rightaway; either because the weights and the distance functions associated with the features donot accurately capture the user's perception or because the specified target values do notfully capture her information need or both. In such cases; the user would like to refine thequery and resubmit it in order to get back a better set of answers. While there has been a …,VLDB 2000,2000,2
Neighborhoods: a framework for enabling Web based synchronous collaboration and hierarchical navigation,Jitendra Kothari; Ed Grossman; Sharad Mehrotra,The World Wide Web (WWW) is an extremely effective mechanism for sharing informationthroughout the world via a web of links.

In the 1960s and 1970s there was considerable doubt these innovations were orshould be eligible for patent protec-tion. By the mid-1980s the tide shifted and softwareinnovations were increas-ingly deemed eligible for patents. Doubts about the patentability ofsoftware seemed to dissipate in the mid-to late 1990s.

Secure quasi-realtime collaborative editing over low-cost storage services,Chunwang Zhang; Junjie Jin; Ee-Chien Chang; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract A realtime collaborative editor facilitates concurrent editing of a document bymultiple authors. It is desired that the document be shared only among the authors; andprotected from the potentially curious server. Existing approaches have taken two distinctpaths–centralized server based approaches that achieve high concurrency and meet real-time requirement but compromise on security and incur high server cost; and peer-to-peerbased approaches that support security but compromise on users' convenience andmobility. In this paper; we observe that by relaxing the realtime requirement; we can achievesecurity; reduce server cost and yet exploit the conveniences of the centralized setting. Inparticular; we consider generic low-cost storage servers in the cloud that provide storageintegrity but do not guarantee low-latency.

Guest editorial: Privacy-aware multimedia surveillance systems,Pradeep K Atrey; Sabu Emmanuel; Sharad Mehrotra; Mohan S Kankanhalli,Due to the significant increase in various security threats; safety has become a primaryconcern for our society. As a result; most of the public places such as airports; train stations;banks; shopping malls; subways and streets are nowadays equipped with state-of-the-artmultimedia surveillance systems. These systems are meant to process sensory data toautomatically detect suspicious or unusual behavior of people and alert security personnelso that preventive actions can be taken.

Protecting personal data from untrusted web-based data services,Ravi Chandra Jammalamadaka; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Our society places a heavy emphasis on security and the privacy of personal data. Personaldata at the hands of a malicious entity could spell disastrous consequences for the data'sowner. There is a whole slew of attacks on the Internet aimed at procuring and misusingpersonal information for profit. 1; 2 And so; recently; there has been a huge thrust towardsdeveloping technologies that protect personal data from being misused. 3; 4 Governmentsacross the world are passing laws to protect personal information. 5 Outsourcing personalinformation to web-based data services (WDS) is a common recent trend. These serviceshave become very popular; but they require us to trust the service provider and may bevulnerable to both outsider and insider attacks.

Community Driven Data Integration for Emergency,Naveen Ashish; Sharad Mehrotra,ABSTRACT This paper describes our work in progress on an approach and technology forproviding integrated data access in situational awareness applications–particularly fordisaster and emergency response. The key new aspect of our work is an approach whereinformation aggregation; processing; and integration capabilities are offered as a service toany new application builder. Further; we provide a framework for possibly reusing priorinformation integration knowledge; the development of which demands the major fraction oftime and complexity in a new application; in a customized fashion for new application. Ouroverall goal is to provide a framework where integrated access to critical data in anemergency response situation can be enabled very rapidly and by personnel with basic ITand data handling expertise. Our approach; while general purpose; is currently motivated …,Proceedings of the 7th International ISCRAM Conference–Seattle,2010,1
Incorporating Integrity Constraints in Uncertain Databases,Naveen Ashish; Sharad Mehrotra; Pouria Pirzadeh,Abstract: We develop an approach to incorporate additional knowledge; in the form ofgeneral purpose integrity constraints (ICs); to reduce uncertainty in probabilistic databases.While incorporating ICs improves data quality (and hence quality of answers to a query); itsignificantly complicates query processing. To overcome the additional complexity; wedevelop an approach to map an uncertain relation U with ICs to another uncertain relationU'; that approximates the set of consistent worlds represented by U. Queries over U caninstead be evaluated over U'achieving higher quality (due to reduced uncertainty in U')without additional complexity in query processing due to ICs. We demonstrate theeffectiveness and scalability of our approach to large data-sets with complex constraints. Wealso present experimental results demonstrating the utility of incorporating integrity …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0907.1632,2009,1

Semantically ranked graph pattern queries for link analysis,Dawit Seid; Sharad Mehrotra,Relationship pattern based queries are important components of intelligence link analysis;Typically the analyst gives a prototypical graph pattern which needs to be approximatelymatched to the data. Performing such inexact graph pattern matching is currently carried outusing some variant of graph edit distance measures. This approach suffers from two mainshortcomings:(1) it relies on detailed graph edit cost assignment by the analyst; and (2) itcannot efficiently incorporate semantic similarities that can be; in most cases; computedbased on appropriate ontologies. In this paper; we propose novel techniques for evaluatinggraph pattern queries to produce semantically-ranked results. Our approach systematicallycombines both partial structural matches and semantic similarities in order to relieve theuser from specifying edit costs.,Intelligence and Security Informatics; 2007 IEEE,2007,1
A framework for refining similarity queries using learning techniques,Yiming Ma; Qi Zhong; Sharad Mehrotra; Dawit Yimam Seid,Abstract In numerous applications that deal with similarity search; a user may not have anexact idea of his information need and/or may not be able to construct a query that exactlycaptures his notion of similarity. A promising approach to mitigate this problem is to enablethe user to submit a rough approximation of the desired query and use the feedback on therelevance of the retrieved objects to refine the query. In this paper; we explore such arefinement strategy for a general class of SQL similarity queries. Our approach casts therefinement problem as that of learning concepts using examples. This is achieved byviewing the tuples on which a user provides feedback as a labeled training set for a learner.Under this setup; SQL query refinement consists of two learning tasks; namely learning thestructure of the SQL query and learning the relative importance of the query components …,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2004,1

Programming Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing Applications with the TOTA Middleware,Marco Mamei; Franco Zambonelli; Letizia Leonardi,Such a scenario introduces peculiar and challenging requirements in the development ofdistributed software systems. Because new agents (we use this term generically to indicate adistributed application's active components) can depart out of and arrive into the network atany time and roam across different environments; applications must be able to deal withsuch activity adaptively and independently. In addition; the activities of software systems areoften contextual-that is; closely connected to the setting (for example; location; time; orenvironment) in which the systems execute. Setting/contextual characteristics are typically apriori unknown and thus require dynamic enforcement of context awareness.,Middleware Conference,2003,1
Incorporating Aggregate Queries in Interactive Visualization,Iosif Lazaridis; Sharad Mehrotra,ABSTRACT Spatial aggregate queries involve specifying a region of space and asking forthe value of some aggregate function of a quantity for which we have measurements for thisgiv en region. An example of such a query is “Average rain fall in California”. The aggregatefunction is average; the interesting quantity is rainfall and the spatial region is California. Inthe context of Virtual Geographic Informa tion System (VGIS) such queries can be extremelyinterest ing. As the user performs a fly-through over the virtual world; it may be worthwhile topose queries like “highest terrain elevation in my vicinity”;“average wind velocity for the next100 miles of my flight path at a 1 mile resolu tion” or “total number of vehicles within 10 milesof my position”.

Continuous Media Databases,Aidong Zhang; Sharad Mehrotra,Quality of service requirements for" continuous" data like video and audio pose challengingperformance demands on a multimedia information server. In particular; the delivery of suchdata from the server to its clients dictates disk-service deadlines for real-time playback at theclients. Missing a deadline may result in a temporary; but possibly user-noticeabledegradation of the playback that we refer to as a" glitch". Guaranteeing a specified quality ofservice then means to avoid glitches or to bound the glitch rate within a continuous datastream; possibly in a stochastic manner (Le.; with very high probability). In addition; animportant objective for the server is to maximize the number of continuous data streams thatcan be sustained by the system without violating the promised glitch rate bound.

Failure-resilient transaction management in multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract A multidatabase system (MDBS) is an integration of pre-existing and independentlocal database management systems (DBMSs). The transaction management problem inMDBSs consists of designing appropriate software; on top of local DBMSs; such that userscan execute transactions that span multiple local DBMSs without jeopardizing databaseconsistency. In this thesis; we study the problems associated with transaction managementin MDBSs. The major difficulty arises due to the heterogeneity of the local DBMSs and thedesire to preserve their autonomy. Heterogeneity makes the task of ensuring globalserializability difficult. To overcome heterogeneity; we reduce the problem of ensuring globalserializability in an MDBS environment to that of ensuring serializability in a traditionalDBMS. Since concurrency control in traditional DBMSs is a well studied problem; the …,*,1993,1
Situational Awareness over Large Spatio-Temporal Databases,Sharad Mehrotra; Iosif Lazaridis; Kriengkrai Porkaew,Abstract. Providing database support for interactive 3D Visualization and SituationalAwareness (SA) is one of the keys to making such systems scale to the complexity of real-world scenarios. It is desirable that SA systems be highly realistic and intuitive to use. From adatabase perspective these requirements translate into (i) support for large amount ofheterogeneous spatio-temporal data (to provide a convincing virtual environment;approximating the complexity of reality);(ii) support for highly dynamic situations in which thedata may change frequently;(iii) support for mechanisms to deal with inherent imprecision inthe underlying information; and;(iv) powerful query interface that allows users to pose variedand interesting queries that are answered with minimum time delay.

One-sided Differential Privacy,Stelios Doudalis; Ios Kotsogiannis; Samuel Haney; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract: In this paper; we study the problem of privacy-preserving data sharing; whereinonly a subset of the records in a database are sensitive; possibly based on predefinedprivacy policies. Existing solutions; viz; differential privacy (DP); are over-pessimistic andtreat all information as sensitive. Alternatively; techniques; like access control andpersonalized differential privacy; reveal all non-sensitive records truthfully; and theyindirectly leak information about sensitive records through exclusion attacks. Motivated bythe limitations of prior work; we introduce the notion of one-sided differential privacy (OSDP).We formalize the exclusion attack and we show how OSDP protects against it. OSDP offersdifferential privacy like guarantees; but only to the sensitive records. OSDP allows thetruthful release of a subset of the non-sensitive records.

Parallel Progressive Approach to Entity Resolution Using MapReduce,Yasser Altowim; Sharad Mehrotra,Entity resolution (ER) is the process of identifying which entities in a dataset represent thesame real-world object. This paper proposes a progressive approach to ER usingMapReduce. In contrast to traditional ER; progressive ER aims to resolve the dataset suchthat the rate at which the data quality improves is maximized. Such a progressive approachis useful for many emerging analytical applications that require low latency response and/orin situations where the underlying resources are constrained or costly to use. Experimentswith real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of our approach to generate high-qualityresults using limited amounts of resolution cost.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,*

Similarity Search Using Multiple Examples in,Kriengkrai Porkaew; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract. Unlike traditional database management systems; in multimedia databases thatsupport content-based retrieval over multimedia objects; it is difficult for users to expresstheir exact information need directly in the form of a precise query. A typical interfacesupported by content-based retrieval systems allows users to express their query in the formof examples of objects similar to the ones they wish to retrieve. Such a user interface;however; requires mechanisms to learn the query representation from the examplesprovided by the user. In our previous work; we proposed a query refinement mechanism inwhich a query representation is modified by adding new relevant examples based on userfeedback. In this paper; we describe query processing mechanisms that can efficientlysupport query expansion using multidimensional index,Visual Information and Information Systems: Third International Conference; VISUAL'99; Amsterdam; The Netherlands; June 2-4; 1999; Proceedings,2003,*

Guest Editorial: Continuous Media Databases,Aidong Zhang; Avi Silberschatz; Sharad Mehrotra,The need to handle multimedia data in database systems is growing rapidly in many fields;including video-on-demand servers; education and training; Web browsing; informationretrieval; electronic commerce; and distributed publishing. To meet these demands;database systems must have the ability to efficiently store; manage; and retrieve multimediadata. However; conventional database systems were not designed with these applications inmind; and as a result are not suitable to handle these type of new applications. Research oncontinuous-media database brings about a variety of interesting and challenging issueswhich are being studied by the multimedia database community. The aim of RIDE98workshop was to bring out the issues and methods used in designing continuous-mediadatabase systems.

Locally Dimensionality Reduction: A New Approach to Indexing High Dimensional Spaces (Preprint),Kaushik Chakrabarti; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract: Many emerging application domains require database systems to support efficientaccess over highly multidimensional datasets. The current state-of-the-art technique toindexing high dimensional data is to first reduce the dimensionality of the data usingPrincipal Component Analysis and then indexing the reduced dimensionality space using amultidimensional index structure. The above technique; referred to as global dimensionalityreduction (GDR); works well when the data set is globally correlated; ie most of the variationin the data can be captured by a few dimensions. In practice; datasets are often not globallycorrelated. In such cases; reducing the data dimensionality using GDR causes significantloss of distance information resulting in a large number of false positives and hence a highquery cost. Even when a global correlation does not exist; there may exist subsets of data …,*,2000,*
The Hybrid Tree: An Index Structure for High Dimensional Feature Spaces (Preprint),Kaushik Chakrabarti; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract: Feature based similarity search is emerging as an important search paradigm indatabase systems. The technique used is to map the data items as points into a highdimensional feature space which is indexed using a multidimensional data structure.Similarity search then corresponds to a range search over the data structure. Althoughseveral data structures have been proposed for feature indexing; none of them is known toscale beyond 10-15 dimensional spaces. This paper introduces the hybrid tree amultidimensional data structure for indexing high dimensional feature spaces. Unlike othermultidimensional data structures; the hybrid tree cannot be classified as either a pure datapartitioning (DP) index structure (eg; R-tree; SS-tree; SRtree) or a pure space partitioning(SP) one (eg; KDB-tree; hBtree); rather; it combines positive aspects of the two types of …,*,1999,*

Interoperability with unstructured data and services,Daniel Barbara; Yuri Breitbart; Hector Garcia-Molina; Henry F Korth; Sharad Mehrotra,A large percentage of valuable information is not stored in database management systems.Therefore; many applications must deal only only with heterogeneous structured data; butwith a wide variety of unstructured and semi-structured data such as electronic mail;documents; files and spreadsheets. In addition; these applications must deal withheterogeneous services such as an electronic library or an airline reservation service. Whileit is; of course; important to study interoperability among heterogeneous conventionaldatabase systems; it is also very important to study interoperation in this broader domain;where application programs must interact with a wide variety of services and must handlemany types of structures; unstructured; and semi-structured data.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1993: Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems; 1993.

During a crisis; responding organizations confrontgrave uncertainties in making critical decisions. They need to gather situational information(eg; state of the civil; transportation and information infrastructures); together with informationabout available resources (eg; medical facilities; rescue and law enforcement units). Thereis a strong correlation between the accuracy; timeliness; and reliability of the informationavailable to the decision-makers; and the quality of their decisions.

Building a Mobile Applications Knowledge Base,Primal Pappachan; Roberto Yus; Prajit Kumar Das; Sharad Mehrotra; Tim Finin; Anupam Joshi,Abstract. The number of mobile applications (apps) in major app stores exceeded onemillion in 2013. While app stores provide a central point for storing app metadata; they oftenimpose restrictions on the access to this information thus limiting the potential to developtools to search; recommend; and analyze app information. A few projects have circumventedthese limitations and managed to create a dataset with a substantial number of apps.However; accessing this information; especially for the purpose of an integrated view; isdifficult as there is no common standard for publishing data. We present Mobipedia; an effortto gather this information from various sources and publish it as RDF Linked Data.

SORTaki: A Framework to Integrate Sorting with Differential Private Histogramming Algorithms,Stylianos Doudalis; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract—Differential privacy has been established as the primary framework for privacypreserving data-sharing. In the context of query answering through histograms; most of thedatadependent solutions are composed of two steps: a partitioning phase that splits thehistogram into bins and a finalizing step that approximates each bin with its averagefrequency or other similar statistics. Solutions that sort the histograms' values prior to thepartitioning phase can improve the utility of the final output. In this paper; we build SORTaki;a framework that integrates sorting with any partitioning and finalizing mechanism. UsingSORTaki; we modify existing partitioning and finalizing solutions; as well as propose newones; that mitigate the error of the final approximation up to 70% over existing sorting ornonsorting based algorithms. Additionally; we perform a principled and thorough …,*,*,*

Event Based Approach to Situational Representation,Dmitri V Kalashnikov Dawit Seid Yiming; Ma Naveen Ashish Sharad Mehrotra Nalini; Venkatasubramanian Cal,ABSTRACT Many application domains require representing interrelated real-world activitiesand/or evolving physical phenomena. In the crisis response domain; for instance; one maybe interested in representing the state of the unfolding crisis (eg; forest fire); the progress ofthe response activities such as evacuation and traffic control; and the state of the crisis site(s). Such a situation representation can then be used to support multitude of applicationsincluding situation monitoring; analysis; and planning. In this paper; we make a case for anevent based representation of situations where events are defined to be domain-specificsignificant occurrences in space and time. We argue that events offer a unifying andpowerful abstraction to building situational awareness applications. We identify challengesin building an Event Management System (EMS) for which traditional data and …,*,*,*

SMPL a Specification Language Based Framework for the Semantic Structure; Annotation and Control of SMIL Documents,Ronen Vaisenberg; Ramesh Jain; Sharad Mehrotra,In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a declarative XML language usedto support the seman- tic structure; annotation and control of SMIL documents. We evaluate thesystem in the context of distant learning en- vironment. We named the new framework SMPLas it intended to support the design of simple; declarative language based; multimedia documentmanagement standards; based on SMIL - a W3C standard. SMPL is supported by all browsersde-facto. Unlike per- haps other web standards; where adding functionality has to be includedin a release of a new version for a plug-in or a web browser; SMPL is extendable and yet requiresno specific changes to the implementation of a plugin or the browser; beyond it's support forSMIL. We envision SMPL as the framework for the next gen- eration semantic Multimedia documentmanagement lan- guages. It supports the creation of different languages that facilitate …,*,*,*

A Reflective Architecture for Cellular Networks,Xingbo Yu; Iosif Lazaridis; Jinsu Wang; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Babak Jafarian,ABSTRACT The rapid growth of cellular telephony; the portability of cell phone devices; andthe imminent realization of cell phone localization technologies represent a greatopportunity for crisis management applications. Inasmuch as connectivity is maintainedduring the crisis; cell phone users may receive real-time spatially-relevant instructions fromauthorities; helping them survive and function within the crisis region. Cellular infrastructurealso enables collecting relevant on-site crisis related information from human informants.While the implications are enormous; cellular infrastructures as they exist today; do notprovide a reliable and scalable platform to realizing the potential. It is well documented inthe literature that the cellular services are amongst the first to fail both due to the collapse ofinfrastructure or the paucity of resources needed to meet surge in demands.

Exploiting Quality/Performance Tradeoffs in Sensor Network Applications,Xingbo Yu; Koushik Niyogi; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Recent advances in processor; memory and radio technology have enabled cheapnodes capable of sensing; communicating and processing. Networks of distributedmicrosensors are rapidly emerging as a feasible solution to a wide range of data gatheringapplications. However; the key impediments to successful deployment of microsensor nodesare their energy and longevity constraints. We propose a middleware framework for energyaware information collection in sensor networks with a focus on tracking applications. Theproposed framework explores the trade-off between energy and application quality tosignificantly reduce energy consumption in the sensor network thereby enhancing thelifetime of a sensor node. We also show that using prediction models in our architectureprovides further gains in energy conservation and reduction in transmission costs over …,*,*,*

Exploiting Semantics for Sensor Re-Calibration in Event Detection Systems [long],Ronen Vaisenberg; Shengyue Ji; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,ABSTRACT Event detection from a video stream is becoming an important and challengingtask in surveillance and sentient systems. While computer vision has been extensivelystudied to solve different kinds of detection problems over time; it is still a hard problem andeven in a controlled environment only simple events can be detected with a high degree ofaccuracy. Instead of struggling to improve event detection using image processing only; webring in semantics to direct traditional image processing. Semantics are the underlying factsthat hide beneath video frames; which can not be “seen” directly by image processing. In thiswork we demonstrate that time sequence semantics can be exploited to guide unsupervisedre-calibration of the event detection system. We present an instantiation of our ideas byusing an appliance as an example-Coffee Pot level detection based on video datato …,*,*,*

Computing connection strength in probabilistic graphs,Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Many data mining algorithms view datasets as attributed relation graphs (ARGs) inwhich nodes correspond to entities and edges to relationships. However; frequently real-world datasets contain uncertainty and can be represented only as probabilistic ARGs(pARGs); ie as ARGs where each edge has associated with it a non-zero probability of thatedge to exist–probabilistic edge. In this paper we first introduce an interesting novel conceptof probabilistic ARGs and then present an algorithm for efficient computation of the importantconnection strength metric directly on probabilistic ARGs. Such a metric is useful foranalyzing social and collaboration networks; to measure 'impact'; and other purposes.,*,*,*

Privacy-Preserving Triggers for Pervasive Spaces,Jehan Wickramasuriya; Mahesh Datt; Bijit Hore; Stanislaw Jarecki; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract. Providing pervasive services often necessitates gathering information aboutindividuals that may be considered sensitive. Often; one is forced to make a difficult choice:either to risk loss of privacy or to let go of the benefits pervasive technology offers. Ourconjecture is that such a choice is not always necessary. It is possible to design datacollection strategies in such a way that services offered by pervasive environments do notcome at the expense of individuals' privacy. Specifically; we consider a trigger-basedpervasive environment in which end-user services are built using triggers over eventsdetected through sensors. Privacy concerns in such a pervasive space are analogous todisclosure and misuse of event logs. We use cryptographic techniques to prevent loss ofprivacy; but that raises a fundamental challenge of evaluating triggers over the encrypted …,*,*,*

XAR: An Integrated Framework for Semantic Extraction and,Naveen Ashish; Sharad Mehrotra,The vision of semantic interoperability on a large-scale; such as that envisioned by theconcept of the Semantic-Web (Berners-Lee; Hendler & Lassila; 2001); continues to sustaininterest and excitement. The availability of automated tools for semantic annotation of dataon the open Web is recognized as critical for Semantic-Web enablement. In the process ofsemantic annotation we annotate significant entities and relationships in documents andpages on the Web; thus making them amenable for machine processing. The time andinvestment of marking and annotating Web content manually is prohibitive for all but ahandful of Web content providers; which leads us to develop automated tools for this task. Asan example; consider Web pages of academic researchers with their biographies in free textas shown in Fig 1.,*,*,*
