Resisting structural re-identification in anonymized social networks,Michael Hay; Gerome Miklau; David Jensen; Don Towsley; Philipp Weis,Abstract We identify privacy risks associated with releasing network data sets and providean algorithm that mitigates those risks. A network consists of entities connected by linksrepresenting relations such as friendship; communication; or shared activity. Maintainingprivacy when publishing networked data is uniquely challenging because an individual'snetwork context can be used to identify them even if other identifying information is removed.In this paper; we quantify the privacy risks associated with three classes of attacks on theprivacy of individuals in networks; based on the knowledge used by the adversary. We showthat the risks of these attacks vary greatly based on network structure and size. We proposea novel approach to anonymizing network data that models aggregate network structure andthen allows samples to be drawn from that model. The approach guarantees anonymity …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,517,21
Anonymizing social networks,Michael Hay; Gerome Miklau; David Jensen; Philipp Weis; Siddharth Srivastava,Abstract Advances in technology have made it possible to collect data about individuals andthe connections between them; such as email correspondence and friendships. Agenciesand researchers who have collected such social network data often have a compellinginterest in allowing others to analyze the data. However; in many cases the data describesrelationships that are private (eg; email correspondence) and sharing the data in full canresult in unacceptable disclosures. In this paper; we present a framework for assessing theprivacy risk of sharing anonymized network data. This includes a model of adversaryknowledge; for which we consider several variants and make connections to known graphtheoretical results. On several real-world social networks; we show that simpleanonymization techniques are inadequate; resulting in substantial breaches of privacy for …,Computer Science Department Faculty Publication Series,2007,377,21
Containment and equivalence for an XPath fragment,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract XPath is a simple language for navigating an XML document and selecting a set ofelement nodes. XPath expressions are used to query XML data; describe key constraints;express transformations; and reference elements in remote documents. This paper studiesthe containment and equivalence problems for a fragment of the XPath query language; withapplications in all these contexts. In particular; we study a class of XPath queries that containbranching; label wildcards and can express descendant relationships between nodes. Priorwork has shown that languages which combine any two of these three features haveefficient containment algorithms. However; we show that for the combination of features;containment is coNP-complete. We provide a sound and complete EXPTIME algorithm forcontainment; and study parameterized PTIME special cases.

Controlling access to published data using cryptography,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We propose a framework for enforcing access control policies on published XMLdocuments using cryptography. In this framework the owner publishes a single datainstance; which is partially encrypted; and which enforces all access control policies. Ourcontributions include a declarative language for access policies; and the resolution of thesepolicies into a logical" protection model" which protects an XML tree with keys. The dataowner enforces an access control policy by granting keys to users. The model is quitepowerful; allowing the data owner to describe complex access scenarios; and is also quiteelegant; allowing logical optimizations to be described as rewriting rules. Finally; wedescribe cryptographic techniques for enforcing the protection model on published data; andprovide a performance analysis using real datasets.,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,358,3

Boosting the accuracy of differentially private histograms through consistency,Michael Hay; Vibhor Rastogi; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We show that it is possible to significantly improve the accuracy of a general classof histogram queries while satisfying differential privacy. Our approach carefully chooses aset of queries to evaluate; and then exploits consistency constraints that should hold overthe noisy output. In a post-processing phase; we compute the consistent input most likely tohave produced the noisy output. The final output is differentially-private and consistent; butin addition; it is often much more accurate. We show; both theoretically and experimentally;that these techniques can be used for estimating the degree sequence of a graph veryprecisely; and for computing a histogram that can support arbitrary range queries accurately.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,345,12
Processing XML streams with deterministic automata,Todd J Green; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on anXML stream. Our main contribution consists in showing that Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA) can be used effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a throughputof about 5.4 MB/s; independent of the number of XPath expressions (up to 1;000;000 in ourtests). The major problem we face is that of the size of the DFA. Since the number of statesgrows exponentially with the number of XPath expressions; it was previously believed thatDFAs cannot be used to process large sets of expressions. We make a theoretical analysisof the number of states in the DFA resulting from XPath expressions; and consider both thecase when it is constructed eagerly; and when it is constructed lazily. Our analysis indicatesthat; when the automaton is constructed lazily; and under certain assumptions about the …,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,328,16
The Piazza peer data management project,Igor Tatarinov; Zachary Ives; Jayant Madhavan; Alon Halevy; Dan Suciu; Nilesh Dalvi; Xin Luna Dong; Yana Kadiyska; Gerome Miklau; Peter Mork,Abstract A major problem in today's information-driven world is that sharing heterogeneous;semantically rich data is incredibly difficult. Piazza is a peer data management system thatenables sharing heterogeneous data in a distributed and scalable way. Piazza assumes theparticipants to be interested in sharing data; and willing to define pairwise mappingsbetween their schemas. Then; users formulate queries over their preferred schema; and aquery answering system expands recursively any mappings relevant to the query; retrievingdata from other peers. In this paper; we provide a brief overview of the Piazza projectincluding our work on developing mapping languages and query reformulation algorithms;assisting the users in defining mappings; indexing; and enforcing access control overshared data.,ACM Sigmod Record,2003,263,21
A formal analysis of information disclosure in data exchange,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We perform a theoretical study of the following query-view security problem: given aview V to be published; does V logically disclose information about a confidential query S?The problem is motivated by the need to manage the risk of unintended informationdisclosure in today's world of universal data exchange. We present a novel information-theoretic standard for query-view security. This criterion can be used to provide a preciseanalysis of information disclosure for a host of data exchange scenarios; including multi-party collusion and the use of outside knowledge by an adversary trying to learn privilegedfacts about the database. We prove a number of theoretical results for deciding securityaccording to this standard. We also generalize our security criterion to account for priorknowledge a user or adversary may possess; and introduce techniques for measuring the …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2007,262,12
Processing XML streams with deterministic automata and stream indexes,Todd J Green; Ashish Gupta; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on astream of XML packets. We contribute two novel techniques. The first is to use a singleDeterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The contribution here is to show that the DFA can beused effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a constant throughput;independently of the number of XPath expressions. The major issue is the size of the DFA;which; in theory; can be exponential in the number of XPath expressions. We provide aseries of theoretical results and experimental evaluations that show that the lazy DFA has asmall number of states; for all practical purposes. These results are of general interest inXPath processing; beyond stream processing. The second technique is the Streaming IndeX(SIX); which consists of adding a small amount of binary data to each XML packet that …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2004,259,12
Optimizing linear counting queries under differential privacy,Chao Li; Michael Hay; Vibhor Rastogi; Gerome Miklau; Andrew McGregor,Abstract Differential privacy is a robust privacy standard that has been successfully appliedto a range of data analysis tasks. But despite much recent work; optimal strategies foranswering a collection of related queries are not known. We propose the matrix mechanism;a new algorithm for answering a workload of predicate counting queries. Given a workload;the mechanism requests answers to a different set of queries; called a query strategy; whichare answered using the standard Laplace mechanism. Noisy answers to the workloadqueries are then derived from the noisy answers to the strategy queries. This two stageprocess can result in a more complex correlated noise distribution that preserves differentialprivacy but increases accuracy.,Proceedings of the twenty-ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2010,243,6
Accurate estimation of the degree distribution of private networks,Michael Hay; Chao Li; Gerome Miklau; David Jensen,We describe an efficient algorithm for releasing a provably private estimate of the degreedistribution of a network. The algorithm satisfies a rigorous property of differential privacy;and is also extremely efficient; running on networks of 100 million nodes in a few seconds.Theoretical analysis shows that the error scales linearly with the number of unique degrees;whereas the error of conventional techniques scales linearly with the number of nodes. Wecomplement the theoretical analysis with a thorough empirical analysis on real and syntheticgraphs; showing that the algorithm's variance and bias is low; that the error diminishes asthe size of the input graph increases; and that common analyses like fitting a power-law canbe carried out very accurately.,Data Mining; 2009.

Relationship privacy: output perturbation for queries with joins,Vibhor Rastogi; Michael Hay; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study privacy-preserving query answering over data containing relationships. Asocial network is a prime example of such data; where the nodes represent individuals andedges represent relationships. Nearly all interesting queries over social networks involvejoins; and for such queries; existing output perturbation algorithms severely distort queryanswers. We propose an algorithm that significantly improves utility over competingtechniques; typically reducing the error bound from polynomial in the number of nodes topolylogarithmic. The algorithm is; to the best of our knowledge; the first to answer suchqueries with acceptable accuracy; even for worst-case inputs. The improved utility isachieved by relaxing the privacy condition. Instead of ensuring strict differential privacy; weguarantee a weaker (but still quite practical) condition based on adversarial privacy.

Threats to privacy in the forensic analysis of database systems,Patrick Stahlberg; Gerome Miklau; Brian Neil Levine,Abstract The use of any modern computer system leaves unintended traces of expired dataand remnants of users' past activities. In this paper; we investigate the unintendedpersistence of data stored in database systems. This data can be recovered by forensicanalysis; and it poses a threat to privacy. First; we show how data remnants are preserved indatabase table storage; the transaction log; indexes; and other system components. Ourevaluation of several real database systems reveals that deleted data is not securelyremoved from database storage and that users have little control over the persistence ofdeleted data.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,92,3
An adaptive mechanism for accurate query answering under differential privacy,Chao Li; Gerome Miklau,Abstract We propose a novel mechanism for answering sets of counting queries underdifferential privacy. Given a workload of counting queries; the mechanism automaticallyselects a different set of" strategy" queries to answer privately; using those answers to deriveanswers to the workload. The main algorithm proposed in this paper approximates theoptimal strategy for any workload of linear counting queries. With no cost to the privacyguarantee; the mechanism improves significantly on prior approaches and achieves near-optimal error for many workloads; when applied under (ε; δ)-differential privacy. The result isan adaptive mechanism which can help users achieve good utility without requiring that theyreason carefully about the best formulation of their task.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,85,3
Resisting structural re-identification in anonymized social networks,Michael Hay; Gerome Miklau; David Jensen; Don Towsley; Chao Li,Abstract We identify privacy risks associated with releasing network datasets and provide analgorithm that mitigates those risks. A network dataset is a graph representing entitiesconnected by edges representing relations such as friendship; communication or sharedactivity. Maintaining privacy when publishing a network dataset is uniquely challengingbecause an individual's network context can be used to identify them even if other identifyinginformation is removed. In this paper; we introduce a parameterized model of structuralknowledge available to the adversary and quantify the success of attacks on individuals inanonymized networks. We show that the risks of these attacks vary based on networkstructure and size and provide theoretical results that explain the anonymity risk in randomnetworks. We then propose a novel approach to anonymizing network data that models …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,80,12
Scalable probabilistic databases with factor graphs and MCMC,Michael Wick; Andrew McCallum; Gerome Miklau,Abstract Incorporating probabilities into the semantics of incomplete databases has posedmany challenges; forcing systems to sacrifice modeling power; scalability; or treatment ofrelational algebra operators. We propose an alternative approach where the underlyingrelational database always represents a single world; and an external factor graph encodesa distribution over possible worlds; Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference is thenused to recover this uncertainty to a desired level of fidelity. Our approach allows the efficientevaluation of arbitrary queries over probabilistic databases with arbitrary dependenciesexpressed by graphical models with structure that changes during inference. MCMCsampling provides efficiency by hypothesizing modifications to possible worlds rather thangenerating entire worlds from scratch. Queries are then run over the portions of the world …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,76,19
A theory of pricing private data,Chao Li; Daniel Yang Li; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract Personal data has value to both its owner and to institutions who would like toanalyze it. Privacy mechanisms protect the owner's data while releasing to analysts noisyversions of aggregate query results. But such strict protections of the individual's data havenot yet found wide use in practice. Instead; Internet companies; for example; commonlyprovide free services in return for valuable sensitive information from users; which theyexploit and sometimes sell to third parties. As awareness of the value of personal dataincreases; so has the drive to compensate the end-user for her private information. The ideaof monetizing private data can improve over the narrower view of hiding private data; since itempowers individuals to control their data through financial means.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,69,12
Differential privacy in data publication and analysis,Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Gerome Miklau; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Data privacy has been an important research topic in the security; theory anddatabase communities in the last few decades. However; many existing studies haverestrictive assumptions regarding the adversary's prior knowledge; meaning that theypreserve individuals' privacy only when the adversary has rather limited backgroundinformation about the sensitive data; or only uses certain kinds of attacks. Recently;differential privacy has emerged as a new paradigm for privacy protection with veryconservative assumptions about the adversary's prior knowledge. Since its proposal;differential privacy had been gaining attention in many fields of computer science; and isconsidered among the most promising paradigms for privacy-preserving data publicationand analysis. In this tutorial; we will motivate its introduction as a replacement for other …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,65,1
Asymptotic conditional probabilities for conjunctive queries,Nilesh Dalvi; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the asymptotic probabilities of conjunctive queries on random graphs. Weconsider a probabilistic model where the expected graph size remains constantindependent of the number of vertices. While it has been known that a convergence lawholds for conjunctive queries under this model; we focus on the calculation of conditionalprobabilities. This has direct applications to database problems like query-view security; ieevaluating the probability of a sensitive query given the knowledge of a set of publishedviews. We prove that a convergence law holds for conditional probabilities of conjunctivequeries and we give a procedure for calculating the conditional probabilities.,International Conference on Database Theory,2005,56,10
A data-and workload-aware algorithm for range queries under differential privacy,Chao Li; Michael Hay; Gerome Miklau; Yue Wang,Abstract We describe a new algorithm for answering a given set of range queries under ε-differential privacy which often achieves substantially lower error than competing methods.Our algorithm satisfies differential privacy by adding noise that is adapted to the input dataand to the given query set. We first privately learn a partitioning of the domain into bucketsthat suit the input data well. Then we privately estimate counts for each bucket; doing so in amanner well-suited for the given query set. Since the performance of the algorithm dependson the input database; we evaluate it on a wide range of real datasets; showing that we canachieve the benefits of data-dependence on both" easy" and" hard" databases.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,54,6
Analyzing Privacy in Enterprise Packet Trace Anonymization.,Bruno F Ribeiro; Weifeng Chen; Gerome Miklau; Donald F Towsley,Abstract Accurate network measurement through trace collection is critical for advancingnetwork design and for maintaining secure; reliable networks. Unfortunately; the release ofnetwork traces to analysts is highly constrained by privacy concerns. Several anonymizationschemes have been proposed to address this issue. Preservation of prefix relationshipsamong anonymized addresses is an important aspect of trace utility; but also causes anumber of vulnerabilities in trace anonymization. In this work we present a novel; systematicattack on prefix-preserving anonymization which can be efficiently executed by an adversaryin possession of a modest amount of public information about the network. The attack isgeneral (encompassing a range of fingerprinting attacks proposed by others) and flexible (itcan be adapted to emerging variants of prefix-preserving anonymization).

Learning to predict the quality of contributions to wikipedia,Gregory Druck; Gerome Miklau; Andrew McCallum,Abstract Although some have argued that Wikipedia's open edit policy is one of the primaryreasons for its success; it also raises concerns about quality—vandalism; bias; and errorscan be problems. Despite these challenges; Wikipedia articles are often (perhapssurprisingly) of high quality; which many attribute to both the dedicated Wikipedia communityand “good Samaritan” users. As Wikipedia continues to grow; however; it becomes moredifficult for these users to keep up with the increasing number of articles and edits. Thismotivates the development of tools to assist users in creating and maintaining quality. In thispaper; we propose metrics that quantify the quality of contributions to Wikipedia throughimplicit feedback from the community. We then learn discriminative probabilistic models thatpredict the quality of a new edit using features of the changes made; the author of the edit …,WikiAI,2008,43,18
Principled evaluation of differentially private algorithms using dpbench,Michael Hay; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Gerome Miklau; Yan Chen; Dan Zhang,Abstract Differential privacy has become the dominant standard in the research communityfor strong privacy protection. There has been a flood of research into query answeringalgorithms that meet this standard. Algorithms are becoming increasingly complex; and inparticular; the performance of many emerging algorithms is data dependent; meaning thedistribution of the noise added to query answers may change depending on the input data.Theoretical analysis typically only considers the worst case; making empirical study ofaverage case performance increasingly important. In this paper we propose a set ofevaluation principles which we argue are essential for sound evaluation. Based on theseprinciples we propose DPBench; a novel evaluation framework for standardized evaluationof privacy algorithms. We then apply our benchmark to evaluate algorithms for answering …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,37,10
Securing history: Privacy and accountability in database systems.,Gerome Miklau; Brian Neil Levine; Patrick Stahlberg,ABSTRACT Databases that preserve a historical record of activities and data offer theimportant benefit of system accountability: past events can be analyzed to detect breachesand maintain data quality. But the retention of history can also pose a threat to privacy.System designers need to carefully balance the need for privacy and accountability bycontrolling how and when data is retained by the system and who will be able to recover andanalyze it. This paper describes the technical challenges faced in enhancing databasesystems so that they can securely manage history. These include: first; assessing theunintended retention of data in existing database systems that can threaten privacy; second;redesigning system components to avoid this unintended retention; and third; developingnew system features to support accountability when it is desired.,CIDR,2007,28,12
Exponential random graph estimation under differential privacy,Wentian Lu; Gerome Miklau,Abstract The effective analysis of social networks and graph-structured data is often limitedby the privacy concerns of individuals whose data make up these networks. Differentialprivacy offers individuals a rigorous and appealing guarantee of privacy. But whiledifferentially private algorithms for computing basic graph properties have been proposed;most graph modeling tasks common in the data mining community cannot yet be carried outprivately. In this work we propose algorithms for privately estimating the parameters ofexponential random graph models (ERGMs). We break the estimation problem into twosteps: computing private sufficient statistics; then using them to estimate the modelparameters. We consider specific alternating statistics that are in common use for ERGMmodels and describe a method for estimating them privately by adding noise proportional …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,27,5
Pricing Aggregate Queries in a Data Marketplace.,Chao Li; Gerome Miklau,ABSTRACT In a data marketplace; producers of data provide query answers to consumersin exchange for payment. A market for data allows capital to flow from data consumers todata producers. This helps to finance the costs of data collection and dissemination; therebyincreasing the availability of data throughout society. While nascent data markets exist onthe Web; they are currently limited in the pricing mechanisms and interactions they support.In this paper we propose new criteria for interactive pricing in a data market: price functionsshould be non-disclosive; arbitrage-free; and regret-free. We study the structure of pricefunctions meeting these criteria; and distinguish between NP-complete and PTIME cases forcomputing a conforming price function.,WebDB,2012,25,10
Cryptographically Enforced Conditional Access for XML.,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract Access control for databases is typically enforced by a trusted server responsible forpermitting or denying users access to the database. This server-based protection model isincreasingly becoming inconvenient for web based applications. We propose encryptiontechniques that allow¥¦ § documents to be distributed over the web to clients for localprocessing while maintaining certain access controls. In particular; we focus on conditionalaccess controls; where a user is granted access to certain data elements conditioned on theuser's existing knowledge of another part of the data. We believe such access controls areimportant in practice; and that enforcing them cryptographically on remote instances allowsfor more flexible data dissemination and processing.,WebDB,2002,23,10
Implementing a tamper-evident database system,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data integrity is an assurance that data has not been modified in an unknown orunauthorized manner. The goal of this paper is to allow a user to leverage a small amount oftrusted client-side computation to achieve guarantees of integrity when interacting with avulnerable or untrusted database server. To achieve this goal we describe a novel relationalhash tree; designed for efficient database processing; and evaluate the performance penaltyfor integrity guarantees. We show that strong cryptographic guarantees of integrity can beprovided in a relational database with modest overhead.,Annual Asian Computing Science Conference,2005,22,10
Privacy-aware data management in information networks,Michael Hay; Kun Liu; Gerome Miklau; Jian Pei; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The proliferation of information networks; as a means of sharing information; hasraised privacy concerns for enterprises who manage such networks and for individual usersthat participate in such networks. For enterprises; the main challenge is to satisfy twocompeting goals: releasing network data for useful data analysis and also preserving theidentities or sensitive relationships of the individuals participating in the network. Individualusers; on the other hand; require personalized methods that increase their awareness of thevisibility of their private information.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,21,12
The matrix mechanism: optimizing linear counting queries under differential privacy,Chao Li; Gerome Miklau; Michael Hay; Andrew McGregor; Vibhor Rastogi,Abstract Differential privacy is a robust privacy standard that has been successfully appliedto a range of data analysis tasks. We describe the matrix mechanism; an algorithm foranswering a workload of linear counting queries that adapts the noise distribution toproperties of the provided queries. Given a workload; the mechanism uses a different set ofqueries; called a query strategy; which are answered using a standard Laplace or Gaussianmechanism. Noisy answers to the workload queries are then derived from the noisy answersto the strategy queries. This two-stage process can result in a more complex; correlatednoise distribution that preserves differential privacy but increases accuracy. We provide aformal analysis of the error of query answers produced by the mechanism and investigatethe problem of computing the optimal query strategy in support of a given workload. We …,The VLDB journal,2015,20,18
Optimal error of query sets under the differentially-private matrix mechanism,Chao Li; Gerome Miklau,Abstract A common goal of privacy research is to release synthetic data that satisfies aformal privacy guarantee and can be used by an analyst in place of the original data. Toachieve reasonable accuracy; a synthetic data set must be tuned to support a specified setof queries accurately; sacrificing fidelity for other queries. This work considers methods forproducing synthetic data under differential privacy and investigates what makes a set ofqueries" easy" or" hard" to answer. We consider answering sets of linear counting queriesusing the matrix mechanism [18]; a recent differentially-private mechanism that can reduceerror by adding complex correlated noise adapted to a specified workload.,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Database Theory,2013,20,12
Auditing a database under retention restrictions,Wentian Lu; Gerome Miklau,Auditing the changes to a database is critical for identifying malicious behavior; maintainingdata quality; and improving system performance. But an accurate audit log is a historicalrecord of the past that can also pose a serious threat to privacy. Policies which limit dataretention conflict with the goal of accurate auditing; and data owners have to carefullybalance the need for policy compliance with the goal of accurate auditing. In this paper; weprovide a framework for auditing the changes to a database system while respecting dataretention policies. Our framework includes a historical data model that supports flexible auditqueries; along with a language for retention policies that hide individual attribute values orremove entire tuples from history. Under retention policies; the audit history is partiallyincomplete. We formalize the meaning of audit queries on the protected history; which …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Collaborative access control in webdamlog,Vera Zaychik Moffitt; Julia Stoyanovich; Serge Abiteboul; Gerome Miklau,Abstract The management of Web users' personal information is increasingly distributedacross a broad array of applications and systems; including online social networks andcloud-based services. Users wish to share data using these systems; but avoiding the risksof unintended disclosures or unauthorized access by applications has become a majorchallenge. We propose a novel access control model that operates within a distributed datamanagement framework based on datalog. Using this model; users can control access todata they own and control applications they run. They can conveniently specify accesscontrol policies providing flexible tuple-level control derived using provenance information.We present a formal specification of the model; an implementation built using an open-source distributed datalog engine; and an extensive experimental evaluation showing …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,11,12

Data; responsibly: Fairness; neutrality and transparency in data analysis,Julia Stoyanovich; Serge Abiteboul; Gerome Miklau,Big data technology holds incredible promise of improving people's lives; acceleratingscientific discovery and innovation; and bringing about positive societal change. Yet; if notused responsibly; this technology can propel economic inequality; destabilize globalmarkets and affirm systemic bias. While the potential benefits of big data are well-accepted;the importance of using these techniques in a fair and transparent manner is rarelyconsidered. The primary goal of this tutorial is to draw the attention of the data managementcommunity to the important emerging subject of responsible data management and analysis.We will offer our perspective on the issue; will give an overview of existing technical work;primarily from the data mining and algorithms communities; and will motivate future researchdirections.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2016,10,12

A framework for safely publishing communication traces,Abhinav Parate; Gerome Miklau,Abstract A communication trace is a detailed record of the communication between twoentities. Communication traces are vital for research in computer networks and study ofnetwork protocols in various domains; but their release is severely constrained by privacyand security concerns. In this paper; we propose a framework in which a trace owner canmatch an anonymizing transformation with the requirements of analysts. The trace ownercan release multiple transformed traces; each customized to an analyst's needs; or a singletransformation satisfying all requirements. The framework enables formal reasoning aboutanonymization policies; for example to verify that a given trace has utility for the analyst; or toobtain the most secure anonymization for the desired level of utility.

But an accurate audit log is ahistorical record of the past that can also pose a serious threat to privacy. In many domains;retention policies govern how long data can be preserved by an institution.

Pythia: Data dependent differentially private algorithm selection,Ios Kotsogiannis; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Michael Hay; Gerome Miklau,Abstract Differential privacy has emerged as a preferred standard for ensuring privacy inanalysis tasks on sensitive datasets. Recent algorithms have allowed for significantly lowererror by adapting to properties of the input data. These so-called data-dependent algorithmshave different error rates for different inputs. There is now a complex and growing landscapeof algorithms without a clear winner that can offer low error over all datasets. As a result; thebest possible error rates are not attainable in practice; because the data curator cannotknow which algorithm to select prior to actually running the algorithm. We address thischallenge by proposing a novel meta-algorithm designed to relieve the data curator of theburden of algorithm selection. It works by learning (from non-sensitive data) the associationbetween dataset properties and the best-performing algorithm. The meta-algorithm is …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,8,2
Private Database Synthesis for Outsourced System Evaluation.,Vani Gupta; Gerome Miklau; Neoklis Polyzotis,Abstract. The goal of this paper is to permit secure outsourced system evaluation. Wepropose a method for generating synthetic databases and obfuscating a workload of queriesin order to protect the sensitive information present in the database. The synthetic databaseand workload can be used by a third party to accurately carry out performance tuning; indexselection; or other system evaluation tasks. As a result; an untrusted third party can evaluatewhether a new technology would benefit the data owner without the risk of a privacy breach.Our approach is to employ state-of-the-art privacy mechanisms to compute the sufficientstatistics of a statistical model of the true database. These statistics are safe to release; so athird party can then use them to generate one or more synthetic databases to be used as asurrogate for the true database.,AMW,2011,7,21
Efficient batch query answering under differential privacy,Chao Li; Gerome Miklau,Abstract: Differential privacy is a rigorous privacy condition achieved by randomizing queryanswers. This paper develops efficient algorithms for answering multiple queries underdifferential privacy with low error. We pursue this goal by advancing a recent approachcalled the matrix mechanism; which generalizes standard differentially private mechanisms.This new mechanism works by first answering a different set of queries (a strategy) and theninferring the answers to the desired workload of queries. Although a few strategies areknown to work well on specific workloads; finding the strategy which minimizes error on anarbitrary workload is intractable. We prove a new lower bound on the optimal error of thismechanism; and we propose an efficient algorithm that approaches this bound for a widerange of workloads.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1103.1367,2011,6,18
Boosting the accuracy of differentially-private queries through consistency,Michael Hay; Vibhor Rastogi; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT Recent differentially private query mechanisms offer strong privacy guaranteesby adding noise to the query answer. For a single counting query; the technique is simple;accurate; and provides optimal utility. However; analysts typically wish to ask multiplequeries. In this case; the optimal strategy is not apparent; and alternative query strategiescan involve difficult trade-offs in accuracy; and may produce inconsistent answers. In thiswork we show that it is possible to significantly improve accuracy for a general class ofhistogram queries. Our approach carefully chooses a set of queries to evaluate; and thenexploits consistency constraints that should hold over the noisy output. In a post-processingphase; we compute the consistent input most likely to have produced the noisy output. Thefinal output is both private and consistent; but in addition; it is often much more accurate …,CoRR; abs/0904.0942; April,2009,6,12
Self-interested database managers playing the view maintenance game,Hala Mostafa; Victor Lesser; Gerome Miklau,Abstract A database view is a dynamic virtual table composed of the result set of a query;often executed over different underlying databases.

Generating private synthetic databases for untrusted system evaluation,Wentian Lu; Gerome Miklau; Vani Gupta,Evaluating the performance of database systems is crucial when database vendors orresearchers are developing new technologies. But such evaluation tasks rely heavily onactual data and query workloads that are often unavailable to researchers due to privacyrestrictions. To overcome this barrier; we propose a framework for the release of a syntheticdatabase which accurately models selected performance properties of the originaldatabase. We improve on prior work on synthetic database generation by providing a formal;rigorous guarantee of privacy. Accuracy is achieved by generating synthetic data using acarefully selected set of statistical properties of the original data which balance privacy losswith relevance to the given query workload. An important contribution of our framework is anextension of standard differential privacy to multiple tables.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,5,18

Probabilistic representations for integrating unreliable data sources,David Mimno; Andrew McCallum; Gerome Miklau,Abstract Databases constructed automatically through web mining and informationextraction often overlap with databases constructed and curated by hand. These two types ofdatabases are complementary: automatic extraction provides increased scope; whilecurated databases provide increased accuracy. The uncertain nature of such integrationtasks suggests that the final representation of the merged database should representmultiple possible values. We present initial work on a system to integrate two bibliographicdatabases; DBLP and Rexa; while maintaining and assigning probabilistic confidences todifferent alternative values in merged records.,Information integration on the web (IIWeb); papers from the 2007 AAAI Workshop,2007,3,12

Enabling Secure Data Exchange.,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,The emergence of diverse networked data sources has created new opportunities for thesharing and exchange of data. In support of this; a fruitful line of research has resulted indistributed data processing and integration systems [19; 17; 29; 30; 3]. However in practice;fear of unauthorized disclosure or malicious tampering requires that data stay safely behindfirewalls or remain protected by secure servers. Our goal is to overcome these limitationsand enable secure data exchange and sharing in distributed integration scenarios. Suchscenarios are characterized by many interacting data sources and many data consumers.Primary sources create and publish data; intermediate sources combine; extract; and modifythe data for further dissemination; data consumers query it.

A consumer-centric market for database computation in the cloud,Yue Wang; Alexandra Meliou; Gerome Miklau,Abstract: The availability of public computing resources in the cloud has revolutionized dataanalysis; but requesting cloud resources often involves complex decisions for consumers.Under the current pricing mechanisms; cloud service providers offer several service optionsand charge consumers based on the resources they use. Before they can decide whichcloud resources to request; consumers have to estimate the completion time and cost of theircomputational tasks for different service options and possibly for different service providers.This estimation is challenging even for expert cloud users. We propose a new market-basedframework for pricing computational tasks in the cloud. Our framework introduces an agentbetween consumers and cloud providers. The agent takes data and computational tasksfrom users; estimates time and cost for evaluating the tasks; and returns to consumers …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02104,2016,2,5

A framework for utility-driven network trace anonymization,Abhinav Parate; Gerome Miklau,Abstract The publication of network traces is critical for network research but their release ishighly constrained by privacy and security concerns. The importance of a framework foranonymizing traces to provide different levels of security and utility to promote tracepublication has been identified in the literature. However; the current state-of-artanonymization techniques have failed to provide the guarantees on privacy and security. Inthis paper; we propose a framework in which a trace owner can match an anonymizingtransformation with the requirements of analysts. The trace owner can release multipletransformed traces; each customized to an analysts needs; or a single transformationsatisfying all requirements.

Lower Bounds on the Error of Query Sets Under the Differentially-Private Matrix Mechanism,Chao Li; Gerome Miklau,Abstract A common goal of privacy research is to release synthetic data that satisfies aformal privacy guarantee and can be used by an analyst in place of the original data. Toachieve reasonable accuracy; a synthetic data set must be tuned to support a specified setof queries accurately; sacrificing fidelity for other queries. This work considers methods forproducing synthetic data under differential privacy and investigates what makes a set ofqueries “easy” or “hard” to answer. We consider this issue in the particular case ofanswering sets of linear counting queries using the matrix mechanism (Li et al. 2010); arecent differentially-private mechanism that can reduce error by adding complex correlatednoise adapted to a specified workload. Our main result is a novel lower bound on theminimum total error required to simultaneously release answers to a set of workload …,Theory of Computing Systems,2015,1,21

Efficient recovery from false state in distributed routing algorithms,Daniel Gyllstrom; Sudarshan Vasudevan; Jim Kurose; Gerome Miklau,Abstract Malicious and misconfigured nodes can inject incorrect state into a distributedsystem; which can then be propagated system-wide as a result of normal network operation.Such false state can degrade the performance of a distributed system or render it unusable.For example; in the case of network routing algorithms; false state corresponding to a nodeincorrectly declaring a cost of 0 to all destinations (maliciously or due to misconfiguration)can quickly spread through the network. This causes other nodes to (incorrectly) route viathe misconfigured node; resulting in suboptimal routing and network congestion. Wepropose three algorithms for efficient recovery in such scenarios and prove the correctnessof each of these algorithms. Through simulation; we evaluate our algorithms–in terms ofmessage and time overhead–when applied to removing false state in distance vector …,International Conference on Research in Networking,2010,1,21

Log sanitization: Auditing a database under retention restrictions,Wentian Lu; Gerome Miklau,Abstract Auditing the changes to a database is critical for identifying malicious behavior;maintaining data quality; and improving system performance. But an accurate audit log is ahistorical record of the past that can also pose a serious threat to privacy. Policies which limitdata retention conflict with the goal of accurate auditing; and data owners have to carefullybalance the need for policy compliance with the goal of accurate auditing. In this paper; weprovide a framework for auditing the changes to a database system while respecting dataretention policies. Our framework includes a historical data model that supports flexible auditqueries; along with a language for retention policies that hide individual attribute values orremove entire tuples from history. Under retention policies; the audit history is partiallyincomplete. We formalize the meaning of audit queries on the protected history; which …,*,2008,1,16
Optimizing histogram queries under differential privacy,Chao Li; Michael Hay; Vibhor Rastogi; Gerome Miklau; Andrew McGregor,ABSTRACT Differential privacy is a robust privacy standard that has been successfullyapplied to a range of data analysis tasks. Despite much recent work; optimal strategies foranswering a collection of correlated queries are not known. We study the problem ofdevising a set of strategy queries; to be submitted and answered privately; that will supportthe answers to a given workload of queries. We propose a general framework in whichquery strategies are formed from linear combinations of counting queries; and we describean optimal method for deriving new query answers from the answers to the strategy queries.Using this framework we characterize the error of strategies geometrically; and we proposesolutions to the problem of finding optimal strategies.,*,*,1,5

Differentially Private Rank Aggregation,Michael Hay; Liudmila Elagina; Gerome Miklau,Abstract Given a collection of rankings of a set of items; rank aggregation seeks to computea ranking that can serve as a single best representative of the collection. Rank aggregationis a well-studied problem and a number of effective algorithmic solutions have beenproposed in the literature. However; when individuals are asked to contribute a ranking; theymay be concerned that their personal preferences will be disclosed inappropriately toothers. This acts as a disincentive to individuals to respond honestly in expressing theirpreferences and impedes data collection and data sharing. We address this problem byinvestigating rank aggregation under differential privacy; which requires that a releasedoutput (here; the aggregate ranking computed from individuals' rankings) remain almost thesame if any one individual's ranking is removed from the input.

DIAS: Differentially Private Interactive Algorithm Selection using Pythia,Ios Kotsogiannis; Michael Hay; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Gerome Miklau; Margaret Orr,Abstract Differential privacy has emerged as the dominant privacy standard for dataanalysis. Its wide acceptance has led to significant development of algorithms that meet thisrigorous standard. For some tasks; such as the task of answering low dimensional countingqueries; dozens of algorithms have been proposed. However; no single algorithm hasemerged as the dominant performer; and in fact; algorithm performance varies drasticallyacross inputs. Thus; it's not clear how to select an algorithm for a particular task; andchoosing the wrong algorithm might lead to significant degradation in terms of analysisaccuracy. We believe that the difficulty of algorithm selection is one factor limiting theadoption of differential privacy in real systems.

Principled Evaluation of Differentially Private Algorithms,Michael Hay; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Gerome Miklau; Yan Chen; Dan Zhang,Abstract The emergence of differential privacy as a primary standard for privacy protectionhas led to the development of hundreds of algorithms for various data analysis tasks. Thesealgorithms are becoming increasingly complex; and in particular; the performance of manyemerging algorithms is data dependent; meaning the distribution of the noise added toquery answers may change depending on the input data. Theoretical analysis typically onlyconsiders the worst case; making empirical study of average case performance increasinglyimportant. We propose a set of evaluation principles which we argue are essential for soundevaluation. Based on these principles we propose DPBENCH; a novel evaluation frameworkfor standardized evaluation of privacy algorithms. We then apply our benchmark to evaluatealgorithms for answering 1-and 2-dimensional range queries. The result is a thorough …,*,*,*,15
Challenges of Visualizing Differentially Private Data,Dan Zhang; Michael Hay; Gerome Miklau; Brendan O’Connor,ABSTRACT Differential privacy has become a primary standard for protecting individual datawhile supporting flexible data analysis. Despite the adaptation of differential privacy to awide variety of applications and tasks; visualizing the output of differentially privatealgorithms has rarely been considered. Visualization is one of the primary means by whichhumans understand and explore an unknown dataset and therefore supporting visualizationis an important goal to advance the practical adoption of differential privacy. In this initialwork on private data visualization we explore key challenges and propose solutionapproaches. We use two-dimensional location data as an example domain; and considerthe challenges of plotting noisy output; the impact of visual artifacts caused by noise; and theproper way to present known uncertainty about private output.,*,*,*,10
Abstract/Details,Alice M Epps; Ann Arbor,The problem of homelessness in the US is increasing in magnitude; diversity and visibility;with the subpopulation of homeless children with families growing the fastest. In the study; aquestionnaire/interview guide was designed to collect self-report information which includedpictures drawn by a random sample of sixty elementary school-age children (6-11 yearolds); living from one to thirty-six months with homeless single-parent families in one of threetemporary shelters located in central Westchester County; New York. The data collected in1991-1992 were used to create three perception of" home" scales;(Ideal; Positive andNegative); and looked at demographic characteristics of the children that influenced theirperception of" home". Analyses of the data and findings from this non-experimental studyprovided a significant contribution of the child's health on the child's perception of home …,*,*,*,12
