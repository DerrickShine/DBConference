Object exchange across heterogeneous information sources,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Hector Garcia-Molina; Jennifer Widom,We address the problem of providing integrated access to diverse and dynamic informationsources. We explain how this problem differs from the traditional database integrationproblem and we focus on one aspect of the information integration problem; namelyinformation exchange. We define an object-based information exchange model and acorresponding query language that we believe are well suited for integration of diverseinformation sources. We describe how; the model and language have been used tointegrate heterogeneous bibliographic information sources. We also describe two general-purpose libraries we have implemented for object exchange between clients and servers.,Data Engineering; 1995.

Discover: Keyword search in relational databases,Vagelis Hristidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou,DISCOVER operates on relational databases and facilitates information discovery on themby allowing its user to issue keyword queries without any knowledge of the databaseschema or of SQL. DISCOVER returns qualified joining networks of tuples; that is; sets oftuples that are associated because they join on their primary and foreign keys andcollectively contain all the keywords of the query. DISCOVER proceeds in two steps. First;the Candidate Network Generator generates all candidate networks of relations; that is; joinexpressions that generate the joining networks of tuples. Second; the Plan Generator buildsplans for the efficient evaluation of the set of candidate networks; exploiting the opportunitiesto reuse common sub expressions of the candidate networks.

Efficient keyword search for smallest LCAs in XML databases,Yu Xu; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Keyword search is a proven; user-friendly way to query HTML documents in theWorld Wide Web. We propose keyword search in XML documents; modeled as labeledtrees; and describe corresponding efficient algorithms. The proposed keyword searchreturns the set of smallest trees containing all keywords; where a tree is designated as"smallest" if it contains no tree that also contains all keywords. Our core contribution; theIndexed Lookup Eager algorithm; exploits key properties of smallest trees in order tooutperform prior algorithms by orders of magnitude when the query contains keywords withsignificantly different frequencies. The Scan Eager variant is tuned for the case where thekeywords have similar frequencies. We analytically and experimentally evaluate twovariants of the Eager algorithm; along with the Stack algorithm [13]. We also present the …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,683,8
-Efficient IR-Style Keyword Search over Relational Databases,Vagelis Hristidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Luis Gravano,This chapter presents a system for efficient information retrieval (IR)-style keyword searchover relational databases. A query in the model is simply a list of keywords and does notneed to specify any relation or attribute names. The answer to such a query consists of arank of “tuple trees;” which potentially include tuples from multiple relations that arecombined via joins. To rank tuple trees; this chapter introduces a ranking function thatleverages and extends the ability of modern relational database systems to provide keywordsearch on individual text attributes and rank tuples accordingly. In particular; the rankingfunction appropriately combines the relational database management systems (RDBMS)provided scores of individual attributes and tuples. The chapter introduces several top-kquery-processing algorithms whose relative strengths depend; for example; on whether …,*,2003,670,12
Objectrank: Authority-based keyword search in databases,Andrey Balmin; Vagelis Hristidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract The ObjectRank system applies authority-based ranking to keyword search indatabases modeled as labeled graphs. Conceptually; authority originates at the nodes(objects) containing the keywords and flows to objects according to their semanticconnections. Each node is ranked according to its authority with respect to the particularkeywords. One can adjust the weight of global importance; the weight of each keyword of thequery; the importance of a result actually containing the keywords versus being referencedby nodes containing them; and the volume of authority flow via each type of semanticconnection. Novel performance challenges and opportunities are addressed. First; schemasimpose constraints on the graph; which are exploited for performance purposes.

Query caching and optimization in distributed mediator systems,Sibel Adali; K Selçuk Candan; Yannis Papakonstantinou; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract Query processing and optimization in mediator systems that access distributed non-proprietary sources pose many novel problems. Cost-based query optimization is hardbecause the mediator does not have access to source statistics information and furthermoreit may not be easy to model the source's performance. At the same time; querying remotesources may be very expensive because of high connection overhead; long computationtime; financial charges; and temporary unavailability. We propose a cost-based optimizationtechnique that caches statistics of actual calls to the sources and consequently estimates thecost of the possible execution plans based on the statistics cache. We investigate issuespertaining to the design of the statistics cache and experimentally analyze various tradeoffs.We also present a query result caching mechanism that allows us to effectively use …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1996,507,18
Big data and its technical challenges,HV Jagadish; Johannes Gehrke; Alexandros Labrinidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Jignesh M Patel; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Cyrus Shahabi,The growth rate of the output of current NGS methods in terms of the raw sequence data producedby a single NGS machine is shown in Figure 1; along with the performance increase for the SPECintCPU benchmark.

Note the sequencedata size in Figure 1 is the output of analyzing the raw images that are actually produced by theNGS instruments. The size of these raw image datasets themselves is so large (many TBs perlab per day) that it is impractical today to even consider storing them.

XML-based information mediation with MIX,Chaitan Baru; Amarnath Gupta; Bertram Ludäscher; Richard Marciano; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Pavel Velikhov; Vincent Chu,Abstract The MIX mediator system; MIX m; is developed as part of the MIX Project at the SanDiego Supercomputer Center; and the University of California; San Diego. 1 MIX m usesXML as the common model for data exchange. Mediator views are expressed in XMAS (XMLMatching And Structuring Language); a declarative XML query language. To facilitate user-friendly query formulation and for optimization purposes; MIX m employs XML DTDs as astructural description (in effect; a “schema”) of the exchanged data. The novel features of thesystem include: Data exchange and integration solely relies on XML; ie; instance andschema information is represented by XML documents and XML DTDs; respectively. XMLqueries are denoted in XMAS; which builds upon ideas of languages like XML-QL; MSL; Yat;and UnQL. Additionally; XMAS features powerful grouping and order constructs for …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,390,18
Keyword proximity search on XML graphs,Vagelis Hristidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Andrey Balmin,XKeyword provides efficient keyword proximity queries on large XML graph databases. Aquery is simply a list of keywords and does not require any schema or query languageknowledge for its formulation. XKeyword is built on a relational database and; hence; canaccommodate very large graphs. Query evaluation is optimized by using the graph'sschema. In particular; XKeyword consists of two stages. In the preprocessing stage a set ofkeyword indices are built along with indexed path relations that describe particular patternsof paths in the graph. In the query processing stage plans are developed that use a nearoptimal set of path relations to efficiently locate the keyword query results.

Object fusion in mediator systems,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Serge Abiteboul; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract One of the main tasks of mediators is to fuse information from heterogeneousinformation sources. This may involve; for example; removing redundancies; and resolvinginconsistencies in favor of the most reliable source. The problem becomes harder when thesources are unstructured semistructured and we do not have complete knowledge of theircontents and structure. In this paper we show how many common fusion operations can bespecified non-procedurally and succinctly. The key to our approach is to assign semanticallymeaningful object ids to objects as they are imported" into the mediator. These semantic idscan then be used to specify how various objects are combined or merged into objectsexported" by the mediator. In this paper we also discuss the implementation of a mediationsystem based on these principles. In particular; we present key optimization techniques …,VLDB,1996,348,12
PREFER: A system for the efficient execution of multi-parametric ranked queries,Vagelis Hristidis; Nick Koudas; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Users often need to optimize the selection of objects by appropriately weighting theimportance of multiple object attributes. Such optimization problems appear often inoperations' research and applied mathematics as well as everyday life; eg; a buyer mayselect a home as a weighted function of a number of attributes like its distance from office; itsprice; its area; etc. We capture such queries in our definition of preference queries that use aweight function over a relation's attributes to derive a score for each tuple. Database systemscannot efficiently produce the top results of a preference query because they need toevaluate the weight function over all tuples of the relation. PREFER answers preferencequeries efficiently by using materialized views that have been pre-processed and stored.,ACM Sigmod Record,2001,345,18
DTD inference for views of XML data,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Victor Vianu,Abstract We study the inference of Data Type Definitions (DTDs) for views of XML data;using an abstraction that focuses on document content structure. The views are defined by aquery language that produces a list of documents selected from one or more input sources.The selection conditions involve vertical and horizontal navigation; thus querying explicitlythe order present in input documents. We point several strong limitations in the descriptiveability of current DTDs and the need for extending them with (i) a subtyping mechanism and(ii) a more powerful specification mechanism than regular languages; such as context-freelanguages. With these extensions; we show that one can always infer tight DTDs; thatprecisely characterize a selection view on sources satisfying given DTDs.

Keyword proximity search in XML trees,Vagelis Hristidis; Nick Koudas; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Divesh Srivastava,Recent works have shown the benefits of keyword proximity search in querying XMLdocuments in addition to text documents. For example; given query keywords overShakespeare's plays in XML; the user might be interested in knowing how the keywordscooccur. In this paper; we focus on XML trees and define XML keyword; proximity queries toreturn the (possibly heterogeneous) set of minimum connecting trees (MCTs) of the matchesto the individual keywords in the query. We consider efficiently executing keyword proximityqueries on labeled trees (XML) in various settings: 1) when the XML database has beenpreprocessed and 2) when no indices are available on the XML database. We perform adetailed experimental evaluation to study the benefits of our approach and show that ouralgorithms considerably outperform prior algorithms and other applicable approaches.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,241,12

The systemcompiles a given XQuery into an XSM; which is an XML stream transducer; that is; anabstract device that takes as input one or more XML data streams and produces one or moreoutput streams; potentially using internal buffers. It presents a systematic way to translateXQueries into efficient XSMs. First; the XQuery is translated into a network of XSMs thatcorrespond to the basic operators of the XQuery language and exchange streams. Thenetwork is reduced to a single XSM by repeated application of an XSM compositionoperation that is optimized to reduce the number of tests and actions that the XSM performsas well as the number of intermediate buffers that it uses.

Query rewriting for semistructured data,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract We address the problem of query rewriting for TSL; a language for queryingsemistructured data. We develop and present an algorithm that; given a semistructuredquery q and a set of semistructured views V; finds rewriting queries; ie; queries that accessthe views and produce the same result as q. Our algorithm is based on appropriatelygeneralizing containment mappings; the chase; and query composition—techniques thatwere developed for structured; relational data. We also develop an algorithm forequivalence checking of TSL queries. We show that the algorithm is sound and complete forTSL; ie; it always finds every non-trivial TSL rewriting query of q; and we discuss itscomplexity. We extend the rewriting algorithm to use some forms of structural constraints(such as DTDs) and find more opportunities for query rewriting.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,196,12
Capabilities-based query rewriting in mediator systems,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Ashish Gupta; Laura Haas,Abstract Users today are struggling to integrate a broad range of information sourcesproviding different levels of query capabilities. Currently; data sources with different andlimited capabilities are accessed either by writing rich functional wrappers for the moreprimitive sources; or by dealing with all sources at a “lowest common denominator”. Thispaper explores a third approach; in which a mediator ensures that sources receive queriesthey can handle; while still taking advantage of all of the query power of the source. Wepropose an architecture that enables this; and identify a key component of that architecture;the Capabilities-Based Rewriter (CBR). The CBR takes as input a description of thecapabilities of a data source; and a query targeted for that data source. From these; the CBRdetermines component queries to be sent to the sources; commensurate with their …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1998,177,8

Efficient LCA based keyword search in XML data,Yu Xu; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Keyword search in XML documents based on the notion of lowest commonancestors (LCAs) and modifications of it has recently gained research interest [10; 14; 22]. Inthis paper we propose an efficient algorithm called Indexed Stack to find answers to keywordqueries based on XRank's semantics to LCA [10]. The complexity of the Indexed Stackalgorithm is O (kd| S 1| log| S|) where k is the number of keywords in the query; d is the depthof the tree and| S 1|(| S|) is the occurrence of the least (most) frequent keyword in the query.In comparison; the best worst case complexity of the core algorithms in [10] is O (kd| S|). Weanalytically and experimentally evaluate the Indexed Stack algorithm and the two corealgorithms in [10]. The results show that the Indexed Stack algorithm outperforms in terms ofboth CPU and I/O costs other algorithms by orders of magnitude when the query contains …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,167,21
Describing and using query capabilities of heterogeneous sources,Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Information integration systems have to cope with the different and limited query interfaces ofthe underlying information sources. First; the integration systems need descriptions of thequery capabilities of each source; ie; the set of queries supported by each source. Second;the integration systems need algorithms for deciding how a query can be answered giventhe capabilities of the sources. Third; they need to translate a query into the format that thesource understands. We present two languages suitable for descriptions of querycapabilities of sources and compare their expressive power. We also describe algorithms fordeciding whether a query" matches" the description and show their application to theproblem of translating user queries into source-specific queries and commands.

Supporting top-k keyword search in xml databases,Liang Jeff Chen; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Keyword search is considered to be an effective information discovery method for bothstructured and semi-structured data. In XML keyword search; query semantics is based onthe concept of Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). However; naive LCA-based semanticsleads to exponential computation and result size. In the literature; LCA-based semanticvariants (eg; ELCA and SLCA) were proposed; which define a subset of all the LCAs as theresults. While most existing work focuses on algorithmic efficiency; top-K processing for XMLkeyword search is an important issue that has received very little attention. Existingalgorithms focusing on efficiency are designed to optimize the semantic pruning and areincapable of supporting top-K processing.

BBQ displays thestructure of multiple data sources using a paradigm that resembles drilling-down inWindows' directory structures. BBQ allows queries incorporating one or more of the sources.Queries are constructed in a query-by-example (QBE) manner; where DTDs play the role ofschema. The queries are arbitrary conjunctive queries with GROUPBY; and their results canbe subsequently used and refined. To support query refinement; BBQ introduces virtualresult views: standalone virtual data sources that (i) are constructed by user queries; fromelements in other data sources; and (ii) can be used in subsequent queries as first-classdata sources themselves.

We study the problem of rewriting a query using materializedviews; where both the query and the views are described by a tree pattern language;appropriately extended to capture a large XQuery subset. The pattern language featuresoptional nodes and nesting; allowing to capture the data needs of nested XQueries. Thelanguage also allows describing storage features such as structural identifiers; whichenlarge the space of rewritings. We study pattern containment and equivalent rewritingunder the constraints expressed in a structural summary; whose enhanced form also entailsintegrity constraints.

The NEXT framework for logical XQuery optimization,Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Yu Xu,Abstract Classical logical optimization techniques rely on a logical semantics of the querylanguage. The adaptation of these techniques to XQuery is precluded by its definition as afunctional language with operational semantics. We introduce Nested XML Tableaux whichenable a logical foundation for XQuery semantics and provide the logical plan optimizationframework of our XQuery processor. As a proof of concept; we develop and evaluate aminimization algorithm for removing redundant navigation within and across nestedsubqueries.

Three ranking factors are used: the relevance to the query; thespecificity and the importance of the result. All factors are handled using authority-flowtechniques that exploit the link-structure of the data graph; in contrast to traditionalInformation Retrieval. We address the performance challenges in computing the authorityflows in databases by using precomputation and exploiting the database schema if present.We conducted user surveys and performance experiments on multiple real and syntheticdatasets; to assess the semantic meaningfulness and performance of our system.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2008,81,12
Enhancing semistructured data mediators with document type definitions,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Pavel Velikhov,Mediation is an important application of XML. The MIX mediator uses Document TypeDefinitions (DTDs) to assist the user in query formulation and query processors in runningqueries more efficiently. We provide an algorithm for inferring the view DTD from the viewdefinition and the source DTDs. We develop a metric of the quality of the inferencealgorithm's view DTD by formalizing the notions of soundness and tightness. Intuitively;tightness is similar to precision; ie; it deteriorates when" many" objects described by the viewDTD can never appear as content of the view. In addition we show that DTDs have someinherent deficiencies that prevent the development of tight DTDs. We propose" DTDs withspecialization" as a way to resolve this problem.,Data Engineering; 1999.

QURSED: querying and reporting semistructured data,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Michalis Petropoulos; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract QURSED enables the development of web-based query forms and reports (QFRs)that query and report semistructured XML data; ie; data that are characterized by nesting;irregularities and structural variance. The query aspects of a QFR are captured by its queryset specification; which formally encodes multiple parameterized condition fragments andcan describe large numbers of queries.

Navigation-driven evaluation of virtual mediated views,Bertram Ludäscher; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Pavel Velikhov,Abstract The MIX mediator systems incorporates a novel framework for navigation-drivenevaluation of virtual mediated views. Its architecture allows the on-demand computation ofviews and query results as the user navigates them. The evaluation scheme minimizessuperfluous source access through the use of lazy mediators that translate incoming clientnavigations on virtual XML views into navigations on lower level mediators or wrappedsources. The proposed demand-driven approach is inevitable for handling up-to-datemediated views of large Web sources or query results. The non-materialization of the queryanswer is transparent to the client application since clients can navigate the query answerusing a subset of the standard DOM API for XML documents. We elaborate on queryevaluation in such a framework and show how algebraic plans can be implemented as …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,76,12
Rewriting nested XML queries using nested views,Nicola Onose; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Emiran Curtmola,Abstract We present and analyze an algorithm for equivalent rewriting of XQuery queriesusing XQuery views; which is complete for a large class of XQueries featuring nested FLWRblocks; XML construction and join equalities by value and identity. These features posesignificant challenges which lead to fundamental extension of prior work on the problems ofrewriting conjunctive and tree pattern queries. Our solution exploits the Nested XMLTableaux (NEXT) notation which enables a logical foundation for specifying XQuerysemantics. We present a tool which inputs XQuery queries and views and outputs anXQuery rewriting; thus being usable on top of any of the existing XQuery processingengines. Our experimental evaluation shows that the tool scales well for large numbers ofviews and complex queries.,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,75,5
Branch-and-bound processing of ranked queries,Yufei Tao; Vagelis Hristidis; Dimitris Papadias; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Despite the importance of ranked queries in numerous applications involving multi-criteria decision making; they are not efficiently supported by traditional database systems.In this paper; we propose a simple yet powerful technique for processing such queriesbased on multi-dimensional access methods and branch-and-bound search. Theadvantages of the proposed methodology are:(i) it is space efficient; requiring only a singleindex on the given relation (storing each tuple at most once);(ii) it achieves significant (ie;orders of magnitude) performance gains with respect to the current state-of-the-art;(iii) it canefficiently handle data updates; and (iv) it is applicable to other important variations ofranked search (including the support for non-monotone preference functions); at no extraspace overhead.

View definition and dtd inference for xml,Bertram Ludäscher; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Pavel Velikhov; Victor Vianu,Abstract We present a query language and mediator architecture for XML data [XML98b].The query language; called Xmas (XML Matching And Structuring Language) uses verticaland horizontal navigation. The horizontal navigation provides a powerful novel mechanismfor using the order in the semistructured model underlying XML. This couples nicely with thewell-known regular path expressions for vertical navigation [Suc; Abi97; Bun97; AQM+ 97;FFLS98; AM98; CDSS98; XML98a; KS95]. Xmas also provides versatile mechanisms forconstructing XML documents as answers to queries; including powerful group-by and order-by constructs. We briefly describe a prototype for an XML-based information mediationsystem; built around Xmas.,In Post-ICDT Workshop on Query Processing for Semistructured Data and Non-Standard Data Formats,1999,71,12
Expressive capabilities description languages and query rewriting algorithms,Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Information integration systems have to cope with a wide variety of differentinformation sources; which support query interfaces with very varied capabilities. To dealwith this problem; the integration systems need descriptions of the query capabilities of eachsource; ie; the set of queries supported by each source. Moreover; the integration systemsneed algorithms for deciding how a query can be answered given the capabilities of thesources. Finally; they need to translate a query into the format that the source understands.We present two languages suitable for descriptions of query capabilities of sources andcompare their expressive power. We also use one of the languages to automatically derivethe capabilities description of the integration system itself; in terms of the capabilities of thesources it integrates. We describe algorithms for deciding whether a query “matches” the …,The Journal of Logic Programming,2000,69,21
Privacy in database publishing,Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract We formulate and study a privacy guarantee to data owners; who share informationwith clients by publishing views of a proprietary database.

Storing and querying XML data using denormalized relational databases,Andrey Balmin; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract. XML database systems emerge as a result of the acceptance of the XML datamodel. Recent works have followed the promising approach of building XML databasemanagement systems on underlying RDBMS's. Achieving query processing performancereduces to two questions:(i) How should the XML data be decomposed into data that arestored in the RDBMS?(ii) How should the XML query be translated into an efficient plan thatsends one or more SQL queries to the underlying RDBMS and combines the data into theXML result? We provide a formal framework for XML Schema-driven decompositions; whichencompasses the decompositions proposed in prior work and extends them withdecompositions that employ denormalized tables and binary-coded XML fragments.

Mediating and Metasearching on the Internet,Luis Gravano; Yannis Papakonstantinou,The Internet emerges as the largest database. Increasingly; users want to issue complexqueries across Internet sources to obtain the data they require. However; finding relevantinformation sources and querying them manually is problematic: there are numeroussources; and they vary in the type of information objects they contain and in the interfacethey present to their users. Some sources contain text documents and support simple querymodels where a query is just a list of keywords. Other sources contain more structured dataand provide query interfaces in the style of relational query languages. Furthermore; usershave to manually fuse the query results by merging information; removing redundancies;ranking the answer objects in the appropriate order; and so on. Since it is tedious to contactseveral heterogeneous sources; users can benefit from metasearchers and mediators …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,1998,50,12

-A System for Keyword Proximity Search on XML Databases,Andrey Balmin; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vagelis Hristidis; Tianqiu Wang; Divesh Srivastava; Nick Koudas,This chapter discusses keyword proximity search on XML database. Keyword proximitysearch is a user-friendly information discovery technique that has been extensively studiedfor text documents. In extending this technique to structured databases; recent works providekeyword proximity search on labeled graphs. A keyword proximity search does not requirethe user to know the structure of the graph; the role of the objects containing the keywords;or the type of the connections between the objects. The user simply submits a list ofkeywords and the system returns the sub-graphs that connect the objects containing thekeywords. XML and its labeled graph/tree abstractions are becoming the data model ofchoice for representing semistructured; self-describing data; and keyword proximity searchis well-suited to XML documents as well.A System for Keyword Proximity Search on XML …,*,2003,45,12

The platform enables the development ofeBusiness applications in customer relationship management; e-commerce; supply chainmanagement; and decision support. These applications often require that data be integrateddynamically from multiple information sources. The Enosys platform allows one to build(virtual and/or materialized) integrated XML views of multiple sources; using XML queries asview definitions. During run-time; the application issues XML queries against the views.Queries and views are translated into the XCQL algebra and are combined into a singlealgebra expression/plan.

XML query forms (XQForms): Declarative specification of XML query interfaces,Michalis Petropoulos; Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,ABSTRACT XQForms is the first generator of Web-based query forms and reports for XMLdata. XQForms takes as input (i) XML Schemas that model the data to be queried andpresented;(ii) declarative specifications; called annotations; of the logic of the query formsand reports that will be generated; and (iii) a set of template presentation libraries. Theoutput is a set of query forms and reports that provide automated query construction andreport formatting in order for the end users to query and browse the underlying XML data.Thus XQForms separates content (given by the XML Schema of the data); query form logic(specified by the annotations) and presentation of the forms and reports. The systemarchitecture is modular and consists of four main components:(a) a collection of query formcontrols that incorporate query capabilities and allow parameter passing from the end …,Proceedings of the 10th international conference on World Wide Web,2001,33,1
A framework for navigation-driven lazy mediators,Bertram Ludäscher; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Pavel Velikhov,Abstract We propose a framework for navigation-driven evaluation of virtual mediated views.The approach is based on lazy mediators that translate incoming client navigations on avirtual XML view (or the result of an XML query) into navigations on wrapped sources orlower level mediators. Such a demand-driven approach is inevitable in order to handle up-to-date mediated views of huge Web sources or large query results; which are commonplacewhen querying the Web. The proposed MIX mediator provides to the client an abstraction ofthe DOM API; the de facto API to XML documents; hence hiding the non-materialization ofthe view or the query. We also describe the inherent navigational complexity of queries andview definitions wrt. navigations. Next; we discuss the query/navigation processing aspectsof the MIX mediator. The mediator translates a view into an algebraic plan. Then each …,In ACM Workshop on the Web and Databases,1999,32,19
Fusion queries over internet databases,Ramana Yerneni; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Serge Abiteboul; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract Fusion queries search for information integrated from distributed; autonomoussources over the Internet. We investigate techniques for efficient processing of fusionqueries. First; we focus on a very wide class of query plans that capture the spirit of manytechniques usually considered in existing systems. We show how to efficiently find goodquery plans within this large class. We provide additional heuristics that; by consideringplans outside our target class of plans; yield further performance improvements.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1998,31,12
Algebra-based identification of tree patterns in XQuery,Andrei Arion; Véronique Benzaken; Ioana Manolescu; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Ravi Vijay,Abstract Query processing performance in XML databases can be greatly enhanced by theusage of materialized views whose content has been stored in the database. This requires amethod for identifying query subexpressions matching the views; a process known as view-based query rewriting. This process is quite complex for relational databases; and all themore daunting on XML databases. Current XML materialized view proposals are based ontree patterns; since query navigation is conceptually close to such patterns. However; theexisting algorithms for extracting tree patterns from XQuery do not detect patterns acrossnested query blocks. Thus; complex; useful tree pattern views may be missed by therewriting algorithm. We present a novel tree pattern extraction algorithm from XQueryqueries; able to identify larger patterns than previous methods. Our algorithm has been …,International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems,2006,30,21

Using knowledge of redundancy for query optimization in mediators,Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Many autonomous and heterogeneous information sources are becoming increasinglyavailable to users through the Internet; especially through the World Wide Web. In order tomake the information available in a consolidated; uniform; and efficient manner; it isnecessary to integrate the different information sources. The integration of Internet sourcesposes several challenges that have not been sufficiently addressed by work on theintegration of corporate databases residing on an Intranet [LMR90]. We believe that the mostimportant ones are heterogeneity; large number of sources; redundancy; availability; sourceautonomy; and diverse access methods and querying interfaces.,Proc. of the AAAI Symposium on AI and Data Integration,1998,28,10

Exporting and interactively querying web service-accessed sources: The CLIDE system,Michalis Petropoulos; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Yannis Katsis,Abstract The CLIDE System assists the owners of sources that participate in Web service-based data publishing systems to publish a restricted set of parameterized queries over theschema of their sources and package them as WSDL services. The sources may berelational databases; which naturally have a schema; or ad hoc information/applicationsystems whereas the owner publishes a virtual schema. CLIDE allows information clients topose queries over the published schema and utilizes prior work on answering queries usingviews to answer queries that can be processed by combining and processing the results ofone or more Web service calls. These queries are called feasible. Contrary to prior work;where infeasible queries are rejected without an explanatory feedback; leading the user intoa frustrating trial-and-error cycle; CLIDE features a query formulation interface; which …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,22,0
Mixing querying and navigation in MIX,Pratik Mukhopadhyay; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Web-based information systems provide to their users the ability to interleave querying andbrowsing during their information discovery efforts. The MIX system provides an API calledQDOM (Querible Document Object Model) that supports the interleaved querying andbrowsing of virtual XML views; specified in an XQuery-like language. QDOM is based on theDOM standard. It allows the client applications to navigate into the view using standard DOMnavigation commands. Then the application can use any visited node as the root for a querythat creates a new view. The query/navigation processing algorithms of MIX performdecontextualization; ie; they translate a query that has been issued from within the context ofother queries and navigations into efficient queries that are understood by the sourceoutside of the context of previous operations. In addition; MIX provides a navigation …,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,22,12

Ajax-based report pages as incrementally rendered views,Yupeng Fu; Keith Kowalczykowski; Kian Win Ong; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Kevin Keliang Zhao,Abstract While Ajax-based programming enables faster performance and higher interfacequality over pure server-side programming; it is demanding and error prone as each actionthat partially updates the page requires custom; ad-hoc code. The problem is exacerbatedby distributed programming between the browser and server; where the developer usesJavaScript to access the page state and Java/SQL for the database. The FORWARDframework simplifies the development of Ajax pages by treating them as rendered views;where the developer declares a view using an extension of SQL and page units; which mapto the view and render the data in the browser. Such a declarative approach leads tosignificantly less code; as the framework automatically solves performance optimizationproblems that the developer would otherwise hand-code.

The SQL-based all-declarative FORWARD web application development framework.,Yupeng Fu; Kian Win Ong; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Michalis Petropoulos,The vast majority of database-driven web applications perform; at a logical level;fundamentally simple INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE commands.

The state is primarily persistent and often captured in a single database.Additional state; which is transient; is maintained in the session (eg; the identity of thecurrently logged-in user; her shopping cart; etc.) and the pages. The programs perform aseries of simple SQL queries and updates; and decide the next step using simple if-then-else conditions over the state. The changes made on the transient state; though technicallynot expressed in SQL; are also computationally as simple as basic SQL updates.

The SQL++ unifying semi-structured query language; and an expressiveness benchmark of SQL-on-Hadoop; NoSQL and NewSQL databases,Kian Win Ong; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Romain Vernoux,Abstract SQL-on-Hadoop; NewSQL and NoSQL databases provide semi-structured datamodels (typically JSON based) and respective query languages.

It is especially tedious to write software thatinteroperates between two of them or an SQL database and one of them. Towards solvingthese problems; first we formally specify the syntax and semantics of SQL++.

Blended browsing and querying of xml in a lazy mediator system,Kevin D Munroe; Bertram Ludäscher; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Research in semistructured data and XML has focused on query languages; data extraction;and mediator systems for integrating heterogeneous sources. However; the issue of userinterfaces for browsing and querying semistructured data has largely been ignored despitethe fact that it is of primary importance as XML becomes more widely used as a dataexchange format and information model on the Web. To facilitate XML query constructionand browsing of results by the non-expert user; the DTD-based graphical user interface BBQ(Blended Browsing and Querying) has been developed as a front end to XML sources.

Context-sensitive ranking for document retrieval,Liang Jeff Chen; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract We study the problem of context-sensitive ranking for document retrieval; where acontext is defined as a sub-collection of documents; and is specified by queries provided bydomain-interested users. The motivation of context-sensitive search is that the ranking of thesame keyword query generally depends on the context. The reason is that the underlyingkeyword statistics differ significantly from one context to another. The query evaluationchallenge is the computation of keyword statistics at runtime; which involves expensiveonline aggregations. We appropriately leverage and extend materialized view research inorder to deliver algorithms and data structures that evaluate context-sensitive queriesefficiently. Specifically; a number of views are selected and materialized; eachcorresponding to one or more large contexts.

Combining Databases and Signal Processing in Plato.,Yannis Katsis; Yoav Freund; Yannis Papakonstantinou,ABSTRACT Sensors generate large amounts of spatiotemporal data that have to be storedand analyzed. However; spatiotemporal data still lack the equivalent of a DBMS that wouldallow their declarative analysis. We argue that the reason for this is that DBMSs have beenbuilt with the assumption that the stored data are the ground truth. This is not the case withsensor measurements; which are merely incomplete and inaccurate samples of the groundtruth. Based on this observation; we present Plato; an extensible DBMS for spatiotemporalsensor data that leverages signal processing algorithms to infer from the measurements theunderlying ground truth in the form of statistical models.

Declarative ajax web applications through sql++ on a unified application state,Yupeng Fu; Kian Win Ong; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract: Implementing even a conceptually simple web application requires an inordinateamount of time. FORWARD addresses three problems that reduce developer productivity:(a)Impedance mismatch across the multiple languages used at different tiers of the applicationarchitecture.(b) Distributed data access across the multiple data sources of the application(SQL database; user input of the browser page; session data in the application server;etc).(c) Asynchronous; incremental modification of the pages; as performed by Ajax actions.FORWARD belongs to a novel family of web application frameworks that attack impedancemismatch by offering a single unifying language. FORWARD's language is SQL++; aminimally extended SQL.

SSD in-storage computing for list intersection,Jianguo Wang; Dongchul Park; Yang-Suk Kee; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Steven Swanson,Abstract Recently; there has been a renewed interest of in-storage computing in the contextof solid state drives (SSDs); called" Smart SSDs." Smart SSDs allow application-specificcode to execute inside SSDs. This allows applications to take advantage of the high internalbandwidth that Smart SSDs provide. This work studies the offloading of list intersection intoSmart SSDs; because intersection is prominent in both search engines and analyticsqueries. Furthermore; intersection is interesting because the algorithms are more complexthan plain scans; they are affected by multiple parameters; as we show; and provide lessonsthat can be used in other operations also. We are interested to know whether Smart SSDscan accelerate the processing of list intersection and reduce the consumed energy.Intuitively; the answer is yes. However; the performance tradeoffs on real devices are …,Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2016,7,12
Interactive source registration in community-oriented information integration,Yannis Katsis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Modern Internet communities need to integrate and query structured information.Employing current information integration infrastructure; data integration is still a very costlyeffort; since source registration is performed by a central authority which becomes abottleneck. We propose the community-based integration paradigm which pushes thesource registration task to the independent community members. This creates newchallenges caused by each community member's lack of a global overview on how her datainteracts with the application queries of the community and the data from other sources. Howcan the source owner maximize the visibility of her data to existing applications; whileminimizing the clean-up and reformatting cost associated with publishing? Does her datacontradict (or could it contradict in the future) the data of other sources? We introduce …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,7,12

Optimization of hypothetical queries in an OLAP environment,Andrey Balmin; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Thanos Papadimitriou,Analysts and decision-makers use what-if analysis to assess the effects of hypotheticalscenarios on historical data. For example an analyst working for a financial company mayconstruct a scenario for a strategy that would involve 10% higher positions in stocks of largehigh-tech companies for the last 3 years. The hypothetical world created by this scenario willbe queried to calculate the returns and volatility of customer portfolios under this scenario.Current On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems support what-if analysis only byphysically replicating the data warehouse and modifying it according to the scenario. Thisprocess may take many hours; hence limiting the applicability of OLAP. To eliminate thisinefficiency; we built an OLAP toolkit; called Sesame; that exploits the following twoopportunities. First; typically a small part of the modified data is needed to answer the …,Data Engineering; 2000. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2000,7,10
Fast in-memory SQL analytics on typed graphs,Chunbin Lin; Benjamin Mandel; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Matthias Springer,Abstract We study a class of graph analytics SQL queries; which we call relationshipqueries. These queries involving aggregation; join; semijoin; intersection and selection are awide superset of fixed-length graph reachability queries and of tree pattern queries. Wepresent real-world OLAP scenarios; where efficient relationship queries are needed.However; row stores; column stores and graph databases are unacceptably slow in suchOLAP scenarios. We propose a GQ-Fast database; which is an indexed database thatroughly corresponds to efficient encoding of annotated adjacency lists that combines salientfeatures of column-based organization; indexing and compression. GQ-Fast uses a bottom-up fully pipelined query execution model; which enables (a) aggressive compression (eg;compressed bitmaps and Huffman) and (b) avoids intermediate results that consist of row …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,6,12
HippogriffDB: balancing I/O and GPU bandwidth in big data analytics,Jing Li; Hung-Wei Tseng; Chunbin Lin; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Steven Swanson,Abstract As data sets grow and conventional processor performance scaling slows; dataanalytics move towards heterogeneous architectures that incorporate hardware accelerators(notably GPUs) to continue scaling performance. However; existing GPU-based databasesfail to deal with big data applications efficiently: their execution model suffers from scalabilitylimitations on GPUs whose memory capacity is limited; existing systems fail to consider thediscrepancy between fast GPUs and slow storage; which can counteract the benefit of GPUaccelerators. In this paper; we propose HippogriffDB; an efficient; scalable GPU-acceleratedOLAP system. It tackles the bandwidth discrepancy using compression and an optimizeddata transfer path. HippogriffDB stores tables in a compressed format and uses the GPU fordecompression; trading GPU cycles for the improved I/O bandwidth.

CLIDE: interactive query formulation for service oriented architectures,Michalis Petropoulos; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Integration systems typically support a restricted set of queries over the schema they export.The reason is that the participating information sources contribute limited content and limitedaccess methods. In prior work; these limited access methods have often been specifiedusing a set of parameterized views exported as Web services; with the understanding thatthe integration system accepts only queries which have an equivalent rewriting using theviews [5; 7; 9; 10]. These queries are called feasible. Infeasible queries are rejected withoutan explanatory feedback. To help a user; who is building an integration application; avoid afrustrating trial-and-error cycle; we demonstrate the CLIDE query formulation interface;which employes a coloring scheme to guide the user toward formulating feasible queries.CLIDE is based on Microsoft's Query Builder which is incorporated in MS SQL Server [1] …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,6,12

Query rewriting using semistructured views,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract We consider the problem of rewriting semistructured queries using semistructuredviews. Given a client semistructured positive non-recursive query and a set of semistructuredviews; the algorithm finds a rewriting query that is equivalent to the client query andaccesses only the views. Our solution is based on appropriately generalizing wellunderstood techniques such as containment mappings and the chase. Furthermore; wedevelop an equivalence testing algorithm for checking the equivalence of the client queryagainst the composition of the rewriting query with the views. We prove that our algorithm issound and complete. Finally we investigate a specialized polynomial algorithm forcomposing the rewritten query with the views; based on which we can show that thesemistructured query rewriting problem is NP-complete; ie; it is no harder than the …,Proc. of the ACM SIGMOD Int.

MILC: inverted list compression in memory,Jianguo Wang; Chunbin Lin; Ruining He; Moojin Chae; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Steven Swanson,Abstract Inverted list compression is a topic that has been studied for 50 years due to itsfundamental importance in numerous applications including information retrieval;databases; and graph analytics. Typically; an inverted list compression algorithm isevaluated on its space overhead and query processing time. Earlier list compressiondesigns mainly focused on minimizing the space overhead to reduce expensive disk I/O timein disk-oriented systems. But the recent trend is shifted towards reducing query processingtime because the underlying systems tend to be memory-resident. Although there are manyhighly optimized compression approaches in main memory; there is still a considerableperformance gap between query processing over compressed lists and uncompressed lists;which motivates this work. In this work; we set out to bridge this performance gap for the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,5,5
Ssd in-storage computing for search engines,Jianguo Wang; Dongchul Park; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Steven Swanson,SSD-based in-storage computing (called” Smart SSDs”) allows application-specific codes toexecute inside SSDs to exploit the high internal bandwidth and energy-efficient processors.As a result; Smart SSDs have been successfully deployed in many industry settings; eg;Samsung; IBM; Teradata; and Oracle. Moreover; researchers have also demonstrated theirpotential opportunities in database systems; data mining; and big data processing. However;it remains unknown whether search engine systems can benefit from Smart SSDs. This worktakes a first step to answer this question. The major research issue is what search enginequery processing operations can be cost-effectively offloaded to SSDs. For this; we carefullyidentified the five most commonly used search engine operations that could potentiallybenefit from Smart SSDs: intersection; ranked intersection; ranked union; difference; and …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2016,5,10
Utilizing ids to accelerate incremental view maintenance,Yannis Katsis; Kian Win Ong; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Kevin Keliang Zhao,Abstract Prior Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) algorithms specify the view tuples thatneed to be modified by computing diff sets; which we call tuple-based diffs since a diff setcontains one diff tuple for each to-be-modified view tuple. idIVM assumes the base tableshave keys and performs IVM by computing ID-based diff sets that compactly identify the to-be-modified tuples through their IDs. This work makes the following contributions:(a) An ID-based IVM system for a large subset of SQL that includes the algebraic operators selection;join; grouping and aggregation; generalized projection involving functions; antisemijoin (andtherefore negation/difference) and union. The system is based on a modular approach;allowing one to extend the supported language simply by adding one algebraic operator at-a-time; along with equations describing how ID-based changes are propagated through …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,5,12
Inconsistency resolution in online databases,Yannis Katsis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Shared online databases allow community members to collaboratively maintain knowledge.Collaborative editing though inevitably leads to inconsistencies as different members entererroneous data or conflicting opinions. Ideally community members should be able to seeand resolve these inconsistencies in a collaborative fashion. However most current onlinedatabases do not support inconsistency resolution. Instead they try to by-pass the problemby either ignoring inconsistencies and treating data as if they were not conflicting or byrequiring inconsistencies to be resolved outside the system. To address this limitation; wepropose Ricolla; an online database system that; by treating inconsistencies as first-classcitizens; supports a natural workflow for the management of conflicting data. The systemcaptures inconsistencies (so that community members can easily inspect them) and …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,5,22

Describing and using query capabilities of heterogeneous sources (extended version),Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Information integration systems have to cope with the di erent and limited queryinterfaces of the underlying information sources. First; the integration systems needdescriptions of the query capabilities of each source; ie; the set of queries supported by eachsource. Second; the integration systems need algorithms for deciding how a query can beanswered given the capabilities of the sources. Third; they need to translate a query into theformat that the source understands. We present two languages suitable for descriptions ofquery capabilities of sources and compare their expressive power. We also describealgorithms for deciding whether a query\matches" the description and show their applicationto the problem of translating user queries into source-speci c queries and commands.Finally; we propose new improved algorithms for the problem of answering queries using …,Technical Report,1997,5,21

An experimental study of bitmap compression vs. inverted list compression,Jianguo Wang; Chunbin Lin; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Steven Swanson,Abstract Bitmap compression has been studied extensively in the database area and manyefficient compression schemes were proposed; eg; BBC; WAH; EWAH; and Roaring.Inverted list compression is also a well-studied topic in the information retrieval communityand many inverted list compression algorithms were developed as well; eg; VB; PforDelta;GroupVB; Simple8b; and SIMDPforDelta. We observe that they essentially solve the sameproblem; ie; how to store a collection of sorted integers with as few as possible bits andsupport query processing as fast as possible. Due to historical reasons; bitmap compressionand inverted list compression were developed as two separated lines of research in thedatabase area and information retrieval area. Thus; a natural question is: Which one isbetter between bitmap compression and inverted list compression?

We study a hybrid approach that combinestwo common interfaces for human tasks in Crowd Entity Resolution; taking into account keyobservations about the advantages and disadvantages of the two interfaces. We give aformal definition to the problem of human task selection and we derive algorithms withstrong optimality guarantees.

KAML: A Flexible; High-Performance Key-Value SSD,Yanqin Jin; Hung-Wei Tseng; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Steven Swanson,Modern solid state drives (SSDs) unnecessarily confine host programs to the conventionalblock I/O interface; leading to suboptimal performance and resource under-utilization.Recent attempts to replace or extend this interface with a key-value-oriented interface and/orbuilt-in support for transactions offer some improvements; but the details of theirimplementations make them a poor match for many applications. This paper presents thekey-addressable; multi-log SSD (KAML); an SSD with a key-value interface that uses a novelmulti-log architecture and stores data as variable-sized records rather than fixed-sizedsectors. Exposing a key-value interface allows applications to remove a layer of indirectionbetween application-level keys (eg; database record IDs or file inode numbers) and datastored in the SSD.

However; intervention designers havetraditionally had access only to a very limited subset of health data (typically medical recorddata). Other health data; such as environmental or physical activity data; although alreadycollected and stored; have been very difficult to access; since they are maintained bydifferent providers and isolated in their own proprietary silos. This prevents physicians andintervention designers from acquiring a true overview of all factors influencing a conditionand acting towards its prevention or cure.

We present containment and rewriting algorithms for tree pattern queriesthat correspond to a large and important subset of XQuery; in the presence of a structuralsummary of the database (ie; in the presence of a Dataguide). The tree pattern languagecaptures structural identiﬁers and optional nodes; which allow us to translate nestedXQueries into tree patterns.

DTD inference for views of XML data,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Victor Vianu,Abstract We study the inference of Data Type Definitions (DTDs) for views of XML data;using an abstraction that focuses on document content structure. The views are defined byaquery language that produces a list of documents selected from one or more input sources.The selection conditions involvevertical and horizontal navigation; thus querying explicitlythe order present in input documents. We point several strong limitations in the descriptiveability of current DTDs and the need for extending them with (i) a subtyping mechanism and(ii) a more powerful specification mechanism than regular languages; suchascontext-freelanguages. With these extensions; we show that one can always infer tight DTDs; thatprecisely characterize a selection view on sources satisfying given DTDs. We also showimportant special cases where one can infer a tight DTD without requiring extension (ii) …,*,1999,3,12

Fast in-memory SQL analytics on relationships between entities,Chunbin Lin; Benjamin Mandel; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Matthias Springer,ABSTRACT In this paper; we study relationship queries on graph databases with binaryrelationship. A relationship query is a graph reachability query bounded on primary-keysand foreign-keys with aggregation on single output attribute. Both row stores and columnstores miss key opportunities towards the efficient execution of relationship queries; makingthem unacceptably slow in real-world OLAP scenarios.

Generating Query Forms and Reports for Semistructured Data: The QURSED Editor,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Michalis Petropoulos; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract. The wide adoption of semistructured XML databases requires the existence ofsystems for the generation and execution of web-based interactive database query formsand reports. Such systems are most effective when they allow the construction of the queryforms and reports without programming; via the use of intuitive graphical tools.

Query rewriting for semistructured data (extended version),Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,We address the problem of query rewriting for TSL; a language for querying semistructureddata. We develop and present an algorithm that; given a semistructured query $ q $ and aset of semistructured views ${\cal V} $; finds rewriting queries; ie; queries that access theviews and produce the same result as $ q $. Our algorithm is based on appropriatelygeneralizing containment mappings; the chase; and query composition--techniques thatwere developed for structured; relational data. We also develop an algorithm forequivalence checking of TSL queries. We show that the algorithm is sound and complete forTSL; ie; it always finds every non-trivial TSL rewriting query of $ q $; and we discuss itscomplexity. We extend the rewriting algorithm to use some forms of structural constraints(such as DTDs) and find more opportunities for query rewriting,*,1998,2,18

Query Caching and Optimization in Mediator Systems,S Adali; S Candan; Y Papakonstantinou; V Subrahmanyan,Query processing and optimization in mediator systems that access distributed non-proprietary sources pose many novel problems. Cost-based query optimization is hardbecause the mediator does not have access to source statistics information and furthermoreit may not be easy to model the source's performance. At the same time; querying remotesources may be very expensive because of high connection overhead; high computationtime; financial charges; and temporary unavailability. We propose a cost-based optimizationtechnique that caches statistics of actual calls to the sources and consequently estimates thecost of the possible execution plans based on the statistics cache. We investigate issuespertaining to the design of the statistics cache and experimentally analyze various tradeoffs.We also present a query result caching mechanism that allows us to effectively use …,*,1995,2,5
The use and computation of specialized dtds in the MIX mediator system,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Pavel Velikhov,Abstract The MIX mediator system provides to its users integrated XML views of dataexported by XML sources or other MIX mediators.

In light of this challenge wedeveloped the view DTD inference module that automatically computes the view DTD fromthe view definition and the source DTDs. We present a metric of the quality of the inferencealgorithm s view DTD by formalizing the notions of soundness and tightness. Intuitively;tightness is similar to precision; ie; it deteriorates when? many objects described by the viewDTD can never appear as content of the view.

Data Compression for Analytics over Large-scale In-memory Column Databases,Chunbin Lin; Jianguo Wang; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract: Data compression schemes have exhibited their importance in column databasesby contributing to the high-performance OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queryprocessing. Existing works mainly concentrate on evaluating compression schemes for disk-resident databases as data is mostly stored on disks. With the continuously decreasing ofthe price/capacity ratio of main memory; it is the tendencies of the times to reside data inmain memory. But the discussion of data compression on in-memory databases is veryvague in the literature. In this work; we present an updated discussion about whether it isvaluable to use data compression techniques in memory databases.

Semistructured Models; Queries and Algebras in the Big Data Era: Tutorial Summary,Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Numerous databases promoted as SQL-on-Hadoop; NewSQL and NoSQL supportsemi-structured; schemaless and heterogeneous data; typically in the form of enrichedJSON. They also provide corresponding query languages. In addition to these genuineJSON databases; relational databases also provide special functions and language featuresfor the support of JSON columns; typically piggybacking on non-1NF (non first normal form)features that SQL acquired over the years. We refer to SQL databases with JSON support asSQL/JSON databases. The evolving query languages present multiple variations: Some aresuperficial syntactic ones; while other ones are genuine differences in modeling; languagecapabilities and semantics. Incompatibility with SQL presents a learning challenge forgenuine JSON databases; while the table orientation of SQL/JSON databases often leads …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,1,0
Optimal access to database and web application data by distributed query processing,Vicky Papavasileiou; Kevin Keliang Zhao; Yupeng Fu; Kian Win Ong; Michalis Petropoulos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Web applications require simple; integrated access to persistent data from SQL databases;data obtained from services and transient web application data stored in the page; sessionor request.

Join-Based Algorithms for Keyword Search in XML Databases,Liang Chen; Yannis Papakonstantinou,ABSTRACT We consider the problem of keyword search in XML databases under theexcluding lowest common ancestor (ELCA) semantics. Our analysis shows that ELCAsemantics may lead to conflict with keyword proximity concept; and under such semantics;lower ELCAs are preferable because lower elements tend to be more specific. However;existing algorithms (stack-based and index-based) do not provide efficient support either forthis the lower the better intuition or for general ranking functions; which is mainly due to thefact that generated results follow the document order. In this paper; we propose a join-basedalgorithm to compute complete ELCAs; which achieves complexity optimality for queries withvarious frequencies; as well as guarantees that lowest ELCAs are generated first. Moreimportantly; we shed the new light on the connection between relational join and XML …,Paragraph,2009,1,10
Trading with plans and patterns in XQuery optimization,Andrei Arion; Véronique Benzaken; Ioana Manolescu; Yannis Papakonstantinou,The query optimizer is a central component of a database management system that attemptsto determine the most efficient way to execute a query. During the optimization phase thequery optimizer builds execution plans-(functional) programs that are interpreted by theevaluation engine to produce the query result. The optimizer decides then which of thepossible query plans will be the most efficient in terms in terms of CPU requirements and thenumber of I/O operations. A simplified view of the optimization process for XML queries isdepicted in Figure 1. To process a query expressed in some query language; first; dataaccess plans are built by examining all the possible access paths (eg index scan; sequentialscan) of the existing storage modules; views and indices. Then; these plans are combinedwith the help of algebraic operators (such as selections; joins...) into increasingly larger …,*,2006,1,6

Merging results from multi-parametric ranked queries,Vagelis Hristidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Many Web sources rank objects according to multiple attributes. As the number ofsuch sources increases; so does the number of meta-brokers; which provide integratedaccess to the sources. Metabrokers answer to user queries by accessing the sources andmerging the source responses. We study the fundamental problem of how a metabroker candeliver a prefix of the user query result (ie; the top results of the user query) by accessingonly a minimum prefix of the result of each source. The challenge is that the sources supportdifferent ranking functions from each other and from the ranking that the user query requests.We present an algorithm that inputs the query ranking function and the ranking functions ofthe sources and computes the minimum prefix required by each source in order to deliver aprefix of the query result. We consider ranking functions that are either linear functions of …,*,2001,1,21
Fusion Queries over Internet Databases,Ramana Yemeni; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Serge Abiteboul; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract. Fusion queries search for information integrated from distributed; autonomoussources over the Internet. We investigate techniques for efficient processing of fusionqueries. First; we focus on a very wide class of query plans that capture the spirit of manytechniques usually considered in existing systems. We show how to efficiently find goodquery plans within this large class. We provide additional heuristics that; by consideringplans outside our target class of plans; yield further performance improvements.,Advances in Database Technology-EDBT'98: 6th International Conference on Extending Database Technology; Valencia; Spain; March 23-27; 1998.,1998,1,12
Interactive Query Formulation for Systems that Rewrite Queries Using Views,Michalis Petropoulos; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Integration systems typically support only a limited set of queries over the schemathey export. The reason is that the participating information sources contribute limitedcontent and limited access methods. In prior work; this query set has often been describedusing a set of views. We describe the CLIDE interactive system; which extends the QBE-likequery builder of Microsoft's SQL Server with a coloring scheme that guides the user towardformulating feasible queries. We formalize the behavior of the system using an interactiongraph. We present a modular architecture consisting of a front-end and a back-end thatenables the front-end's behavior by providing answers to particular questions about theinteraction graph. We developed a back-end for the case where the content and the accessmethods are described using parameterized views. In this case the set of feasible queries …,*,*,1,12
Improving SSD lifetime with byte-addressable metadata,Yanqin Jin; Hung-Wei Tseng; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Steven Swanson,Abstract Existing solid state drives (SSDs) provide flash-based out-of-band (OOB) data thatcan only be updated on a page write. Consequently; the metadata stored in their OOBregion lack flexibility due to the idiosyncrasies of flash memory; incurring unnecessary flashwrite operations detrimental to device lifetime. We propose PebbleSSD; an SSD with byte-addressable metadata; or BAM; as a mechanism exploiting the non-volatile; byte-addressable random access memory (NVRAM) inside the SSD. With BAM; PebbleSSD cansupport a range of useful features to improve its lifetime by reducing redundant flash writes.Specifically; PebbleSSD supports a write-optimized; BAM-based file block mapping toprevent excessive updates of file system index blocks. Furthermore; PebbleSSD allows log-structured file systems to perform fast and efficient log cleaning with minimal flash writes.,Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems,2017,*,16

The magnitude ofsuch datasets makes exact query answering infeasible; leading researchers into thedevelopment of approximate query answering approaches. However; existing approximatequery answering algorithms are not suited for the efficient processing of queries over sensordata; as they exhibit at least one of the following shortcomings:(a) They do not providedeterministic error guarantees; resorting to weaker probabilistic error guarantees that are inmany cases not acceptable;(b) they allow queries only over a single dataset; thus notsupporting the multitude of queries over multiple datasets that appear in practice; such ascorrelation or cross-correlation and (c) they support relational data in general and thus …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01414,2017,*,6
Assisting Discovery in Public Health,Yannis Katsis; Nikos Koulouris; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Kevin Patrick,Abstract Several public health (PH) researchers have lately been arguing that big data canplay a profound role in scientific discovery. Leveraging the vast amount of population-leveldata collected by public agencies and other organizations; could lead to importantdiscoveries that were not necessarily suspected to be true. However; they also warn aboutthe pitfalls of data-driven discovery: The large amount of data can easily lead to informationoverload for the researchers. Additionally; data-driven studies that make a lot of tests in thesearch for important discoveries have the potential to lead to discoveries that seemimportant but are in fact random.

Fast In-Memory SQL Analytics on Graphs,Chunbin Lin; Benjamin Mandel; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Matthias Springer,Abstract: We study a class of graph analytics SQL queries; which we call relationshipqueries. Relationship queries are a wide superset of fixed-length graph reachability queriesand of tree pattern queries. Intuitively; it discovers target entities that are reachable fromsource entities specified by the query. It usually also finds aggregated scores; whichcorrespond to the target entities and are calculated by applying aggregation functions onmeasure attributes; which are found on the target entities; the source entities and the pathsfrom the sources to the targets. We present real-world OLAP scenarios; where efficientrelationship queries are needed. However; row stores; column stores and graph databasesare unacceptably slow in such OLAP scenarios.

Polystore Query Rewriting: The Challenges of Variety.,Yannis Papakonstantinou,Numerous databases marketed as SQL-on-Hadoop; NewSQL [16] and NoSQL haveemerged to catalyze Big Data applications. These databases generally support the 3Vs[7].(i) Volume: amount of data (ii) Velocity: speed of data in and out (iii) Variety: semi-structured and heterogeneous data. As a result of differing use cases and designconsiderations around the Variety requirement; these new databases have adopted semi-structured data models that vary among each other. Their query languages have even morevariations. Some variations are due to superficial syntactic differences. Some variationsarise from the data model differences. Other variations are genuine differences in querycapabilities. Yet another kind of variations involves subtly different semantics for seeminglysimilar query functionalities. Eg; equality may have subtle and unexpected meanings in …,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2016,*,10
Context-sensitive ranking,Liang Chen,We are witnessing a growing number of applications that involve both structured data andunstructured data. A simple example is academic citations: while the citation's content isunstructured text; the citation is associated with structured data such as author list;categories and publication time. To query such hybrid data; a natural approach is tocombine structured queries with keyword search. Two fundamental problems arise for thisunique marriage:(1) How to evaluate hybrid queries efficiently?(2) How to model relevanceranking? The second problem is especially difficult; because all the foundations of relevanceranking in information retrieval are built on unstructured text and no structures areconsidered. We present context-sensitive ranking; a ranking framework that integratesstructured queries and relevance ranking. The key insight is that structured queries …,*,2012,*,15

Using Proximity Search to Estimate Authority Flow,Vagelis Hristidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Ramakrishna Varadarajan,Authority flow and proximity search have been used extensively in measuring theassociation between entities in data graphs; ranging from the web to relational and XMLdatabases. These two ranking factors have been used and studied separately in the past. Inaddition to their semantic differences; a key advantage of proximity search is the existence ofefficient execution algorithms. In contrast; due to the complexity of calculating the authorityflow; current systems only use precomputed authority flows in runtime. This limitationprohibits authority flow to be used more effectively as a ranking factor. In this paper; wepresent a comparative analysis of the two ranking factors. We present an efficientapproximation of authority flow based on proximity search. We analytically estimate theapproximation error and how this affects the ranking of the results of a query.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,*,4

RIDE: a tool for interactive source registration in community-oriented information integration,Yannis Katsis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Keliang Zhao,Abstract Modern Internet communities need to integrate and query structured information.Employing current information integration infrastructure; data integration is still a very costlyeffort; since source registration is performed by a central authority which becomes abottleneck. We propose the community-based integration paradigm which pushes thesource registration task to the independent community members. This creates newchallenges caused by each member's lack of a global overview on how her data interactswith the application queries of the community and the data from other sources. How can thesource owner maximize the visibility of her data to existing applications; while minimizing theclean-up and reformatting cost associated with publishing? Does her data contradict (orcould it contradict in the future) the data of other sources?,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,*,5

Algebra-based extraction of tree patterns in XQuery,Andrei Arion; Veronique Benzaken; Ioana Manolescu; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Ravi Vijay,Query processing performance in XML databases can be greatly enhanced by the usage ofmaterialized views whose content has been stored in the database. This requires a methodfor identifying query subexpressions matching the views; a process known as view-basedquery rewriting. This process is quite complex for relational databases; and all the moredaunting on XML databases. Current XML materialized view proposals are based on treepatterns; since query navigation is conceptually close to such patterns. However; theexisting algorithms for extracting tree patterns from XQuery do not detect patterns {\emacross nested query blocks}. Thus; complex; useful tree pattern views may be missed by therewriting algorithm. We present a novel tree pattern extraction algorithm from XQueryqueries; able to identify larger patterns than previous methods. Our algorithm has been …,*,2006,*,4

Thesystem compiles a given XQuery into an XSM; which is an XML stream transducer; ie; anabstract device that takes as input one or more XML data streams and produces one or moreoutput streams; potentially using internal buffers. We present a systematic way to translateXQueries into efficient XSMs: First the XQuery is translated into a network of XSMs thatcorrespond to the basic operators of the XQuery language and exchange streams. Thenetwork is reduced to a single XSM by repeated application of an XSM com-positionoperation that is optimized to reduce the number of tests and actions that the XSM performsas well as the number of intermediate buffers that it uses. Finally; the optimized XSM is …,Proceedings 2002 VLDB Conference: 28th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB),2002,*,3

Application View Maintenance: Optimizing Change Propagation in Mobile Applications,Konstantinos Zarifis; Yannis Katsis; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Web Frameworks that adopt the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design patternhave been extensively used in the web community for the development of fully-fledgedapplications. Such frameworks; typically; provide algorithms that automate the maintenanceof the application's view when mutations occur to the underlying data (also known asmodel). The automation of this process; commonly referred to as Application ViewMaintenance (AVM); significantly improves developer productivity; since it alleviates thedeveloper from manually performing this task. Such algorithms are also capable of mutatingindividual parts of the view when the underlying data mutate; thus avoiding a full reload andrerendering of the entire application view;(a very expensive operation for HTML content;especially in the mobile setting).

Such frameworks enable efficient incremental updates on the application'sstate and visual layer; but they usually enforce the extended use of imperative logic in orderto accomplish this effect. As an application is extended with additional functionality; thedevelopment process soon becomes extremely arduous and error-prone. This has lead tothe emergence of Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and Web Component libraries thatachieve higher developer productivity by keeping the required source code minimal andwell-organized. Such frameworks can also provide additional mechanisms thatautomatically maintain the application state and the respective visual layer in sync; thus …,*,*,*,3

With Great Freedom for Inconsistent Data Comes Great Scalability Responsibility,Yannis Katsis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,ABSTRACT Shared online databases; such as Google Fusion Tables or Quickbase; allowcommunity members to collaboratively maintain and browse data. While users may believein conflicting facts (due to conflicting sources; measurements or opinions); current onlinedatabases do not offer support for the management of data conflicts. Thus online databasescould clearly benefit from technology for uncertain/incomplete databases. However; priorworks on uncertain databases are of limited help when designing a conflict-aware onlinedatabase; for two reasons: First; their performance degrades rapidly as the number ofconflicting facts escalates; which can be the case in large user communities. Second; theywere built as storage models; resulting in data models that are either non-simple or non-compact and thus may require additional; often non-trivial processing before they appear …,*,*,*,18
La Jolla; CA 92093-0114; USA,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Victor VianuJr,Abstract We study the inference of Data Type Deﬁnitions (DTDs) for views of XML data;using an abstraction that focuses on document content structure. The views are deﬁned by aquery language that produces a list of documents selected from one or more input sources.The selection conditions involve vertical and horizontal navigation; thus querying explicitlythe order present in input documents. We point several strong limitations in the descriptiveability of current DTDs and the need for extending them with a subtyping mechanism and (ii)a more powerful speciﬁcation mecha-nism than regular languages; such as context-freelanguages. With these extensions; we show that one can always infer tight DTDs; thatprecisely characterize a selection view on sources satisfying given DTDs. We also showimportant special cases where one can infer a tight DTD without re-quiring extension (ii) …,*,*,*,18

Queries over Virtual Nested Objects,Liang Chen; Yannis Papakonstantinou,ABSTRACT We describe a system that allows the easy specification and efficient support ofqueries specified as a set of attribute/predicate/value triplets over virtual nested objectsconstructed from relational databases. For example; the Internet Movie Database (imdb)provides virtual nested objects such as” movies”(each one containing a movie tuple; multipleactor tuples and more) and” actors”(containing multiple movies). Queries may contain bothboolean and text/fuzzy predicates and may be directed to one or more virtual nested objectsets. We define ranked query semantics that capture the common requirements that (1)individual tuples within a nested object may only satisfy a subset of all the predicates and (2)an object that contains a tuple that satisfies more than one predicates should (all otherthings being equal) be ranked higher than an object where such predicates are satisfied …,*,*,*,10

The QURSED System,Michalis Petropoulos; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract QURSED enables the development of web-based query forms and reports (QFRs)that query and report semistructured XML data; ie; data that are characterized by nesting;irregularities and structural variance. The query aspects of a QFR are captured by its queryset specification; which formally encodes multiple parameterized; possibly interdependentcondition fragments and can describe large numbers of queries. The run-time component ofQURSED produces XQuery-compliant queries by synthesizing fragments from the query setspecification that have been activated during the interaction of the end-user with the QFR.The design-time component of QURSED; called QURSED Editor; semiautomates thedevelopment of the query set specification and its association with the visual components ofthe QFR and guides the development of meaningful dependencies between condition …,*,*,*,18

Whilecommunity members may believe in conflicting facts (due to conflicting sources;measurements or opinions); current online databases do not yet offer support for themanagement of data conflicts. Ricolla is a novel online database that treats data conflicts asfirst-class citizens. Unlike prior work in uncertain databases; which was made to provide adatabase back-end to application logic; Ricolla is tuned to the requirements of the onlinedatabase paradigm; allowing intuitive visualization of conflicts and collaborative dataediting/conflict resolution. The proposed end-to-end system makes the followingcontributions: a) an online database paradigm that captures conflicts; allowing data query …,*,*,*,12
