Robust and fast similarity search for moving object trajectories,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract An important consideration in similarity-based retrieval of moving object trajectoriesis the definition of a distance function. The existing distance functions are usually sensitive tonoise; shifts and scaling of data that commonly occur due to sensor failures; errors indetection techniques; disturbance signals; and different sampling rates. Cleaning data toeliminate these is not always possible. In this paper; we introduce a novel distance function;Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) which is robust against these data imperfections.Analysis and comparison of EDR with other popular distance functions; such as Euclideandistance; Dynamic Time Warping (DTW); Edit distance with Real Penalty (ERP); andLongest Common Subsequences (LCSS); indicate that EDR is more robust than Euclideandistance; DTW and ERP; and it is on average 50% more accurate than LCSS.

On the marriage of lp-norms and edit distance,Lei Chen; Raymond Ng,Abstract Existing studies on time series are based on two categories of distance functions.The first category consists of the Lp-norms. They are metric distance functions but cannotsupport local time shifting. The second category consists of distance functions which arecapable of handling local time shifting but are nonmetric. The first contribution of this paperis the proposal of a new distance function; which we call ERP (" Edit distance with RealPenalty"). Representing a marriage of L1-norm and the edit distance; ERP can support localtime shifting; and is a metric. The second contribution of the paper is the development ofpruning strategies for large time series databases. Given that ERP is a metric; one way toprune is to apply the triangle inequality. Another way to prune is to develop a lower boundon the ERP distance. We propose such a lower bound; which has the nice computational …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,600,3
K-automorphism: A general framework for privacy preserving network publication,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The growing popularity of social networks has generated interesting datamanagement and data mining problems. An important concern in the release of these datafor study is their privacy; since social networks usually contain personal information. Simplyremoving all identifiable personal information (such as names and social security number)before releasing the data is insufficient. It is easy for an attacker to identify the target byperforming different structural queries. In this paper we propose k-automorphism to protectagainst multiple structural attacks and develop an algorithm (called KM) that ensures k-automorphism. We also discuss an extension of KM to handle" dynamic" releases of thedata. Extensive experiments show that the algorithm performs well in terms of protection itprovides.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,335,10
Monochromatic and bichromatic reverse skyline search over uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Reverse skyline queries over uncertain databases have many importantapplications such as sensor data monitoring and business planning. Due to the existence ofuncertainty in many real-world data; answering reverse skyline queries accurately andefficiently over uncertain data has become increasingly important. In this paper; we modelthe probabilistic reverse skyline query on uncertain data; in both monochromatic andbichromatic cases; and propose effective pruning methods to reduce the search space ofquery processing. Moreover; efficient query procedures have been presented seamlesslyintegrating the proposed pruning methods. Extensive experiments have demonstrated theefficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach with various experimental settings.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,246,12
Contour map matching for event detection in sensor networks,Wenwei Xue; Qiong Luo; Lei Chen; Yunhao Liu,Abstract Many sensor network applications; such as object tracking and disaster monitoring;require effective techniques for event detection. In this paper; we propose a novel eventdetection mechanism based on matching the contour maps of in-network sensory datadistribution. Our key observation is that events in sensor networks can be abstracted intospatio-temporal patterns of sensory data and that pattern matching can be done efficientlythrough contour map matching. Therefore; we propose simple SQL extensions to allowusers to specify common types of events as patterns in contour maps and study energy-efficient techniques of contour map construction and maintenance for our pattern-basedevent detection. Our experiments with synthetic workloads derived from a real-world coalmine surveillance application validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,244,12
gStore: answering SPARQL queries via subgraph matching,Lei Zou; Jinghui Mo; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Due to the increasing use of RDF data; efficient processing of SPARQL queriesover RDF datasets has become an important issue. However; existing solutions suffer fromtwo limitations: 1) they cannot answer SPARQL queries with wildcards in a scalable manner;and 2) they cannot handle frequent updates in RDF repositories efficiently. Thus; most ofthem have to reprocess the dataset from scratch. In this paper; we propose a graph-basedapproach to store and query RDF data. Rather than mapping RDF triples into a relationaldatabase as most existing methods do; we store RDF data as a large graph. A SPARQLquery is then converted into a corresponding subgraph matching query. In order to speed upquery processing; we develop a novel index; together with some effective pruning rules andefficient search algorithms. Our method can answer exact SPARQL queries and queries …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,167,15
Distance-join: Pattern match query in a large graph database,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The growing popularity of graph databases has generated interesting datamanagement problems; such as subgraph search; shortest-path query; reachabilityverification; and pattern match. Among these; a pattern match query is more flexiblecompared to a subgraph search and more informative compared to a shortest-path orreachability query. In this paper; we address pattern match problems over a large data graphG. Specifically; given a pattern graph (ie; query Q); we want to find all matches (in G) thathave the similar connections as those in Q. In order to reduce the search space significantly;we first transform the vertices into points in a vector space via graph embedding techniques;coverting a pattern match query into a distance-based multi-way join problem over theconverted vector space. We also propose several pruning strategies and a join order …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,162,0
Sliding-window top-k queries on uncertain streams,Cheqing Jin; Ke Yi; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Query processing on uncertain data streams has attracted a lot of attentions lately;due to the imprecise nature in the data generated from a variety of streaming applications;such as readings from a sensor network. However; all of the existing works on uncertaindata streams study unbounded streams. This paper takes the first step towards the importantand challenging problem of answering sliding-window queries on uncertain data streams;with a focus on arguably one of the most important types of queries---top-k queries. Thechallenge of answering sliding-window top-k queries on uncertain data streams stems fromthe strict space and time requirements of processing both arriving and expiring tuples in high-speed streams; combined with the difficulty of coping with the exponential blowup in thenumber of possible worlds induced by the uncertain data model. In this paper; we design …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,143,12
Nonthreshold-based event detection for 3D environment monitoring in sensor networks,Mo Li; Yunhao Liu; Lei Chen,Event detection is a crucial task for wireless sensor network applications; especiallyenvironment monitoring. Existing approaches for event detection are mainly based on somepredefined threshold values; and thus are often inaccurate and incapable of capturingcomplex events. For example; in coal mine monitoring scenarios; gas leakage or waterosmosis can hardly be described by the overrun of specified attribute thresholds; but somecomplex pattern in the full-scale view of the environmental data. To address this issue; wepropose a non-threshold based approach for the real 3D sensor monitoring environment.We employ energy-efficient methods to collect a time series of data maps from the sensornetwork and detect complex events through matching the gathered data to spatio-temporaldata patterns. Finally; we conduct trace driven simulations to prove the efficacy and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,141,12
Mining frequent itemsets over uncertain databases,Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Yurong Cheng; Philip S Yu,Abstract In recent years; due to the wide applications of uncertain data; mining frequentitemsets over uncertain databases has attracted much attention. In uncertain databases; thesupport of an itemset is a random variable instead of a fixed occurrence counting of thisitemset. Thus; unlike the corresponding problem in deterministic databases where thefrequent itemset has a unique definition; the frequent itemset under uncertain environmentshas two different definitions so far. The first definition; referred as the expected support-based frequent itemset; employs the expectation of the support of an itemset to measurewhether this itemset is frequent. The second definition; referred as the probabilistic frequentitemset; uses the probability of the support of an itemset to measure its frequency. Thus;existing work on mining frequent itemsets over uncertain databases is divided into two …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,137,12
Indexable PLA for efficient similarity search,Qiuxia Chen; Lei Chen; Xiang Lian; Yunhao Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Similarity-based search over time-series databases has been a hot research topicfor a long history; which is widely used in many applications; including multimedia retrieval;data mining; web search and retrieval; and so on. However; due to high dimensionality (ielength) of the time series; the similarity search over directly indexed time series usuallyencounters a serious problem; known as the" dimensionality curse". Thus; manydimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing thedimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods; only Piecewise LinearApproximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries;which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initialstudies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods; however; show that PLA …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,129,5
A novel spectral coding in a large graph database,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yansheng Lu,Abstract Retrieving related graphs containing a query graph from a large graph database isa key issue in many graph-based applications; such as drug discovery and structural patternrecognition. Because sub-graph isomorphism is a NP-complete problem [4]; we have toemploy a filter-and-verification framework to speed up the search efficiency; that is; using aneffective and efficient pruning strategy to filter out the false positives (graphs that are notpossible in the results) as many as possible first; then validating the remaining candidatesby subgraph isomorphism checking. In this paper; we propose a novel filtering method; aspectral encoding method; ie GCoding. Specifically; we assign a signature to each vertexbased on its local structures. Then; we generate a spectral graph code by combining allvertex signatures in a graph. Based on spectral graph codes; we derive a necessary …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,127,5
Efficient anomaly monitoring over moving object trajectory streams,Yingyi Bu; Lei Chen; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Dawei Liu,Abstract Lately there exist increasing demands for online abnormality monitoring overtrajectory streams; which are obtained from moving object tracking devices. This problem ischallenging due to the requirement of high speed data processing within limited space cost.In this paper; we present a novel framework for monitoring anomalies over continuoustrajectory streams. First; we illustrate the importance of distance-based anomaly monitoringover moving object trajectories. Then; we utilize the local continuity characteristics oftrajectories to build local clusters upon trajectory streams and monitor anomalies via efficientpruning strategies. Finally; we propose a piecewise metric index structure to reschedule thejoining order of local clusters to further reduce the time cost. Our extensive experimentsdemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,124,1
Mining frequent trajectory patterns for activity monitoring using radio frequency tag arrays,Yunhao Liu; Lei Chen; Jian Pei; Qiuxia Chen; Yiyang Zhao,Activity monitoring; a crucial task in many applications; is often conducted expensively usingvideo cameras. Also; effectively monitoring a large field by analyzing images from multiplecameras remains a challenging problem. In this paper; we introduce a novel application ofthe recently developed RFID technology: using RF tag arrays for activity monitoring; wheredata mining techniques play a critical role. The RFID technology provides an economicallyattractive solution due to the low cost of RF tags and readers. Another novelty of this designis that the tracking objects do not need to attach any transmitters or receivers; such as tagsor readers. By developing a practical fault-tolerant method; we offset the noise of RF tag dataand mine frequent trajectory patterns as models of regular activities.

Whom to ask?: jury selection for decision making tasks on micro-blog services,Caleb Chen Cao; Jieying She; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen,Abstract It is universal to see people obtain knowledge on micro-blog services by askingothers decision making questions. In this paper; we study the Jury Selection Problem (JSP)by utilizing crowdsourcing for decision making tasks on micro-blog services. Specifically; theproblem is to enroll a subset of crowd under a limited budget; whose aggregated wisdom viaMajority Voting scheme has the lowest probability of drawing a wrong answer (Jury ErrorRate-JER). Due to various individual error-rates of the crowd; the calculation of JER is non-trivial. Firstly; we explicitly state that JER is the probability when the number of wrong jurorsis larger than half of the size of a jury. To avoid the exponentially increasing calculation ofJER; we propose two efficient algorithms and an effective bounding technique. Furthermore;we study the Jury Selection Problem on two crowdsourcing models; one is for altruistic …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,114,12
Event detection over twitter social media streams,Xiangmin Zhou; Lei Chen,Abstract In recent years; microblogs have become an important source for reporting real-world events. A real-world occurrence reported in microblogs is also called a social event.Social events may hold critical materials that describe the situations during a crisis. In realapplications; such as crisis management and decision making; monitoring the critical eventsover social streams will enable watch officers to analyze a whole situation that is acomposite event; and make the right decision based on the detailed contexts such as what ishappening; where an event is happening; and who are involved. Although there has beensignificant research effort on detecting a target event in social networks based on a singlesource; in crisis; we often want to analyze the composite events contributed by differentsocial users.

We categorize the state-of-the-artanonymization methods on simple graphs in three main categories: K-anonymity basedprivacy preservation via edge modification; probabilistic privacy preservation via edgerandomization; and privacy preservation via generalization. We then review anonymizationmethods on rich graphs. We finally discuss challenges and propose new research directionsin this area.,*,2010,108,12

Yet the low participationlevel of smartphone users due to various resource consumptions; such as time and power;remains a hurdle that prevents the enjoyment brought by sensing applications. Recently;some researchers have done pioneer works in motivating users to contribute their resourcesby designing incentive mechanisms; which are able to provide certain rewards forparticipation.

Probabilistic ranked queries in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Recently; many new applications; such as sensor data monitoring and mobiledevice tracking; raise up the issue of uncertain data management. Compared to" certain"data; the data in the uncertain database are not exact points; which; instead; often locatewithin a region. In this paper; we study the ranked queries over uncertain data. In fact;ranked queries have been studied extensively in traditional database literature due to theirpopularity in many applications; such as decision making; recommendation raising; anddata mining tasks. Many proposals have been made in order to improve the efficiency inanswering ranked queries. However; the existing approaches are all based on theassumption that the underlying data are exact (or certain). Due to the intrinsic differencesbetween uncertain and certain data; these methods are designed only for ranked queries …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,105,12
Efficient multi-way theta-join processing using MapReduce,Xiaofei Zhang; Lei Chen; Min Wang,Abstract Multi-way Theta-join queries are powerful in describing complex relations andtherefore widely employed in real practices. However; existing solutions from traditionaldistributed and parallel databases for multi-way Theta-join queries cannot be easilyextended to fit a shared-nothing distributed computing paradigm; which is proven to be ableto support OLAP applications over immense data volumes. In this work; we study theproblem of efficient processing of multi-way Theta-join queries using MapReduce from acost-effective perspective. Although there have been some works using the (key; value) pair-based programming model to support join operations; efficient processing of multi-wayTheta-join queries has never been fully explored. The substantial challenge lies in; given anumber of processing units (that can run Map or Reduce tasks); mapping a multi-way …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,100,10
A weighted moving average-based approach for cleaning sensor data,Yongzhen Zhuang; Lei Chen; X Sean Wang; Jie Lian,Nowadays; wireless sensor networks have been widely used in many monitoringapplications. Due to the low quality of sensors and random effects of the environments;however; it is well known that the collected sensor data are noisy. Therefore; it is very criticalto clean the sensor data before using them to answer queries or conduct data analysis.Popular data cleaning approaches; such as the moving average; cannot meet therequirements of both energy efficiency and quick response time in many sensor relatedapplications. In this paper; we propose a hybrid sensor data cleaning approach withconfidence. Specifically; we propose a smart weighted moving average (WMA) algorithmthat collects confidence data from sensors and computes the weighted moving average. Therationale behind the WMA algorithm is to draw more samples for a particular value that is …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2007. ICDCS'07. 27th International Conference on,2007,99,3
Personalized privacy protection in social networks,Mingxuan Yuan; Lei Chen; Philip S Yu,Abstract Due to the popularity of social networks; many proposals have been proposed toprotect the privacy of the networks. All these works assume that the attacks use the samebackground knowledge. However; in practice; different users have different privacy protectrequirements. Thus; assuming the attacks with the same background knowledge does notmeet the personalized privacy requirements; meanwhile; it looses the chance to achievebetter utility by taking advantage of differences of users' privacy requirements. In this paper;we introduce a framework which provides privacy preserving services based on the user'spersonal privacy requests. Specifically; we define three levels of protection requirementsbased on the gradually increasing attacker's background knowledge and combine the labelgeneralization protection and the structure protection techniques (ie adding noise edge or …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,98,12
Efficient processing of probabilistic reverse nearest neighbor queries over uncertain data,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) search is very crucial in many real applications. Inparticular; given a database and a query object; an RNN query retrieves all the data objectsin the database that have the query object as their nearest neighbors. Often; due to limitationof measurement devices; environmental disturbance; or characteristics of applications (forexample; monitoring moving objects); data obtained from the real world are uncertain(imprecise). Therefore; previous approaches proposed for answering an RNN query overexact (precise) database cannot be directly applied to the uncertain scenario. In this paper;we re-define the RNN query in the context of uncertain databases; namely probabilisticreverse nearest neighbor (PRNN) query; which obtains data objects with probabilities ofbeing RNNs greater than or equal to a user-specified threshold. Since the retrieval of a …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,95,12
Finding time period-based most frequent path in big trajectory data,Wuman Luo; Haoyu Tan; Lei Chen; Lionel M Ni,Abstract The rise of GPS-equipped mobile devices has led to the emergence of big trajectorydata. In this paper; we study a new path finding query which finds the most frequent path(MFP) during user-specified time periods in large-scale historical trajectory data. We refer tothis query as time period-based MFP (TPMFP). Specifically; given a time period T; a sourcev_s and a destination v_d; TPMFP searches the MFP from v_s to v_d during T. Though thereexist several proposals on defining MFP; they only consider a fixed time period. Mostimportantly; we find that none of them can well reflect people's common sense notion whichcan be described by three key properties; namely suffix-optimal (ie; any suffix of an MFP isalso an MFP); length-insensitive (ie; MFP should not favor shorter or longer paths); andbottleneck-free (ie; MFP should not contain infrequent edges). The TPMFP with the above …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2013,92,12
Probabilistic group nearest neighbor queries in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,The importance of query processing over uncertain data has recently arisen due to its wideusage in many real-world applications. In the context of uncertain databases; previous workshave studied many query types such as nearest neighbor query; range query; top-k query;skyline query; and similarity join. In this paper; we focus on another important query; namely;probabilistic group nearest neighbor (PGNN) query; in the uncertain database; which alsohas many applications. Specifically; given a set; Q; of query points; a PGNN query retrievesdata objects that minimize the aggregate distance (eg; sum; min; and max) to query set Q.Due to the inherent uncertainty of data objects; previous techniques to answer group nearestneighbor (GNN) query cannot be directly applied to our PGNN problem. Motivated by this;we propose effective pruning methods; namely; spatial pruning and probabilistic pruning …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,83,12
Geotrucrowd: trustworthy query answering with spatial crowdsourcing,Leyla Kazemi; Cyrus Shahabi; Lei Chen,Abstract With the abundance and ubiquity of mobile devices; a new class of applications;called spatial crowdsourcing; is emerging; which enables spatial tasks (ie; tasks related to alocation) assigned to and performed by human workers. However; one of the majorchallenges with spatial crowdsourcing is how to verify the validity of the results provided byworkers; when the workers are not trusted equally. To tackle this problem; we assume everyworker has a reputation score; which states the probability that the worker performs a taskcorrectly. Moreover; we define a confidence level for every spatial task; which states that theanswer to the given spatial task is only accepted if its confidence is higher than a certainthreshold. Thus; the problem we are trying to solve is to maximize the number of spatialtasks that are assigned to a set of workers while satisfying the confidence levels of those …,Proceedings of the 21st acm sigspatial international conference on advances in geographic information systems,2013,82,21
Privacy preserving serial data publishing by role composition,Yingyi Bu; Ada Wai Chee Fu; Raymond Chi Wing Wong; Lei Chen; Jiuyong Li,Abstract Previous works about privacy preserving serial data publishing on dynamicdatabases have relied on unrealistic assumptions of the nature of dynamic databases. Inmany applications; some sensitive values changes freely while others never change. Forexample; in medical applications; the disease attribute changes with time when patientsrecover from one disease and develop another disease. However; patients do not recoverfrom some diseases such as HIV. We call such diseases permanent sensitive values. To thebest of our knowledge; none of the existing solutions handle these realistic issues. Wepropose a novel anonymization approach called HD-composition to solve the aboveproblems. Extensive experiments with real data confirm our theoretical results.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,81,5
Evaluating probability threshold k-nearest-neighbor queries over uncertain data,Reynold Cheng; Lei Chen; Jinchuan Chen; Xike Xie,Abstract In emerging applications such as location-based services; sensor monitoring andbiological management systems; the values of the database items are naturally imprecise.For these uncertain databases; an important query is the Probabilistic k-Nearest-NeighborQuery (k-PNN); which computes the probabilities of sets of k objects for being the closest toa given query point. The evaluation of this query can be both computationally-and I/O-expensive; since there is an exponentially large number of k object-sets; and numericalintegration is required. Often a user may not be concerned about the exact probabilityvalues. For example; he may only need answers that have sufficiently high confidence. Wethus propose the Probabilistic Threshold k-Nearest-Neighbor Query (Tk-PNN); which returnssets of k objects that satisfy the query with probabilities higher than some threshold T …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,79,12
Modeling and enhancing the data capacity of wireless sensor networks,Jie Lian; L Chen; K Naik; T Otzu; G Agnew,Abstract—Energy conservation is one of the most important design considerations for batterypowered wireless sensors networks (WSNET). Energy constraint in WSNETs limits the totalamount of sensed data (data capacity) received by the sink. The data capacity of WSNETs issignificantly affected by deployment of sensors and the sink. A major issue; which has notbeen adequately addressed so far; is the question of how node deployment governs thedata capacity and how to improve the total data capacity of WSNETs by using non-uniformsensor deployment strategies. In this paper; we discuss this problem by analyzing thecommonly used static model of sensors networks. In the static model; we find that after thelifetime of a sensor network is over; there is a great amount of energy left unused; which canbe up to 90% of the total initial energy. This energy waste implies that the potential data …,IEEE Monograph on Sensor Network Operations,2004,78,6
Reducing uncertainty of schema matching via crowdsourcing,Chen Jason Zhang; Lei Chen; HV Jagadish; Chen Caleb Cao,Abstract Schema matching is a central challenge for data integration systems. Automatedtools are often uncertain about schema matchings they suggest; and this uncertainty isinherent since it arises from the inability of the schema to fully capture the semantics of therepresented data. Human common sense can often help. Inspired by the popularity and thesuccess of easily accessible crowdsourcing platforms; we explore the use of crowdsourcingto reduce the uncertainty of schema matching. Since it is typical to ask simple questions oncrowdsourcing platforms; we assume that each question; namely CorrespondenceCorrectness Question (CCQ); is to ask the crowd to decide whether a given correspondenceshould exist in the correct matching. We propose frameworks and efficient algorithms todynamically manage the CCQs; in order to maximize the uncertainty reduction within a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,71,5
Protecting Sensitive Labels in Social Network Data Anonymization,Mingxuan Yuan; Lei Chen; P Yu; Ting Yu,Privacy is one of the major concerns when publishing or sharing social network data forsocial science research and business analysis. Recently; researchers have developedprivacy models similar to k-anonymity to prevent node reidentification through structureinformation. However; even when these privacy models are enforced; an attacker may stillbe able to infer one's private information if a group of nodes largely share the same sensitivelabels (ie; attributes). In other words; the label-node relationship is not well protected by purestructure anonymization methods. Furthermore; existing approaches; which rely on edgeediting or node clustering; may significantly alter key graph properties. In this paper; wedefine a k-degree-l-diversity anonymity model that considers the protection of structuralinformation as well as sensitive labels of individuals. We further propose a novel …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2011,71,12

Discovering threshold-based frequent closed itemsets over probabilistic data,Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Bolin Ding,In recent years; many new applications; such as sensor network monitoring and movingobject search; show a growing amount of importance of uncertain data management andmining. In this paper; we study the problem of discovering threshold-based frequent closeditem sets over probabilistic data. Frequent item set mining over probabilistic database hasattracted much attention recently. However; existing solutions may lead an exponentialnumber of results due to the downward closure property over probabilistic data. Moreover; itis hard to directly extend the successful experiences from mining exact data to a probabilisticenvironment due to the inherent uncertainty of data.

Dynamic skyline queries in metric spaces,Lei Chen; Xiang Lian,Abstract Skyline query is of great importance in many applications; such as multi-criteriadecision making and business planning. In particular; a skyline point is a data object in thedatabase whose attribute vector is not dominated by that of any other objects. Previousmethods to retrieve skyline points usually assume static data objects in the database (ie theirattribute vectors are fixed); whereas several recent work focus on skyline queries withdynamic attributes. In this paper; we propose a novel variant of skyline queries; namelymetric skyline; whose dynamic attributes are defined in the metric space (ie not limited to theEuclidean space). We illustrate an efficient and effective pruning mechanism to answermetric skyline queries through a metric index.

In-network outlier cleaning for data collection in sensor networks,Yongzhen Zhuang; Lei Chen,Abstract Outliers are very common in the environmental data monitored by a sensor networkconsisting of many inexpensive; low fidelity; and frequently failed sensors. The limitedbattery power and costly data transmission have introduced a new challenge for outliercleaning in sensor networks: it must be done innetwork to avoid spending energy ontransmitting outliers. In this paper; we propose an in-network outlier cleaning approach;including wavelet based outlier correction and neighboring DTW (Dynamic Time Warping)distance-based outlier removal. The cleaning process is accomplished during multi-hopdata forwarding process; and makes use of the neighboring relation in the hop-count basedrouting algorithm. Our approach guarantees that most of the outliers can be either corrected;or removed from further transmission within 2 hops. We have simulated a spatialtemporal …,CleanDB Workshop,2006,68,10
Top-k dominating queries in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Due to the existence of uncertain data in a wide spectrum of real applications;uncertain query processing has become increasingly important; which dramatically differsfrom handling certain data in a traditional database. In this paper; we formulate and tacklean important query; namely probabilistic top-k dominating (PTD) query; in the uncertaindatabase. In particular; a PTD query retrieves k uncertain objects that are expected todynamically dominate the largest number of uncertain objects. We propose an effectivepruning approach to reduce the PTD search space; and present an efficient query procedureto answer PTD queries. Furthermore; approximate PTD query processing and the casewhere the PTD query is issued from an uncertain query object are also discussed.

Mixed type audio classification with support vector machine,Lei Chen; Sule Gunduz; M Tamer Ozsu,Content-based classification of audio data is an important problem for various applicationssuch as overall analysis of audio-visual streams; boundary detection of video story segment;extraction of speech segments from video; and content-based video retrieval. Though theclassification of audio into single type such as music; speech; environmental sound andsilence is well studied; classification of mixed type audio data; such as clips having speechwith music as background; is still considered a difficult problem. In this paper; we present amixed type audio classification system based on support vector machine (SVM). In order tocapture characteristics of different types of audio data; besides selecting audio features; wealso design four different representation formats for each feature.

However; graph data handledby these applications is often noisy; incomplete; and inaccurate because of the way the datais produced. In this paper; we study subgraph queries over uncertain graphs. Specifically;we consider the problem of answering threshold-based probabilistic queries over a largeuncertain graph database with the possible world semantics. We prove that problem is# P-complete; therefore; we adopt a filtering-and-verification strategy to speed up the search. Inthe filtering phase; we use a probabilistic inverted index; PIndex; based on subgraphfeatures obtained by an optimal feature selection process. During the verification phase …,Proc.

Continuously maintaining sliding window skylines in a sensor network,Junchang Xin; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Xiaoyi Zhang; Zhenhua Wang,Abstract Currently; wireless sensor network has been widely used in environmentmonitoring. The skyline query; as an important operator for multiple criteria decision makingand data mining; plays an important role in many sensing applications. Though skylinequeries have been well-studied in traditional database system; the existing solutionsdesigned for data stored in a centralized site are not directly applicable to sensorenvironment due to the unique characteristics of wireless sensor network. In this paper; wepropose an energy-efficient algorithm; called Sliding Window Skyline Monitoring Algorithm(SWSMA); to continuously maintain sliding window skylines over a wireless sensor network.Specifically; SWSMA employs two types of filters within each sensor to reduce the amount ofdata transferred and save the energy consumption as a consequence.

Symbolic representation and retrieval of moving object trajectories,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract Searching moving object trajectories of video databases has been applied to manyfields; such as video data analysis; content-based video retrieval; video scene classification.In this paper; we propose a novel representation of trajectories; called< i> movement patternstrings</i>; which convert the trajectories into symbolic representations. Movement patternstrings encode both the movement direction and the movement distance information of thetrajectories. The distances that are computed in a symbolic space are lower bounds of thedistances of original trajectory data; which guarantees that no false dismissals will beintroduced using movement pattern strings to retrieve trajectories. In order to improve theretrieval efficiency; we define a< i> modified frequency distance</i> for frequency vectorsthat are obtained from movement pattern strings to reduce the dimensionality and the …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGMM international workshop on Multimedia information retrieval,2004,62,12
Efficient subgraph similarity search on large probabilistic graph databases,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Haixun Wang,Abstract Many studies have been conducted on seeking the efficient solution for subgraphsimilarity search over certain (deterministic) graphs due to its wide application in manyfields; including bioinformatics; social network analysis; and Resource DescriptionFramework (RDF) data management. All these works assume that the underlying data arecertain. However; in reality; graphs are often noisy and uncertain due to various factors; suchas errors in data extraction; inconsistencies in data integration; and privacy preservingpurposes. Therefore; in this paper; we study subgraph similarity search on large probabilisticgraph databases. Different from previous works assuming that edges in an uncertain graphare independent of each other; we study the uncertain graphs where edges' occurrences arecorrelated. We formally prove that subgraph similarity search over probabilistic graphs is# …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,59,10
Energy-efficient reverse skyline query processing over wireless sensor networks,Guoren Wang; Junchang Xin; Lei Chen; Yunhao Liu,Reverse skyline query plays an important role in many sensing applications; such asenvironmental monitoring; habitat monitoring; and battlefield monitoring. Due to the limitedpower supplies of wireless sensor nodes; the existing centralized approaches; which do notconsider energy efficiency; cannot be directly applied to the distributed sensor environment.In this paper; we investigate how to process reverse skyline queries energy efficiently inwireless sensor networks. Initially; we theoretically analyzed the properties of reverseskyline query and proposed a skyband-based approach to tackle the problem of reverseskyline query answering over wireless sensor networks. Then; an energy-efficient approachis proposed to minimize the communication cost among sensor nodes of evaluating rangereverse skyline query. Moreover; optimization mechanisms to improve the performance of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,58,19
Dominant graph: An efficient indexing structure to answer top-k queries,Lei Zou; Lei Chen,Given a record set D and a query score function F; a top-k query returns k records from D;whose values of function F on their attributes are the highest. In this paper; we investigatethe intrinsic connection between top-k queries and dominant relationship between records;and based on which; we propose an efficient layer-based indexing structure; DominantGraph (DG); to improve the query efficiency. Specifically; DG is built offline to express thedominant relationship between records and top-k query is implemented as a graph traversalproblem; ie Traveler algorithm. We prove theoretically that the size of search space (that isthe number of retrieved records from the record set to answer top-k query) in our basicalgorithm is directly related to the cardinality of skyline points in the record set (see Theorem3.2). Based on the cost analysis; we propose the optimization technique; pseudo record …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,57,12
Differential dependencies: Reasoning and discovery,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen,Abstract The importance of difference semantics (eg;“similar” or “dissimilar”) has beenrecently recognized for declaring dependencies among various types of data; such asnumerical values or text values. We propose a novel form of Differential Dependencies(dds); which specifies constraints on difference; called differential functions; instead ofidentification functions in traditional dependency notations like functional dependencies.Informally; a differential dependency states that if two tuples have distances on attributes Xagreeing with a certain differential function; then their distances on attributes Y should alsoagree with the corresponding differential function on Y. For example;[date (&leq; 7)]→[price(< 100)] states that the price difference of any two days within a week length should be nogreater than 100 dollars. Such differential dependencies are useful in various …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,56,20
Online mobile micro-task allocation in spatial crowdsourcing,Yongxin Tong; Jieying She; Bolin Ding; Libin Wang; Lei Chen,With the rapid development of smartphones; spatial crowdsourcing platforms are gettingpopular. A foundational research of spatial crowdsourcing is to allocate micro-tasks tosuitable crowd workers. Most existing studies focus on offline scenarios; where all thespatiotemporal information of micro-tasks and crowd workers is given. However; they areimpractical since micro-tasks and crowd workers in real applications appear dynamicallyand their spatiotemporal information cannot be known in advance. In this paper; to addressthe shortcomings of existing offline approaches; we first identify a more practical micro-taskallocation problem; called the Global Online Micro-task Allocation in spatial crowdsourcing(GOMA) problem. We first extend the state-of-art algorithm for the online maximum weightedbipartite matching problem to the GOMA problem as the baseline algorithm.

gStore: a graph-based SPARQL query engine,Lei Zou; M Tamer Özsu; Lei Chen; Xuchuan Shen; Ruizhe Huang; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract We address efficient processing of SPARQL queries over RDF datasets. Theproposed techniques; incorporated into the gStore system; handle; in a uniform and scalablemanner; SPARQL queries with wildcards and aggregate operators over dynamic RDFdatasets. Our approach is graph based. We store RDF data as a large graph and alsorepresent a SPARQL query as a query graph. Thus; the query answering problem isconverted into a subgraph matching problem. To achieve efficient and scalable queryprocessing; we develop an index; together with effective pruning rules and efficient searchalgorithms. We propose techniques that use this infrastructure to answer aggregationqueries. We also propose an effective maintenance algorithm to handle online updates overRDF repositories.

Efficiently answering probability threshold-based shortest path queries over uncertain graphs,Ye Yuan; Lei Chen; Guoren Wang,Abstract Efficiently processing shortest path (SP) queries over stochastic networks attracteda lot of research attention as such queries are very popular in the emerging real worldapplications such as Intelligent Transportation Systems and communication networks whoseedge weights can be modeled as a random variable. Some pervious works aim at findingthe most likely SP (the path with largest probability to be SP); and others search the least-expected-weight path. In all these works; the definitions of the shortest path query are basedon simple probabilistic models which can be converted into the multi-objective optimalissues on a weighted graph. However; these simple definitions miss important informationabout the internal structure of the probabilistic paths and the interplay among all theuncertain paths. Thus; in this paper; we propose a new SP definition based on the …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,52,12

Meanwhile; with advances inpervasive technology; mobile devices; such as mobile phones and tablets; have becomeextremely popular. These mobile devices can work as sensors to collect multimedia data(audios; images and videos) and location information. This power makes it possible toimplement the new crowdsourcing mode: spatial crowdsourcing. In spatial crowdsourcing; arequester can ask for resources related a specific location; the mobile users who would liketo take the task will travel to that place and get the data.

Reverse skyline search in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Reverse skyline queries over uncertain databases have many importantapplications such as sensor data monitoring and business planning. Due to the wideexistence of uncertainty in many real-world data; answering reverse skyline queriesaccurately and efficiently over uncertain data has become increasingly important. In thisarticle; we formalize the probabilistic reverse skyline query over uncertain data; in bothmonochromatic and bichromatic cases; and propose effective pruning methods; namelyspatial pruning and probabilistic pruning; to reduce the search space of the reverse skylinequery processing. Moreover; efficient query procedures have been presented seamlesslyintegrating the proposed pruning methods.

Traffic prediction in a bike-sharing system,Yexin Li; Yu Zheng; Huichu Zhang; Lei Chen,Abstract Bike-sharing systems are widely deployed in many major cities; providing aconvenient transportation mode for citizens' commutes. As the rents/returns of bikes atdifferent stations in different periods are unbalanced; the bikes in a system need to berebalanced frequently. Real-time monitoring cannot tackle this problem well as it takes toomuch time to reallocate the bikes after an imbalance has occurred. In this paper; we proposea hierarchical prediction model to predict the number of bikes that will be rent from/returnedto each station cluster in a future period so that reallocation can be executed in advance. Wefirst propose a bipartite clustering algorithm to cluster bike stations into groups; formulating atwo-level hierarchy of stations. The total number of bikes that will be rent in a city is predictedby a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT).

Reliable diversity-based spatial crowdsourcing by moving workers,Peng Cheng; Xiang Lian; Zhao Chen; Rui Fu; Lei Chen; Jinsong Han; Jizhong Zhao,Abstract With the rapid development of mobile devices and the crowdsourcing platforms; thespatial crowdsourcing has attracted much attention from the database community;specifically; spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending a location-based request to workersaccording to their positions. In this paper; we consider an important spatial crowdsourcingproblem; namely reliable diversity-based spatial crowdsourcing (RDB-SC); in which spatialtasks (such as taking videos/photos of a landmark or firework shows; and checking whetheror not parking spaces are available) are time-constrained; and workers are moving towardssome directions. Our RDB-SC problem is to assign workers to spatial tasks such that thecompletion reliability and the spatial/temporal diversities of spatial tasks are maximized. Weprove that the RDB-SC problem is NP-hard and intractable. Thus; we propose three …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,49,5
An efficient near-duplicate video shot detection method using shot-based interest points,Xiangmin Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou; Lei Chen; Athman Bouguettaya; Nong Xiao; John A Taylor,We propose a shot-based interest point selection approach for effective and efficient near-duplicate search over a large collection of video shots. The basic idea is to eliminate thelocal descriptors with lower frequencies among the selected video frames from a shot toensure that the shot representation is compact and discriminative. Specifically; we proposean adaptive frame selection strategy called furthest point voronoi (FPV) to produce the shotframe set according to the shot content and frame distribution. We describe a novel strategynamed reference extraction (RE) to extract the shot interest descriptors from a keyframe withthe support of the selected frame set. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of theproposed approaches with extensive experiments.,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2009,49,21
Utility-aware social event-participant planning,Jieying She; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen,Abstract Online event-based social network (EBSN) platforms are becoming popular thesedays. An important task of managing EBSNs is to arrange proper social events to interestedusers. Existing approaches usually assume that each user only attends one event or ignorelocation information. The overall utility of such strategy is limited in real world: 1) each usermay attend multiple events; 2) attending multiple events will incur spatio-temporal conflictsand travel expenses. Thus; a more intelligent EBSN platform that provides personalizedevent planning for each participant is desired. In this paper; we first formally define theproblem of Utility-aware Social Event-participant Planning (USEP); which is proven to be NP-hard. To solve the USEP problem; we first devise a greedy-based heuristic algorithm; whichperforms fast under certain circumstances but has no approximation guarantee.

Continuous monitoring of skylines over uncertain data streams,Xiaofeng Ding; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Hai Jin,Abstract Uncertain data are inevitable in many applications due to various factors such asthe limitations of measuring equipment and delays in data updates. Although modeling andquerying uncertain data have recently attracted considerable attention from the databasecommunity; there are still many critical issues to be resolved with respect to conductingadvanced analysis on uncertain data. In this paper; we study the execution of theprobabilistic skyline query over uncertain data streams. We propose a novel sliding windowskyline model where an uncertain tuple may take the probability to be in the skyline at acertain timestamp t. Formally; a Wp-Skyline (p; t) contains all the tuples whose probabilitiesof becoming skylines are at least p at timestamp t. However; in the stream environment;computing a probabilistic skyline on a large number of uncertain tuples within the sliding …,Information Sciences,2012,48,21
Efficient processing of metric skyline queries,Lei Chen; Xiang Lian,Skyline query is of great importance in many applications; such as multi-criteria decisionmaking and business planning. In particular; a skyline point is a data object in the databasewhose attribute vector is not dominated by that of any other objects. Previous methods toretrieve skyline points usually assume static data objects in the database (ie their attributevectors are fixed); whereas several recent work focus on skyline queries with dynamicattributes. In this paper; we propose a novel variant of skyline queries; namely metric skyline;whose dynamic attributes are defined in the metric space (ie not limited to the Euclideanspace). We illustrate an efficient and effective pruning mechanism to answer metric skylinequeries through a metric index. Most importantly; we formalize the query performance of themetric skyline query in terms of the pruning power; by a cost model; in light of which we …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,46,12
Efficient query answering in probabilistic RDF graphs,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract In this paper; we tackle the problem of efficiently answering queries on probabilisticRDF data graphs. Specifically; we model RDF data by probabilistic graphs; and an RDFquery is equivalent to a search over subgraphs of probabilistic graphs that have highprobabilities to match with a given query graph. To efficiently processqueries on probabilisticRDF graphs; we propose effective pruning mechanisms; structural and probabilistic pruning.For the structural pruning; we carefully design synopses for vertex/edge labels byconsidering their distributions and other structural information; in order to improve thepruning power. For the probabilistic pruning; we derive a cost model to guide the pre-computation of probability upper bounds such that the query cost is expected to be low.

Virtual surrounding face geocasting in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks,Jie Lian; Yunhao Liu; Kshirasagar Naik; Lei Chen,Abstract Geocasting in wireless sensor and ad hoc networks means delivering a messagefrom a source node to all the nodes in a given geographical region. The objectives of ageocasting protocol are two-fold: guaranteed message delivery and low transmission cost.Most of the existing protocols do not guarantee message de-livery; and those that do; incurhigh transmission costs. In this study; we propose the concept of Virtual Surrounding Face(VSF); and design a VSF-based geocasting protocol (VSFG). We also design a SKIP methodand a local dominating set (DS) based restricted flooding technique to further reduce thecost of VSFG. Through mathematical analysis and comprehensive sim-ulations; we showthat VSFG; together with SKIP and local DS based restricted flooding; guarantees messagedelivery and has a much lower transmission cost than the previous approaches.

Continuous subgraph pattern search over certain and uncertain graph streams,Lei Chen; Changliang Wang,Search over graph databases has attracted much attention recently due to its usefulness inmany fields; such as the analysis of chemical compounds; intrusion detection in networktraffic data; and pattern matching over users' visiting logs. However; most of the existingworks focus on search over static graph databases; while in many real applications; graphsare changing over time. In this paper; we investigate a new problem on continuoussubgraph pattern search under the situation where multiple target graphs are constantlychanging in a stream style; namely; the subgraph pattern search over graph streams.Obviously; the proposed problem is a continuous join between query patterns and graphstreams where the join predicate is the existence of subgraph isomorphism. Due to the NP-completeness of subgraph isomorphism checking; to achieve the real-time monitoring of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,44,21
Crowdcleaner: Data cleaning for multi-version data on the web via crowdsourcing,Yongxin Tong; Caleb Chen Cao; Chen Jason Zhang; Yatao Li; Lei Chen,Multi-version data is often one of the most concerned information on the Web since this typeof data is usually updated frequently. Even though there exist some Web informationintegration systems that try to maintain the latest update version; the maintained multi-version data usually includes inaccurate and invalid information due to the data integrationor update delay errors. In this demo; we present CrowdCleaner; a smart data cleaningsystem for cleaning multi-version data on the Web; which utilizes crowdsourcing-basedapproaches for detecting and repairing errors that usually cannot be solved by traditionaldata integration and cleaning techniques. In particular; CrowdCleaner blends active andpassive crowdsourcing methods together for rectifying errors for multi-version data.

Conflict-aware event-participant arrangement,Jieying She; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Caleb Chen Cao,With the rapid development of Web 2.0 and Online To Offline (O2O) marketing model;various online event-based social networks (EBSNs); such as Meetup and Whova; aregetting popular. An important task of EBSNs is to facilitate the most satisfactory event-participant arrangement for both sides; ie events enroll more participants and participantsare arranged with personally interesting events. Existing approaches usually focus on thearrangement of each single event to a set of potential users; and ignore the conflictsbetween different events; which leads to infeasible or redundant arrangements. In thispaper; to address the shortcomings of existing approaches; we first identify a more generaland useful event-participant arrangement problem; called Global Event-participantArrangement with Conflict and Capacity (GEACC) problem; focusing on the conflicts of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,42,12
EAGRE: Towards scalable I/O efficient SPARQL query evaluation on the cloud,Xiaofei Zhang; Lei Chen; Yongxin Tong; Min Wang,To benefit from the Cloud platform's unlimited resources; managing and evaluating hugevolume of RDF data in a scalable manner has attracted intensive research efforts recently.Progresses have been made on evaluating SPARQL queries with either high-leveldeclarative programming languages; like Pig [1]; or a sequence of sophisticated designedMapReduce jobs; both of which tend to answer the query with multiple join operations.However; due to the simplicity of Cloud storage and the coarse organization of RDF data inexisting solutions; multiple join operations easily bring significant I/O and network trafficwhich can severely degrade the system performance.

Optimal resource placement in structured peer-to-peer networks,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Guoren Wang,Utilizing the skewed popularity distribution in P2P systems; common in Gnutella and KazaAlike P2P applications; we propose an optimal resource (replica or link) placement strategy;which can optimally trade off the performance gain and paid cost. The proposed resourceplacement strategy; with better results than existing works; can be generally applied inrandomized P2P systems (Symphony) and deterministic P2P systems (eg; Chord; Pastry;Tapestry; etc.). We apply the proposed resource placement strategy; respectively; to twonovel applications: PCache (a P2P-based caching scheme) and PRing (a P2P ringstructure). The simulation results as well as a real deployment on Planetlab demonstrate theeffectiveness of the proposed resource placement strategy in reducing the average searchcost of the whole system.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2010,42,12
Efficient similarity search over future stream time series,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,With the advance of hardware and communication technologies; stream time series isgaining ever-increasing attention due to its importance in many applications such asfinancial data processing; network monitoring; Web click-stream analysis; sensor datamining; and anomaly detection. For all of these applications; an efficient and effectivesimilarity search over stream data is essential. Because of the unique characteristics of thestream; for example; data are frequently updated and real-time response is required; theprevious approaches proposed for searching through archived data may not work in thestream scenarios. Especially; in the cases where data often arrive periodically for variousreasons (for example; the communication congestion or batch processing); queries on suchincomplete time series or even future time series may result in inaccuracy using …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,41,16
Probabilistic nearest neighbor queries on uncertain moving object trajectories,Johannes Niedermayer; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Nikos Mamoulis; Lei Chen; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Nearest neighbor (NN) queries in trajectory databases have received significantattention in the past; due to their applications in spatio-temporal data analysis. More recentwork has considered the realistic case where the trajectories are uncertain; however; onlysimple uncertainty models have been proposed; which do not allow for accurateprobabilistic search. In this paper; we fill this gap by addressing probabilistic nearestneighbor queries in databases with uncertain trajectories modeled by stochastic processes;specifically the Markov chain model. We study three nearest neighbor query semantics thattake as input a query state or trajectory q and a time interval; and theoretically evaluate theirruntime complexity. Furthermore we propose a sampling approach which uses Bayesianinference to guarantee that sampled trajectories conform to the observation data stored in …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,40,12

Top-k subgraph matching query in a large graph,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Yansheng Lu,Abstract Recently; due to its wide applications; subgraph search has attracted a lot ofattention from database and data mining community. Sub-graph search is defined asfollows: given a query graph Q; we report all data graphs containing Q in the database.However; there is little work about sub-graph search in a single large graph; which has beenused in many applications; such as biological network and social network. In this paper; weaddress top-k sub-graph matching query problem; which is defined as follows: given a querygraph Q; we locate top-k matchings of Q in a large data graph G according to a scorefunction. The score function is defined as the sum of the pairwise similarity between a vertexin Q and its matching vertex in G.

Gradient boundary detection for time series snapshot construction in sensor networks,Jie Lian; Lei Chen; Kshirasagar Naik; Yunhao Liu; Gordon B Agnew,In many applications of sensor networks; the sink needs to keep track of the history ofsensed data of a monitored region for scientific analysis or supporting historical queries. Wecall these historical data a time series of value distributions or snapshots. Obviously; to buildthe time series snapshots by requiring all of the sensors to transmit their data to the sinkperiodically is not energy efficient. In this paper; we introduce the idea of gradient boundaryand propose the gradient boundary detection (GBD) algorithm to construct these time seriessnapshots of a monitored region. In GBD; a monitored region is partitioned into a set ofsubregions and all sensed data in one subregion are within a predefined value range;namely; the gradient interval.

Crowdplanner: A crowd-based route recommendation system,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Jiamin Huang; Hoyoung Jeung; Lei Chen; Xiaofang Zhou,As travel is taking more significant part in our life; route recommendation service becomes abig business and attracts many major players in IT industry. Given a pair of user-specifiedorigin and destination; a route recommendation service aims to provide users with the routesof best travelling experience according to criteria; such as travelling distance; travelling time;traffic condition; etc. However; previous research shows that even the routes recommendedby the big-thumb service providers can deviate significantly from the routes travelled byexperienced drivers. It means travellers' preferences on route selection are influenced bymany latent and dynamic factors that are hard to model exactly with pre-defined formulas.

Efficient simrank-based similarity join over large graphs,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Yansong Feng; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Graphs have been widely used to model complex data in many real-worldapplications. Answering vertex join queries over large graphs is meaningful and interesting;which can benefit friend recommendation in social networks and link prediction; etc. In thispaper; we adopt" SimRank" to evaluate the similarity of two vertices in a large graphbecause of its generality. Note that" SimRank" is purely structure dependent and it does notrely on the domain knowledge. Specifically; we define a SimRank-based join (SRJ) query tofind all the vertex pairs satisfying the threshold in a data graph G. In order to reduce thesearch space; we propose an estimated shortest-path distance based upper bound forSimRank scores to prune unpromising vertex pairs.

Dynamic skyline queries in large graphs,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Given a set of query points; a dynamic skyline query reports all data points that arenot dominated by other data points according to the distances between data points andquery points. In this paper; we study d ynamic s kyline queries in a large g raph (DSG-queryfor short). Although dynamic skylines have been studied in Euclidean space [14]; roadnetwork [5]; and metric space [3; 6]; there is no previous work on dynamic skylines over largegraphs. We employ a filter-and-refine framework to speed up the query processing that cananswer DSG-query efficiently. We propose a novel pruning rule based on graph propertiesto derive the candidates for DSG-query; that are guaranteed not to introduce false negatives.In the refinement step; with a carefully-designed index structure; we compute short pathdistances between vertices in O (H); where H is the number of maximal hops between …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,37,3
Parallel subgraph listing in a large-scale graph,Yingxia Shao; Bin Cui; Lei Chen; Lin Ma; Junjie Yao; Ning Xu,Abstract Subgraph listing is a fundamental operation to many graph and network analyses.The problem itself is computationally expensive and is well-studied in centralizedprocessing algorithms. However; the centralized solutions cannot scale well to large graphs.Recently; several parallel approaches are introduced to handle the large graphs.Unfortunately; these parallel approaches still rely on the expensive join operations; thuscannot achieve high performance. In this paper; we design a novel parallel subgraph listingframework; named PSgL. The PSgL iteratively enumerates subgraph instances and solvesthe subgraph listing in a divide-and-conquer fashion. The framework completely relies onthe graph traversal; and avoids the explicit join operation. Moreover; in order to improve itsperformance; we propose several solutions to balance the workload and reduce the size …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,36,3
Optimal proactive caching in peer-to-peer network: analysis and application,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; YingYi Bu,Abstract As a promising new technology with the unique properties like high efficiency;scalability and fault tolerance; Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology is used as the underlyingnetwork to build new Internet-scale applications. However; one of the well known issues insuch an application (for example WWW) is that the distribution of data popularities is heavilytailed with a Zipf-like distribution. With consideration of the skewed popularity we adopt aproactive caching approach to handle the challenge; and focus on two key problems: where(ie the placement strategy: where to place the replicas) and how (ie the degree problem:how many replicas are assigned to one specific content)? For the where problem; wepropose a novel approach which can be generally applied to structured P2P networks. Next;we solve two optimization objectives related to the how problem: MAX_PERF and …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,36,12
On efficient content matching in distributed pub/sub systems,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; AW-C Fu; Hanhua Chen; Futai Zou,The efficiency of matching structures is the key issue for content publish/subscribe systems.In this paper; we propose an efficient matching tree structure; named CobasTree; for adistributed environment. Particularly; we model a predicate in each subscription filter as aninterval and published content value as a data point. The CobasTree is designed to index allsubscription intervals and a matching algorithm is proposed to match the data points tothese indexed intervals.

Continuous subgraph pattern search over graph streams,Changliang Wang; Lei Chen,Search over graph databases has attracted much attention recently due to its usefulness inmany fields; such as the analysis of chemical compounds; intrusion detection in networktraffic data; and pattern matching over users' visiting logs. However; most of the existing workfocuses on search over static graph databases while in many real applications graphs arechanging over time. In this paper we investigate a new problem on continuous subgraphpattern search under the situation where multiple target graphs are constantly changing in astream style; namely the subgraph pattern search over graph streams. Obviously theproposed problem is a continuous join between query patterns and graph streams wherethe join predicate is the existence of subgraph isomorphism. Due to the NP-completeness ofsubgraph isomorphism checking; to achieve the real time monitoring of the existence of …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,35,12
Similarity match over high speed time-series streams,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang; Ge Yu,Similarity-based time series retrieval has been a subject of long term study due to its wideusage in many applications; such as financial data analysis; weather data forecasting; andmultimedia data retrieval. Its original task was to find those time series similar to a pattern(query) time series data; where both the pattern and data time series are static. Recently;with an increasing demand on stream data management; similarity-based stream time seriesretrieval has raised new research issues due to its unique requirements during the streamprocessing; such as one-pass search and fast response. In this paper; we address theproblem of matching patterns over high-speed stream time series data. We will develop anovel representation; called multi-scaled segment mean (MSM); for stream time series data;which can be incrementally computed and thus perfectly adapted to the stream …,Data Engineering; 2007.

Conflict-aware event-participant arrangement and its variant for online setting,Jieying She; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Caleb Chen Cao,With the rapid development of Web 2.0 and Online To Offline (O2O) marketing model;various online event-based social networks (EBSNs) are getting popular. An important taskof EBSNs is to facilitate the most satisfactory event-participant arrangement for both sides; ie;events enroll more participants and participants are arranged with personally interestingevents. Existing approaches usually focus on the arrangement of each single event to a setof potential users; or ignore the conflicts between different events; which leads to infeasibleor redundant arrangements. In this paper; to address the shortcomings of existingapproaches; we first identify a more general and useful event-participant arrangementproblem; called Global E vent-participant Arrangement with Conflict and C apacity ($GEACC $) problem; focusing on the conflicts of different events and making event …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,34,5
Maximal subspace coregulated gene clustering,Yuhai Zhao; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Bin Wang; Ge Yu,Clustering is a popular technique for analyzing microarray data sets; with n genes and mexperimental conditions. As explored by biologists; there is a real need to identifycoregulated gene clusters; which include both positive and negative regulated geneclusters. The existing pattern-based and tendency-based clustering approaches cannotdirectly be applied to find such coregulated gene clusters; because they are designed forfinding positive regulated gene clusters. In this paper; in order to cluster coregulated genes;we propose a coding scheme that allows us to cluster two genes into the same cluster if theyhave the same code; where two genes that have the same code can be either positive ornegative regulated. Based on the coding scheme; we propose a new algorithm for findingmaximal subspace coregulated gene clusters with new pruning techniques.

TCS: efficient topic discovery over crowd-oriented service data,Yongxin Tong; Caleb Chen Cao; Lei Chen,Abstract In recent years; with the widespread usage of Web 2.0 techniques; crowdsourcingplays an important role in offering human intelligence in various service websites; such asYahoo! Answer and Quora. With the increasing amount of crowd-oriented service data; animportant task is to analyze latest hot topics and track topic evolution over time. However; theexisting techniques in text mining cannot effectively work due to the unique structure ofcrowd-oriented service data; task-response pairs; which consists of the task and itscorresponding responses. In particular; existing approaches become ineffective with theever-increasing crowd-oriented service data that accumulate along the time. In this paper;we first study the problem of discovering topics over crowd-oriented service data.

Sliding-window top-k queries on uncertain streams,Cheqing Jin; Ke Yi; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Recently; due to the imprecise nature of the data generated from a variety ofstreaming applications; such as sensor networks; query processing on uncertain datastreams has become an important problem. However; all the existing works on uncertaindata streams study unbounded streams. In this paper; we take the first step towards theimportant and challenging problem of answering sliding-window queries on uncertain datastreams; with a focus on one of the most important types of queries--top-k queries. It isnontrivial to find an efficient solution for answering sliding-window top-k queries onuncertain data streams; because challenges not only stem from the strict space and timerequirements of processing both arriving and expiring tuples in high-speed streams; but alsorise from the exponential blowup in the number of possible worlds induced by the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,32,5
Efficient multi-keyword search over p2p web,Hanhua Chen; Hai Jin; Jiliang Wang; Lei Chen; Yunhao Liu; Lionel M Ni,Abstract Current search mechanisms of DHT-based P2P systems can well handle a singlekeyword search problem. Other than single keyword search; multi-keyword search is quitepopular and useful in many real applications. Simply using the solution for single keywordsearch will require distributed intersection/union operations in wide area networks; leadingto unacceptable traffic cost. As it is well known that Bloom Filter (BF) is effective in reducingtraffic; we would like to use BF encoding to handle multi-keyword search. Applying BF is notdifficult; but how to get optimal results is not trivial. In this study we show; throughmathematical proof; that the optimal setting of BF in terms of traffic cost is determined by theglobal statistical information of keywords; not the minimized false positive rate as claimed byprevious methods. Through extensive experiments; we demonstrate how to obtain …,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web,2008,32,21
Probabilistic top-k dominating queries in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Due to the existence of uncertain data in a wide spectrum of real applications;uncertain query processing has become increasingly important; which dramatically differsfrom handling certain data in a traditional database. In this paper; we formulate and tacklean important query; namely probabilistic top-k dominating (PTD) query; in the uncertaindatabase. In particular; a PTD query retrieves k uncertain objects that are expected todynamically dominate the largest number of uncertain objects. We propose an effectivepruning approach to reduce the PTD search space; and present an efficient query procedureto answer PTD queries. Moreover; approximate PTD query processing and the case wherethe PTD query is issued from an uncertain query object are also discussed. Furthermore; wepropose an important query type; that is; the PTD query in arbitrary subspaces (namely …,Information Sciences,2013,31,12
Pareto-based dominant graph: An efficient indexing structure to answer top-k queries,Lei Zou; Lei Chen,Given a record set D and a query score function F; a top-k query returns k records from D;whose values of function F on their attributes are the highest. In this paper; we investigatethe intrinsic connection between top-k queries and dominant relationships between records;and based on which; we propose an efficient layer-based indexing structure; Pareto-BasedDominant Graph (DG); to improve the query efficiency. Specifically; DG is built offline toexpress the dominant relationship between records and top-k query is implemented as agraph traversal problem; ie; Traveler algorithm. We prove theoretically that the size of searchspace (that is the number of retrieved records from the record set to answer top-k query) inour algorithm is directly related to the cardinality of skyline points in the record set (seeTheorem 3).

Identification of a sex-associated RAPD marker in Ginkgo biloba,JIANG Ling-YOU Rui-Lin; LI Mao-Xue-SHI Chen,Abstract: The random amplified polymorphic DNA RAPD? technique was used to amplifyDNA fragment-aiming at finding markers linked to the sex determination in Ginkgo biloba L.One thousand and two hundred random decamers had been screened. Of the 8 372 RAPDbands-only a 682 bp RAPD marker generated by a primer S1478? of random decamersequences named S1478-682-was found to be associated with the male plants. This markerwas present in all male plants and absent in all female plants. Ginkgo trees collected in bothBeijing and Shenyang China were tested using primer S1478. Positive results wereobtained suggesting S1478-682 could be utilized as a reliable RAPD marker to detect thesexuality of Ginkgo.,Acta Botanica Sinica,2003,30,12
Modeling of video objects in a video databases,Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu,In this paper; we present an efficient video data model to represent moving trajectories ofvideo objects and spatiotemporal relationships among the video objects. A video clip issegmented into a set of common appearance intervals (CAIs). A CAI is a time interval thatvideo objects appear together. Transitions among CAIs record the appearance/disappearance of video objects. Depending on the properties of video objects; they areclassified as foreground and background video objects. Foreground video objects arefurther divided into moving video objects and static video objects. Different models aredesigned to capture these video objects and spatio-temporal relationships amongforeground video objects.,Multimedia and Expo; 2002. ICME'02.

Answering why-not questions on spatial keyword top-k queries,Lei Chen; Xin Lin; Haibo Hu; Christian S Jensen; Jianliang Xu,Large volumes of geo-tagged text objects are available on the web. Spatial keyword top-kqueries retrieve k such objects with the best score according to a ranking function that takesinto account a query location and query keywords. In this setting; users may wonder whysome known object is unexpectedly missing from a result; and understanding why may aidusers in retrieving better results. While spatial keyword querying has been studiedintensively; no proposals exist for how to offer users explanations of why such expectedobjects are missing from results. We provide techniques that allow the revision of spatialkeyword queries such that their results include one or more desired; but missing objects. Indoing so; we adopt a query refinement approach to provide a basic algorithm that reducesthe problem to a two-dimensional geometrical problem.

Efficient keyword search on uncertain graph data,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Haixun Wang,As a popular search mechanism; keyword search has been applied to retrieve useful data indocuments; texts; graphs; and even relational databases. However; so far; there is no workon keyword search over uncertain graph data even though the uncertain graphs have beenwidely used in many real applications; such as modeling road networks; influential detectionin social networks; and data analysis on PPI networks. Therefore; in this paper; we study theproblem of top-k keyword search over uncertain graph data. Following the similar answerdefinition for keyword search over deterministic graphs; we consider a subtree in theuncertain graph as an answer to a keyword query if 1) it contains all the keywords; 2) it has ahigh score (defined by users or applications) based on keyword matching; and 3) it has lowuncertainty.

Wisemarket: a new paradigm for managing wisdom of online social users,Caleb Chen Cao; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; HV Jagadish,Abstract The benefits of crowdsourcing are well-recognized today for an increasingly broadrange of problems. Meanwhile; the rapid development of social media makes it possible toseek the wisdom of a crowd of targeted users. However; it is not trivial to implement thecrowdsourcing platform on social media; specifically to make social media users as workers;we need to address the following two challenges: 1) how to motivate users to participate intasks; and 2) how to choose users for a task. In this paper; we present Wise Market as aneffective framework for crowdsourcing on social media that motivates users to participate ina task with care and correctly aggregates their opinions on pairwise choice problems. TheWise Market consists of a set of investors each with an associated individual confidence inhis/her prediction; and after the investment; only the ones whose choices are the same as …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,29,10
Discovering matching dependencies,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen,Abstract Matching dependencies (MDs) are recently proposed for various data qualityapplications such as detecting the violation of integrity constraints and duplicate objectidentification. In this paper; we study the problem of discovering matching dependencies fora given database instance. First; we formally define the measures; support and confidence;for evaluating the utility of MDs in the given database instance. Then; we study the discoveryof MDs with certain utility requirements of support and confidence. Exact algorithms aredeveloped; together with pruning strategies to improve the time performance.

Development of foundation models for Internet of Things,Lei Chen; Mitchell Tseng; Xiang Lian,Abstract With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) that offers capabilities to identify andconnect worldwide physical objects into a unified system; the importance of modeling andprocessing IoT data has become significantly accentuated. IoT data is substantial in quantity;noisy; heterogeneous; inconsistent; and arrives at the system in a streaming fashion. Due tothe unique characteristics of IoT data; the manipulation of IoT data for practical applicationshas encountered many fundamental challenging problems; such as data modeling andprocessing. This paper proposes the infrastructure for an IoT prototype system that aims todevelop foundation models for IoT data. We illustrate major modules in the IoT prototype; aswell as their functionalities; and provide our vision of the key techniques used for tacking thecritical problems in each module.,Frontiers of Computer Science in China,2010,28,11
Similarity search in arbitrary subspaces under l p-norm,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Similarity search has been widely used in many applications such as information retrieval;image data analysis; and time-series matching. Specifically; a similarity query retrieves alldata objects in a data set that are similar to a given query object. Previous work on similaritysearch usually consider the search problem in the full space. In this paper; however; wepropose a novel problem; subspace similarity search; which finds all data objects that matchwith a query object in the subspace instead of the original full space. In particular; the queryobject can specify arbitrary subspace with arbitrary number of dimensions. Since traditionalapproaches for similarity search cannot be applied to solve the proposed problem; weintroduce an efficient and effective pruning technique; which assigns scores to data objectswith respect to pivots and prunes candidates via scores.

Processing SPARQL queries over distributed RDF graphs,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; M Tamer Özsu; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract We propose techniques for processing SPARQL queries over a large RDF graph ina distributed environment. We adopt a “partial evaluation and assembly” framework.Answering a SPARQL query Q is equivalent to finding subgraph matches of the query graphQ over RDF graph G. Based on properties of subgraph matching over a distributed graph;we introduce local partial match as partial answers in each fragment of RDF graph G. Forassembly; we propose two methods: centralized and distributed assembly. We analyze ouralgorithms from both theoretically and experimentally. Extensive experiments over both realand benchmark RDF repositories of billions of triples confirm that our method is superior tothe state-of-the-art methods in both the system's performance and scalability.,The VLDB Journal,2016,25,12
Returning clustered results for keyword search on XML documents,Xiping Liu; Changxuan Wan; Lei Chen,Keyword search is an effective paradigm for information discovery and has been introducedrecently to query XML documents. In this paper; we address the problem of returningclustered results for keyword search on XML documents. We first propose a novel semanticsfor answers to an XML keyword query. The core of the semantics is the conceptually relatedrelationship between keyword matches; which is based on the conceptual relationshipbetween nodes in XML trees. Then; we propose a new clustering methodology for XMLsearch results; which clusters results according to the way they match the given query. Twoapproaches to implement the methodology are discussed. The first approach is aconventional one which does clustering after search results are retrieved; the second oneclusters search results actively; which has characteristics of clustering on the fly.

Probabilistic inverse ranking queries over uncertain data,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Query processing in the uncertain database has become increasingly importantdue to the wide existence of uncertain data in many real applications. Different fromhandling precise data; the uncertain query processing needs to consider the datauncertainty and answer queries with confidence guarantees. In this paper; we formulate andtackle an important query; namely probabilistic inverse ranking (PIR) query; which retrievespossible ranks of a given query object in an uncertain database with confidence above aprobability threshold. We present effective pruning methods to reduce the PIR search space;which can be seamlessly integrated into an efficient query procedure. Furthermore; we alsotackle the problem of PIR query processing in high dimensional spaces; which reduces highdimensional uncertain data to a lower dimensional space.

Robust and efficient aggregate query processing in wireless sensor networks,Kebin Liu; Lei Chen; Yunhao Liu; Minglu Li,Abstract Wireless sensor networks have been widely used in many applications; such as soiltemperature monitoring for plant growth and abnormal event detection of industrialparameters. Among these applications; aggregate queries; such as SUM; COUNT;AVERAGE; MIN and MAX are often used to collect statistical data. Due to the low qualitysensing devices or random environmental disturbances; sensor data are often noisy. Hence;the idea of moving average; which computes the average over consecutive aggregate data;is introduced to offset the effect. The high link loss rate; however; makes the result afteraveraging still inaccurate. To address this issue; we propose a PCM-based datatransmission scheme to “make up” the possibly lost data. Specifically; we focus on obtainingrobust aggregate results under high link loss rate. In order to reduce the communication …,Mobile Networks and Applications,2008,25,12
Similarity join processing on uncertain data streams,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Similarity join processing in the streaming environment has many practical applications suchas sensor networks; object tracking and monitoring; and so on. Previous works usuallyassume that stream processing is conducted over precise data. In this paper; we study animportant problem of similarity join processing on stream data that inherently containuncertainty (or called uncertain data streams); where the incoming data at each time stampare uncertain and imprecise. Specifically; we formalize this problem as join on uncertaindata streams (USJ); which can guarantee the accuracy of USJ answers over uncertain data.To tackle the challenges with respect to efficiency and effectiveness such as limited memoryand small response time; we propose effective pruning methods on both object and samplelevels to filter out false alarms.

Set similarity join on probabilistic data,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Set similarity join has played an important role in many real-world applications suchas data cleaning; near duplication detection; data integration; and so on. In theseapplications; set data often contain noises and are thus uncertain and imprecise. In thispaper; we model such probabilistic set data on two uncertainty levels; that is; set andelement levels. Based on them; we investigate the problem of probabilistic set similarity join(PS 2 J) over two probabilistic set databases; under the possible worlds semantics. Toefficiently process the PS 2 J operator; we first reduce our problem by condensing thepossible worlds; and then propose effective pruning techniques; including Jaccard distancepruning; probability upper bound pruning; and aggregate pruning; which can filter out falsealarms of probabilistic set pairs; with the help of indexes and our designed synopses.

Towards efficient join processing over large RDF graph using mapreduce,Xiaofei Zhang; Lei Chen; Min Wang,Abstract Existing solutions for answering SPARQL queries in a shared-nothing environmentusing MapReduce failed to fully explore the substantial scalability and parallelism of thecomputing framework. In this paper; we propose a cost model based RDF join processingsolution using MapReduce to minimize the query responding time as much as possible.After transforming a SPARQL query into a sequence of MapReduce jobs; we propose anovel index structure; called All Possible Join tree (APJ-tree); to reduce the searching spacefor the optimal execution plan of a set of MapReduce jobs. To speed up the join processing;we employ hybrid join and bloom filter for performance optimization. Extensive experimentson real data sets proved the effectiveness of our cost model.

Pattern matching over cloaked time series,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu,In many privacy preserving applications such as Location-Based Services (LBS); medicaldata analysis; and data sequence matching; users often deliberately disturb the original datain order to avoid the release of their private information. Although these disturbed cloakeddata cannot reveal the privacy information of individual users; they can still help performsome data mining tasks such as data classification. In this paper; we study one importantand fundamental query predicate; that is; to find the cloaked time series that are similar to aquery pattern. In this paper; we formalize such similarity search problem over the cloakedtime series; and propose a novel approach to index the cloaked series; which can facilitatethe similarity query.,Data Engineering; 2008.

Efficient similarity search in nonmetric spaces with local constant embedding,Lei Chen; Xiang Lian,Similarity-based search has been a key factor for many applications such as multimediaretrieval; data mining; Web search and retrieval; and so on. There are two important issuesrelated to the similarity search; namely; the design of a distance function to measure thesimilarity and improving the search efficiency. Many distance functions have been proposed;which attempt to closely mimic human recognition. Unfortunately; some of these well-designed distance functions do not follow the triangle inequality and are thereforenonmetric. As a consequence; efficient retrieval by using these nonmetric distance functionsbecomes more challenging; since most existing index structures assume that the indexeddistance functions are metric. In this paper; we address this challenging problem byproposing an efficient method; that is; local constant embedding (LCE); which divides the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,23,18

Answering pattern match queries in large graph databases via graph embedding,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract The growing popularity of graph databases has generated interesting datamanagement problems; such as subgraph search; shortest path query; reachabilityverification; and pattern matching. Among these; a pattern match query is more flexiblecompared with a subgraph search and more informative compared with a shortest path or areachability query. In this paper; we address distance-based pattern match queries over alarge data graph G. Due to the huge search space; we adopt a filter-and-refine framework toanswer a pattern match query over a large graph. We first find a set of candidate matches bya graph embedding technique and then evaluate these to find the exact matches.

Adaptive subspace symbolization for content-based video detection,Xiangmin Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou; Lei Chen; Yanfeng Shu; Athman Bouguettaya; John A Taylor,Efficiently and effectively identifying similar videos is an important and nontrivial problem incontent-based video retrieval. This paper proposes a subspace symbolization approach;namely SUDS; for content-based retrieval on very large video databases. The novelty ofSUDS is that it explores the data distribution in subspaces to build a visual dictionary withwhich the videos are processed by deriving the string matching techniques with two-stepdata simplification. Specifically; we first propose an adaptive approach; called VLP; to extracta series of dominant subspaces of variable lengths from the whole visual feature spacewithout the constraint of dimension consecutiveness. A stable visual dictionary is built byclustering the video keyframes over each dominant subspace.

Using multi-scale histograms to answer pattern existence and shape match queries over time series data,Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract Similarity-based querying of time series data can be categorized as patternexistence queries and shape match queries. Pattern existence queries find the time seriesdata with certain patterns while shape match queries look for the time series data that havesimilar movement shapes. Existing proposals address one of these or the other. In thispaper; we propose multi-scale time series histograms that can be used to answer both typesof queries; thus offering users more flexibility. Multiple histogram levels allow querying atvarious precision levels. Most importantly; the distances of time series histograms at lowerscale are lower bounds of the distances at higher scale; which guarantees that no falsedismissals will be introduced when a multi-step filtering process is used in answering shapematch queries. We further propose to use averages of time series histograms to reduce …,Proc. of 17th Int Conf. on Scientific and Statistical Database Management; CA; USA,2005,22,19
Modeling video data for content based queries: Extending the DISIMA image data model,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,We present an efficient video data model that extends the DISIMA image data model byadding the video components and setting up links between image and video data. Manyvideo data models have been proposed; most of which describe video data independently ofimage data and therefore fail to consider the relationship between videos and images. Ourproposed model expresses the semantics of video data content by means of salient objectsand relationships among them. Connections between video data and DISIMA images aremade through key frames; which are extracted from each shot. Based on these connections;techniques used to query image data may be used to query video data. In addition; a set ofnew predicates has been defined to describe the spatio-temporal characteristics of salientobjects in the video data.

Differential privacy in telco big data platform,Xueyang Hu; Mingxuan Yuan; Jianguo Yao; Yu Deng; Lei Chen; Qiang Yang; Haibing Guan; Jia Zeng,Abstract Differential privacy (DP) has been widely explored in academia recently but less soin industry possibly due to its strong privacy guarantee. This paper makes the first attempt toimplement three basic DP architectures in the deployed telecommunication (telco) big dataplatform for data mining applications. We find that all DP architectures have less than 5%loss of prediction accuracy when the weak privacy guarantee is adopted (eg; privacy budgetparameter ε≥ 3). However; when the strong privacy guarantee is assumed (eg; privacybudget parameter ε≤ 0: 1); all DP architectures lead to 15%~ 30% accuracy loss; whichimplies that real-word industrial data mining systems cannot work well under such a strongprivacy guarantee recommended by previous research works.

LogGP: a log-based dynamic graph partitioning method,Ning Xu; Lei Chen; Bin Cui,Abstract With the increasing availability and scale of graph data from Web 2.0; graphpartitioning becomes one of efficient preprocessing techniques to balance the computingworkload. Since the cost of partitioning the entire graph is strictly prohibitive; there are somerecent tentative works towards streaming graph partitioning which can run faster; be easilyparalleled; and be incrementally updated. Unfortunately; the experiments show that therunning time of each partitioning is still unbalanced due to the variation of workload accesspattens during the supersteps. In addition; the one-pass streaming partitioning result is notalways satisfactory for the algorithms' local view of the graph.

Move: A large scale keyword-based content filtering and dissemination system,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Pan Hui; Sasu Tarkoma,The Web 2.0 era is characterized by the emergence of a very large amount of live content. Areal time and fine grained content filtering approach can precisely keep users up-to-date theinformation that they are interested. The key of the approach is to offer a scalable matchalgorithm. One might treat the content match as a special kind of content search; and resortto the classic algorithm [5]. However; due to blind flooding;[5] cannot be simply adapted forscalable content match. To increase the throughput of scalable match; we propose anadaptive approach to allocate (ie; replicate and partition) filters. The allocation is based onour observation on real datasets: most users prefer to use short queries; consisting ofaround 2-3 terms per query; and web content typically contains tens and even thousands ofterms per article. Thus; by reducing the number of processed documents; we can reduce …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2012 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2012,21,12
Data vitalization: a new paradigm for large-scale dataset analysis,Zhang Xiong; Wuman Luo; Lei Chen; Lionel M Ni,Nowadays; datasets grow enormously both in size and complexity. One of the key issuesconfronted by large-scale dataset analysis is how to adapt systems to new; unprecedentedquery loads. Existing systems nail down the data organization scheme once and for all at thebeginning of the system design; thus inevitably will see the performance goes down whenuser requirements change. In this paper; we propose a new paradigm; Data Vitalization; forlarge-scale dataset analysis. Our goal is to enable high flexibility such that the system isadaptive to complex analytical applications. Specifically; data are organized into a group ofvitalized cells; each of which is a collection of data coupled with computing power. As userrequirements change over time; cells evolve spontaneously to meet the potential new queryloads. Besides basic functionality of Data Vitalization; we also explore an envisioned …,Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS); 2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2010,21,21
Monitoring near duplicates over video streams,Xiangmin Zhou; Lei Chen,Abstract Since near duplicates are ubiquitous over different data sources; increasingresearch efforts have been put to near duplicate detection recently. Among all the nearduplicate detection tasks; an important one is continuous near duplicate monitoring overvideo streams. Existing video monitoring techniques are not effective for handling thevariations that commonly exist among near duplicates. Moreover; approaches proposed forthe near duplicate detection in archived video databases are inefficient when applied to highspeed video streams. In this work; we propose a framework for effectively online monitoringnear duplicates over video streams. Specifically; we first propose a novel representation; avideo cuboid signature; to describe a video segment. To capture the local spatio-temporalinformation of video subclips; we employ the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to measure …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM international conference on multimedia,2010,21,12
Consistent query answers in inconsistent probabilistic databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Shaoxu Song,Abstract Efficient and effective manipulation of probabilistic data has become increasinglyimportant recently due to many real applications that involve the data uncertainty. This isespecially crucial when probabilistic data collected from different sources disagree witheach other and incur inconsistencies. In order to accommodate such inconsistencies andenable consistent query answering (CQA); in this paper; we propose the all-possible-repairsemantics in the context of inconsistent probabilistic databases; which formalize the repairson the database as repair worlds via a graph representation. In turn; the CQA problem canbe converted into one in the so-called repaired possible worlds (wrt both repair worlds andpossible worlds). We investigate a series of consistent queries in inconsistent probabilisticdatabases; including consistent range queries; join; and top-k queries; which; however …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,21,19
Heterogeneous environment aware streaming graph partitioning,Ning Xu; Bin Cui; Lei Chen; Zi Huang; Yingxia Shao,With the increasing availability of graph data and widely adopted cloud computingparadigm; graph partitioning has become an efficient pre-processing technique to balancethe computing workload and cope with the large scale of input data. Since the cost ofpartitioning the entire graph is strictly prohibitive; there are some recent tentative workstowards streaming graph partitioning which run faster; are easily parallelized; and can beincrementally updated. Most of the existing works on streaming partitioning assume thatworker nodes within a cluster are homogeneous in nature. Unfortunately; this assumptiondoes not always hold. Experiments show that these homogeneous algorithms suffer asignificant performance degradation when running at heterogeneous environment. In thispaper; we propose a novel adaptive streaming graph partitioning approach to cope with …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,20,12
Cleaning uncertain data with a noisy crowd,Chen Jason Zhang; Lei Chen; Yongxin Tong; Zheng Liu,Uncertain data has been emerged as an important problem in database systems due to theimprecise nature of many applications. To handle the uncertainty; probabilistic databasescan be used to store uncertain data; and querying facilities are provided to yield answerswith confidence. However; the uncertainty may propagate; hence the returned results from aquery or mining process may not be useful. In this paper; we leverage the power ofcrowdsourcing for cleaning uncertain data. Specifically; we will design a set of HumanIntelligence Tasks (HIT) s to ask a crowd to improve the quality of uncertain data. Each HIT isassociated with a cost; thus; we need to design solutions to maximize the data quality withminimal number of HITs. There are two obstacles for this non-trivial optimization-first; thecrowd has a probability to return incorrect answers; second; the HITs decomposed from …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,20,12
A generic framework for handling uncertain data with local correlations,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Data uncertainty is ubiquitous in many real-world applications such as sensor/RFIDdata analysis. In this paper; we investigate uncertain data that exhibit local correlations; thatis; each uncertain object is only locally correlated with a small subset of data; while beingindependent of others. We propose a generic framework for dealing with this kind ofuncertain and locally correlated data; in which we investigate a classical spatial query;nearest neighbor query; on uncertain data with local correlations (namely LC-PNN). Mostimportantly; to enable fast LC-PNN query processing; we propose a novel filtering techniquevia offline pre-computations to reduce the query search space. We demonstrate throughextensive experiments the efficiency and effectiveness of our approaches.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,20,21
Detecting leaders from correlated time series,Di Wu; Yiping Ke; Jeffrey Xu Yu; S Yu Philip; Lei Chen,Abstract Analyzing the relationships of time series is an important problem for manyapplications; including climate monitoring; stock investment; traffic control; etc. Existingresearch mainly focuses on studying the relationship between a pair of time series. In thispaper; we study the problem of discovering leaders among a set of time series by analyzinglead-lag relations. A time series is considered to be one of the leaders if its rise or fallimpacts the behavior of many other time series. At each time point; we compute the laggedcorrelation between each pair of time series and model them in a graph. Then; theleadership rank is computed from the graph; which brings order to time series. Based on theleadership ranking; the leaders of time series are extracted. However; the problem posesgreat challenges as time goes by; since the dynamic nature of time series results in highly …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,20,21
Toward efficient filter privacy-aware content-based pub/sub systems,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Sasu Tarkoma,In recent years; the content-based publish/subscribe [12];[22] has become a popularparadigm to decouple information producers and consumers with the help of brokers.Unfortunately; when users register their personal interests to the brokers; the privacypertaining to filters defined by honest subscribers could be easily exposed by untrustedbrokers; and this situation is further aggravated by the collusion attack between untrustedbrokers and compromised subscribers. To protect the filter privacy; we introduce ananonymizer engine to separate the roles of brokers into two parts; and adapt the k-anonymity and-diversity models to the contentbased pub/sub. When the anonymizationmodel is applied to protect the filter privacy; there is an inherent tradeoff between theanonymization level and the publication redundancy. By leveraging partial-order-based …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,19,10
STAIRS: Towards efficient full-text filtering and dissemination in DHT environments,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Nowadays" live" content; such as weblog; wikipedia; and news; is ubiquitous in theInternet. Providing users with relevant content in a timely manner becomes a challengingproblem. Differing from Web search technologies and RSS feeds/reader applications; thispaper envisions a personalized full-text content filtering and dissemination system in ahighly distributed environment such as a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Network. Users subscribe to their interested content by specifying input keywords andthresholds as filters. Then; content is disseminated to those users having interest in it. In theliterature; full-text document publishing in DHTs has suffered for a long time from the highcost of forwarding a document to home nodes of all distinct terms. It is aggravated by the factthat a document contains a large number of distinct terms (typically tens or thousands of …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,19,12
Answering label-constraint reachability in large graphs,Kun Xu; Lei Zou; Jeffery Xu Yu; Lei Chen; Yanghua Xiao; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we study a variant of reachability queries; called label-constraintreachability (LCR) queries; specifically; given a label set S and two vertices u1 and u2 in alarge directed graph G; we verify whether there exists a path from u1 to u2 under labelconstraint S. Like traditional reachability queries; LCR queries are very useful; such aspathway finding in biological networks; inferring over RDF (resource description f ramework)graphs; relationship finding in social networks. However; LCR queries are much morecomplicated than their traditional counterpart. Several techniques are proposed in this paperto minimize the search space in computing path-label transitive closure. Furthermore; wedemonstrate the superiority of our method by extensive experiments.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,19,12
Local summarization and multi-level LSH for retrieving multi-variant audio tracks,Yi Yu; Michel Crucianu; Vincent Oria; Lei Chen,Abstract In this paper we study the problem of detecting and grouping multi-variant audiotracks in large audio datasets. To address this issue; a fast and reliable retrieval method isnecessary. But reliability requires elaborate representations of audio content; whichchallenges fast retrieval by similarity from a large audio database. To find a better tradeoffbetween retrieval quality and efficiency; we put forward an approach relying on localsummarization and multi-level Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). More precisely; each audiotrack is divided into multiple Continuously Correlated Periods (CCP) of variable lengthaccording to spectral similarity. The description for each CCP is calculated based on itsWeighted Mean Chroma (WMC). A track is thus represented as a sequence of WMCs. Then;an adapted two-level LSH is employed for efficiently delineating a narrow relevant search …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2009,19,1
Flexible routing in grouped DHTs,Yiming Zhang; Dongsheng Li; Lei Chen; Xicheng Lu,In most DHTs proposed so far; all nodes areassumed to be homogeneous; and allmessages are routed using a common algorithm. In practice; however; nodes in large-scalesystems might be heterogeneous with respect to their capabilities; reputations; affiliations ofadministrative domains; and so on; which consequently makes it preferable to distinguishthe heterogeneity of participant nodes. To achieve this; in this paper we present GroupedTapestry (GTap); a novel Tapestry-based DHT that supports organizing nodes into groupsand allows flexible DHT routing. The effectiveness of our proposals is demonstrated throughtheoretical analysis and extensive simulations.,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2008. P2P'08. Eighth International Conference on,2008,19,12
Hear the whole story: Towards the diversity of opinion in crowdsourcing markets,Ting Wu; Lei Chen; Pan Hui; Chen Jason Zhang; Weikai Li,Abstract The recent surge in popularity of crowdsourcing has brought with it a newopportunity for engaging human intelligence in the process of data analysis. Crowdsourcingprovides a fundamental mechanism for enabling online workers to participate in tasks thatare either too difficult to be solved solely by a computer or too expensive to employ expertsto perform. In the field of social science; four elements are required to form a wise crowd-Diversity of Opinion; Independence; Decentralization and Aggregation. However; while theother three elements are already studied and implemented in current crowdsourcingplatforms; the'Diversity of Opinion'has not been functionally enabled. In this paper; weaddress the algorithmic optimizations towards the diversity of opinion of crowdsourcingmarketplaces. From a computational perspective; in order to build a wise crowd; we need …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,18,18
Efficient discovery of similarity constraints for matching dependencies,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen,Abstract The concept of matching dependencies (md s) has recently been proposed forspecifying matching rules for object identification. Similar to the functional dependencies(with conditions); md s can also be applied to various data quality applications such asdetecting the violations of integrity constraints. In this paper; we study the problem ofdiscovering similarity constraints for matching dependencies from a given databaseinstance. First; we introduce the measures; support and confidence; for evaluating the utilityof md s in the given data. Then; we study the discovery of md s with certain utilityrequirements of support and confidence. Exact algorithms are developed; together withpruning strategies to improve the time performance. Since the exact algorithm has totraverse all the data during the computation; we propose an approximate solution which …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2013,18,12
Optimizing multi-top-k queries over uncertain data streams,Tao Chen; Lei Chen; M Tamer Oezsu; Nong Xiao,Query processing over uncertain data streams; in particular top-κ query processing; hasbecome increasingly important due to its wide application in many fields such as sensornetwork monitoring and internet traffic control. In many real applications; multiple top-κqueries are registered in the system. Sharing the results of these queries is a key factor insaving the computation cost and providing real-time response. However; due to the complexsemantics of uncertain top-κ query processing; it is nontrivial to implement sharing amongdifferent top-κ queries and few works have addressed the sharing issue. In this paper; weformulate various types of sharing among multiple top-κ queries over uncertain data streamsbased on the frequency upper bound of each top-κ query.

Interval reverse nearest neighbor queries on uncertain data with markov correlations,Chuanfei Xu; Yu Gu; Lei Chen; Jianzhong Qiao; Ge Yu,Nowadays; many applications return to the user a set of results that take the query as theirnearest neighbor; which are commonly expressed through reverse nearest neighbor (RNN)queries. When considering moving objects; users would like to find objects that appear inthe RNN result set for a period of time in some real-world applications such as collaborationrecommendation and anti-tracking. In this work; we formally define the problem of intervalreverse nearest neighbor (IRNN) queries over moving objects; which return the objects thatmaintain nearest neighboring relations to the moving query objects for the longest time inthe given interval. Location uncertainty of moving data objects and moving query objects isinherent in various domains; and we investigate objects that exhibit Markov correlations; thatis; each object's location is only correlated with its own location at previous timestamp …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,18,12
Tracking frequent items over distributed probabilistic data,Yongxin Tong; Xiaofei Zhang; Lei Chen,Abstract Tracking frequent items (also called heavy hitters) is one of the most fundamentalqueries in real-time data due to its wide applications; such as logistics monitoring;association rule based analysis; etc. Recently; with the growing popularity of Internet ofThings (IoT) and pervasive computing; a large amount of real-time data is usually collectedfrom multiple sources in a distributed environment. Unfortunately; data collected from eachsource is often uncertain due to various factors: imprecise reading; data integration frommultiple sources (or versions); transmission errors; etc. In addition; due to network delay andlimited by the economic budget associated with large-scale data communication over adistributed network; an essential problem is to track the global frequent items from alldistributed uncertain data sites with the minimum communication cost.

Shooting top-k stars in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Query processing in the uncertain database has played an important role in manyreal-world applications due to the wide existence of uncertain data. Although many previoustechniques can correctly handle precise data; they are not directly applicable to theuncertain scenario. In this article; we investigate and propose a novel query; namelyprobabilistic top-k star (PTkS) query; which aims to retrieve k objects in an uncertaindatabase that are" closest" to a static/dynamic query point; considering both distance andprobability aspects. In order to efficiently answer PTkS queries with a static/moving querypoint; we propose effective pruning methods to reduce the PTkS search space; which can beseamlessly integrated into an efficient query procedure.

Ufimt: an uncertain frequent itemset mining toolbox,Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Philip S Yu,Abstract In recent years; mining frequent itemsets over uncertain data has attracted muchattention in the data mining community. Unlike the corresponding problem in deterministicdata; the frequent itemset under uncertain data has two different definitions: the expectedsupport-based frequent itemset and the probabilistic frequent itemset. Most existing worksonly focus on one of the definitions and no comprehensive study is conducted to comparethe two different definitions. Moreover; due to lacking the uniform implementation platform;existing solutions for the same definition even generate inconsistent results. In this demo; wepresent a demonstration called as UFIMT (underline Uncertain Frequent Itemset MiningToolbox) which not only discovers frequent itemsets over uncertain data but also comparesthe performance of different algorithms and demonstrates the relationship between …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,16,12
Structure tensor series-based large scale near-duplicate video retrieval,Xiangmin Zhou; Lei Chen; Xiaofang Zhou,With the huge amount of video data and its exponential growth in recent years; many newchallenges; like storage; search and navigation; have arisen. Among these challenges; near-duplicate video retrieval aims to find clips that are identical or nearly identical in content to aquery clip. This has attracted much attention due to its wide applications including copyrightdetection; commercial monitoring and news video tracking. In this paper; we propose apractical solution based on 3-D structure tensor model for this problem. We first propose anovel video representation; adaptive structure video tensor series; together with a robustsimilarity measure; to improve the retrieval effectiveness. Then; we design a dimensionalityreduction technique for tensor series to improve the search efficiency.

In this paper; we study theproblem of ranking evolving time series and discovering leaders from them by analyzinglead-lag relations. A time series is considered to be one of the leaders if its rise or fallimpacts the behavior of many other time series. At each time point; we compute the laggedcorrelation between each pair of time series and model them in a graph.

Ranked query processing in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Recently; many new applications; such as sensor data monitoring and mobile devicetracking; raise up the issue of uncertain data management. Compared to" certain¿ data; thedata in the uncertain database are not exact points; which; instead; often reside within aregion. In this paper; we study the ranked queries over uncertain data. In fact; rankedqueries have been studied extensively in traditional database literature due to theirpopularity in many applications; such as decision making; recommendation raising; anddata mining tasks. Many proposals have been made in order to improve the efficiency inanswering ranked queries. However; the existing approaches are all based on theassumption that the underlying data are exact (or certain). Due to the intrinsic differencesbetween uncertain and certain data; these methods are designed only for ranked queries …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2010,16,19

Indexing high-dimensional data in dual distance spaces: a symmetrical encoding approach,Yi Zhuang; Yueting Zhuang; Qing Li; Lei Chen; Yi Yu,Abstract Due to the well-known dimensionality curse problem; search in a high-dimensionalspace is considered as a" hard" problem. In this paper; a novel symmetrical encoding-basedindex structure; which is called EHD-Tree (for symmetrical Encoding-based Hybrid DistanceTree); is proposed to support fast k-Nearest-Neighbor (k-NN) search in high-dimensionalspaces. In an EHD-Tree; all data points are first grouped into clusters by a k-Meansclustering algorithm. Then the uniform ID number of each data point is obtained by a dual-distance-driven encoding scheme in which each cluster sphere is partitioned twiceaccording to the dual distances of start-and centroid-distance. Finally; the uniform ID numberand the centroid-distance of each data point are combined to get a uniform index key; thelatter is then indexed through a partition-based B+-tree. Thus; given a query point; its k …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,16,10
Similarity search over time series and trajectory data,Lei Chen,Abstract Time series data have been used in many applications; such as financial dataanalysis and weather forecasting. Similarly; trajectories of moving objects are often used toperform movement pattern analysis in surveillance video and sensor monitoring systems. Allthese applications are closely related to similarity-based time series or trajectory dataretrieval. In this dissertation; various similarity models are proposed to capture thesimilarities among time series and trajectory data under various circumstances andrequirements; such as the appearance of noise and local time shifting. A novelrepresentation; called multiscale time series histograms; is proposed to answer patternexistence queries and shape match queries. Earlier proposals generally address one or theother; multi-scale time series histograms can answer both types; which offers users more …,*,2005,16,3
Top-k team recommendation in spatial crowdsourcing,Dawei Gao; Yongxin Tong; Jieying She; Tianshu Song; Lei Chen; Ke Xu,Abstract With the rapid development of Mobile Internet and Online To Offline (O2O)marketing model; various spatial crowdsourcing platforms; such as Gigwalk and Gmission;are getting popular. Most existing studies assume that spatial crowdsourced tasks aresimple and trivial. However; many real crowdsourced tasks are complex and need to becollaboratively finished by a team of crowd workers with different skills. Therefore; animportant issue of spatial crowdsourcing platforms is to recommend some suitable teams ofcrowd workers to satisfy the requirements of skills in a task. In this paper; to address theissue; we first propose a more practical problem; called Top-k\; T eam\; R ecommendation\;in\; spatial\; crowdsourcing (Top k TR) problem.

Answering why-not spatial keyword top-k queries via keyword adaption,Lei Chen; Jianliang Xu; Xin Lin; Christian S Jensen; Haibo Hu,Web objects; often associated with descriptive text documents; are increasingly being geo-tagged. A spatial keyword top-k query retrieves the best k such objects according to ascoring function that considers both spatial distance and textual similarity. However; it is insome cases difficult for users to identify the exact keywords that describe their query intent.After a user issues an initial query and gets back the result; the user may find that someexpected objects are missing and may wonder why. Answering the resulting why-notquestions can aid users in retrieving better results. However; no existing techniques are ableto answer why-not questions by adapting the query keywords. We propose techniquescapable of adapting an initial set of query keywords so that expected; but missing; objectsenter the result along with other relevant objects.

An efficient similarity search framework for simrank over large dynamic graphs,Yingxia Shao; Bin Cui; Lei Chen; Mingming Liu; Xing Xie,Abstract SimRank is an important measure of vertex-pair similarity according to the structureof graphs. The similarity search based on SimRank is an important operation for identifyingsimilar vertices in a graph and has been employed in many data analysis applications.Nowadays; graphs in the real world become much larger and more dynamic. The existingsolutions for similarity search are expensive in terms of time and space cost. None of themcan efficiently support similarity search over large dynamic graphs. In this paper; we proposea novel two-stage random-walk sampling framework (TSF) for SimRank-based similaritysearch (eg; top-k search). In the preprocessing stage; TSF samples a set of one-way graphsto index raw random walks in a novel manner within O (NR g) time and space; where N isthe number of vertices and R g is the number of one-way graphs.

Where to: Crowd-aided path selection,Chen Jason Zhang; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen,Abstract With the widespread use of geo-positioning services (GPS); GPS-based navigationsystems have become ever more of an integral part of our daily lives. GPS-based navigationsystems usually suggest multiple paths for any given pair of source and target; leaving usersperplexed when trying to select the best one among them; namely the problem of best pathselection. Too many suggested paths may jeopardize the usability of the recommendationdata; and decrease user satisfaction. Although existing studies have already partiallyrelieved this problem through integrating historical traffic logs or updating traffic conditionsperiodically; their solutions neglect the potential contribution of human experience. In thispaper; we resort to crowdsourcing to ease the pain of the best path selection. The first step ofappropriately using the crowd is to ask proper questions. For the best path selection …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,15,4
Towards effective and efficient mining of arbitrary shaped clusters,Hao Huang; Yunjun Gao; Kevin Chiew; Lei Chen; Qinming He,Mining arbitrary shaped clusters in large data sets is an open challenge in data mining.Various approaches to this problem have been proposed with high time complexity. To savecomputational cost; some algorithms try to shrink a data set size to a smaller amount ofrepresentative data examples. However; their user-defined shrinking ratios may significantlyaffect the clustering performance. In this paper; we present CLASP an effective and efficientalgorithm for mining arbitrary shaped clusters. It automatically shrinks the size of a data setwhile effectively preserving the shape information of clusters in the data set withrepresentative data examples. Then; it adjusts the positions of these representative dataexamples to enhance their intrinsic relationship and make the cluster structures more clearand distinct for clustering.

Different fromhandling precise data; the uncertain query processing needs to consider the datauncertainty and answer queries with confidence guarantees. In this paper; we formulate andtackle an important query; namely probabilistic inverse ranking (PIR) query; which retrievespossible ranks of a given query object in an uncertain database with confidence above aprobability threshold. We present effective pruning methods to reduce the PIR search space;which can be seamlessly integrated into an efficient query procedure. Moreover; we tacklethe problem of PIR query processing in high dimensional spaces; which reduces highdimensional uncertain data to a lower dimensional space.

Enabling routing control in a DHT,Yiming Zhang; Lei Chen; Xicheng Lu; Dongsheng Li,DHTs are scalable; self-organizing; and adaptive to underlying topology changes; thusbeing a promising infrastructure for realizing autonomic communications in distributedsystems. To provide the above advantages; however; DHTs sacrifice flexibility; that is; allmessages are routed by using a common algorithm in a DHT on the assumption that allparticipant nodes are homogeneous. In practice; nodes in large-scale systems might beheterogeneous with respect to their capabilities; reputations; affiliations of administrativedomains; and so on; which consequently makes it preferable to distinguish theheterogeneity of participant nodes and enable flexible control of routing destinations andpaths. To achieve this; in this paper we propose a novel approach that supports organizingnodes into groups and enables routing control in a DHT.

Summarization graph indexing: beyond frequent structure-based approach,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Huaming Zhang; Yansheng Lu; Qiang Lou,Abstract Graph is an important data structure to model complex structural data; such aschemical compounds; proteins; and XML documents. Among many graph data-basedapplications; sub-graph search is a key problem; which is defined as given a query Q;retrieving all graphs containing Q as a sub-graph in the graph database. Most existing sub-graph search methods try to filter out false positives (graphs that are not possible in theresults) as many as possible by indexing some frequent sub-structures in graph database;such as [20; 22; 4; 23]. However; due to ignoring the relationships between sub-structures;these methods still admit a high percentage of false positives. In this paper; we propose anovel concept; Summarization Graph; which is a complete graph and captures mosttopology information of the original graph; such as sub-structures and their relationships …,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on Database systems for advanced applications,2008,15,4
Similarity-based retrieval of time-series data using multi-scale histograms,Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract Queries for similarity-based time series data retrieval can be categorized into twotypes:(1) pattern existence queries; and (2) exact match queries. Pattern existence queriesfind the time series data with certain patterns while exact match queries search over the timeseries data by specifying exact values and detailed temporal information. In this paper; wepropose multi-scale time series histograms that can be used to answer both types of queries;thus offering users more flexibility. The experimental results show that multi-scalehistograms can effectively find the patterns in time series data as well as answer exact matchqueries; even when the data contain noise; local time shifting; local time scaling; amplitudeshifting and amplitude scaling.,Computer sciences technical report; CS-2003-31; University of Waterloo; Waterloo,2003,15,10
Efficient processing of probabilistic group subspace skyline queries in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Due to the pervasive data uncertainty in many real applications; efficient andeffective query answering on uncertain data has recently gained much attention from thedatabase community. In this paper; we propose a novel and important query in the context ofuncertain databases; namely probabilistic group subspace skyline (PGSS) query; which isuseful in applications like sensor data analysis. Specifically; a PGSS query retrieves thoseuncertain objects that are; with high confidence; not dynamically dominated by other objects;with respect to a group of query points in ad-hoc subspaces. In order to enable fast PGSSquery answering; we propose effective pruning methods to reduce the PGSS search space;which are seamlessly integrated into an efficient PGSS query procedure.

In this paper; we study a new problem: distributed data sharing with privacy-preserving requirements. Given a data demander requesting data from multiple distributeddata providers; the objective is to enable the data demander to access the distributed datawithout knowing the privacy of any individual provider. The problem is challenged by twoquestions: how to transmit the data safely and accurately; and how to efficiently handle datastreams? As the first study; we propose a practical method; Shadow Coding; to preserve theprivacy in data transmission and ensure the recovery in data collection; which achievesprivacy preserving computation in a data-recoverable; efficient; and scalable way. We alsoprovide practical techniques to make Shadow Coding efficient and safe in data streams …,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,2015,13,6
Generic composite counting in RFID systems,Haoxiang Liu; Wei Gong; Lei Chen; Wenbo He; Kebin Liu; Yunhao Liu,Counting the number of RFID tags is a fundamental issue and has a wide range ofapplications in RFID systems. Most existing protocols; however; only apply to the scenariowhere a single reader counts the number of tags covered by its radio; or at most the union oftags covered by multiple readers. They are unable to achieve more complex countingobjectives; ie; counting the number of tags in a composite set expression such as (S_1 bigcup S_2)-(S_3 big cap S_4). This type of counting has realistic significance since it providesmore diversity than existing counting scenario; and can be applied in various applications. Inthis paper; we formally introduce the RFID composite counting problem; which aims atcounting the tags in arbitrary set expression. We obtain strong lower bounds on thecommunication cost of composite counting. We then propose a generic Composite …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2014 IEEE 34th International Conference on,2014,13,18
Distributed incomplete pattern matching via a novel weighted bloom filter,Siyuan Liu; Lei Kang; Lei Chen; Lionel Ni,In this paper; we first propose a very interesting and practical problem; pattern matching in adistributed mobile environment. Pattern matching is a well-known problem and extensiveresearch has been conducted for performing effective and efficient search. However;previous proposed approaches assume that data are centrally stored; which is not the casein a mobile environment (eg; mobile phone networks); where one person's pattern could beseparately stored in a number of different stations; and such a local pattern is incompletecompared with the global pattern. A simple solution to pattern matching over a mobileenvironment is to collect all the data distributed in base stations to a data center and conductpattern matching at the data center afterwards. Clearly; such a simple solution will raisehuge amount of communication traffic; which could cause the communication bottleneck …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2012 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2012,13,18
Node protection in weighted social networks,Mingxuan Yuan; Lei Chen,Abstract Weighted social network has a broad usage in the data mining fields; such ascollaborative filtering; influence analysis; phone log analysis; etc. However; current privacymodels which prevent node re-identification for the social network only dealt withunweighted graphs. In this paper; we make use of the special characteristic of edge weightsto define a novel k-weighted-degree anonymous model. While keeping the weight utilities;this model helps prevent node re-identification in the weighted graph based on threedistance functions which measure the nodes' difference. We also design correspondingalgorithms for each distance to achieve anonymity.

Efficient cohesive subgraphs detection in parallel,Yingxia Shao; Lei Chen; Bin Cui,Abstract A cohesive subgraph is a primary vehicle for massive graph analysis; and a newlyintroduced cohesive subgraph; k-truss; which is motivated by a natural observation of socialcohesion; has attracted more and more attention. However; the existing parallel solutions toidentify the k-truss are inefficient for very large graphs; as they still suffer from hugecommunication cost and large number of iterations during the computation. In this paper; wepropose a novel parallel and efficient truss detection algorithm; called PeTa. The PeTaproduces a triangle complete subgraph (TC-subgraph) for every computing node. Based onthe TC-subgraphs; PeTa can detect the local k-truss in parallel within a few iterations. Wetheoretically prove; within this new paradigm; the communication cost of PeTa is bounded bythree times of the number of triangles; the total computation complexity of PeTa is the …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,12,12
KLEAP: an efficient cleaning method to remove cross-reads in RFID streams,Guoqiong Liao; Jing Li; Lei Chen; Changxuan Wan,Abstract Recently; the RFID technology has been widely used in many kinds of applications.However; because of the interference from environmental factors and limitations of the radiofrequency technology; the data streams collected by the RFID readers are usually contain alot of cross-reads. To address this issue; we propose a KerneL dEnsity-bAsed Probabilitycleaning method (KLEAP) to remove cross-reads within a sliding window. The methodestimates the density of each tag using a kernel-based function. The reader correspondingto the micro-cluster with the largest density will be regarded as the position that the taggedobject should locate in current window; and the readings derived from other readers will betreated as the cross-reads. Experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of theproposed method.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,12,5
On data dependencies in dataspaces,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; S Yu Philip,To study data dependencies over heterogeneous data in dataspaces; we define a generaldependency form; namely comparable dependencies (CDs); which specifies constraints oncomparable attributes. It covers the semantics of a broad class of dependencies indatabases; including functional dependencies (FDs); metric functional dependencies(MFDs); and matching dependencies (MDs). As we illustrated; comparable dependenciesare useful in real practice of dataspaces; eg; semantic query optimization. Due to theheterogeneous data in dataspaces; the first question; known as the validation problem; is todetermine whether a dependency (almost) holds in a data instance. Unfortunately; as weproved; the validation problem with certain error or confidence guarantee is generally hard.In fact; the confidence validation problem is also NP-hard to approximate to within any …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,12,10
Automatically weighting tags in XML collection,Dexi Liu; Changxuan Wan; Lei Chen; Xiping Liu,Abstract In XML retrieval; nodes with different tags play different roles in XML documentsand then tags should be reflected in the relevance ranking. An automatic method isproposed in this paper to infer the weights of tags. We first investigate 15 features abouttags; and then select five of them based on the correlations between these features andmanual tag weights. Using these features; a tag weight assignment model; ATG; isdesigned. We evaluate the performance of ATG on two real data sets; IEEECS andWikipedia from two different perspectives. One is to evaluate the quality of the model bymeasuring the correlation between weights generated by our model and those given byexperts. The other is to test the effectiveness of the model in improving retrievalperformance. Experimental results show that the tag weights generated by ATG are highly …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,12,5
Effective XML content and structure retrieval with relevance ranking,Xiping Liu; Changxuan Wan; Lei Chen,Abstract XML documents can be retrieved by means of not only content-only (CO) queries;but also content-and-structure (CAS) queries. Though promising better retrieval precision;CAS queries introduce several new challenges. To address these challenges; we propose anovel approach for XML CAS retrieval. The distinctive feature of the approach is that itadopts a content-oriented point of view. Specifically; the approach first decomposes a CASquery into several fragments; then retrieves results for each query fragment in a content-centric way; and finally scores each answer node. The approach is adaptive to versatilehomogeneous and heterogeneous data environments. To assess the relevance of retrievalresults to a query fragment; we present a scoring strategy that measures relevance from bothcontent and structure perspectives. In addition; an effective approach is proposed to infer …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,12,12
High‐sensitivity CRP: Possible link between job stress and atherosclerosis,Weixian Xu; Baoxia Chen; Lijun Guo; Zhaoping Li; Yiming Zhao; Hui Zeng,Background Chronic inflammation may play an important role in linking job stress toatherosclerosis. We sought to investigate the relationship between job stress and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) among Chinese workers. Methods A total of 731subjects (506 men and 225 women) were analyzed. Job stress was evaluated by effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model.

Mining frequent itemsets in correlated uncertain databases,Yong-Xin Tong; Lei Chen; Jieying She,Abstract Recently; with the growing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and pervasivecomputing; a large amount of uncertain data; eg; RFID data; sensor data; real-time videodata; has been collected. As one of the most fundamental issues of uncertain data mining;uncertain frequent pattern mining has attracted much attention in database and data miningcommunities. Although there have been some solutions for uncertain frequent patternmining; most of them assume that the data is independent; which is not true in most real-world scenarios. Therefore; current methods that are based on the independent assumptionmay generate inaccurate results for correlated uncertain data. In this paper; we focus on theproblem of mining frequent itemsets over correlated uncertain data; where correlation canexist in any pair of uncertain data objects (transactions). We propose a novel probabilistic …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2015,11,12
CrowdMatcher: crowd-assisted schema matching,Chen Jason Zhang; Ziyuan Zhao; Lei Chen; Hosagrahar Visvesvaraya Jagadish; Chen Caleb Cao,Abstract Schema matching is a central challenge for data integration systems. Due to theinherent uncertainty arose from the inability of schema in fully capturing the semantics of therepresented data; automatic tools are often uncertain about suggested matching results.However; human is good at understanding data represented in various forms andcrowdsourcing platforms are making the human annotation process more affordable. Thus inthis demo; we will show how to utilize the crowd to find the right matching. In order to do that;we need to make the tasks posted on the crowdsouricng platforms extremely simple; to beperformed by non-expert people; and reduce the number of tasks as less as possible to savethe cost. We demonstrate CrowdMatcher; a hybrid machine-crowd system for schemamatching. The machine-generated matchings are verified by correspondence correctness …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,11,12
Exploiting structures in keyword queries for effective XML search,Xiping Liu; Lei Chen; Changxuan Wan; Dexi Liu; Naixue Xiong,Abstract Keyword search on XML documents has received considerable research interestsrecently. Most existing methods put their emphases on the document side; and focus on howto utilize structural properties of XML documents to produce better search results; moreeffective ranking methods; or more efficient algorithms. However; effective XML searchrequires a full understanding of not only XML documents but also XML keyword queries;whereas little attention has been paid to the latter. In this paper; we focus on the query sideof XML keyword search instead of the document side. We show that keyword queries havestructures; and define a concept called keyword query with structure (QWS) to capture querystructure. As query structure provides hints about the intent of the query; it can be used toimprove the quality of the search results. We exploit some key observations to …,Information Sciences,2013,11,12

Multi-version music search using acoustic feature union and exact soft mapping,Yi Yu; Kazuki Joe; Vincent Oria; Fabian Moerchen; J Stephen Downie; Lei Chen,Research on audio-based music retrieval has primarily concentrated on refining audiofeatures to improve search quality. However; much less work has been done on improvingthe time efficiency of music audio searches. Representing music audio documents in anindexable format provides a mechanism for achieving efficiency. To address this issue; inthis work Exact Locality Sensitive Mapping (ELSM) is suggested to join the concatenatedfeature sets and soft hash values. On this basis we propose audio-based music indexingtechniques; ELSM and Soft Locality Sensitive Hash (SoftLSH) using an optimized FeatureUnion (FU) set of extracted audio features. Two contributions are made here. First; theprinciple of similarity-invariance is applied in summarizing audio feature sequences andutilized in training semantic audio representations based on regression.

SenCast: Scalable multicast in wireless sensor networks,Shaoliang Peng; Shanshan Li; Lei Chen; Nong Xiao; Yuxing Peng,Multicast is essential for wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. Existing multicastprotocols in WSNs are often designed in a P2P pattern; assuming small number ofdestination nodes and frequent changes on network topologies. In order to truly adoptmulticast in WSNs; we propose a base-station model-based multicast; SenCast; to meet thegeneral requirements of applications. SenCast is scalable and energy-efficient for largegroup communications in WSNs. Theoretical analysis shows that SenCast is able toapproximate the Minimum Nonleaf Nodes (MNN) problem to a ratio of ln| R|(R is the set of alldestinations); best known lowest bound. We evaluate our design through comprehensivesimulations. Experimental results demonstrate that SenCast outperforms previous multicastprotocols including the most recent work uCast.,Parallel and Distributed Processing; 2008. IPDPS 2008.

MINDEX: An efficient index structure for salient-object-based queries in video databases,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract. Several salient-object-based data models have been proposed to model videodata. However; none of them addresses the development of an index structure to efficientlyhandle salient-object-based queries. There are several indexing schemes that have beenproposed for spatiotemporal relationships among objects; and they are used to optimizetimestamp and interval queries; which are rarely used in video databases. Moreover; theseindex structures are designed without consideration of the granularity levels of constraintson salient objects and the characteristics of video data. In this paper; we propose amultilevel index structure (MINDEX) to efficiently handle the salient-object-based querieswith different levels of constraints. We present experimental results showing theperformance of different methods of MINDEX construction.,Multimedia Systems,2004,11,21
Towards better understanding of app functions,Yong-Xin Tong; Jieying She; Lei Chen,Abstract Apps are attracting more and more attention from both mobile and web platforms.Due to the self-organized nature of the current app marketplaces; the descriptions of appsare not formally written and contain a lot of noisy words and sentences. Thus; for most of theapps; the functions of them are not well documented and thus cannot be captured by appsearch engines easily. In this paper; we study the problem of inferring the real functions ofan app by identifying the most informative words in its description. In order to utilize andintegrate the diverse information of the app corpus in a proper way; we propose aprobabilistic topic model to discover the latent data structure of the app corpus. The outputsof the topic model are further used to identify the function of an app and its most informativewords. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods through extensive …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2015,10,20
Efficient processing of label-constraint reachability queries in large graphs,Lei Zou; Kun Xu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lei Chen; Yanghua Xiao; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we study a variant of reachability queries; called label-constraintreachability (LCR) queries. Specifically; given a label set S and two vertices u 1 and u 2 in alarge directed graph G; we check the existence of a directed path from u 1 to u 2; whereedge labels along the path are a subset of S. We propose the path-label transitive closuremethod to answer LCR queries. Specifically; we t4ransform an edge-labeled directed graphinto an augmented DAG by replacing the maximal strongly connected components asbipartite graphs. We also propose a Dijkstra-like algorithm to compute path-label transitiveclosure by re-defining the “distance” of a path. Comparing with the existing solutions; weprove that our method is optimal in terms of the search space. Furthermore; we propose asimple yet effective partition-based framework (local path-label transitive closure+ online …,Information Systems,2014,10,21
Efficient join processing on uncertain data streams,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Join processing in the streaming environment has many practical applications suchas data cleaning and outlier detection. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the real-world data;it has become an increasingly important problem to consider the join processing onuncertain data streams; where the incoming data at each timestamp are uncertain andimprecise. Different from the static databases; processing uncertain data streams has its ownrequirements such as the limited memory; small response time; and so on. To tackle thechallenges with respect to efficiency and effectiveness; in this paper; we formalize theproblem of join on uncertain data streams (USJ); which can guarantee the accuracy of USJanswers over uncertain data; and propose effective pruning methods to filter out falsealarms. We integrate the pruning methods into an efficient query procedure for …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,10,2
Energy-efficient evaluation of multiple skyline queries over a wireless sensor network,Junchang Xin; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Vincent Oria,Abstract Though skyline queries in wireless sensor networks have been intensively studiedin recent years; existing solutions are not optimized for multiple skyline queries as they focuson single full space skyline queries. It is not efficient to individually evaluate skyline queriesespecially in a wireless sensor network environment where power consumption should beminimized. In this paper; we propose an energy-efficient multi-skyline evaluation (EMSE)algorithm to effectively evaluate multiple skyline queries in wireless sensor networks. EMSEfirst utilizes a global optimization mechanism to reduce the number of skyline queries andsave on query propagation cost and parts of redundant result transmission cost as aconsequence. Then; it utilizes a local optimization mechanism to share the skyline resultsamong skyline queries and uses some filtering policies to further eliminate unnecessary …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,10,21
Distr: a distributed method for the reachability query over large uncertain graphs,Yurong Cheng; Ye Yuan; Lei Chen; Guoren Wang; Christophe Giraud-Carrier; Yongjiao Sun,Among uncertain graph queries; reachability; ie; the probability that one vertex is reachablefrom another; is likely the most fundamental one. Although this problem has been studiedwithin the field of network reliability; solutions are implemented on a single computer andcan only handle small graphs. However; as the size of graph applications continuallyincreases; the corresponding graph data can no longer fit within a single computer's memoryand must therefore be distributed across several machines. Furthermore; the computation ofprobabilistic reachability queries is# P-complete making it very expensive even on smallgraphs. In this paper; we develop an efficient distributed strategy; called DistR; to solve theproblem of reachability query over large uncertain graphs. Specifically; we perform the taskin two steps: distributed graph reduction and distributed consolidation. In the distributed …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2016,9,21
Online video recommendation in sharing community,Xiangmin Zhou; Lei Chen; Yanchun Zhang; Longbing Cao; Guangyan Huang; Chen Wang,Abstract The creation of sharing communities has resulted in the astonishing increasing ofdigital videos; and their wide applications in the domains such as entertainment; onlinenews broadcasting etc. The improvement of these applications relies on effective solutionsfor social user access to video data. This fact has driven the recent research interest in socialrecommendation in shared communities. Although certain effort has been put into videorecommendation in shared communities; the contextual information on social users has notbeen well exploited for effective recommendation. In this paper; we propose an approachbased on the content and social information of videos for the recommendation in sharingcommunities. Specifically; we first exploit a robust video cuboid signature together with theEarth Mover's Distance to capture the content relevance of videos. Then; we propose to …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,9,12
Keyword search over probabilistic RDF graphs,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Zi Huang,In many real applications; RDF (Resource Description Framework) has been widely used asa W3C standard to describe data in the Semantic Web. In practice; RDF data may oftensuffer from the unreliability of their data sources; and exhibit errors or inconsistencies. In thispaper; we model such unreliable RDF data by probabilistic RDF graphs; and study animportant problem; keyword search query over probabilistic RDF graphs (namely; the pg-KWS query). To retrieve meaningful keyword search answers; we design the score rankingsfor subgraph answers specific for RDF data. Furthermore; we propose effective pruningmethods (via offline pre-computed score bounds and probabilistic threshold) to quickly filterout false alarms. We construct an index over the pre-computed data for RDF; and present anefficient query answering approach through the index.

Probabilistic correlation-based similarity measure on text records,Shaoxu Song; Han Zhu; Lei Chen,Abstract Large scale unstructured text records are stored in text attributes in databases andinformation systems; such as scientific citation records or news highlights. Approximatestring matching techniques for full text retrieval; eg; edit distance and cosine similarity; canbe adopted for unstructured text record similarity evaluation. However; these techniques donot show the best performance when applied directly; owing to the difference betweenunstructured text records and full text. In particular; the information are limited in text recordsof short length; and various information formats such as abbreviation and data missinggreatly affect the record similarity evaluation. In this paper; we propose a novel probabilisticcorrelation-based similarity measure. Rather than simply conducting the matching of tokensbetween two records; our similarity evaluation enriches the information of records by …,Information Sciences,2014,9,21
Multi-scale histograms for answering queries over time series data,Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu,Similarity-based time series data retrieval has been used in many real world applications;such as stock data or weather data analysis. Two types of queries on time series data aregenerally studied: pattern existence queries and exact match queries. Here; we describe atechnique to answer both pattern existence queries and exact match queries. A typicalapplication that needs answers to both queries is an interactive analysis of time series data.We propose a histogram-based representation to approximate time series data.,Data Engineering; 2004.

Towards social-aware ridesharing group query services,Yafei Li; Rui Chen; Lei Chen; Jianliang Xu,With the deep penetration of smartphones and geo-locating devices; ridesharing isenvisioned as a promising solution to transportation-related problems in metropolitan cities;such as traffic congestion and air pollution. Despite the potential to provide significantsocietal and environmental benefits; ridesharing has not so far been as popular asexpected. Notable barriers include social discomfort and safety concerns when travelingwith strangers. To overcome these barriers; in this paper; we propose a new type of Social-aware Ridesharing Group (SaRG) queries which retrieve a group of riders by taking intoaccount their social connections and spatial proximities. While SaRG queries are of practicalusefulness; we prove that; however; the SaRG query problem is NP-hard. Thus; we designan efficient algorithm with a set of powerful pruning techniques to tackle this problem. We …,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,2017,8,12
Trichromatic online matching in real-time spatial crowdsourcing,Tianshu Song; Yongxin Tong; Libin Wang; Jieying She; Bin Yao; Lei Chen; Ke Xu,The prevalence of mobile Internet techniques and Online-To-Offline (O2O) business modelshas led the emergence of various spatial crowdsourcing (SC) platforms in our daily life. Acore issue of SC is to assign real-time tasks to suitable crowd workers. Existing approachesusually focus on the matching of two types of objects; tasks and workers; or assume thestatic offline scenarios; where the spatio-temporal information of all the tasks and workers isknown in advance. Recently; some new emerging O2O applications incur new challenges:SC platforms need to assign three types of objects; tasks; workers and workplaces; andsupport dynamic real-time online scenarios; where the existing solutions cannot handle. Inthis paper; based on the aforementioned challenges; we formally define a novel dynamiconline task assignment problem; called the trichromatic online matching in real-time …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,8,12

These mobile devices can work as sensors to collect varioustypes of data; such as pictures; videos; audios and texts. Therefore; in crowdsourcing; arequester can unitize power of mobile devices and their location information to ask for datarelated a specific location; subsequently; the mobile users who would like to perform the taskwill travel to the target location and collect the data (videos; audios; or pictures); which isthen sent to the requester.

On uncertain graphs modeling and queries,Arijit Khan; Lei Chen,Abstract Large-scale; highly-interconnected networks pervade both our society and thenatural world around us. Uncertainty; on the other hand; is inherent in the underlying datadue to a variety of reasons; such as noisy measurements; lack of precise information needs;inference and prediction models; or explicit manipulation; eg; for privacy purposes.Therefore; uncertain; or probabilistic; graphs are increasingly used to represent noisy linkeddata in many emerging application scenarios; and they have recently become a hot topic inthe database research community. While many classical graph algorithms such asreachability and shortest path queries become# P-complete; and hence; more expensive inuncertain graphs; various complex queries are also emerging over uncertain networks; suchas pattern matching; information diffusion; and influence maximization queries.

Efficient distributed subgraph similarity matching,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Jeffery Yu Xu; Lei Chen,Abstract Given a query graph qq and a data graph GG; subgraph similarity matching is toretrieve all matches of qq in GG with the number of missing edges bounded by a giventhreshold ϵ ϵ. Many works have been conducted to study the problem of subgraph similaritymatching due to its ability to handle applications involved with noisy or erroneous graphdata. In practice; a data graph can be extremely large; eg; a web-scale graph containinghundreds of millions of vertices and billions of edges. The state-of-the-art approachesemploy centralized algorithms to process the subgraph similarity queries; and thus; they areinfeasible for such a large graph due to the limited computational power and storage spaceof a centralized server.

Graph similarity search on large uncertain graph databases,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Haixun Wang,Abstract Many studies have been conducted on seeking an efficient solution for graphsimilarity search over certain (deterministic) graphs due to its wide application in manyfields; including bioinformatics; social network analysis; and Resource DescriptionFramework data management. All prior work assumes that the underlying data isdeterministic. However; in reality; graphs are often noisy and uncertain due to variousfactors; such as errors in data extraction; inconsistencies in data integration; and for privacy-preserving purposes. Therefore; in this paper; we study similarity graph containment searchon large uncertain graph databases.

Efficient determination of distance thresholds for differential dependencies,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Hong Cheng,The importance of introducing distance constraints to data dependencies; such asdifferential dependencies (DDs); has recently been recognized. The differentialdependencies are tolerant to small variations; which enable them to apply to wide dataquality checking applications; such as detecting data violations. However; the determinationof distance thresholds for the differential dependencies is non-trivial. It often relies on a truthdata instance which embeds the distance constraints. To find useful distance thresholdpatterns from data; there are several guidelines of statistical measures to specify; eg;support; confidence and dependent quality. Unfortunately; given a data instance; usersmight not have any knowledge about the data distribution; thus it is very challenging to setthe right parameters.

Processing SPARQL queries over linked data-a distributed graph-based approach,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; M Tamer Ozsu; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,ABSTRACT We propose techniques for processing SPARQL queries over linked data. Wefollow a graph-based approach where answering a query Q is equivalent to finding itsmatches over a distributed RDF data graph G. We adopt a “partial evaluation and assembly”framework. Partial evaluation results of query Q over each repository—called local partialmatch—are found. In the assembly stage; we propose a centralized and a distributedassembly strategy. We analyze our algorithms both theoretically and the experimentally.Extensive experiments over both real and benchmark RDF repositories with billion triplesdemonstrate the high performance and scalability of our methods compared with that of theexisting solutions.,CoRR; abs/1411.6763,2014,8,12
Indexing dataspaces with partitions,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen,Abstract Dataspaces are recently proposed to manage heterogeneous data; with featureslike partially unstructured; high dimension and extremely sparse. The inverted index hasbeen previously extended to retrieve dataspaces. In order to achieve more efficient accessto dataspaces; in this paper; we first introduce our survey of data features in the realdataspaces. Based on the features observed in our study; several partitioning based indexapproaches are proposed to accelerate the query processing in dataspaces. Specifically;the vertical partitioning index utilizes the partitions on tokens to merge and compress data.We can both reduce the number of I/O reads and avoid aggregation of data inside acompressed list. The horizontal partitioning index supports pruning partitions of tuples in thetop-k query. Thus; we can reduce the computation overhead of irrelevant candidate tuples …,World wide web,2013,8,5

The world in a nutshell: Concise range queries,Ke Yi; Xiang Lian; Feifei Li; Lei Chen,With the advance of wireless communication technology; it is quite common for people toview maps or get related services from the handheld devices; such as mobile phones andPDAs. Range queries; as one of the most commonly used tools; are often posed by theusers to retrieve needful information from a spatial database. However; due to the limits ofcommunication bandwidth and hardware power of handheld devices; displaying all theresults of a range query on a handheld device is neither communication-efficient norinformative to the users. This is simply because that there are often too many resultsreturned from a range query. In view of this problem; we present a novel idea that a conciserepresentation of a specified size for the range query results; while incurring minimalinformation loss; shall be computed and returned to the user. Such a concise range query …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2011,8,12
CrowdTC: crowdsourced taxonomy construction,Rui Meng; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Caleb Chen Cao,Recently; taxonomy has attracted much attention. Both automatic construction solutions andhuman-based computation approaches have been proposed. The automatic methods sufferfrom the problem of either low precision or low recall and human computation; on the otherhand; is not suitable for large scale tasks. Motivated by the shortcomings of bothapproaches; we present a hybrid framework; which combines the power of machine-basedapproaches and human computation (the crowd) to construct a more complete and accuratetaxonomy. Specifically; our framework consists of two steps: we first construct a complete butnoisy taxonomy automatically; then crowd is introduced to adjust the entity positions in theconstructed taxonomy. However; the adjustment is challenging as the budget (money) forasking the crowd is often limited. In our work; we formulate the problem of finding the …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,7,12
Enriching data imputation with extensive similarity neighbors,Shaoxu Song; Aoqian Zhang; Lei Chen; Jianmin Wang,Abstract Incomplete information often occur along with many database applications; eg; indata integration; data cleaning or data exchange. The idea of data imputation is to fill themissing data with the values of its neighbors who share the same information. Suchneighbors could either be identified certainly by editing rules or statistically by relationaldependency networks. Unfortunately; owing to data sparsity; the number of neighbors(identified wrt value equality) is rather limited; especially in the presence of data values withvariances. In this paper; we argue to extensively enrich similarity neighbors by similarityrules with tolerance to small variations. More fillings can thus be acquired that the aforesaidequality neighbors fail to reveal. To fill the missing values more; we study the problem ofmaximizing the missing data imputation. Our major contributions include (1) the np …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,7,9
MaC: a probabilistic framework for query answering with machine-crowd collaboration,Chen Jason Zhang; Lei Chen; Yongxin Tong,Abstract The popularity of crowdsourcing has recently brought about brand newopportunities for engaging human intelligence in the process of data analysis. Most existingworks on crowdsourcing have developed sophisticated methods to utilize the crowd as anew kind of processor; aka Human Processor Units (HPU). In this paper; we propose aframework; called MaC; to combine the powers of both CPUs and HPUs. In order to buildMaC; we need to tackle the following two challenges:(1) HIT Selection: Selecting the" right"HITs (Human Intelligent Tasks) can help reducing the uncertainty significantly and theresults can converge quickly. Thus; we propose an entropy-based model to evaluate theinformativeness of HITs. Furthermore; we find that selecting HITs has factorial complexityand the optimization function is non-linear; thus; we propose an efficient approximation …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,7,12
Trip planner over probabilistic time-dependent road networks,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Recently; the management of transportation systems has become increasingly important inmany real applications such as location-based services; supply chain management; trafficcontrol; and so on. These applications usually involve queries over spatial road networkswith dynamically changing and complicated traffic conditions. In this paper; we model such anetwork by a probabilistic time-dependent graph (PT-Graph); whose edges are associatedwith uncertain delay functions. We propose a useful query in the PT-Graph; namely a tripplanner query (TPQ); which retrieves trip plans that traverse a set of query points in PT-Graph; having the minimum traveling time with high confidence. To tackle the efficiencyissue; we present the pruning methods time interval pruning and probabilistic pruning toeffectively rule out false alarms of trip plans. Furthermore; we design a pre-computation …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,7,9
Bitlist: New full-text index for low space cost and efficient keyword search,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Pan Hui; Sasu Tarkoma,Abstract Nowadays Web search engines are experiencing significant performancechallenges caused by a huge amount of Web pages and increasingly larger number of Webusers. The key issue for addressing these challenges is to design a compact structure whichcan index Web documents with low space and meanwhile process keyword search very fast.Unfortunately; the current solutions typically separate the space optimization from the searchimprovement. As a result; such solutions either save space yet with search inefficiency; orallow fast keyword search but with huge space requirement. In this paper; to address thechallenges; we propose a novel structure bitlist with both low space requirement andsupporting fast keyword search. Specifically; based on a simple and yet very efficientencoding scheme; bitlist uses a single number to encode a set of integer document IDs …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,7,12
A distributed full-text top-k document dissemination system in distributed hash tables,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen,Abstract Recent years witnessed the explosive growth of 'live'web content in the World WideWeb like Weblogs; RSS feeds; and real-time news; etc. The popular usage of RSSfeeds/readers enables end users to subscribe for favorite contents via input RSS URLs.However; the RSS feeds/readers architecture suffers from (i) the high bandwidthconsumption issue; and (ii) limited filtering semantics. In this paper; we proposed a statefulfull text dissemination scheme over structured P2Ps to address both issues. Specifically; forthe semantic side; end users are allowed to subscribe for favorite contents via inputkeywords; for the network bandwidth side; the cooperative content polling; filtering anddisseminating via DHT-based P2P overlay networks save the network bandwidthconsumption.

A study on the job-housing spatial balance of Beijing,Lei Chen; Xiaochen MENG,In the process of socio-economic development and planning construction of Chinese cities;the spatial patterns of job-housing have undergone tremendous changes; and the mismatchof job-housing has led to a se-ries of traffic and social problems. This paper defines ameasurement of job-housing balance; through question-naires and on-site visits in fourcommunities of Beijing in 2008; and then studies their spatial patterns. Further; this papercompares the situation of job-housing balance between citizens with different socio-economic attri-butes. The results show that the job-housing balance of residents has beendestroyed in Beijing; especially in the large-scale work and residence centers. By analyzingthe relationship between the social-economic attributes and job-housing balance ofresidents; we find that the most prominent features of the balanced group are more than …,Progress in geography,2011,7,12
Multi-query optimization for distributed similarity query processing,Yi Zhuang; Qing Li; Lei Chen,This paper considers a multi-query optimization issue for distributed similarity queryprocessing; which attempts to exploit the dependencies in the derivation of a queryevaluation plan. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work investigating a multi-query optimization technique for distributed similarity query processing (MDSQ). Four stepsare incorporated in our MDSQ algorithm. First when a number of query requests (ie; m queryvectors and m radiuses) are simultaneously submitted by users; then a cost-based dynamicquery scheduling (DQS) procedure is invoked to quickly and effectively identify thecorrelation among the query spheres (requests). After that; an index-based vector setreduction is performed at data node level in parallel. Finally; a refinement process of thecandidate vectors is conducted to get the answer set. The proposed method includes a …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008. ICDCS'08. The 28th International Conference on,2008,7,10
A multi-level index structure for video databases,Lei Chen; Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu,ABSTRACT Several salient object-based data models have been proposed to model thevideo data; however; none of them proposed an index structure to handle the salient object-based queries efficiently. There are several indexing schemes that have been proposed forspatio-temporal relationships among objects and they are used to optimize timestamp andinterval queries; which are rarely used in video database. Moreover; these index structuresare designed without consideration of the granularity levels of constraints in salient objectsand the characteristics of the video data. In this paper; we propose a multi-level indexstructure to efficiently handle the salient object-based quires with different levels ofconstraints. The characteristics of video data are also captured in the second level of theindex structure designed to reduce the storage requirement.,Proceedings of the 8th international workshop on multimedia information system,2002,7,12
Phosphate glass cement bone graft,WS Chen; EA Monroe,Abstract The objective of this study was to prepare cement-forming substances fromphosphate glasses for use as a bone graft. The glass-forming system of CaO-SrO-Na 2 OP 2O 5 was explored and ten phosphate glasses were prepared of varying compositions.Cements were made by reducing the glass to powders and reacting them with a watersolution of calcium hydroxide or phosphoric acid. The cements were evaluated by X-raydiffraction; electron microscopy; density and porosity measurements; pH change duringreaction and solubility in water. Because of the water solubilities of these cement materials;they may be useful as bone grafts containing drugs such as antibiotics which would beslowly released as the graft material degrades.,Biomaterials,1991,7,4
The simpler the better: a unified approach to predicting original taxi demands based on large-scale online platforms,Yongxin Tong; Yuqiang Chen; Zimu Zhou; Lei Chen; Jie Wang; Qiang Yang; Jieping Ye; Weifeng Lv,Abstract Taxi-calling apps are gaining increasing popularity for their efficiency in dispatchingidle taxis to passengers in need. To precisely balance the supply and the demand of taxis;online taxicab platforms need to predict the Unit Original Taxi Demand (UOTD); which refersto the number of taxi-calling requirements submitted per unit time (eg.; every hour) and perunit region (eg.; each POI). Predicting UOTD is non-trivial for large-scale industrial onlinetaxicab platforms because both accuracy and flexibility are essential. Complex non-linearmodels such as GBRT and deep learning are generally accurate; yet require labor-intensivemodel redesign after scenario changes (eg.; extra constraints due to new regulations). Toaccurately predict UOTD while remaining flexible to scenario changes; we proposeLinUOTD; a unified linear regression model with more than 200 million dimensions of …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,6,18
Flexible online task assignment in real-time spatial data,Yongxin Tong; Libin Wang; Zimu Zhou; Bolin Ding; Lei Chen; Jieping Ye; Ke Xu,Abstract The popularity of Online To Offline (O2O) service platforms has spurred the need foronline task assignment in real-time spatial data; where streams of spatially distributed tasksand workers are matched in real time such that the total number of assigned pairs ismaximized. Existing online task assignment models assume that each worker is eitherassigned a task immediately or waits for a subsequent task at a fixed location once she/heappears on the platform. Yet in practice a worker may actively move around rather thanpassively wait in place if no task is assigned. In this paper; we define a new problem< u>F</u> lexible< u> T</u> wo-sided< u> O</u> nline task< u> A</u> ssignment (FTOA). FTOAaims to guide idle workers based on the prediction of tasks and workers so as to increasethe total number of assigned worker-task pairs.

Answering subgraph queries over massive disk resident graphs,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Xuemin Lin; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Due to its wide applications; subgraph query has attracted lots of attentions indatabase community. In this paper; we focus on subgraph query over a single large graph G;ie; finding all embeddings of query Q in G. Different from existing feature-based approaches;we map all edges into a two-dimensional space R 2 and propose a bitmap structure to indexR 2. At run time; we find a set of a djacent e dge p airs (AEP) or s tar-s tyle p atterns (SSP) tocover Q. We develop e dge j oin (EJ) algorithms to address both AEP and SSP subqueries.Based on the bitmap index; our method can optimize I/O and CPU cost. More importantly;our index has the linear space complexity instead of exponential complexity in feature-based approaches; which indicates that our index can scale well with respect to large datasize. Furthermore; our index has light maintenance overhead; which has not been …,World Wide Web,2016,6,12
LINQ: A framework for location-aware indexing and query processing,Xiping Liu; Lei Chen; Changxuan Wan,This paper studies the generic location-aware rank query (GLRQ) over a set of location-aware objects. A GLRQ is composed of a spatial location; a set of keywords; a querypredicate; and a ranking function formulated on location; text and other attributes. The resultconsists of k objects satisfying the predicate ranked according to the ranking function. Anexample is a query searching for the restaurants that 1) are nearby; 2) offer “American” food;and 3) have high ratings (rating> 4.0). Such queries can not be processed efficiently usingexisting techniques. In this work; we propose a novel framework called LINQ for efficientprocessing of GLRQs. To handle the predicate and the attribute-based scoring; we devise anew index structure called synopses tree; which contains the synopses of different subsetsof the dataset. The synopses tree enables pruning of search space according to the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,6,3
Efficient parallel processing of distance join queries over distributed graphs,Xiaofei Zhang; Lei Chen; Min Wang,Distance join queries have recently been recognized as a particularly useful operation overgraph data; since they capture graph similarity in a meaningful way. Consequently; theyhave been studied extensively in recent years [1];[2]. However; current methods aredesigned for centralized systems; and rely on the graph embedding for effective pruning andindexing. As graph sizes become very large and graph data must be deployed in thedistributed environment; these techniques become impractical. In this work; we propose asolution for efficient parallel processing of distance join queries over distributed largegraphs. There have been emerging efforts devoted to managing large graphs in distributedand parallel systems. Programming models like Pregel [3] and iterative computingframework like HaLoop [4] have been proposed to handle queries over distributed graphs …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,6,12
From labor to trader: Opinion elicitation via online crowds as a market,Caleb Chen Cao; Lei Chen; Hosagrahar Visvesvaraya Jagadish,Abstract We often care about people's degrees of belief about certain events: eg causalitybetween an action and the outcomes; odds distribution among the outcome of a horse raceand so on. It is well recognized that the best form to elicit opinion from human is probabilitydistribution instead of simple voting; because the form of distribution retains the delicateinformation that an opinion expresses. In the past; opinion elicitation has relied on experts;who are expensive and not always available. More recently; crowdsourcing has gainedprominence as an inexpensive way to get a great deal of human input. However; traditionalcrowdsourcing has primarily focused on issuing very simple (eg binary decision) tasks to thecrowd. In this paper; we study how to use crowds for Opinion Elicitation. There are threemajor challenges to eliciting opinion information in the form of probability distributions …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,6,22
Efficient subsequence matching over large video databases,Xiangmin Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou; Lei Chen; Athman Bouguettaya,Abstract Video similarity matching has broad applications such as copyright detection; newstracking and commercial monitoring; etc. Among these applications; one typical task is todetect the local similarity between two videos without the knowledge on positions andlengths of each matched subclip pair. However; most studies so far on video detectioninvestigate the global similarity between two short clips using a pre-defined distancefunction. Although there are a few works on video subsequence detection; all theseproposals fail to provide an effective query processing mechanism. In this paper; we firstgeneralize the problem of video similarity matching. Then; a novel solution called consistentkeyframe matching (CKM) is proposed to solve the problem of subsequence matchingbased on video segmentation. CKM is designed with two goals:(1) good scalability in …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,6,19
Efficient similarity join over multiple stream time series,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Similarity join (SJ) in time-series databases has a wide spectrum of applications such asdata cleaning and mining. Specifically; an SJ query retrieves all pairs of (sub) sequencesfrom two time-series databases that epsiv-match with each other; where epsiv is thematching threshold. Previous work on this problem usually considers static time-seriesdatabases; where queries are performed either on disk-based multidimensional indexesbuilt on static data or by nested loop join (NLJ) without indexes. SJ over multiple stream timeseries; which continuously outputs pairs of similar subsequences from stream time series;strongly requires low memory consumption; low processing cost; and query procedures thatare themselves adaptive to time-varying stream data. These requirements invalidate theexisting approaches in static databases. In this paper; we propose an efficient and …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2009,6,12
General cost models for evaluating dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional spaces,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Similarity search usually encounters a serious problem in the high-dimensional space;known as the" curse of dimensionality". In order to speed up the retrieval efficiency; mostprevious approaches reduce the dimensionality of the entire data set to a fixed lower valuebefore building indexes (referred to as global dimensionality reduction (GDR)). More recentworks focus on locally reducing the dimensionality of data to different values (called the localdimensionality reduction (LDR)). In addition; random projection is proposed as anapproximate dimensionality reduction (ADR) technique to answer the approximate similaritysearch instead of the exact one. However; so far little work has formally evaluated theeffectiveness and efficiency of GDR; LDR; and ADR for the range query. Motivated by this; inthis paper; we propose general cost models for evaluating the query performance over …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2009,6,12
Continuous answering holistic queries over sensor networks,Kebin Liu; Lei Chen; Minglu Li; Yunhao Liu,Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used for various monitoring applications.Users issue queries to sensors and collect sensing data. Due to the low quality sensingdevices or random link failures; sensor data are often noisy. In order to increase thereliability of the query results; continuous queries are often employed. In this work we focuson continuous holistic queries like Median. Existing approaches are mainly designed for non-holistic queries like Average. However; it is not trivial to answer holistic ones due to their non-decomposable property. We propose two schemes for answering queries under differentdata changing conditions. While sensor data changes slowly; based on the data correlationbetween different rounds; we propose one algorithm for getting the exact answers. When thedata changing speed is high; we propose another approach to derive the approximate …,Parallel and Distributed Processing; 2008. IPDPS 2008. IEEE International Symposium on,2008,6,12

Collaborative search in large-scale unstructured peer-to-peer networks,Yiming Zhang; Dongsheng Li; Lei Chen; Xicheng Lu,Searching in large-scale unstructured peer-to-peer networks is challenging due to the lackof effective hint information to guide queries. In this paper; we propose POP; a Parallel;collaborative and Probabilistic search mechanism; in which query messages are viewed assearch units to collaborate with each other and aggregate the distributed hints during thesearch process. A scheme called distributed Bloom filter (DBF) is presented to propagate thehints with a bandwidth-aware manner; in which a node divides the received Bloom filtervector into subvectors and disseminates the fragments to its neighbors according to theirbandwidth capacity. The effectiveness of POP is demonstrated through theoretical analysisand extensive simulations.,Parallel Processing; 2007. ICPP 2007. International Conference on,2007,6,12
Approximate similarity search over multiple stream time series,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Bin Wang,Abstract Similarity search over stream time series has a wide spectrum of applications. Mostprevious work in static time-series databases and stream time series aim at retrieving theexact answer to a similarity search. However; little work considers the approximate similaritysearch in stream time series. In this paper; we propose a weighted locality-sensitive hashing(WLSH) technique; which is adaptive to characteristics of stream data; to answerapproximate similarity search over stream time series. Due to the unique requirement ofstream processing; we present an efficient method to update hash functions adaptive tostream data and maintain hash files incrementally at a low cost. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate the effectiveness of WLSH; as well as the efficiency of approximate similaritysearch via hashing on stream time series.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,6,12
Localized routing trees for query processing in sensor networks,Jie Lian; Lei Chen; Kshirasagar Naik; M Tamer Özsu; G Agnew,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel energy-efficient approach; a localized routing tree(LRT) coupled with a route redirection (RR) strategy; to support various types of queries.LRTs take care of the sensors near the sink and reduce the energy consumption of thesesensors; and RR reduces the energy cost of data receptions. Compared to the existingapproaches; simulation studies show that LRT together with RR has significant improvementon the query capacity.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,6,12

Mutual benefit aware task assignment in a bipartite labor market,Liu Zheng; Lei Chen,As one of the three major steps (question design; task assignment; answer aggregation) incrowdsourcing; task assignment directly affects the quality of the crowdsourcing result. Agood assignment will not only improve the answers' quality; but also boost the workers'willingness to participate. Although a lot of works have been made to produce betterassignment; most of them neglected one of its most important properties: the bipartition;which exists widely in real world scenarios. Such ignorance greatly limits their applicationunder general settings.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,5,4
Boosting mobile Apps under imbalanced sensing data,Xinglin Zhang; Zheng Yang; Longfei Shangguan; Yunhao Liu; Lei Chen,Mobile sensing apps have proliferated rapidly over the recent years. Most of them rely oninference components heavily for detecting interesting activities or contexts. Existing workimplements inference components using traditional models designed for balanced data sets;where the sizes of interesting (positive) and non-interesting (negative) data are comparable.Practically; however; the positive and negative sensing data are highly imbalanced. Forexample; a single daily activity such as bicycling or driving usually occupies a small portionof time; resulting in rare positive instances. Under this circumstance; the trained modelsbased on imbalanced data tend to mislabel positive ones as negative. In this paper; wepropose a new inference framework SLIM based on several machine learning techniques inorder to accommodate the imbalanced nature of sensing data.

Fast similarity search of multi-dimensional time series via segment rotation,Xudong Gong; Yan Xiong; Wenchao Huang; Lei Chen; Qiwei Lu; Yiqing Hu,Abstract Multi-dimensional time series is playing an increasingly important role in the “bigdata” era; one noticeable representative being the pervasive trajectory data. Numerousapplications of multi-dimensional time series all require to find similar time series of a givenone; and regarding this purpose; Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is the most widely useddistance measure. Due to the high computation overhead of DTW; many lower boundingmethods have been proposed to speed up similarity search. However; almost all the existinglower bounds are for general time series; which means they do not take advantage of theunique characteristics of higher dimensional time series. In this paper; we introduce a newlower bound for constrained DTW on multi-dimensional time series to achieve fast similaritysearch. The key observation is that when the time series is multi-dimensional; it can be …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2015,5,10
Efficient probabilistic supergraph search over large uncertain graphs,Yongxin Tong; Xiaofei Zhang; Caleb Chen Cao; Lei Chen,Abstract In recent years; with the emergence of a number of new real applications; such asprotein-protein interaction (PPI) networks; visual pattern recognition; and intelligent trafficsystems; managing huge volumes of uncertain graphs has attracted much attention in thedatabase community. Currently; most existing fundamental queries over graphs only supportdeterministic (or certain) graphs; although real graph data are often noisy; inaccurate; andincomplete. In this paper; we study a new type of uncertain graph query; probabilisticsupergraph containment query over large uncertain graphs. Specifically; given an uncertaingraph database UGD which contains a set of uncertain graphs; a deterministic query graphq; and a probabilistic threshold δ; a probabilistic supergraph containment query is to find theset of uncertain graphs from UGD; denoted as UGD q; such that UGD q={ug i∈ UGD| Pr …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,5,20
Pattern match query in a large uncertain graph,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen,Abstract Many studies have been conducted on seeking an efficient solution for patternmatching over graphs. This interest is largely due to large number of applications in manyfields; which require efficient solutions for pattern matching; including protein complexprediction; social network analysis and structural pattern recognition. However; in many realapplications; the graph data are often noisy; incomplete; and inaccurate. In other words;there exist many uncertain graphs. Therefore; in this paper; we study pattern matching in alarge uncertain graph. Specifically; we want to retrieve all qualified matches of a querypattern in the uncertain graph. Though pattern matching over an uncertain graph is NP-hard;we employ a filtering-and verification framework to speed up the search. In the filteringphase; we propose a probabilistic matching tree; PM-tree; based on match cuts obtained …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,5,15
Causality and responsibility: Probabilistic queries revisited in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Recently; due to ubiquitous data uncertainty in many real-life applications; it hasbecome increasingly important to study efficient and effective processing of variousprobabilistic queries over uncertain data; which usually retrieve uncertain objects that satisfyquery predicates with high probabilities. However; one annoying; yet challenging; problemis that; some probabilistic queries are very sensitive to low-quality objects in uncertaindatabases; and the returned query answers might miss some important results (due to lowdata quality). To identify both accurate query answers and those potentially low-qualityobjects; in this paper; we investigate the causes of query answers/non-answers from a novelangle of causality and responsibility (CR); and propose a new interpretation of probabilisticqueries. Particularly; we focus on the problem of CR-based probabilistic nearest neighbor …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,5,3

A unified indexing structure for efficient cross-media retrieval,Yi Zhuang; Qing Li; Lei Chen,Abstract An important trend in web information processing is the support of content-basedmultimedia retrieval (CBMR). However; the most prevailing paradigm of CBMR; such ascontent-based image retrieval; content-based audio retrieval; etc; is rather conservative. Itcan only retrieve media objects of single modality. With the rapid development of Internet;there is a great deal of media objects of different modalities in the multimedia documentssuch as webpages; which exhibit latent semantic correlation. Cross-media retrieval; as anew multi-media retrieval method; is to retrieve all the related media objects with multi-modalities via submitting a query media object. To the best of our knowledge; this is the firststudy on how to speed up the cross-media retrieval via indexes.

Max regional aggregate over sensor networks,Yongzhen Zhuang; Lei Chen,Nowadays; wireless sensor networks are widely used in many environmental monitoringapplications. However; due to the limitation of the current hardware technology; sensors areoften battery powered and it is very difficult to change batteries. Therefore; for applicationsover wireless sensor networks; it is a critical issue to save the energy of sensors. Manyattempts have been made to answer various types of queries energy-efficiently; such asmax; top-k; and skylines. However; all of them return the readings of individual sensors thatsatisfy the query constraint. In practice; query results based on individual sensor readingsare unreliable because sensor readings are often noisy.

Searching musical audio datasets by a batch of multi-variant tracks,Yi Yu; J Stephen Downie; Lei Chen; Vincent Oria; Kazuki Joe,Abstract Multi-variant music tracks are those audio tracks of a particular song which are sungand recorded by different people (ie; cover songs). As music social clubs grow on theInternet; more and more people like to upload music recordings onto such music social sitesto share their own home-produced albums and participate in Internet singing contests.Therefore it is very important to explore a computer-assisted evaluation tool to detect theseaudio-based multi-variant tracks. In this paper we investigate such a task: the original trackof a song is embedded in datasets; with a batch of multi-variant audio tracks of this song asinput; our retrieval system returns an ordered list by similarity and indicates the position ofrelevant audio track. To help process multi-variant audio tracks; we suggest a semanticindexing framework and propose the Federated Features (FF) scheme to generate the …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM international conference on Multimedia information retrieval,2008,5,19

Signature-file-based approach for query answering over wireless sensor networks,Mo Li; Lei Chen; Jizhong Zhao; Qian Zhang; Yunhao Liu,Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used in many application fields. Becausesensor nodes are generally battery powered; to prolong network lifetime; energyconservation becomes a major concern in answering queries over sensor networks. Inaddition; a robust and fault-tolerant data-collection method is highly desirable against alossy network with low-quality wireless communication links and unreliable sensor nodes.We propose a signature-file-based approach to approximately answer queries over WSNs.By combining the duplicate-insensitive structure of signature files and the redundantmultipath routing approach; we create a robust in-network aggregation scheme; which cananswer both aggregative and range queries with high accuracy while significantly reducingthe cost of message transmissions.

A push-based prefetching for cooperative caching RAM Grid,Rui Chu; Nong Xiao; Lei Chen; Xicheng Lu,As an innovative distributed computing technique for sharing the memory resources in high-speed network; RAM Grid exploits the distributed free nodes; and provides remote memoryfor the nodes which are short of memory. One of the RAM Grid systems named DRACO; triesto provide cooperative caching to improve the performance of the user node which has massdisk I/O but lacks local memory. However; the performance of DRACO is constrained withthe network communication cost. In order to hide the latency of remote memory access andimprove the caching performance; we proposed using push-based prefetching to enable thecaching providers to push the potential useful memory pages to the user nodes. Specifically;for each caching provider; it employs sequential pattern mining techniques; which adapts tothe characteristics of memory page access sequences; on locating useful memory pages …,Parallel and Distributed Systems; 2007 International Conference on,2007,5,19
Top-k team recommendation and its variants in spatial crowdsourcing,Dawei Gao; Yongxin Tong; Jieying She; Tianshu Song; Lei Chen; Ke Xu,Abstract With the rapid development of mobile internet and online to offline marketing model;various spatial crowdsourcing platforms; such as Gigwalk and Gmission; are getting popular.Most existing studies assume that spatial crowdsourced tasks are simple and trivial.However; many real crowdsourced tasks are complex and need to be collaborativelyfinished by a team of crowd workers with different skills. Therefore; an important issue ofspatial crowdsourcing platforms is to recommend some suitable teams of crowd workers tosatisfy the requirements of skills in a task. In this paper; to address the issue; we first proposea more practical problem; called Top-k team recommendation in spatial crowdsourcing (Topk TR) problem. We prove that the Top k TR problem is NP-hard and designs a two-level-based framework; which includes an approximation algorithm with provable …,Data Science and Engineering,2017,4,19
Fast composite counting in RFID systems,Wei Gong; Haoxiang Liu; Lei Chen; Kebin Liu; Yunhao Liu,Counting the number of tags is a fundamental issue and has a wide range of applications inRFID systems. Most existing protocols; however; only apply to the scenario where a singlereader counts the number of tags covered by its radio; or at most the union of tags coveredby multiple readers. They are unable to achieve more complex counting objectives; ie;counting the number of tags in a composite set expression such as (S 1∪ S 2)-(S 3∩ S 4).This type of counting has realistic significance as it provides more diversity than existingcounting scenario; and can be applied in various applications. We formally introduce theRFID composite counting problem; which aims at counting the tags in an arbitrary setexpression and obtain its strong lower bounds on the communication cost. We then proposea generic Composite Counting Framework (CCF) that provides estimates for any set …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2016,4,3

Improvement of Hargreaves method for reference evapotranspiration in hilly area of central Sichuan Basin,Chen Li; Ningbo Cui; Xinping Wei; Xiaotao Hu; Daozhi Gong,Reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) is an important part of water cycle and waterbalance. Accurate estimation of ET0 becomes vital in planning and optimizing irrigationschedules and irrigation systems management. Numerous methods have been proposed forestimating ET0; among which Penman-Monteith (PM) model recommended by Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 1998 since it provids the highestaccurate results across the world wherever in an arid or humid environment. But the mainproblems computing ET0 by PM model are its complicated nonlinear process andrequirements of many climatic variables. Thus; there is an urgent need to develop a muchsimpler and more appropriate model in areas with limited data; such as the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) method; which is modified in this paper. In order to obtain more accurate HS …,Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2015,4,0
Structure tensor series-based matching for near-duplicate video retrieval,Xiangmin Zhou; Lei Chen; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Near duplicate video retrieval has attracted much attention due to its wide spectrumof applications including copyright detection; commercial monitoring and news videotracking. In recent years; there has been significant research effort on efficiently identifyingnear duplicates from large video collections. However; existing approaches for large videodatabases suffer from low accuracy due to the serious information loss. In this paper; wepropose a practical solution based on 3D structure tensor model for this problem. We firstpropose a novel video representation scheme; adaptive structure video tensor series (ASVTseries); together with a robust similarity measure; to improve the retrieval effectiveness.Then; we prove the effectiveness of the proposed method by extensive experiments onhundreds hours real video data.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2011,4,12
Cost-efficient repair in inconsistent probabilistic databases,Xiang Lian; Yincheng Lin; Lei Chen,Abstract Due to the ubiquitous data uncertainty in many emerging real applications; efficientmanagement of probabilistic databases has become an increasingly important yetchallenging problem. In particular; one fundamental task of data management is to identifythose unreliable data in the probabilistic database that violate integrity constraints (eg;functional dependencies); and then quickly resolve data inconsistencies. In this paper; weformulate and tackle an important problem of repairing inconsistent probabilistic databasesefficiently by value modification. Specifically; we propose a repair semantic; namely possible-world-oriented repair (PW-repair); which partitions possible worlds into several disjointgroups; and repairs these groups individually with minimum repair costs. Due to theintractable result that finding such a PW-repair strategy is NP-complete; we carefully …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,4,5
Answering frequent probabilistic inference queries in databases,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Existing solutions for probabilistic inference queries mainly focus on answering a singleinference query; but seldom address the issues of efficiently returning results for a sequenceof frequent queries; which is more popular and practical in many real applications. In thispaper; we mainly study the computation caching and sharing among a sequence ofinference queries in databases. The clique tree propagation (CTP) algorithm is firstintroduced in databases for probabilistic inference queries. We use the materialized views tocache the intermediate results of the previous inference queries; which might be shared withthe following queries; and consequently reduce the time cost. Moreover; we take the queryworkload into account to identify the frequently queried variables. To optimize probabilisticinference queries with CTP; we cache these frequent query variables into the …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2011,4,12
Speed up semantic search in P2P networks,Qiang Wang; Rui Li; Lei Chen; Jie Lian; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Peer-to-peer architectures become popular in modern massively distributedsystems; which are often in very large scale and contain a huge volume of heterogeneousdata. To facilitate the information retrieval process in P2P networks; we consider semanticsearch approach; where syntax-based queries are shipped to peers based on semanticcorrelations. Motivated by an interesting experience in Web information retrieval; wepropose a novel ontology-based scheme to measure similarity of peer interests accuratelyand consistently in a decentralized way; and group peers under a scalable hierarchicaloverlay network. Given queries; our approach either floods them within local peer groups orguides them towards remote groups based on the similarity of interests.

Fast parallel path concatenation for graph extraction,Yingxia Shao; Kai Lei; Lei Chen; Zi Huang; Bin Cui; Zhongyi Liu; Yunhai Tong; Jin Xu,Heterogeneous graph is a popular data model to represent the real-world relations withabundant semantics. To analyze heterogeneous graphs; an important step is extractinghomogeneous graphs from the heterogeneous graphs; called homogeneous graphextraction. In an extracted homogeneous graph; the relation is defined by a line pattern onthe heterogeneous graph and the new attribute values of the relation are calculated by user-defined aggregate functions. The key challenges of the extraction problem are how toefficiently enumerate paths matched by the line pattern and aggregate values for each pairof vertices from the matched paths. To address above two challenges; we propose a parallelgraph extraction framework; where we use vertex-centric model to enumerate paths andcompute aggregate functions in parallel. The framework compiles the line pattern into a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,3,12
Tuning crowdsourced human computation,Chen Cao; Jiayang Tu; Zheng Liu; Lei Chen; HV Jagadish,As crowdsourcing has been dramatically investigated and utilized to address problems inthe real world; it is essential and important to think about performance optimization.Analogous to computer systems with CPUs; treating each worker as a HPU (HumanProcessing Unit [1]) and studying the performance optimization on top of HPUs areinteresting perspectives to resolve crowdsourcing issues. However; as we characterizeHPUs in detail for this purpose; we find that there are significant differences between CPUsand HPUs; leading to the need of completely new optimization algorithms. In this paper; westudy the specific optimization problem of obtaining results the fastest for a crowdsourcedjob with a fixed total budget.

TrendTracker: Modelling the motion of trends in space and time,Klaus Arthur Schmid; Christian Frey; Fengchao Peng; Michael Weiler; Andreas Zufle; Lei Chen; Matthias Renz,Both the current trends in technology such as smart phones; general mobile devices;stationary sensors and satellites as well as a new user mentality of utilizing this technologyto voluntarily share information produce a huge flood of geo-textual data. Such data includesmicroblogging platforms such as Twitter; social networks such as Facebook; and data fromnews stations. Such geo-textual data allows to immediately detect and react to new andemerging trends. A trend is a set of keywords associated with a time interval where thefrequency of these keywords is increased significantly. In this paper; we investigate thedissemination of trends over space and time. For this purpose; we employ a four-stepframework.

Relationship between exercise induced elevation of left ventricular filling pressure and exercise intolerance in patients with atrial fibrillation,Shao-Min Chen; Rong He; Wei-Hong Li; Zhao-Ping Li; Bao-Xia Chen; Xin-Heng Feng,Background Elevated left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) is an important cause ofexercise intolerance in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Exercise stress echocardiographycould assess LVFP during exercise. The objective of this study was to investigate therelationship between exercise induced elevation of LVFP and exercise capacity in patientswith AF. Methods This study included 145 consecutive patients (81 men and 64 women;mean age 65.5±8.0 years) with persistent non-valvular AF and normal left ventricular systolicfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction≥ 50%). All patients underwent a symptom-limitedcardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Doppler echocardiography was performed both atrest and immediately after exercise.

Keyword Query over Error-Tolerant Knowledge Bases,Yu-Rong Cheng; Ye Yuan; Jia-Yu Li; Lei Chen; Guo-Ren Wang,Abstract With more and more knowledge provided by WWW; querying and mining theknowledge bases have attracted much research attention. Among all the queries overknowledge bases; which are usually modelled as graphs; a keyword query is the mostwidely used one. Although the problem of keyword query over graphs has been deeplystudied for years; knowledge bases; as special error-tolerant graphs; lead to the results ofthe traditional defined keyword queries out of users' satisfaction. Thus; in this paper; wedefine a new keyword query; called confident r-clique; specific for knowledge bases basedon the r-clique definition for keyword query on general graphs; which has been proved to bethe best one. However; as we prove in the paper; finding the confident r-cliques is# P-hard.We propose a filtering-and-verification framework to improve the search efficiency.

The reachability query over distributed uncertain graphs,Yurong Cheng; Ye Yuan; Lei Chen; Guoren Wang,Reachability; one of the most fundamental queries over uncertain graphs; which asks theprobability that two given query vertices are reachable over an uncertain graph. Althoughthis problem has been widely studied; the existing works are all processed in a singleserver. However; as graph data becomes larger; it usually cannot be stored in a singleserver. Moreover; processing probabilistic reachability queries is# P-complete; so thecalculation is very expensive even on small graphs. Thus; in this paper; our purpose is todevelop efficient distributed strategies to firstly pick out all the maximal subgraphs whosereachability probabilities can be calculated in polynomial time efficiently. After this step; onlya small graph remains; and we provide an approximate method.

Crowdlink: An error-tolerant model for linking complex records,Chen Zhang; Rui Meng; Lei Chen; Feida Zhu,Abstract Record linkage (RL) refers to the task of finding records in a data set that refer to thesame entity across different data sources (eg; data files; books; websites; databases); whichis a long-standing challenge in database management. Algorithmic approaches have beenproposed to improve RL quality; but remain far from perfect. Crowdsourcing offers a moreaccurate but expensive (and slow) way to bring human insight into the process. In this paper;we propose a new probabilistic model; namely CrowdLink; to tackle the above limitations. Inparticular; our model gracefully handles the crowd error and the correlation among differentpairs; as well as enables us to decompose the records into small pieces (ie attributes) sothat crowdsourcing workers can easily verify. Further; we develop efficient and effectivealgorithms to select the most valuable questions; in order to reduce the monetary cost of …,Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Exploratory Search in Databases and the Web,2015,3,10
Ranked content advertising in online social networks,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Ilaria Bartolini,Abstract Online social networks (OSNs) such as Twitter; Digg and Facebook have becomepopular. Users post news; photos and videos; etc. and followers of such users then view andcomment the posted information. In general; we call the users who produce the informationas the information producers; and the users who view the information as the informationconsumers. The recently popular targeted information advertising systems enable theproducers to target users (ie; consumers). A key problem of the advertising system is toefficiently find the top-k most desirable targeted users; who next will view the advertisedinformation and perform potential e-commerce activities. Unfortunately; state-of-the-artsolutions to find the top-k desirable targeted users in large OSNs incur high space cost andslow running time.

Left ventricular filling pressure assessed by exercise TDI was correlated with early HFNEF in patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Guodong Ma; Ming Xu; Wei Gao; Zhaoping Li; Weihong Li; Baoxia Chen; Jieli Feng; Hongyan Wang; Wenying Ma; Hui Chen; Aidong Shen; Xinheng Feng; Yongzhen Zhang,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients are more susceptible to suffer from heartfailure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). Therefore; it is critical to evaluate therelationship between left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) and HFNEF; even if a largeproportion of HCM patients have normal LVFP at rest. The objective was to assess thecorrelation between exercise tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and early HFNEF in HCMpatients by treadmill exercise echocardiography combined with cardiopulmonary exercisetest (CPET). Twenty-seven non-obstructive HCM patients and 31 age-and gender-matchedhealthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent treadmill exerciseechocardiography combined with CPET.

Protect you more than blank: anti-learning sensitive user information in the social networks,Mingxuan Yuan; Lei Chen; S Yu Philip; Hong Mei,Abstract Social networks are getting more and more attention in recent years. People joinsocial networks to share their information with others. However; due to the different culturesand backgrounds; people have different requirements on what kind of information should bepublished. Currently; when social network websites publish data; they just leave theinformation that a user feels sensitive blank. This is not enough due to the existence of thelabel-structure relationship. A group of analyzing algorithms can be used to learn the blankinformation with high accuracy. In this paper; we propose a personalized model to protectprivate information in social networks. Specifically; we break the label-structure associationby slightly changing the edges in some users' neighborhoods. More importantly; in order toincrease the usability of the published graph; we also preserve the influence value of …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2014,3,8
On concise set of relative candidate keys,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Hong Cheng,Abstract Matching keys; specifying what attributes to compare and how to compare them foridentifying the same real-world entities; are found to be useful in applications like recordmatching; blocking and windowing [7]. Owing to the complex redundant semantics amongmatching keys; capturing a proper set of matching keys is highly non-trivial. Analogous tominimal/candidate keys wrt functional dependencies; relative candidate keys (RCKs [7]; witha minimal number of compared attributes; see a more formal definition in Section 2) canclear up redundant semantics wrt" what attributes to compare". However; we note thatredundancy issues may still exist among rcks on the same attributes about" how to comparethem". In this paper; we propose to find a concise set of matching keys; which has lessredundancy and can still meet the requirements on coverage and validity. Specifically; we …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,3,12

Similarity search on uncertain spatio-temporal data,Johannes Niedermayer; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Nikos Mamoulis; Lei Chen; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract In this work; we address the problem of similarity search in a database of uncertainspatio-temporal objects. Each object is defined by a set of observations ((time; location)-tuples) and a Markov chain which describes the objects uncertain motion in space and time.To model similarity-which is an important building block for many applications such asidentifying frequent motion patterns or trajectory clustering-we employ the well-knownLongest Common Subsequence (LCSS) measure; which becomes a distribution onuncertain spatio-temporal data (ULCSS). We show how the aligned version (without timeshifting) of the ULCSS can be exactly computed in PTIME; which is also verified by extensiveexperiments.,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2013,3,10

A general cost model for dimensionality reduction in high dimensional spaces,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Similarity search usually encounters a serious problem in the high dimensional space;known as the" curse of dimensionality". In order to speed up the retrieval efficiency; previousapproaches usually reduce the dimensionality of the entire data set to a fixed lower valuebefore building indexes (referred to as global dimensionality reduction (GDR)). More recentworks focus on locally reducing the dimensionality of data to different values (called the localdimensionality reduction (LDR)). However; so far little work has formally evaluated theeffectiveness and efficiency of both GDR and LDR for range queries. Motivated by this; inthis paper; we propose a general cost model for both GDR and LDR; in light of which weintroduce a novel LDR method; PRANS. It can achieve high retrieval efficiency with theguarantee of optimality given by the formal model. Finally; a B+-tree index is constructed …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Maximizing acceptance in rejection-aware spatial crowdsourcing,Libin Zheng; Lei Chen,With the rapid development of mobile networks and the widespread usage of mobiledevices; spatial crowdsourcing; which refers to assigning location-based tasks to movingworkers; has drawn increasing attention. One of the important issues in spatialcrowdsourcing is task assignment; which allocates tasks to appropriate workers. However;existing works generally assume that no rejection would happen after the task assignment iscompleted by the server. Ignorance of such an operation can lead to low system throughput.Thus; in this paper; we take workers' rejection into consideration and try to maximizeworkers' acceptance in order to improve the system throughput. Specifically; we first formallydefine the problem of maximizing workers' acceptance in rejection-aware spatialcrowdsourcing. Unfortunately; the problem is NP-hard.

Knowledge Base Semantic Integration Using Crowdsourcing,Rui Meng; Lei Chen; Yongxin Tong; Chen Zhang,The semantic Web has enabled the creation of a growing number of knowledge bases(KBs); which are designed independently using different techniques. Integration of KBs hasattracted much attention as different KBs usually contain overlapping and complementaryinformation. Automatic techniques for KB integration have been improved but far fromperfect. Therefore; in this paper; we study the problem of knowledge base semanticintegration using crowd intelligence. There are both classes and instances in a KB; in ourwork; we propose a novel hybrid framework for KB semantic integration considering thesemantic heterogeneity of KB class structures. We first perform semantic integration of theclass structures via crowdsourcing; then apply the blocking-based instance matchingapproach according to the integrated class structure.

Prediction-based task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing,Peng Cheng; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Cyrus Shahabi,With the rapid advancement of mobile devices and crowdsourcing platforms; spatialcrowdsourcing has attracted much attention from various research communities. A spatialcrowdsourcing system periodically matches a number of locationbased workers with nearbyspatial tasks (eg; taking photos or videos at some specific locations). Previous studies onspatial crowdsourcing focus on task assignment strategies that maximize an assignmentscore based solely on the available information about workers/tasks at the time ofassignment. These strategies can only achieve local optimality by neglecting theworkers/tasks that may join the system in a future time. In contrast; in this paper; we aim toimprove the global assignment; by considering both present and future (via predictions)workers/tasks.

Adjustable Time-Window-Based Event Detection on Twitter,Qinyi Wang; Jieying She; Tianshu Song; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Ke Xu,Abstract Twitter has become an important platform for reporting breaking news and instantevents. However; it is almost impossible to detect events on Twitter manually due to thelarge volume of data and the noise in them. Though automatic event detection has beenstudied a lot; most works can only detect events in a fixed time window. In this paper; wepropose an efficient system that can detect events in adjustable time windows. We detectterms with unusual frequency and group them into events. We further modify a segment treedata structure to support adjustable time window based event detection; which can efficientlyaggregate statistics of terms of varied-sized time windows and is both space and timesaving. We finally validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniquesthrough extensive experiments on real datasets.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2016,2,19
Quality-Aware Subgraph Matching Over Inconsistent Probabilistic Graph Databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Guoren Wang,Resource Description Framework (RDF) has been widely used in the Semantic Web todescribe resources and their relationships. The RDF graph is one of the most commonlyused representations for RDF data. However; in many real applications such as the dataextraction/integration; RDF graphs integrated from different data sources may often containuncertain and inconsistent information (eg; uncertain labels or that violate facts/rules); due tothe unreliability of data sources. In this paper; we formalize the RDF data by inconsistentprobabilistic RDF graphs; which contain both inconsistencies and uncertainty. With such aprobabilistic graph model; we focus on an important problem; quality-aware subgraphmatching over inconsistent probabilistic RDF graphs (QA-gMatch); which retrievessubgraphs from inconsistent probabilistic RDF graphs that are isomorphic to a given …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,2,12
Efficient pattern matching on big uncertain graphs,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Bo Ning,Abstract A significant amount of research has been devoted to seeking efficient solutions tothe problem of pattern matching over graphs. This interest is largely due to the manyapplications that require such efficient solutions; including protein complex prediction; socialnetwork analysis; and structural pattern recognition. However; in many real applications; thegraph data are often noisy; incomplete; and inaccurate. In other words; there exist manyuncertain graphs. Therefore; in this paper; we study pattern matching in the context of largeuncertain graphs. Specifically; we want to retrieve all qualified matches of a query pattern inthe uncertain graph. Though pattern matching over uncertain graphs is NP-hard; we employa filtering-and-verification framework to speed up the search. In the filtering phase; wepropose a probabilistic matching tree (PM-tree) built from match cuts obtained by a cut …,Information Sciences,2016,2,3
Semantic-aware location privacy preservation on road networks,Yanhui Li; Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Jiajia Li,Abstract In this paper; we address the topic of location privacy preservation of mobile userson road networks. Most existing techniques of privacy preservation rely on structure-basedspatial cloaking; but pay little attention to location semantic information. Yet; locationsemantic information may disclose sensitive information about mobile users. Thus; wepropose CloSed; a semantic-awareness privacy preservation model to protect users' privacyfrom violation. We design cloaked sets that should cover different semantic regions of roadnetworks as well as satisfy quality of service (QoS). As the problem of calculating the optimalcloaked set is NP-hard; we design a greedy algorithm that balances QoS and privacyrequirements. Extensive experiments evaluations demonstrate the efficiency andeffectiveness of our proposed algorithm in providing privacy guarantees on large real …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2016,2,21
Quality-Aware Online Task Assignment in Mobile Crowdsourcing,Yanrong Kang; Xin Miao; Kebin Liu; Lei Chen; Yunhao Liu,Mobile crowd sourcing (MCS) has grown to be a powerful computation paradigm to harnesshuman power to solve real-world problems. Many commercial MCS platforms have arisen;enabling various novel applications. As crowd workers can be unreliable; a critical issue ofthese platforms is quality control. Many task assignment approaches have been proposed toincrease the quality of crowd sourced tasks by matching workers and tasks in a bipartitegraph. However; they fail to apply to MCS platforms where tasks are bound with locations.This paper considers the quality-aware online task assignment problem with location-basedtasks. The goal is to optimize tasks' overall quality by assigning appropriate sets of tasks toworkers in an online manner. To solve this problem; we propose a probabilistic qualitymeasurement model and a hitchhiking model to characterize workers' behavior. Then we …,Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS); 2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2015,2,18

Progressive batch medical image retrieval processing in mobile wireless networks,Yi Zhuang; Nan Jiang; Qing Li; Lei Chen; Chunhua Ju,Abstract This article addresses a multi-query optimization problem for distributed medicalimage retrieval in mobile wireless networks by exploiting the dependencies in the derivationof a retrieval evaluation plan. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work investigatingbatch medical image retrieval (BMIR) processing in a mobile wireless network environment.Four steps are incorporated in our BMIR algorithm. First; when a number of retrievalrequests (ie; m retrieval images and m radii) are simultaneously submitted by users; then acost-based dynamic retrieval (CDRS) scheduling procedure is invoked to efficiently andeffectively identify the correlation among the retrieval spheres (requests) based on a costmodel. Next; an index-based image set reduction (ISR) is performed at the execution-nodelevel in parallel. Then; a refinement processing of the candidate images is conducted to …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2015,2,21

MTAF: An adaptive design for keyword-based content dissemination on DHT networks,Weixiong Rao; Roman Vitenberg; Lei Chen; Sasu Tarkoma,Beyond offering the widely used keyword search function; many peer-to-peer systemsnowadays support the subscription function. For example; Vuze allows users to createsubscription filters based on the keyword search. Given the subscription; episodic or relatedcontent will be delivered to the users whenever new episodes are available. Unfortunately;these applications suffer from the downsides; for example; high network traffic in the nodesmaintaining popular terms. In this paper; we propose the MTAF mechanism to overcome theissues. The key of MTAF is to carefully select a subset of terms without incurring falsenegatives and to forward the content item toward the home nodes of such selected terms forlow content forwarding cost. Experimental results based on real datasets indicate that theproposed solutions are efficient compared to existing approaches. In particular; the …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2015,2,5
Special Section on Data Management and Data Mining Current Issue| Archive| Adv Search<< Previous Articles| Next Articles,Yong-Xin Tong; Lei Chen; Jieying She,Abstract Recently; with the growing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and pervasivecomputing; a large amount of uncertain data; eg RFID data; sensor data; real-time videodata; etc.; has been collected. As one of the most fundamental issues of uncertain datamining; uncertain frequent pattern mining has attracted much attention in the database andthe data mining communities. Although there have been some solutions for uncertainfrequent pattern mining; most of them assume that the data is independent; which is not truein most real-world scenarios. Therefore; current methods that are based on the independentassumption may generate inaccurate results for correlated uncertain data. In this paper; wefocus on the problem of mining frequent itemsets over correlated uncertain data; wherecorrelation can exist in any pair of uncertain data objects (transactions).

ASVTDECTOR: A practical near duplicate video retrieval system,Xiangmin Zhou; Lei Chen,In this paper; we present a system; named ASVT-DECTOR; to retrieve the near duplicatevideos with large variations based on an 3D structure tensor model; named ASVT series;over the local descriptors of video segments. Different from the traditional global feature-based video detection systems that incur severe information loss; ASVT model is built overthe local descriptor set of each video segment; keeping the robustness of local descriptors.Meanwhile; unlike the traditional local feature-based methods that suffer from the high costof pair-wise descriptor comparison; ASVT model describes a video segment as an 3Dstructure tensor that is actually a 3× 3 matrix; obtaining high retrieval efficiency. In thisdemonstration; we show that; given a clip; our ASVTDETECTOR system can effectively findthe near-duplicates with large variations from a large collection in real time.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,2,6
Semi-Edge anonymity: graph publication when the protection algorithm is available,Mingxuan Yuan; Lei Chen,Abstract With the popularity of social networks; the privacy issues related with social networkdata become more and more important. The connection information between users; as wellas their sensitive attributes; should be protected. There are some proposals studying how topublish a privacy preserving graph. However; when the algorithm which generates thepublished graph is known by the attacker; the current protection models may still leak someconnection information. In this paper; we propose a new protection model;“Semi-EdgeAnonymity”; to protect both user's sensitive attributes and connection information even whenan attacker knows the publication algorithm. Moreover; any state-of-art tabular dataprotection techniques can be applied to Semi-Edge Anonymity model to protect sensitiveattributes. We theoretically prove that on two utilities; the possible world size and the true …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,2,5
Subspace Similarity Search under {\rm L} _p-Norm,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Similarity search has been widely used in many applications such as information retrieval;image data analysis; and time-series matching. Previous work on similarity search usuallyconsider the search problem in the full space. In this paper; however; we tackle a problem;subspace similarity search; which finds all data objects that match with a query object in thesubspace instead of the original full space. In particular; the query object can specifyarbitrary subspace with arbitrary number of dimensions. Due to the exponential number ofpossible subspaces specified by users; we introduce an efficient and effective pruningtechnique; which assigns scores to data objects with respect to pivots and prunescandidates via scores. We propose an effective multipivot-based method to preprocess dataobjects by selecting appropriate pivots; where the entire procedure is guided by a formal …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,2,16
Correlation between voluntary information disclosure and performance of Chinese tourism listed companies,Xiaoyan SHI; Haiying LIU; Feng XU,Based on agency theory and signal theory; the authors believe that listed companies withexcellent performance have an incentive to reduce agency costs or to deliver competitiveadvantages through voluntary information disclosure. This paper selects 20 tourism listedcompanies in Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange markets before the end of 2006 assamples to make an empirical analysis of tourism listed companies' voluntary disclosurebehavior for the purpose to test the correlation between voluntary disclosure and corporateperformance with the intention to help tourism listed companies in improving theirinformation disclosure. The results show that: the voluntary information disclosure ofChinese tourism listed companies is lower in overall level; attractions companies' voluntarydisclosure level was significantly higher than that of tourist hotels and integrated …,Tourism Science,2012,2,2

A concise representation of range queries,Ke Yi; Xiang Lian; Feifei Li; Lei Chen,With the advance of wireless communication technology; it is quite common for people toview maps or get related services from the handheld devices; such as mobile phones andPDAs. Range queries; as one of the most commonly used tools; are often posed by theusers to retrieve needful information from a spatial database. However; due to the limits ofcommunication bandwidth and hardware power of handheld devices; displaying all theresults of a range query on a handheld device is neither communication efficient norinformative to the users. This is simply because that there are often too many resultsreturned from a range query. In view of this problem; we present a novel idea that a conciserepresentation of a specified size for the range query results; while incurring minimalinformation loss; shall be computed and returned to the user. Such a concise range query …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,2,13

Probabilistic correlation-based similarity measure of unstructured records,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen,Abstract Computing the similarity between unstructured records is a fundamental function inmultiple applications. Approximate string matching and full text retrieval techniques do notshow the best performance when applied directly; since the information are limited inunstructured records of short record length. In this paper; we propose a novel probabilisticcorrelation-based similarity measure. Rather than simply conducting the exact matchingtokens of two records; our similarity evaluation enriches the information of records byconsidering the correlations of tokens. We define the probabilistic correlation betweentokens as the probability that these tokens appear in the same records. Then we computethe weight of tokens and discover the correlations of records based on the probabilisticcorrelations of tokens. Finally; we present extensive experimental results to demonstrate …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,2,5
Similarity joins of text with incomplete information formats,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen,Abstract Similarity join over text is important in text retrieval and query. Due to the incompleteformats of information representation; such as abbreviation and short word; similarity joinsshould address an asymmetric feature that these incomplete formats may contain onlypartial information of their original representation. Current approaches; including cosinesimilarity with q-grams; can hardly deal with the asymmetric feature of similarity betweenwords and their incomplete formats. In order to find this type of incomplete format informationwith asymmetric features; we develop a new similarity join algorithm; namely IJoin. A novelmatching scheme is proposed to identify the overlap between two entities with incompleteformats. Other than q-grams; we reconnect the sequence of words in a string to reserve theabbreviated information. Based on the asymmetric features of similar entities with …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,2,19
Effect of niobium on microstructure and properties of coating formed by powder feeding laser cladding,Feng-xiao HUANG; JIANG Zhong-hao; CHEN Li,The possibility of adding Nb to the powder feeding laser cladding Fe-based alloy wasinvestigated. The microstructure; hardness and wear resistance of the laser clad layer wereexamined. Optical microscopy (OM); scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM); energy-dispersivespectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that Nb atoms distributehomogenously in clad layer. With the addition of Nb; the dendrite crysta1s in the coating areobviously refined. The equiaxed grains on the interface increase and the eutecticumbecame denser. The addition of Nb in the cladding powder also resultes in increasedhardness and improved wear resistance of the composite coating. It is considered that theimprovement of the microstructure and properties is due to the formation of substantive NbCparticles distributing homogenously in the coatings; and the particles of NbC act as …,Heat Treatment of Metals,2007,2,12

Keyword Search over Distributed Graphs with Compressed Signature,Ye Yuan; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Jeffery Xu Yu; Guoren Wang; Yongjiao Sun,Graph keyword search has drawn many research interests; since graph models cangenerally represent both structured and unstructured databases and keyword searches canextract valuable information for users without the knowledge of the underlying schema andquery language. In practice; data graphs can be extremely large; eg; a Web-scale graphcontaining billions of vertices. The state-of-the-art approaches employ centralized algorithmsto process graph keyword searches; and thus they are infeasible for such large graphs; dueto the limited computational power and storage space of a centralized server. To addressthis problem; we investigate keyword search for Web-scale graphs deployed in a distributedenvironment. We first give a naive search algorithm to answer the query efficiently. However;the naive search algorithm uses a flooding search strategy that incurs large time and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1,12
Feedback-Aware Social Event-Participant Arrangement,Jieying She; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Tianshu Song,Abstract Online event-based social networks (EBSNs) and studies on global event-participant arrangement strategies for EBSNs are becoming popular recently. Existing worksmeasure satisfaction of an arrangement by a linear combination of few factors; weights ofwhich are predefined and fixed; and do not allow users to provide feedbacks on whetheraccepting the arrangement or not. Besides; most of them only consider offline scenarios;where full information of users is known in advance. However; on real-world EBSNplatforms; users can dynamically log in the platform and register for events on a first come;first served basis. In other words; online scenarios of event-participant arrangementstrategies should be considered. In this work; we study a new event-participant arrangementstrategy for online scenarios; the Feedback-Aware Social Event-participant Arrangement …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,1,4
Direction-Aware Why-Not Spatial Keyword Top-k Queries,Lei Chen; Yafei Li; Jianliang Xu; Christian S Jensen,With the continued proliferation of location-based services; a growing number of web-accessible data objects are geotagged and have text descriptions. An important query oversuch web objects is the direction-aware spatial keyword query that aims to retrieve the top-kobjects that best match query parameters in terms of spatial distance and textual similarity ina given query direction. In some cases; it can be difficult for users to specify appropriatequery parameters. After getting a query result; users may find some desired objects areunexpectedly missing and may therefore question the entire result. Enabling why-notquestions in this setting may aid users to retrieve better results; thus improving the overallutility of the query functionality. This paper studies the direction-aware why-not spatialkeyword top-k query problem.

Complex Event-Participant Planning and Its Incremental Variant,Yurong Cheng; Ye Yuan; Lei Chen; Christophe Giraud-Carrier; Guoren Wang,In recent years; online Event Based Social Network (EBSN) platforms have becomeincreasingly popular. One typical task of EBSN platforms is to help users make suitable andpersonalized plans for participating in different interesting social events. Existing techniqueseither ignore the minimumparticipant requirement constraint for each event; which iscrucially needed for some events to be held successfully; or assume that events would notchange once announced. In this paper; we address the above inadequacies of existingEBSN techniques. We formally define the Global Event Planning with Constraints (GEPC)problem; and its incremental variant. We prove that both are NP-hard; and provideapproximate solutions. Finally; we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposedalgorithms through extensive experiments over real and synthetic datasets.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1,21
Distance-aware selective online query processing over large distributed graphs,Xiaofei Zhang; Lei Chen,Abstract Performing online selective queries against graphs is a challenging problem due tothe unbounded nature of graph queries which leads to poor computation locality. It becomeseven difficult when a graph is too large to be fit in the memory. Although there have beenemerging efforts on managing large graphs in a distributed and parallel setting; eg; Pregel;HaLoop and etc; these computing frameworks are designed from the perspective ofscalability instead of the query efficiency. In this work; we present our solution methodologyfor online selective graph queries based on the shortest path distance semantic; which findsvarious applications in practice. The essential intuition is to build a distance-aware index foronline distance-based query processing and to eliminate redundant graph traversal asmuch as possible. We discuss how the solution can be applied to two types of research …,Data Science and Engineering,2017,1,18
Task assignment on spatial crowdsourcing (technical report),Peng Cheng; Xun Jian; Lei Chen,Abstract: Recently; with the rapid development of mobile devices and the crowdsourcingplatforms; the spatial crowdsourcing has attracted much attention from the databasecommunity. Specifically; spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending a location-based request toworkers according to their positions; and workers need to physically move to specifiedlocations to conduct tasks. Many works have studied task assignment problems in spatialcrowdsourcing; however; their problem definitions are quite different from each other. As aresult; there is no work to compare the performances of existing algorithms on taskassignment in spatial crowdsourcing. In this paper; we present a comprehensiveexperimental comparison of most existing algorithms on task assignment in spatialcrowdsourcing. Specifically; we first give some general definitions about spatial workers …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.09675,2016,1,12
Adaptability evaluation of electronic vehicle identification in urban traffic: a case study of Beijing,Hui Hu; Baowen Li; Xiang Chen; Ying Yan; Bin Ran,Sažetak Electronic vehicle identification (EVI) technology is often introduced to implementcongestion-based toll. This paper presented an ex ante evaluation method for EVIadaptability and discussed the feasibility of this technology in congestion charge on thebasis of assessment. First; system dynamics was introduced to qualitatively analyze theeffect of EVI on urban traffic systems with feedback chains. An EVI adaptability evaluationmodel was then developed based on principal component analysis (PCA) and dataenvelopment analysis (DEA). Given numerous output variables; a PCA model was built toreduce variable dimensionalities. Subsequently; two scenarios of EVI application under acongestion-based toll in Beijing were presented and calculated according to field data.Scenario 1 covered 5% of the total vehicles; as well as the toll zone within the 2nd Ring …,Tehnički vjesnik,2016,1,19
Prediction-based task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing (technical report),Peng Cheng; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract: Spatial crowdsourcing refers to a system that periodically assigns a number oflocation-based workers with spatial tasks nearby (eg; taking photos or videos at somespatial locations). Previous works on the spatial crowdsourcing usually designed taskassignment strategies that maximize some assignment scores; which are however onlybased on available workers/tasks in the system at the time point of assigning workers/tasks.These strategies may achieve local optimality; due to the neglect of future workers/tasks thatmay join the system. In contrast; in this paper; we aim to achieve" globally" optimal taskassignments; by considering not only those present; but also future (via predictions);workers/tasks. Specifically; we formalize an important problem; namely prediction-basedspatial crowdsourcing (PB-SC); which expects to obtain a" globally" optimal strategy for …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.08518,2015,1,15

L-Graph: A General Graph Analytic System on Continuous Computation,Weixiong Rao; Eiko Yoneki; Lei Chen,Abstract Massive graph analytics have become an important aspect of multiple diverseapplications. With the growing scale of real world graphs; efficient execution of entire graphanalytics has become a challenging problem. Recently a number of distributed graphprocessing systems (Pregel; PowerGraph; Trinity) and centralized systems (GraphChi andXStream) have been designed. Compared with high expense of distributed systemsdeployed on a cluster of commodity machines; the centralized systems on cheap PCs arevery attractive propositions with low expense and comparable performance. By carefulanalysis; we find that (i) the graph computation abstraction in the centralized systemsinherently adopted a batch model similar to the distributed systems. The batch model couldlead to suboptimal performance.(ii) The execution model in the centralized systems …,Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Hot Topics in Planet-Scale Measurement,2015,1,19
Privacy preserving graph publication in a distributed environment,Mingxuan Yuan; Lei Chen; S Yu Philip; Hong Mei,Abstract Nowadays; more and more people join different social networks to share orcomment on their daily activities. Along with the popular usage of social networks; people'sprivacy becomes a big concern. Therefore; recently; many works studied how to publishprivacy preserving social networks for” safely” data mining or analysis. These works allassume that there exists a single publisher who holds the complete graph. While; in real life;people join different social networks for different purposes. As a result; there are a group ofpublishers and each of them holds only a subgraph. Since no one has the complete graph; itis a challenging problem to generate the published graph in the distributed environmentwithout releasing any publisher's local content. In this paper; we propose an SMC (SecureMulti-Party Computation) based protocol to publish a privacy preserving graph in a …,World Wide Web,2015,1,12
Bonding vertex sets over distributed graph: a betweenness aware approach,Xiaofei Zhang; Hong Cheng; Lei Chen,Abstract Given two sets of vertices in a graph; it is often of a great interest to find out howthese vertices are connected; especially to identify the vertices of high prominence definedon the topological structure. In this work; we formally define a Vertex Set Bonding query(shorted as VSB); which returns a minimum set of vertices with the maximum importance wrttotal betweenness and shortest path reachability in connecting two sets of input vertices. Wefind that such a kind of query is representative and could be widely applied in many realworld scenarios; eg; logistic planning; social community bonding and etc. Challenges arethat many of such applications are constructed on graphs that are too large to fit in singleserver; and the VSB query evaluation turns to be NP-hard. To cope with the scalability issueand return the near optimal result in almost real time; we propose a generic solution …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,1,5
Threshold-based shortest path query over large correlated uncertain graphs,Yu-Rong Cheng; Ye Yuan; Lei Chen; Guo-Ren Wang,Abstract With the popularity of uncertain data; queries over uncertain graphs have become ahot topic in the database community. As one of the important queries; the shortest path queryover an uncertain graph has attracted much attention of researchers due to its wideapplications. Although there are some efficient solutions addressing this problem; allexisting models ignore an important property existing in uncertain graphs: the correlationamong the edges sharing the same vertex. In this paper; we apply Markov network to modelthe hidden correlation in uncertain graphs and compute the shortest path. Unfortunately;calculating the shortest path and corresponding probability over uncertain graphs modeledby Markov networks is a# P-hard problem. Thus; we propose a filtering-and-verificationframework to accelerate the queries. In the filtering phase; we design a probabilistic …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2015,1,12

Radiation Pneumonitis After Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Early Stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,CHEN Lu; ZHAO Yaqin; XU Feng,Abstract With the development of radiation technology; stereotactic body radiation therapy(SBRT) has been widely used in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is notonly the standard therapy for medically inoperable early-stage NSCLC; but also one of thetherapies for operable early-stage NSCLC. Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is one of the mostcommon adverse effects after SBRT; it may reduce the patients' quality of life; even causetreatment failure. Therefore; in order to improve the patients' quality of life and enhance localcontrol rate of tumor; it is important to reduce the risk of RP. The unique fractionationschemes and the dose distribution of SBRT make it not only different from conventionalfraction radiation therapy in treatment outcomes; but also in the incidence of radiationpneumonitis.

C-DMr: Crowd-powered Decision Maker for real world Knapsack Problems,Leihao Xia; Caleb Chen Cao; Lei Chen; Zhao Chen,Knapsack problems range over a large sphere of real world challenges [?]. For example;every year a professor has to decide her new “squad” of students/staff from possiblyhundreds of candidates; while having a restricted budget of funding in consideration.Moreover; in many cases; she has to resort to her colleagues and senior students to makecomparisons among the candidates. The difficulties of such tasks are mainly three-fold: 1)the knowledge about the candidates are distributed among a crowd; 2) the underlyingfactors are human-intrinsic and hard to be formatted; 3) the size of candidates exceeds thecapacity of human for a one-shot decision. Other examples in this category include gear setpreparation for a venture trip; syllabus design for a popular course and inventory design forgoods shelf; where the two difficulties are commonly observed.

Classification of Topic Evolutions in Scientific Conferences,Lin Zhang; Yao Guo; Xiangqun Chen; Weizhong Shao; Lei Chen,Abstract—The number of scientific publications have been increasing explosively in recentyears. Although scholar searching engines and recommendation systems help to findrelevant papers; neither of them can build overviews of a certain scientific conference; whichis more meaningful and important for researchers to keep up with academic trends. In thispaper; we propose the concepts of topic trend and positive topic trend; and then declare theformal and quantitative definitions of topic categories; including hot topic; sunrise topic;sunset topic and emerging topic. We design an LDA-based framework to classify researchtopics of papers in a scientific conference into topic categories. Experiments are thenconstructed to study the best parameters for detecting different topic categories.,Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering; SEKE,2014,1,12

Subscription privacy protection in topic-based pub/sub,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Mingxuan Yuan; Sasu Tarkoma; Hong Mei,Abstract Topic-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is a popular paradigm to decouplemessage producers and consumers with the help of brokers. However; third-party brokersmay be hacked; sniffed; subpoenaed; or impersonated. Thus; the brokers cannot be trusted.In particular; the collusion attack between compromised subscribers and untrusted brokerseasily exposes the privacy of honest subscribers. Given the untrusted brokers and collusionattacks; traditional security techniques alone cannot protect subscribers' privacy. Byadopting the k-anonymity model to the topic-based pub/sub; we propose to use cloakedsubscriptions to blur subscribers' real interests. Such cloaked could protect the subscriptionprivacy but meanwhile incur high forwarding cost. Thus; we minimize the forwarding costmeanwhile satisfying the privacy requirement; and formulate an integer programming (IP) …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,1,4

Distributed top-k full-text content dissemination,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen,Abstract The World Wide Web (WWW) is experiencing an explosive growth of live content.To timely disseminate end users with fresh content that is relevant to users' interests is a veryuseful but challenging task. In this paper we design a distributed top-k documentdissemination scheme: by inputting query terms and a number k as subscription conditions;end users subscribe to the top-k most relevant documents. When the documents andsubscription conditions are distributed; the difficulties are how to forward the personalizedtop-k documents to the needed users with low forwarding cost. To this end; we proposedocument forwarding and filtering algorithms on a set of dedicate servers. Experimentsbased on real query logs and document datasets show the efficiency of our proposedalgorithms.,Distributed and parallel databases,2012,1,18

Synergistic effects of low temperature in winter and ebb tide at night on Sonneratia apetala seedlings growth and key eco-physiological traits.,Chen Lu-Zhen; Du Xiao-Na; Lu Luan-Mei; Zheng Shi-Jie; Yang Sheng-Chang,Abstract By setting up a set of simulated tidal systems with different air-and watertemperature and tidal flood conditions; this paper studied the synergistic effects of lowtemperature in winter and ebb tide at night on the growth and key eco-physiological traits ofSonneratia apetala seedlings. Low air temperature depressed the seedlings growth; but thereduction in the seedling height and basal stem diameter was compensated 41. 2% and 44.6%; respectively by a 5-increase of water temperature. Low air temperature (15 C) reducedthe leaf F< sub> v</sub>/F< sub> m</sub> significantly; indicating a dramatic reduction inthe leaf photosynthetic capacity; whereas the flooded tide with higher water temperaturecould not compensate this damage. The flooded tide with high air temperature increased theproline and soluble sugar contents in mature leaves; which could protect the mature …,Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao,2012,1,6
Probabilistic time consistent queries over moving objects,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Recently; the wide usage of inexpensive mobile devices; along with broaddeployment of wireless and positioning technology; has enabled many importantapplications such as Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN). In these applications; the positions ofmobile nodes are dynamically changing; and are often imprecise due to the inaccuracy ofpositioning devices. Therefore; it is crucial to efficiently and effectively monitor mobile nodes(modeled as uncertain moving objects). In this paper; we propose a novel query; calledprobabilistic time consistent query (PTCQ). In particular; a PTCQ retrieves uncertain movingobjects that consistently satisfy query predicates within a future period with high confidence.We present effective pruning methods to reduce the search space of PTCQs; andseamlessly integrate them into an efficient query procedure. Moreover; to facilitate query …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,1,19
Efficient set-correlation operator inside databases,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen,Abstract Large scale of short text records are now prevalent; such as news highlights;scientific paper citations; and posted messages in a discussion forum; which are often storedas set records in (hidden) databases. Many interesting information retrieval tasks arecorrespondingly raised on the correlation query over these short text records; such asfinding hot topics over news highlights and searching related scientific papers on a certaintopic. However; current relational database management systems (RDBMS) do not directlyprovide support on set correlation query. Thus; in this paper; we address both theeffectiveness and efficiency issues of set correlation query over set records in databases.First; we present a framework of set correlation query inside databases. To our bestknowledge; only the Pearson's correlation can be implemented to construct token …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,1,16
Two novel semantics of top-k queries processing in uncertain database,Dexi Liu; Changxuan Wan; Naixue Xiong; Laurence T Yang; Lei Chen,Top-k query is a powerful technique in uncertain databases because of the existence ofexponential possible worlds; and it is necessary to combine score and confidence of tuplesto derive top k answers. Different semantics; the combination methods of score andconfidence; lead to different results. U-kRanks and Global Top-k are two semantics of Top-kqueries in uncertain database; which consider every alternative in x-tuple as single one andreturn the tuple which has the highest probability appearing at top k or a given rank.However; no matter which alternative (tuple) of an x-tuple appears in a possible world; itundoubtedly believes that this x-tuple appears in the same possible world accordingly. Thus;instead of ranking every individual tuple; we define two novel Top-k queries semantics inuncertain database; Uncertain x-kRanks queries (Ux-kRanks) and Global x-Top-k queries …,Computer and Information Technology (CIT); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,1,12

Effects of Gig Manure and Wheat Straw Application on Plant Growth and Nutrient Uptake of Cherry Radish (Raphanus Sativus) and Characteristics of Soil Fertility [J],Zou Xiaoxia; Shan Hong; Chen Lei; Liu Rongle; Li Shutian; Wang Hong,A pot experiment using fluvo-aquic soil was conducted to study effects of different rates ofpig manure and wheat straw on plant growth and nutrient uptake of cherry-radish(Raphanus Sativus) and characteristics of soil fertility. The results showed that the biomassof cherry-radish affected by pig manure application in the first harvest was better than thatwith wheat straw application. Moreover; high rate usage of pig manure enhanced plantgrowth and the concentrations of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in plant shoots. Butwheat straw application lowered the dry weight of plant roots and the concentration ofnitrogen in plants. The concentrations of total nitrogen and available potassium in soil wereincreased by the application of wheat straw.

Continually answering constraint k-NN queries in unstructured P2P systems,Bin Wang; Xiao-Chun Yang; Guo-Ren Wang; Ge Yu; Lei Chen; X Sean Wang; Xue-Min Lin,Abstract We consider the problem of efficiently computing distributed geographical k-NNqueries in an unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) system; in which each peer is managed by anindividual organization and can only communicate with its logical neighboring peers. Suchqueries are based on local filter query statistics; and require as less communication cost aspossible; which makes it more difficult than the existing distributed k-NN queries. Especially;we hope to reduce candidate peers and degrade communication cost. In this paper; wepropose an efficient pruning technique to minimize the number of candidate peers to beprocessed to answer the k-NN queries. Our approach is especially suitable for continuous k-NN queries when updating peers; including changing ranges of peers; dynamically leavingor joining peers; and updating data in a peer. In addition; simulation results show that the …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2008,1,12

Enhancing edit distance on real sequences filters using histogram distance on fixed reference ordering,Prima Chairunnanda; Vivekanand Gopalkrishnan; Lei Chen,Distance functions are the main tools to measure similarity of two sequences and to searchthe closest sequences to given query sequence. Several well known distance functions;however; have asymptotical time complexity of O (mn) which cannot be fully afforded bysystems that deal with large volumes of data. These distance functions; including editdistance on real sequences (EDR)(L. Chen et al.; 2005); have pruning methods to reduceexecution time by dismissing false candidates as early as possible. In this paper; wepropose the histogram distance on fixed reference (HDFR) ordering; with various referencehistogram construction methods; to improve the filtering power of the pruning methods inEDR. Experiments show that a decrease in EDR execution time is observed after HDFR isapplied. While we base our experiments on EDR; HDFR can also be applied to other …,Pattern Recognition; 2006.

A meta-index to integrate specific indexes: application to multimedia,Ilaria Bartolini; Paolo Ciaccia; Lei Chen; Vincent Oria,Abstract Although applications such as news; e-learning; ecommerce require multimediadata of different types to coexist; data for each media type are often managed separatelybecause technically they do not have much in common. The common approach for providingthe user with an integrated multimedia database is to build an application layer that presentsa unified interface and deals with the right mono-medium sub-system depending on the userrequest. The problem is that this approach does not fully integrate the underlying systems.Another solution is to push the integration into the query processor. This second approachnecessitates to have access to the query processor which is not always possible especially ifthe multimedia system is using a commercial DBMS underneath. In this paper; we propose ameta-index that hosts different specific indexes and integrates the sub-query results to be …,12th International Conference on Distributed Multimedia Systems (DMS 2006),2006,1,12

A large-scale crowdsourcing task often consists of thousands ormillions of atomic tasks; each of which is usually a simple task such as binary choice orsimple voting. To distribute a large-scale crowdsourcing task to limited crowd workers; acommon practice is to pack a set of atomic tasks into a task bin and send to a crowd workerin a batch. It is challenging to decompose a large-scale crowdsourcing task and executebatches of atomic tasks; which ensures reliable answers at a minimal total cost. Largebatches lead to unreliable answers of atomic tasks; while small batches incur unnecessarycost. In this paper; we investigate a general crowdsourcing task decomposition problem;called the Smart Large-scAle task DEcomposer (SLADE) problem; which aims to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2018,*,12
On Efficiently Detecting Overlapping Communities over Distributed Dynamic Graphs,Xun Jian; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract: Modern networks are of huge sizes as well as high dynamics; which challenges theefficiency of community detection algorithms. In this paper; we study the problem ofoverlapping community detection on distributed and dynamic graphs. Given a distributed;undirected and unweighted graph; the goal is to detect overlapping communitiesincrementally as the graph is dynamically changing. We propose an efficient algorithm;called\textit {randomized Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm}(rSLPA); based onthe\textit {Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm}(SLPA) by relaxing the probabilitydistribution of label propagation. Besides detecting high-quality communities; rSLPA canincrementally update the detected communities after a batch of edge insertion and deletionoperations. To the best of our knowledge; rSLPA is the first algorithm that can …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.05946,2018,*,12
Domain-aware multi-truth discovery from conflicting sources,Xueling Lin; Lei Chen,Abstract In the Big Data era; truth discovery has served as a promising technique to solveconflicts in the facts provided by numerous data sources. The most significant challenge forthis task is to estimate source reliability and select the answers supported by high qualitysources. However; existing works assume that one data source has the same reliability onany kinds of entity; ignoring the possibility that a source may vary in reliability on differentdomains. To capture the influence of various levels of expertise in different domains; weintegrate domain expertise knowledge to achieve a more precise estimation of sourcereliability. We propose to infer the domain expertise of a data source based on its datarichness in different domains. We also study the mutual influence between domains; whichwill affect the inference of domain expertise. Through leveraging the unique features of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2018,*,12

Time-Aware Boolean Spatial Keyword Queries,Gang Chen; Jingwen Zhao; Yunjun Gao; Lei Chen; Rui Chen,With advances in geo-positioning technologies and mobile internet; location-based serviceshave attracted much attention; and spatial keyword queries are catching on fast. However;as far as we aware; no prior work considers the temporal information of geo-tagged objects.Temporal information is important in the spatial keyword query because many objects arenot always valid. For example; visitors may plan their trips according to the opening time ofattractions. In this paper; we identify and solve a novel problem; ie; the time-aware Booleanspatial keyword query (TABSKQ); which returns the $ k $ objects that satisfy users' spatio-temporal description and textual constraint. We first present pruning strategies and algorithmbased on the CIR $^{+} $-tree (ie; the CIR-tree with temporal information).

The improvement of these applications relies on effectivesolutions for social user access to videos. This fact has driven the research interest in therecommendation in shared communities. Though effort has been put into social videorecommendation; the contextual information on social users has not been well exploited foreffective recommendation. Motivated by this; in this paper; we propose a novel approachbased on the video content and user information for the recommendation in sharedcommunities. A new solution is developed by allowing batch video recommendation tomultiple new users and optimizing the subcommunity extraction. We first propose an …,The VLDB Journal,2017,*,5

Neighborhood constraints; specifying label pairs that areallowed to appear on adjacent vertices in the graph; are employed to detect and repairerroneous vertex labels and neighbors. In this paper; we study the problem of repairingvertex labels and neighbors to make graphs satisfy neighborhood constraints. Unfortunately;the problem is generally hard; which motivates us to devise approximation methods forrepairing and identify interesting special cases (star and clique constraints) that can beefficiently solved. First; we propose several label repairing approximation algorithms …,The VLDB Journal,2017,*,12
Spatial crowdsourcing: challenges; techniques; and applications,Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Crowdsourcing is a new computing paradigm where humans are actively enrolledto participate in the procedure of computing; especially for tasks that are intrinsically easierfor humans than for computers. The popularity of mobile computing and sharing economyhas extended conventional web-based crowdsourcing to spatial crowdsourcing (SC); wherespatial data such as location; mobility and the associated contextual information; plays acentral role. In fact; spatial crowdsourcing has stimulated a series of recent industrialsuccesses including Citizen Sensing (Waze); P2P ride-sharing (Uber) and Real-time Online-To-Offline (O2O) services (Instacart and Postmates). In this tutorial; we review the paradigmshift from web-based crowdsourcing to spatial crowdsourcing. We dive deep into thechallenges and techniques brought by the unique spatio-temporal characteristics of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*,21

Efficient SimRank-Based Similarity Join,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Graphs have been widely used to model complex data in many real-worldapplications. Answering vertex join queries over large graphs is meaningful and interesting;which can benefit friend recommendation in social networks and link prediction; and so on.In this article; we adopt “SimRank”[13] to evaluate the similarity between two vertices in alarge graph because of its generality. Note that “Simank” is purely structure dependent; andit does not rely on the domain knowledge. Specifically; we define a SimRank-based join(SRJ) query to find all vertex pairs satisfying the threshold from two sets of vertices U and V.To reduce the search space; we propose a shortest-path-distance-based upper bound forSimRank scores to prune unpromising vertex pairs. In the verification; we propose a novelindex; called h-go cover+; to efficiently compute the SimRank score of any single vertex …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2017,*,21
Discovering Conditional Matching Rules,Yihan Wang; Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng,Abstract Matching dependencies (MDs) have recently been proposed to make datadependencies tolerant to various information representations; and found useful in dataquality applications such as record matching. Instead of the strict equality function used intraditional dependency syntax (eg; functional dependencies); MDs specify constraints basedon similarity and identification. However; in practice; MDs may still be too strict andapplicable only in a subset of tuples in a relation. Thereby; we study the conditionalmatching dependencies (CMDs); which bind matching dependencies only in a certain partof a table; ie; MDs conditionally applicable in a subset of tuples. Compared to MDs; CMDshave more expressive power that enables them to satisfy wider application needs. In thisarticle; we study several important theoretical and practical issues of CMDs; including …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2017,*,5
An Efficient Probabilistic Approach for Graph Similarity Search,Zijian Li; Xun Jian; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract: Graph similarity search is a common and fundamental operation in graphdatabases. One of the most popular graph similarity measures is the Graph Edit Distance(GED) mainly because of its broad applicability and high interpretability. Despite itsprevalence; exact GED computation is proved to be NP-hard; which could result inunsatisfactory computational efficiency on large graphs. However; exactly accurate searchresults are usually unnecessary for real-world applications especially when theresponsiveness is far more important than the accuracy. Thus; in this paper; we propose anovel probabilistic approach to efficiently estimate GED; which is further leveraged for thegraph similarity search. Specifically; we first take branches as elementary structures ingraphs; and introduce a novel graph similarity measure by comparing branches between …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.05476,2017,*,10

Utility-Aware Ridesharing on Road Networks,Peng Cheng; Hao Xin; Lei Chen,Abstract Ridesharing enables drivers to share any empty seats in their vehicles with riders toimprove the efficiency of transportation for the benefit of both drivers and riders. Differentfrom existing studies in ridesharing that focus on minimizing the travel costs of vehicles; weconsider that the satisfaction of riders (the utility values) is more important nowadays. Thus;we formulate the problem of utility-aware ridesharing on road networks (URR) with the goalof providing the optimal rider schedules for vehicles to maximize the overall utility; subject tospatial-temporal and capacity constraints. To assign a new rider to a given vehicle; wepropose an efficient algorithm with a minimum increase in travel cost without reordering theexisting schedule of the vehicle. We prove that the URR problem is NP-hard by reducing itfrom the 0-1 Knapsack problem and it is unlikely to be approximated within any constant …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,*,20
CrowdFusion: A Crowdsourced Approach on Data Fusion Refinement,Yunfan Chen; Lei Chen; Chen Jason Zhang,Data fusion has played an important role in data mining because high quality data isrequired in a lot of applications. As on-line data may be out-of-date and errors in the datamay propagate with copying and referring between sources; it is hard to achieve satisfyingresults with merely applying existing data fusion methods to fuse Web data. In this paper; wemake use of the crowd to achieve high quality data fusion result. We design a frameworkselecting a set of tasks to ask crowds in order to improve the confidence of data. Since dataare correlated and crowds may provide incorrect answers; how to select a proper set of tasksto ask the crowd is a very challenging problem. In this paper; we design an approximationsolution to address this challenge since we prove that the problem is at NP-hard. To furtherimprove the efficiency; we design a pruning strategy and a preprocessing method; which …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,*,12
Response to “Differential Dependencies Revisited”,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen,Abstract A recent article &lsqb; Vincent et al. 2015&rsqb; concerns the correctness of severalresults in reasoning about differential dependencies (dds); originally reported in Song andChen &lsqb; 2011&rsqb;. The major concern by Vincent et al. &lsqb; 2015&rsqb; roots fromassuming a type of infeasible differential functions in the given dds for consistency andimplication analysis; which are not allowed in Song and Chen &lsqb; 2011&rsqb;. Adifferential function is said to be infeasible if there is no tuple pair with values that can satisfythe specified distance constraints. For example; &lsqb; price (< 2;> 4) &rsqb; requires thedifference of two price values to be< 2 and> 4 at the same time; which is clearly impossible.Although dds involving infeasible differential functions may be syntactically interesting; theyare semantically meaningless and would neither be specified by domain experts nor …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2017,*,12
Worker Recommendation for Crowdsourced Q&A Services: A Triple-Factor Aware Approach,Zheng Liu; Lei Chen,ABSTRACT Worker Recommendation (WR) is one of the most important functions forcrowdsourced Q&A services. Specifically; given a set of tasks to be solved; WR recommendseach task with a certain group of workers; whom are expected to give timely answers withhigh qualities. To address the WR problem; recent studies have introduced a number ofrecommendation approaches; which take advantage of workers' expertises or preferencestowards different types of tasks. However; without a thorough consideration of workers'characters; such approaches will lead to either inadequate task fulfillment or inferior answerquality. In this work; we propose the Triple-factor Aware Worker Recommendationframework; which collectively considers workers' expertises; preferences and activenessesto maximize the overall production of high quality answers.

Object identification with Pay-As-You-Go crowdsourcing,Ting Wu; Chen Jason Zhang; Lei Chen; Pan Hui; Siyuan Liu,The conventional crowdsourcing paradigm requires an explicit task description and paymentscheme. Requesters can then easily determine whether the crowdsourced results aresatisfactory; and workers will have a fairly clear expectation of the monetary reward once thetask is accomplished. However; such a paradigm becomes problematic when it is applied toObject Identification (OI) tasks. First; for OI tasks; it is difficult for requesters to evaluatewhether sufficient numbers of objects have been found by an individual worker; warrantingpayment. Second; the same objects can be detected by many workers and ending up beingunnecessary workload and inefficient performance. In this paper; we design a newcrowdsourcing paradigm for OI tasks. Designing such a paradigm is challenging. Firstly; aneasily-detected object can be found by multiple workers; which leads to an unfair situation …,Big Data (Big Data); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,*,12
FROG: A Fast and Reliable Crowdsourcing Framework (Technical Report),Peng Cheng; Xiang Lian; Xun Jian; Lei Chen,Abstract: For decades; the crowdsourcing has gained much attention from both academiaand industry; which outsources a number of tasks to human workers. Existing worksconsidered improving the task accuracy through voting or learning methods; they usually didnot fully take into account reducing the latency of the task completion. When a task requesterposts a group of tasks (eg; sentiment analysis); and one can only obtain answers of all tasksafter the last task is accomplished. As a consequence; the time delay of even one task in thisgroup could delay the next step of the task requester's work from minutes to days; which isquite undesirable for the task requester. Inspired by the importance of the task accuracy andlatency; in this paper; we will propose a novel crowdsourcing framework; namely Fast andReliable crOwdsourcinG framework (FROG); which intelligently assigns tasks to workers …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.08411,2016,*,5
A Survey on Accessing Dataspaces,Yihan Wang; Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen,Abstract Dataspaces provide a co-existence approach for heterogeneous data.Relationships among these heterogeneous data are often incrementally identified; such asobject associations or attribute synonyms. With the different degree of relationshipsrecognized; various query answers may be obtained. In this paper; we review the majortechniques for processing and optimizing queries in dataspaces; according to their differentabilities of handling relationships; including 1) simple search query without consideringrelationships; 2) association query over object associations; 3) heterogeneity query withattribute correspondences; and 4) similarity query for similar objects. Techniques such asindexing; query rewriting; expansion; and semantic query optimization are discussed forthese query types. Finally; we highlight possible directions in accessing dataspaces.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2016,*,12
Efficient Set-Correlation Operator Inside Databases,Fei Gao; Shao-Xu Song; Lei Chen; Jian-Min Wang,Abstract Large scale of short text records are now prevalent; such as news highlights;scientific paper citations; and posted messages in a discussion forum; and are often storedas set records in hidden-Web databases. Many interesting information retrieval tasks arecorrespondingly raised on the correlation query over these short text records; such asfinding hot topics over news highlights and searching related scientific papers on a certaintopic. However; current relational database management systems (RDBMS) do not directlyprovide support on set correlation query. Thus; in this paper; we address both theeffectiveness and the efficiency issues of set correlation query over set records in databases.First; we present a framework of set correlation query inside databases.

Continuous Answering Holistic Queries over Sensor Networks,Kebin Liu; Lei Chen; Yunhao Liu; Wei Gong; Amiya Nayak,Sensor networks are widely used in various domains like the intelligent transportationsystems. Users issue queries to sensors and collect sensing data. Due to the low qualitysensing devices or random link failures; sensor data are often noisy. In order to increase thereliability of the query results; continuous queries are often employed. In this work we focuson continuous holistic queries like Median. Existing approaches are mainly designed for non-holistic queries like Average. However; it is not trivial to answer holistic ones due to their non-decomposable property. We first propose two schemes based on the data correlationbetween different rounds; with one for getting the exact answers and the other one forderiving the approximate results. We then combine the two proposed schemes into a hybridapproach; which is adaptive to the data changing speed. We evaluate this design through …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2016,*,12
Answering why-not questions on spatial keyword top-k queries/Chen Lei.,Lei Chen,Abstract With the continued proliferation of location-based services; a growing number ofweb-accessible data objects are geo-tagged and have text descriptions. Spatial keyword top-k queries retrieve k such objects with the best score according to a ranking function thattakes into account a query location and query keywords. However; it is in some casesdifficult for users to specify appropriate query parameters. After a user issues an initial queryand gets back the result; the user may find that some expected objects are missing and maywonder why. Answering the resulting why-not questions can aid users in retrieving betterresults and thus improve the overall utility of the query functionality. While spatial keywordquerying has been studied intensively; no proposals exist for how to offer users explanationsof why such expected objects are missing from results. In this dissertation; we take the first …,*,2016,*,10

Locality-aware allocation of multi-dimensional correlated files on the cloud platform,Xiaofei Zhang; Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Min Wang; Shicong Feng,Abstract The effective management of enormous data volumes on the Cloud platform hasattracted devoting research efforts. In this paper; we study the problem of allocating files withmultidimensional correlations on the Cloud platform; such that files can be retrieved andprocessed more efficiently. Currently; most prevailing Cloud file systems allocate datafollowing the principles of fault tolerance and availability; while inter-file correlations; ie filescorrelated with each other; are often neglected. As a matter of fact; data files are commonlycorrelated in various ways in real practices. And correlated files are most likely to beinvolved in the same computation process. Therefore; it raises a new challenge of allocatingfiles with multi-dimensional correlations with the “subspace locality” taken into considerationto improve the system throughput.

Privacy and Ethical Issues in Social Network Analysis,Lei Chen; Mingxuan Yuan,Abstract Nowadays; more and more people join social networks; such as Facebook;Linkedin; and Livespace; to share information and to monitor or participate in differentactivities. This gives people a great opportunity to obtain useful information from these socialnetwork data. Meanwhile; the information stored in these social networks are under high riskof attack by various malicious users; in other words; people's privacy could be easilybreached via some domain knowledge. Thus; for a service provider; such as Facebook andLinkedin; how to publish a privacy preserving graph becomes an important problem. It isessential to protect users' privacy and at the same time provide “useful” data. Targeting theprivacy preserving graph publication problem; in this chapter; we introduce graph publishingmodels; which cover different aspects of graph publication issues.,*,2014,*,12

Weighting tags and paths in XML documents according to their topic generalization,Dexi Liu; Changxuan Wan; Lei Chen; Xiping Liu; Jian-Yun Nie,Abstract Text-centric (or document-centric) XML document retrieval aims to rank searchresults according to their relevance to a given query. To do this; most existing methodsmainly rely on content terms and often ignore an important factor–the XML tags and paths;which are useful in determining the important contents of a document. In some previousstudies; each unique tag/path is assigned a weight based on domain (expert) knowledge.However; such a manual assignment is both inefficient and subjective. In this paper; wepropose an automatic method to infer the weights of tags/paths according to the topicalrelationship between the corresponding elements and the whole documents. The more thecorresponding element can generalize the document's topic; the more the tag/path isconsidered to be important.

Graph publication when the protection algorithm is available,Mingxuan Yuan; Lei Chen; Hong Mei,Abstract With the popularity of social networks; the privacy issues related with social networkdata become more and more important. The connection information between users; as wellas their sensitive attributes; should be protected. There are some proposals studying how topublish a privacy preserving graph. However; when the algorithm which generates thepublished graph is known by the attacker; the current protection models may still leak someconnection information. In this paper; we propose a new protection model; named Semi-Edge Anonymity to protect both user's sensitive attributes and connection information evenwhen an attacker knows the publication algorithm. Moreover; Semi-Edge Anonymity modelcan plug in any state-of-the-art protection model for tabular data to protect sensitive labels.We theoretically prove that on two utilities; the possible world size and the true edge ratio …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2013,*,15

Managing the Wisdom of Crowds on Social Media Services,Lei Chen,Abstract Recently; the “Wisdom of Crowds” has attracted a huge amount of interests fromboth research and industrial communities. For the current stage; most of focus has been puton several specific crowdsourcing marketplaces like Amazon MTurk or CrowdFlower; onwhich “requesters” publish tasks and “workers” select tasks according to their own benefits.However; users on social media services can also serve as candidate “workers” forcrowdsourcing tasks; and it is possible for the “requesters” to actively manage the qualityand cost of such crowds. In this tutorial; we will first review the basic concept ofcrowdsourcing and its applications. Then; we will discuss the current popular crowdsourcingplatforms and several interesting crowdsourcing related algorithms. Finally; we will discussthe benefits of using social media services as the crowdsourcing platform and propose …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2013,*,21
Privacy preserving graph publication in a distributed environment,Mingxuan Yuan; Lei Chen; S Yu Philip; Hong Mei,Abstract Recently; many works studied how to publish privacy preserving social networksfor” safely” data mining or analysis. These works all assume that there exists a singlepublisher who holds the complete graph. While; in real life; people join different socialnetworks for different purposes. As a result; there are a group of publishers and each of themholds only a subgraph. Since no one has the complete graph; it is a challenging problem togenerate the published graph in a distributed environment without releasing any publisher'slocal content. In this paper; we propose a SMC (Secure Multi-Party Computation) basedprotocol to publish a privacy preserving graph in a distributed environment. Our scheme canpublish a privacy preserving graph without leaking the local content information andmeanwhile achieve the maximum graph utility. We show the effectiveness of the protocol …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2013,*,12

Query processing over uncertain and probabilistic databases,Lei Chen; Xiang Lian,Abstract Recently; query processing over uncertain data has become increasingly importantin many real applications like location-based services (LBS); sensor network monitoring;object identification; and moving object search. In many of these applications; data areinherently uncertain and imprecise; thus; we can either assign a probability to each dataobject or model each object as an uncertainty region. Based on these models; we have to re-define and study queries over uncertain data. In this tutorial; we will first introduce datamodels that are used to model uncertain and probabilistic data. Then; we will discussvarious types of queries together with their query processing techniques. After that; we willintroduce recent trends on query processing over uncertain non-traditional databases; suchas sets and graphs. Finally; we will highlight some future research directions.

Answering Aggregate Queries Over Large RDF Graphs,Lei Zou; Ruizhe Huang; Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu; Dongyan Zhao,ABSTRACT In this paper; we develop a graph-based methodology for processing aggregateSPARQL queries. The recent version of SPARQL specification (SPARQL 1.1) includesaggregation queries as aa core requirement. However; few existing works and SPARQLengines consider aggregate queries. We decompose each query into a set of star aggregatequeries whose results are combined to achieve the final aggregate results. We developindex structures and processing algorithms for efficient evaluation of aggregation queries.Extensive experiments on both real and benchmark datasets confirm the efficiency of ourmethod.,*,2012,*,10

Privacy-preserved network data publishing,Lei Chen,Abstract Nowadays; more and more people join multiple social networks on the Web; suchas Facebook; Linkedin; and Livespace; to share their own information and at the same timeto monitor or participate in different activities. Meanwhile; the information stored in the socialnetworks are under high risk of attack by various malicious users; in other words; peoplesprivacy could be easily breached via some domain knowledge. Thus; as a service provider;such as Facebook and Linkedin; it is essential to protect users privacy and at the same timeprovide useful data. Simply removing all identifiable personal information (such as namesand social security number) before releasing the data is insufficient. It is easy for an attackerto identify the target by performing different structural queries.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,*,10

Answering constrained k-NN queries in unstructured P2P systems,Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Sean X Wang; Xuemin Lin; Ge Yu,Abstract The processing of k-NN queries has been studied extensively both in a centralizedcomputing environment and in a structured P2P environment. However; the problem over anunstructured P2P system is not well studied despite of their popularity. Communication-efficient processing of k-NN queries in such an environment is a unique challenge due to thedistribution; dynamics and large scale of the system. In this paper; we investigate theproblem of efficiently computing k-NN queries over unstructured P2P systems. We firstpropose a location-based domination model to determine a search space. We then presenttwo types of probing strategies; radius-convergence and radius-expanding. Acomprehensive performance study demonstrates that our techniques are efficient andscalable.,*,2007,*,6
Continuous Monitoring of Outliers Over High Speed Stream Time Series,Yingyi Bu; Lei Chen; Ada Wai-chee Fu,ABSTRACT Lately there exist increasing demands on stream time series management. Theproblem of real-time and continuous abnormal sequential pattern monitoring over streamtime series arises from many online data analysis and cleaning applications; including highspeed sensory; medical; financial; industrial; trajectory streams and so on. This problem isan emerging research issue due to the specific requirement of high speed data processing.An entwined problem is that memory for the outlier monitoring is usually limited; as more andmore computationally limited and memory-wise constrained embedded devices for themonitoring tasks are of massive demands in the industries. This paper presents a novelframework for monitoring outliers over high speed stream time series; where both the timeand memory efficiencies are considered. To our knowledge; this is the first work to …,*,2007,*,3
Efficient methods on predictions for similarity search over stream time series,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Due to the wide usage of stream time series; an efficient and effective similarity search overstream data becomes essential for many applications. Although many approaches havebeen proposed for searching through archived data; because of the unique characteristics ofthe stream; for example; data are frequently updated; traditional methods may not work forthe stream time series. Especially; for the cases where the arrival of data is often delayed forvarious reasons; for example; the communication congestion or batch processing and so on;queries on such incomplete time series or even future time series may result in inaccuracy.Therefore; in this paper we propose two approaches; polynomial and probabilistic; to predictthe unknown values that have not arrived at the system. We also present efficient indexes;that is; a multidimensional hash index and B+-tree; to facilitate the prediction and …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2006. 18th International Conference on,2006,*,12
Rebirth of Worn Atomic Force Microscopy Silicon Tips,H Xu; R Wang; L Guo; X Wang; H Chen; J Liang,Commercially available Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) silicon probe tips are easily wornwhen being used for imaging. The structural and mechanical properties of carbonnanotubes make them ideal tips for AFM. To reuse the worn silicon tips; carbon nanotubetips were successfully fabricated by imaging the nanotubes-covered wafers in tapping modeof AFM by using worn silicon tips with diameters more than 200 nm. Carbon nanotube tipsare composed of bundles of single-walled carbon nanotubes and have diameters of 5~ 20nm. Carbon nanotube tips showed higher resolution and stability than new silicon tips whenimaging a 10 nm thick Au film on silicon surface. This method is an effectively simple methodfor rebirth of worn silicon tips.,Chinese Journal of Inorganic Chemistry,2006,*,10

Primary hyperaldosteronism. Update on a topic of physiopathology and clinical features,T Lima; F Bottino; P Calvelli; C Berardi; P Ajmone-Catt; GM Molinatti; P Limone,Abstract The authors examine the various forms of primary hyperaldosteronism; outlining themost recent acquisitions in terms of etiopathogenesis and physiopathology. While Conn'soriginal description of primary hyperaldosteronism is a syndrome based on corticoadrenalaldosteronesecreting adenoma; it was later seen that this condition could recognise otheranatomic substrates; such as carcinoma and in particular bilateral corticoadrenalhyperplasia. A peculiar form of the latter can be suppressed with glucocorticoids sustainedby an anomalous recombination of aldosterone-synthase and 11-beta-hydroxylase. Themain focus in this paper is on clinical management; in particular the current diagnosticcriteria which show that primary hyperaldosteronism affects a higher percentage of thehypertense population that was estimated in the past.

An Efficient Probabilistic Approach for Graph Similarity Search [Extended Technical Report],Zijian Li; Xun Jian; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract—Graph similarity search is a common and fundamental operation in graphdatabases. One of the most popular graph similarity measures is the Graph Edit Distance(GED) mainly because of its broad applicability and high interpretability. Despite itsprevalence; exact GED computation is proved to be NP-hard; which could result inunsatisfactory computational efficiency on large graphs. However; exactly accurate searchresults are usually unnecessary for real-world applications especially when theresponsiveness is far more important than the accuracy. Thus; in this paper; we propose anovel probabilistic approach to efficiently estimate GED; which is further leveraged for thegraph similarity search. Specifically; we first take branches as elementary structures ingraphs; and introduce a novel graph similarity measure by comparing branches between …,*,*,*,18
Subscription Privacy Protection in Topic-based Publish/Subscribe Systems,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Mingxuan Yuan,Abstract. Topic-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is a popular paradigm to decouplemessage producers and consumers with the help of brokers. However; third-party brokersmay be hacked; sniffed; subpoenaed; or impersonated. Thus; the brokers cannot be trusted.In particular; the collusion attack between compromised subscribers and untrusted brokerseasily exposes the privacy of honest subscribers. Given the untrusted brokers and collusionattacks; traditional security techniques alone cannot protect subscribers' privacy. Byadopting the k-anonymity model to the topic-based pub/sub; we propose to use cloakedsubscriptions to blur subscribers' real interests. Such cloaked could protect the subscriptionprivacy but meanwhile incur high forward cost. Thus; we want to minimize the forwardingcost meanwhile satisfying the privacy requirement; and formulate an integer programming …,*,*,*,12

Therefore; it has become increasingly demanding to develop efficient techniques todiscover useful patterns from such data streams. Among many issues; analyzing thecorrelation between two data streams is an important technique to study linear co-movements of two data streams [11; 9]. Yet; lagged correlation further captures lagged co-movements between time-evolving streams [4; 6]; which is especially useful for forecastingand monitoring.
