Evaluating probabilistic queries over imprecise data,Reynold Cheng; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract Many applications employ sensors for monitoring entities such as temperature andwind speed. A centralized database tracks these entities to enable query processing. Due tocontinuous changes in these values and limited resources (eg; network bandwidth andbattery power); it is often infeasible to store the exact values at all times. A similar situationexists for moving object environments that track the constantly changing locations of objects.In this environment; it is possible for database queries to produce incorrect or invalid resultsbased upon old data. However; if the degree of error (or uncertainty) between the actualvalue and the database value is controlled; one can place more confidence in the answersto queries. More generally; query answers can be augmented with probabilistic estimates ofthe validity of the answers. In this paper we study probabilistic query evaluation based …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,737,10
Querying imprecise data in moving object environments,Reynold Cheng; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sunil Prabhakar,In moving object environments; it is infeasible for the database tracking the movement ofobjects to store the exact locations of objects at all times. Typically; the location of an objectis known with certainty only at the time of the update. The uncertainty in its locationincreases until the next update. In this environment; it is possible for queries to produceincorrect results based upon old data. However; if the degree of uncertainty is controlled;then the error of the answers to queries can be reduced. More generally; query answers canbe augmented with probabilistic estimates of the validity of the answer. We study theexecution of probabilistic range and nearest-neighbor queries. The imprecision in answersto queries is an inherent property of these applications due to uncertainty in data; unlike thetechniques for approximate nearest-neighbor processing that trade accuracy for …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,589,21
Indexing multi-dimensional uncertain data with arbitrary probability density functions,Yufei Tao; Reynold Cheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Wang Kay Ngai; Ben Kao; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract In an" uncertain database"; an object o is associated with a multi-dimensionalprobability density function (pdf); which describes the likelihood that o appears at eachposition in the data space. A fundamental operation is the" probabilistic range search"which; given a value pq and a rectangular area rq; retrieves the objects that appear in rqwith probabilities at least p q. In this paper; we propose the U-tree; an access methoddesigned to optimize both the I/O and CPU time of range retrieval on multi-dimensionalimprecise data. The new structure is fully dynamic (ie; objects can be incrementallyinserted/deleted in any order); and does not place any constraints on the data pdfs. Weverify the query and update efficiency of U-trees with extensive experiments.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,350,12
Efficient indexing methods for probabilistic threshold queries over uncertain data,Reynold Cheng; Yuni Xia; Sunil Prabhakar; Rahul Shah; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,Abstract It is infeasible for a sensor database to contain the exact value of each sensor at allpoints in time. This uncertainty is inherent in these systems due to measurement andsampling errors; and resource limitations. In order to avoid drawing erroneous conclusionsbased upon stale data; the use of uncertainty intervals that model each data item as a rangeand associated probability density function (pdf) rather than a single value has recently beenproposed. Querying these uncertain data introduces imprecision into answers; in the form ofprobability values that specify the likeliness the answer satisfies the query. These queriesare more expensive to evaluate than their traditional counterparts but are guaranteed to becorrect and more informative due to the probabilities accompanying the answers. Althoughthe answer probabilities are useful; for many applications; it is only necessary to know …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,334,12
Preserving user location privacy in mobile data management infrastructures,Reynold Cheng; Yu Zhang; Elisa Bertino; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract Location-based services; such as finding the nearest gas station; require users tosupply their location information. However; a user's location can be tracked without herconsent or knowledge. Lowering the spatial and temporal resolution of location data sent tothe server has been proposed as a solution. Although this technique is effective in protectingprivacy; it may be overkill and the quality of desired services can be severely affected. In thispaper; we suggest a framework where uncertainty can be controlled to provide high qualityand privacy-preserving services; and investigate how such a framework can be realized inthe GPS and cellular network systems. Based on this framework; we suggest a data model toaugment uncertainty to location data; and propose imprecise queries that hide the locationof the query issuer and yields probabilistic results. We investigate the evaluation and …,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2006,315,11
Efficient clustering of uncertain data,Wang Kay Ngai; Ben Kao; Chun Kit Chui; Reynold Cheng; Michael Chau; Kevin Y Yip,We study the problem of clustering data objects whose locations are uncertain. A data objectis represented by an uncertainty region over which a probability density function (pdf) isdefined. One method to cluster uncertain objects of this sort is to apply the UK-meansalgorithm; which is based on the traditional K-means algorithm. In UK-means; an object isassigned to the cluster whose representative has the smallest expected distance to theobject. For arbitrary pdf; calculating the expected distance between an object and a clusterrepresentative requires expensive integration computation. We study various pruningmethods to avoid such expensive expected distance calculation.,Data Mining; 2006. ICDM'06. Sixth International Conference on,2006,291,0
Uncertain data mining: An example in clustering location data,Michael Chau; Reynold Cheng; Ben Kao; Jackey Ng,Abstract Data uncertainty is an inherent property in various applications due to reasons suchas outdated sources or imprecise measurement. When data mining techniques are appliedto these data; their uncertainty has to be considered to obtain high quality results. Wepresent UK-means clustering; an algorithm that enhances the K-means algorithm to handledata uncertainty. We apply UK-means to the particular pattern of moving-object uncertainty.Experimental results show that by considering uncertainty; a clustering algorithm canproduce more accurate results.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2006,198,18
Probabilistic verifiers: Evaluating constrained nearest-neighbor queries over uncertain data,Reynold Cheng; Jinchuan Chen; Mohamed Mokbel; Chi-Yin Chow,In applications like location-based services; sensor monitoring and biological databases; thevalues of the database items are inherently uncertain in nature. An important query foruncertain objects is the Probabilistic Nearest-Neighbor Query (PNN); which computes theprobability of each object for being the nearest neighbor of a query point. Evaluating thisquery is computationally expensive; since it needs to consider the relationship amonguncertain objects; and requires the use of numerical integration or Monte-Carlo methods.Sometimes; a query user may not be concerned about the exact probability values. Forexample; he may only need answers that have sufficiently high confidence. We thus proposethe Constrained Nearest-Neighbor Query (C-PNN); which returns the IDs of objects whoseprobabilities are higher than some threshold; with a given error bound in the answers …,Data Engineering; 2008.

Range search on multidimensional uncertain data,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Reynold Cheng,Abstract In an uncertain database; every object o is associated with a probability densityfunction; which describes the likelihood that o appears at each position in amultidimensional workspace. This article studies two types of range retrieval fundamental tomany analytical tasks. Specifically; a nonfuzzy query returns all the objects that appear in asearch region rq with at least a certain probability t q. On the other hand; given an uncertainobject q; fuzzy search retrieves the set of objects that are within distance &epsiv; q from qwith no less than probability t q. The core of our methodology is a novel concept of“probabilistically constrained rectangle”; which permits effective pruning/validation ofnonqualifying/qualifying data. We develop a new index structure called the U-tree forminimizing the query overhead. Our algorithmic findings are accompanied with a …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,153,19
Efficient evaluation of imprecise location-dependent queries,Jinchuan Chen; Reynold Cheng,In location-based services; it is common for a user to issue a query based on his/her currentposition. One such example is" find the available cabs within two miles of my currentlocation". Very often; the query issuers' locations are imprecise due to measurement error;sampling error; or message delay. They may also want to protect their privacy by providing aless precise location. In this paper; we study the efficiency of queries that return probabilisticguarantees for location data with uncertainty. We classify this query into two types; based onwhether the data (1) has no uncertainty (eg; shops and restaurants); or (2) has a controlleddegree of uncertainty (eg; moving vehicles). Based on this classification; we develop threemethods to improve the computational and I/O performance. The first method expands thequery range based on the query issuer's uncertainty. The second idea exchanges the …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,139,21
Mining uncertain data with probabilistic guarantees,Liwen Sun; Reynold Cheng; David W Cheung; Jiefeng Cheng,Abstract Data uncertainty is inherent in applications such as sensor monitoring systems;location-based services; and biological databases. To manage this vast amount of impreciseinformation; probabilistic databases have been recently developed. In this paper; we studythe discovery of frequent patterns and association rules from probabilistic data under thePossible World Semantics. This is technically challenging; since a probabilistic databasecan have an exponential number of possible worlds. We propose two effcient algorithms;which discover frequent patterns in bottom-up and top-down manners. Both algorithms canbe easily extended to discover maximal frequent patterns. We also explain how to use thesepatterns to generate association rules. Extensive experiments; using real and syntheticdatasets; were conducted to validate the performance of our methods.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,134,10
U-DBMS: A database system for managing constantly-evolving data,Reynold Cheng; Sarvjeet Singh; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract In many systems; sensors are used to acquire information from externalenvironments such as temperature; pressure and locations. Due to continuous changes inthese values; and limited resources (eg; network bandwidth and battery power); it is ofteninfeasible for the database to store the exact values at all times. Queries that uses these oldvalues can produce invalid results. In order to manage the uncertainty between the actualsensor value and the database value; we propose a system called U-DBMS. U-DBMSextends the database system with uncertainty management functionalities. In particular;each data value is represented as an interval and a probability distribution function; and itcan be processed with probabilistic query operators to produce imprecise (but correct)answers.

Naive bayes classification of uncertain data,Jiangtao Ren; Sau Dan Lee; Xianlu Chen; Ben Kao; Reynold Cheng; David Cheung,Traditional machine learning algorithms assume that data are exact or precise. However;this assumption may not hold in some situations because of data uncertainty arising frommeasurement errors; data staleness; and repeated measurements; etc. With uncertainty; thevalue of each data item is represented by a probability distribution function (pdf). In thispaper; we propose a novel naive Bayes classification algorithm for uncertain data with a pdf.Our key solution is to extend the class conditional probability estimation in the Bayes modelto handle pdf's. Extensive experiments on UCI datasets show that the accuracy of naiveBayes model can be improved by taking into account the uncertainty information.,Data Mining; 2009. ICDM'09.

Efficient join processing over uncertain data,Reynold Cheng; Sarvjeet Singh; Sunil Prabhakar; Rahul Shah; Jeffrey Scott Vitter; Yuni Xia,Abstract In many applications data values are inherently uncertain. This includes moving-objects; sensors and biological databases. There has been recent interest in thedevelopment of database management systems that can handle uncertain data. Someproposals for such systems include attribute values that are uncertain. In particular; anattribute value can be modeled as a range of possible values; associated with a probabilitydensity function. Previous efforts for this type of data have only addressed simple queriessuch as range and nearest-neighbor queries. Queries that join multiple relations have notbeen addressed in earlier work despite the significance of joins in databases. In this paperwe address join queries over uncertain data. We propose a semantics for the join operation;define probabilistic operators over uncertain data; and propose join algorithms that …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,117,21
Reducing UK-means to K-means,Sau Dan Lee; Ben Kao; Reynold Cheng,This paper proposes an optimisation to the UK-means algorithm; which generalises the k-means algorithm to han-dle objects whose locations are uncertain. The location of eachobject is described by a probability density function (pdf). The UK-means algorithm needs tocompute expected distances (EDs) between each object and the cluster repre-sentatives.The evaluation of ED from first principles is very costly operation; because the pdf's aredifferent and arbi-trary. But UK-means needs to evaluate a lot of EDs. This is a majorperformance burden of the algorithm. In this pa-per; we derive a formula for evaluating EDsefficiently. This tremendously reduces the execution time of UK-means; as demonstrated byour preliminary experiments. We also il-lustrate that this optimised formula effectivelyreduces the UK-means problem to the traditional clustering algorithm addressed by the k …,Data Mining Workshops; 2007. ICDM Workshops 2007.

Database support for probabilistic attributes and tuples,Sarvjeet Singh; Chris Mayfield; Rahul Shah; Sunil Prabhakar; Susanne Hambrusch; Jennifer Neville; Reynold Cheng,The inherent uncertainty of data present in numerous applications such as sensordatabases; text annotations; and information retrieval motivate the need to handle imprecisedata at the database level. Uncertainty can be at the attribute or tuple level and is present inboth continuous and discrete data domains. This paper presents a model for handlingarbitrary probabilistic uncertain data (both discrete and continuous) natively at the databaselevel. Our approach leads to a natural and efficient representation for probabilistic data. Wedevelop a model that is consistent with possible worlds semantics and closed under basicrelational operators. This is the first model that accurately and efficiently handles bothcontinuous and discrete uncertainty. The model is implemented in a real database system(PostgreSQL) and the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach is validated …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

On querying historical evolving graph sequences,Chenghui Ren; Eric Lo; Ben Kao; Xinjie Zhu; Reynold Cheng,ABSTRACT In many applications; information is best represented as graphs. In a dynamicworld; information changes and so the graphs representing the information evolve with time.We propose that historical graph-structured data be maintained for analytical processing.We call a historical evolving graph sequence an EGS. We observe that in many applications;graphs of an EGS are large and numerous; and they often exhibit much redundancy amongthem. We study the problem of efficient query processing on an EGS and put forward asolution framework called FVF. Through extensive experiments on both real and syntheticdatasets; we show that our FVF framework is highly efficient in EGS query processing.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,88,16
Managing uncertainty in sensor database,Reynold Cheng; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract Sensors are often employed to monitor continuously changing entities like locationsof moving objects and temperature. The sensor readings are reported to a centralizeddatabase system; and are subsequently used to answer queries. Due to continuouschanges in these values and limited resources (eg; network bandwidth and battery power);the database may not be able to keep track of the actual values of the entities; and use theold values instead. Queries that use these old values may produce incorrect answers.However; if the degree of uncertainty between the actual data value and the database valueis limited; one can place more confidence in the answers to the queries. In this paper; wepresent a frame-work that represents uncertainty of sensor data.

Cleaning uncertain data with quality guarantees,Reynold Cheng; Jinchuan Chen; Xike Xie,Abstract Uncertain or imprecise data are pervasive in applications like location-basedservices; sensor monitoring; and data collection and integration. For these applications;probabilistic databases can be used to store uncertain data; and querying facilities areprovided to yield answers with statistical confidence. Given that a limited amount ofresources is available to" clean" the database (eg; by probing some sensor data values toget their latest values); we address the problem of choosing the set of uncertain objects to becleaned; in order to achieve the best improvement in the quality of query answers. For thispurpose; we present the PWS-quality metric; which is a universal measure that quantifies theambiguity of query answers under the possible world semantics. We study how PWS-qualitycan be efficiently evaluated for two major query classes:(1) queries that examine the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,87,12

This issue is technicallychallenging; since an uncertain database contains an exponential number of possibleworlds. By observing that the mining process can be modeled as a Poisson binomialdistribution; we develop an approximate algorithm; which can efficiently and accuratelydiscover frequent item sets in a large uncertain database.

Evaluating probability threshold k-nearest-neighbor queries over uncertain data,Reynold Cheng; Lei Chen; Jinchuan Chen; Xike Xie,Abstract In emerging applications such as location-based services; sensor monitoring andbiological management systems; the values of the database items are naturally imprecise.For these uncertain databases; an important query is the Probabilistic k-Nearest-NeighborQuery (k-PNN); which computes the probabilities of sets of k objects for being the closest toa given query point. The evaluation of this query can be both computationally-and I/O-expensive; since there is an exponentially large number of k object-sets; and numericalintegration is required. Often a user may not be concerned about the exact probabilityvalues. For example; he may only need answers that have sufficiently high confidence. Wethus propose the Probabilistic Threshold k-Nearest-Neighbor Query (Tk-PNN); which returnssets of k objects that satisfy the query with probabilities higher than some threshold T …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,79,12

Minimizing the communication cost for continuous skyline maintenance,Zhenjie Zhang; Reynold Cheng; Dimitris Papadias; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Existing work in the skyline literature focuses on optimizing the processing cost.This paper aims at minimization of the communication overhead in client-serverarchitectures; where a server continuously maintains the skyline of dynamic objects. Our firstcontribution is a Filter method that avoids transmission of updates from objects that cannotinfluence the skyline. Specifically; each object is assigned a filter so that it needs to issue anupdate only if it violates its filter. Filter achieves significant savings over the naive approachof transmitting all updates. Going one step further; we introduce the concept of frequentskyline query over a sliding window (FSQW). The motivation is that snapshot skylines arenot very useful in streaming environments because they keep changing over time. Instead;FSQW reports the objects that appear in the skylines of at least θ⋅ s of the s most recent …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,59,3
Uncertain data mining: A new research direction,Michael Chau; Reynold Cheng; Ben Kao,Abstract Data uncertainty is often found in real-world applications due to reasons such asimprecise measurement; outdated sources; or sampling errors. Recently; much research hasbeen published in the area of managing data uncertainty in databases. We propose thatwhen data mining is performed on uncertain data; data uncertainty has to be considered inorder to obtain high quality data mining results. We call this the" Uncertain Data Mining"problem. In this paper; we present a framework for possible research directions in this area.We also present the UK-means clustering algorithm as an example to illustrate how thetraditional K-means algorithm can be modified to handle data uncertainty in data mining.,Proceedings of the Workshop on the Sciences of the Artificial; Hualien; Taiwan,2005,59,12
QASCA: A quality-aware task assignment system for crowdsourcing applications,Yudian Zheng; Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li; Reynold Cheng; Jianhua Feng,Abstract A crowdsourcing system; such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT); provides aplatform for a large number of questions to be answered by Internet workers. Such systemshave been shown to be useful to solve problems that are difficult for computers; includingentity resolution; sentiment analysis; and image recognition. In this paper; we investigate theonline task assignment problem: Given a pool of n questions; which of the k questionsshould be assigned to a worker? A poor assignment may not only waste time and money;but may also hurt the quality of a crowdsourcing application that depends on the workers'answers. We propose to consider quality measures (also known as evaluation metrics) thatare relevant to an application during the task assignment process.

Adaptive stream filters for entity-based queries with non-value tolerance,Reynold Cheng; Ben Kao; Sunil Prabhakar; Alan Kwan; Yicheng Tu,Abstract We study the problem of applying adaptive filters for approximate query processingin a distributed stream environment. We propose filter bound assignment protocols with theobjective of reducing communication cost. Most previous works focus on value-basedqueries (eg; average) with numerical error tolerance. In this paper; we cover entity-basedqueries (eg; nearest neighbor) with non-value-based error tolerance. We investigatedifferent non-value-based error tolerance definitions and discuss how they are applied totwo classes of entity-based queries: non-rank-based and rank-based queries. Extensiveexperiments show that our protocols achieve significant savings in both communicationoverhead and server computation.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,56,12
Energy-efficient monitoring of mobile objects with uncertainty-aware tolerances,Tobias Farrell; Reynold Cheng; Kurt Rothermel,In location-based services; continuous queries are often employed to monitor the locationsof mobile objects that are determined by sensing devices like GPS receivers. Due to limitedbattery resources; it is important for these objects to acquire and report location data only ifnecessary. We study how these energy-consuming operations can be reduced with acontrolled impact on query accuracy of continuous range queries (CRQs). Specifically; wedevelop uncertainty-aware tolerances; which are user-defined error bounds that providecorrectness guarantees; with consideration of different sources of data uncertainty: sensinguncertainty; sampling uncertainty; and communication delay. Novel algorithms aredeveloped to control carefully when an object should acquire and update a location; whilesatisfying these tolerances.

Online influence maximization,Siyu Lei; Silviu Maniu; Luyi Mo; Reynold Cheng; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Social networks are commonly used for marketing purposes. For example; freesamples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or seed nodes);with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it. One way to formalize thisobjective is through the problem of influence maximization (or IM); whose goal is to find thebest seed nodes to activate under a fixed budget; so that the number of people who getinfluenced in the end is maximized. Solutions to IM rely on the influence probability that auser influences another one. However; this probability information may be unavailable orincomplete. In this paper; we study IM in the absence of complete information on influenceprobability. We call this problem Online Influence Maximization (OIM); since we learninfluence probabilities at the same time we run influence campaigns. To solve OIM; we …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,47,16
Evaluation of concurrency control strategies for mixed soft real-time database systems,Kam-Yiu Lam; Tei-Wei Kuo; Ben Kao; Tony SH Lee; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Previous research in real-time concurrency control mainly focuses on theschedulability guarantee of hard real-time transactions and the reduction of the miss rate ofsoft real-time transactions. Although many new database applications have significantresponse time requirements; not much work has been done in the joint scheduling oftraditional non-real-time transactions and soft real-time transactions. In this paper; we studythe concurrency control problems in mixed soft real-time database systems; in which bothnon-real-time and soft real-time transactions exist simultaneously. The objectives are toidentify the cost and the performance tradeoff in the design of cost-effective and practicalreal-time concurrency control protocols; and to evaluate their performance under differentreal-time and non-real-time supports. In particular; we are interested in studying the …,Information Systems,2002,47,21
UV-diagram: A Voronoi diagram for uncertain data,Reynold Cheng; Xike Xie; Man Lung Yiu; Jinchuan Chen; Liwen Sun,The Voronoi diagram is an important technique for answering nearest-neighbor queries forspatial databases. In this paper; we study how the Voronoi diagram can be used onuncertain data; which are inherent in scientific and business applications. In particular; wepropose the Uncertain-Voronoi Diagram (or UV-diagram in short). Conceptually; the dataspace is divided into distinct “UV-partitions”; where each UV-partition P is associated with aset S of objects; any point q located in P has the set S as its nearest neighbor with non-zeroprobabilities. The UV-diagram facilitates queries that inquire objects for having non-zerochances of being the nearest neighbor of a given query point. It also allows analysis ofnearest neighbor information; eg; finding out how many objects are the nearest neighbors ina given area.

Maintaining temporal consistency of discrete objects in soft real-time database systems,Ben Kao; Kam-Yiu Lam; Brad Adelberg; Reynold Cheng; Tony Lee,A real-time database system contains base data items which record and model a physical;real-world environment. For better decision support; base data items are summarized andcorrelated to derive views. These base data and views are accessed by applicationtransactions to generate the ultimate actions taken by the system. As the environmentchanges; updates are applied to base data; which subsequently trigger viewrecomputations. There are thus three types of activities: base data update; viewrecomputation; and transaction execution. In a real-time database system; two timingconstraints need to be enforced. We require that transactions meet their deadlines(transaction timeliness) and read fresh data (data timeliness). In this paper; we define theconcept of absolute and relative temporal consistency from the perspective of …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2003,38,12
Change tolerant indexing for constantly evolving data,Reynold Cheng; Yuni Xia; Sunil Prabhakar; Rahul Shah,Index structures are designed to optimize search performance; while at the same timesupporting efficient data updates. Although not explicit; existing index structures are typicallybased upon the assumption that the rate of updates will be small compared to the rate ofquerying. This assumption is not valid in streaming data environments such as sensor andmoving object databases; where updates are received incessantly. In fact; for manyapplications; the rate of updates may well exceed the rate of querying. In such environments;index structures suffer from poor performance due to the large overhead of keeping theindex updated with the latest data. Recent efforts at indexing moving object data assumeobjects move in a restrictive manner (eg in straight lines with constant velocity).

Discovering meta-paths in large heterogeneous information networks,Changping Meng; Reynold Cheng; Silviu Maniu; Pierre Senellart; Wangda Zhang,Abstract The Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) is a graph data model in whichnodes and edges are annotated with class and relationship labels. Large and complexdatasets; such as Yago or DBLP; can be modeled as HINs. Recent work has studied how tomake use of these rich information sources. In particular; meta-paths; which representsequences of node classes and edge types between two nodes in a HIN; have beenproposed for such tasks as information retrieval; decision making; and productrecommendation. Current methods assume meta-paths are found by domain experts.However; in a large and complex HIN; retrieving meta-paths manually can be tedious anddifficult. We thus study how to discover meta-paths automatically. Specifically; users areasked to provide example pairs of nodes that exhibit high proximity.

On optimality of jury selection in crowdsourcing,Yudian Zheng; Reynold Cheng; Silviu Maniu; Luyi Mo,Recent advances in crowdsourcing technologies enable computationally challenging tasks(eg; sentiment analysis and entity resolution) to be performed by Internet workers; drivenmainly by monetary incentives. A fundamental question is: how should workers be selected;so that the tasks in hand can be accomplished successfully and economically? In this paper;we study the Jury Selection Problem (JSP): Given a monetary budget; and a set of decision-making tasks (eg;“Is Bill Gates still the CEO of Microsoft now?”); return the set of workers(called jury); such that their answers yield the highest “Jury Quality”(or JQ). Existing JSPsolutions make use of the Majority Voting (MV) strategy; which uses the answer chosen bythe largest number of workers. We show that MV does not yield the best solution for JSP.

Truth inference in crowdsourcing: is the problem solved?,Yudian Zheng; Guoliang Li; Yuanbing Li; Caihua Shan; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Crowdsourcing has emerged as a novel problem-solving paradigm; whichfacilitates addressing problems that are hard for computers; eg; entity resolution andsentiment analysis. However; due to the openness of crowdsourcing; workers may yield low-quality answers; and a redundancy-based method is widely employed; which first assignseach task to multiple workers and then infers the correct answer (called truth) for the taskbased on the answers of the assigned workers. A fundamental problem in this method isTruth Inference; which decides how to effectively infer the truth. Recently; the databasecommunity and data mining community independently study this problem and proposevarious algorithms. However; these algorithms are not compared extensively under thesame framework and it is hard for practitioners to select appropriate algorithms. To …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,29,12
Crowdsourced poi labelling: Location-aware result inference and task assignment,Huiqi Hu; Yudian Zheng; Zhifeng Bao; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Reynold Cheng,Identifying the labels of points of interest (POIs); aka POI labelling; provides significantbenefits in location-based services. However; the quality of raw labels manually added byusers or generated by artificial algorithms cannot be guaranteed. Such low-quality labelsdecrease the usability and result in bad user experiences. In this paper; by observing thatcrowdsourcing is a best-fit for computer-hard tasks; we leverage crowdsourcing to improvethe quality of POI labelling. To our best knowledge; this is the first work on crowdsourced POIlabelling tasks. In particular; there are two sub-problems:(1) how to infer the correct labels foreach POI based on workers' answers; and (2) how to effectively assign proper tasks toworkers in order to make more accurate inference for next available workers. To addressthese two problems; we propose a framework consisting of an inference model and an …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,27,12
On link-based similarity join,Liwen Sun; CK Cheng; Xiang Li; DWL Cheung; Jiawei Han,Graphs can be found in applications like social networks; bibliographic networks; andbiological databases. Understanding the relationship; or links; among graph nodes enablesapplications such as link prediction; recommendation; and spam detection. In this paper; wepropose link-based similarity join (LS-join); which extends the similarity join operator to link-based measures. Given two sets of nodes in a graph; the LS-join returns all pairs of nodesthat are highly similar to each other; with respect to an e-function. The e-function generalizescommon measures like Personalized PageRank (PPR) and SimRank (SR). We study anefficient LS-join algorithm on a large graph. We further improve our solutions for PPR andSR; which involve expensive randomwalk operations. We validate our solutions byperforming extensive experiments on three real graph datasets.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,27,19
Scalable processing of snapshot and continuous nearest-neighbor queries over one-dimensional uncertain data,Jinchuan Chen; Reynold Cheng; Mohamed Mokbel; Chi-Yin Chow,Abstract In several emerging and important applications; such as location-based services;sensor monitoring and biological databases; the values of the data items are inherentlyimprecise. A useful query class for these data is the Probabilistic Nearest-Neighbor Query(PNN); which yields the IDs of objects for being the closest neighbor of a query point;together with the objects' probability values. Previous studies showed that this query takes along time to evaluate. To address this problem; we propose the Constrained Nearest-Neighbor Query (C-PNN); which returns the IDs of objects whose probabilities are higherthan some threshold; with a given error bound in the answers. We show that the C-PNN canbe answered efficiently with verifiers. These are methods that derive the lower and upperbounds of answer probabilities; so that an object can be quickly decided on whether it …,The VLDB Journal,2009,27,10
Location privacy in moving-object environments,Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Reynold Cheng; Sunil Prabhakar,The expanding use of location-based services has profound implications on the privacy ofpersonal information. If no adequate protection is adopted; information about movements ofspecific individuals could be disclosed to unauthorized subjects or organizations; thusresulting in privacy breaches. In this paper; we propose a framework for preserving locationprivacy in moving-object environments. Our approach is based on the idea of sending to theservice provider suitably modified location information. Such modifications; that includetransformations like scaling; are performed by agents interposed between users and serviceproviders. Agents execute data transformation and the service provider directly processesthe transformed dataset. Our technique not only prevents the service provider from knowingthe exact locations of users; but also protects information about user movements and …,Transactions on Data Privacy,2009,27,3
An efficient location update mechanism for continuous queries over moving objects,Reynold Cheng; Kam-Yiu Lam; Sunil Prabhakar; Biyu Liang,Abstract In a moving-object database system that supports continuous queries (CQ); animportant problem is to keep the location data consistent with the actual locations of theentities being monitored; in order to produce correct query results. This goal is often difficultto achieve due to limited network resources. However; if an object is not required by anyquery; its value need not be refreshed. Based on this observation; we redefine the notion oftemporal consistency of data items with respect to the query result; where only data itemsthat are relevant to the CQs need to be fresh. To exploit this correctness definition; wedevelop an adaptive time-based update technique called query-result update (QRU). Theadvantage of this technique is that it identifies objects with different levels of significance tothe correctness of query results. Locations of objects that have more impact to the query …,Information Systems,2007,24,19
Meta structure: Computing relevance in large heterogeneous information networks,Zhipeng Huang; Yudian Zheng; Reynold Cheng; Yizhou Sun; Nikos Mamoulis; Xiang Li,Abstract A heterogeneous information network (HIN) is a graph model in which objects andedges are annotated with types. Large and complex databases; such as YAGO and DBLP;can be modeled as HINs. A fundamental problem in HINs is the computation of closeness; orrelevance; between two HIN objects. Relevance measures can be used in variousapplications; including entity resolution; recommendation; and information retrieval. Severalstudies have investigated the use of HIN information for relevance computation; however;most of them only utilize simple structure; such as path; to measure the similarity betweenobjects. In this paper; we propose to use meta structure; which is a directed acyclic graph ofobject types with edge types connecting in between; to measure the proximity betweenobjects. The strength of meta structure is that it can describe complex relationship …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2016,23,12
Updates and view maintenance in soft real-time database systems,Ben Kao; Kam-Yiu Lam; Brad Adelberg; Reynold Cheng; Tony Lee,Abstract A database system contains base data items which record and model a physical;real world environment. For better decision support; base data items are summarized andcorrelated to derive views. These base data and views are accessed by applicationtransactions to generate the ultimate actions taken by the system. As the environmentchanges; updates are applied to the base data; which subsequently trigger viewrecomputations. There are thus three types of activities: base data update; viewrecomputation; and transaction execution. In a real-time system; two timing constrains needto be enforced. We require transactions meet their deadlines (transaction timeliness) andread fresh data (data timeliness). In this paper we define the concept of absolute and relativetemporal consistency from the perspective of transactions. We address the important …,Proceedings of the eighth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1999,22,12
Processing continuous range queries with spatiotemporal tolerance,Tobias Farrell; Kurt Rothermel; Reynold Cheng,Continuous queries are often employed to monitor the locations of mobile objects (MOs);which are determined by sensing devices like GPS receivers. In this paper; we tackle twochallenges in processing continuous range queries (CRQs): coping with data uncertaintyinherently associated with location data; and reducing the energy consumption of battery-powered MOs. We propose the concept of spatiotemporal tolerance for CRQ to relax aquery's accuracy requirements in terms of a maximal acceptable error. Unlike previousworks; our definition considers tolerance in both the spatial and temporal dimensions; whichoffers applications more flexibility in specifying their individual accuracy requirements. As wewill show; these tolerance bounds can provide well-defined query semantics in spite ofdifferent sources of data uncertainty. In addition; we present efficient algorithms that …,ieee transactions on mobile computing,2011,21,3
Indexing continuously changing data with mean-variance tree,Yuni Xia; Sunil Prabhakar; Shan Lei; Reynold Cheng; Rahul Shah,Abstract Constantly evolving data arise in various mobile applications such as location-based services and sensor networks. The problem of indexing the data for efficient queryprocessing is of increasing importance. Due to the constant changing nature of the data;traditional indexes suffer from a high update overhead which leads to poor performance. Inthis paper; we propose a novel index structure; the MVTree; which is built based on themean and variance of the data instead of the actual data values that are in constant flux.Since the mean and variance are relatively stable features compared to the actual values;the MVTree significantly reduces the index update cost. The distribution interval andprobability distribution function of the data are not required to be known a priori. The meanand variance for each data item can be dynamically adjusted to match the observed …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2005,21,12
Optimizing plurality for human intelligence tasks,Luyi Mo; Reynold Cheng; Ben Kao; Xuan S Yang; Chenghui Ren; Siyu Lei; David W Cheung; Eric Lo,Abstract In a crowdsourcing system; Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs)(eg; translatingsentences; matching photos; tagging videos with keywords) can be conveniently specified.HITs are made available to a large pool of workers; who are paid upon completing the HITsthey have selected. Since workers may have different capabilities; some difficult HITs maynot be satisfactorily performed by a single worker. If more workers are employed to perform aHIT; the quality of the HIT's answer could be statistically improved. Given a set of HITs and afixed" budget"; we address the important problem of determining the number of workers (orplurality) of each HIT so that the overall answer quality is optimized. We propose a dynamicprogramming (DP) algorithm for solving the plurality assignment problem (PAP). We identifytwo interesting properties; namely; monotonicity and diminishing return; which are …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,20,12
On incentive-based tagging,Xuan S Yang; Reynold Cheng; Luyi Mo; Ben Kao; David W Cheung,A social tagging system; such as del. icio. us and Flickr; allows users to annotate resources(eg; web pages and photos) with text descriptions called tags. Tags have proven to beinvaluable information for searching; mining; and recommending resources. In practice;however; not all resources receive the same attention from users. As a result; while somehighly-popular resources are over-tagged; most of the resources are under-tagged.Incomplete tagging on resources severely affects the effectiveness of all tag-basedtechniques and applications. We address an interesting question: if users are paid to tagspecific resources; how can we allocate incentives to resources in a crowd-sourcingenvironment so as to maximize the tagging quality of resources? We address this questionby observing that the tagging quality of a resource becomes stable after it has been …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,20,12
Cleaning uncertain data for top-k queries,Luyi Mo; Reynold Cheng; Xiang Li; David W Cheung; Xuan S Yang,The information managed in emerging applications; such as sensor networks; location-based services; and data integration; is inherently imprecise. To handle data uncertainty;probabilistic databases have been recently developed. In this paper; we study how toquantify the ambiguity of answers returned by a probabilistic top-k query. We developefficient algorithms to compute the quality of this query under the possible world semantics.We further address the cleaning of a probabilistic database; in order to improve top-k queryquality. Cleaning involves the reduction of ambiguity associated with the database entities.For example; the uncertainty of a temperature value acquired from a sensor can be reduced;or cleaned; by requesting its newest value from the sensor. While this “cleaning operation”may produce a better query result; it may involve a cost and fail. We investigate the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,19,12
Managing uncertainty of XML schema matching,Reynold Cheng; Jian Gong; David W Cheung,Despite of advances in machine learning technologies; a schema matching result betweentwo database schemas (eg; those derived from COMA++) is likely to be imprecise. Inparticular; numerous instances of “possible mappings” between the schemas may bederived from the matching result. In this paper; we study the problem of managing possiblemappings between two heterogeneous XML schemas. We observe that for XML schemas;their possible mappings have a high degree of overlap. We hence propose a novel datastructure; called the block tree; to capture the commonalities among possible mappings. Theblock tree is useful for representing the possible mappings in a compact manner; and can begenerated efficiently. Moreover; it supports the evaluation of probabilistic twig query (PTQ);which returns the probability of portions of an XML document that match the query pattern …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,19,10
Effective community search for large attributed graphs,Yixiang Fang; Reynold Cheng; Siqiang Luo; Jiafeng Hu,Abstract Given a graph G and a vertex q∈ G; the community search query returns asubgraph of G that contains vertices related to q. Communities; which are prevalent inattributed graphs such as social networks and knowledge bases; can be used in emergingapplications such as product advertisement and setting up of social events. In this paper; weinvestigate the attributed community query (or ACQ); which returns an attributed community(AC) for an attributed graph. The AC is a subgraph of G; which satisfies both structurecohesiveness (ie; its vertices are tightly connected) and keyword cohesiveness (ie; itsvertices share common keywords). The AC enables a better understanding of how and whya community is formed (eg; members of an AC have a common interest in music; becausethey all have the same keyword" music"). An AC can be" personalized"; for example; an …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,17,12
CubeLSI: An effective and efficient method for searching resources in social tagging systems,Bin Bi; Sau Dan Lee; Ben Kao; Reynold Cheng,In a social tagging system; resources (such as photos; video and web pages) are associatedwith tags. These tags allow the resources to be effectively searched through tag-basedkeyword matching using traditional IR techniques. We note that in many such systems; tagsof a resource are often assigned by a diverse audience of causal users (taggers). This leadsto two issues that gravely affect the effectiveness of resource retrieval:(1) Noise: tags arepicked from an uncontrolled vocabulary and are assigned by untrained taggers. The tagsare thus noisy features in resource retrieval.(2) A multitude of aspects: different taggers focuson different aspects of a resource. Representing a resource using a flattened bag of tagsignores this important diversity of taggers. To improve the effectiveness of resource retrievalin social tagging systems; we propose CubeLSI-a technique that extends traditional LSI to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,17,12
A statistics-based sensor selection scheme for continuous probabilistic queries in sensor networks,Song Han; Edward Chan; Reynold Cheng; Kam-Yiu Lam,Abstract A common approach to improve the reliability of query results based on error-pronesensors is to introduce redundant sensors. However; using multiple sensors to generate thevalue for a data item can be expensive; especially in wireless environments wherecontinuous queries are executed. Moreover; some sensors may not be working properly andtheir readings need to be discarded. In this paper; we propose a statistical approach todecide which sensor nodes to be used to answer a query. In particular; we propose to solvethe problem with the aid of continuous probabilistic query (CPQ); which is originally used tomanage uncertain data and is associated with a probabilistic guarantee on the query result.Based on the historical data values from the sensor nodes; the query type; and therequirement on the query; we present methods to select an appropriate set of sensors …,Real-Time Systems,2007,17,9
Earth mover's distance based similarity search at scale,Yu Tang; Yilun Cai; Nikos Mamoulis; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Earth Mover's Distance (EMD); as a similarity measure; has received a lot ofattention in the fields of multimedia and probabilistic databases; computer vision; imageretrieval; machine learning; etc. EMD on multidimensional histograms provides betterdistinguishability between the objects approximated by the histograms (eg; images);compared to classic measures like Euclidean distance. Despite its usefulness; EMD has ahigh computational cost; therefore; a number of effective filtering methods have beenproposed; to reduce the pairs of histograms for which the exact EMD has to be computed;during similarity search. Still; EMD calculations in the refinement step remain the bottleneckof the whole similarity search process. In this paper; we focus on optimizing the refinementphase of EMD-based similarity search by (i) adapting an efficient min-cost flow algorithm …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,16,18
Model-based probabilistic frequent itemset mining,Thomas Bernecker; Reynold Cheng; David W Cheung; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Sau Dan Lee; Matthias Renz; Florian Verhein; Liang Wang; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract Data uncertainty is inherent in emerging applications such as location-basedservices; sensor monitoring systems; and data integration. To handle a large amount ofimprecise information; uncertain databases have been recently developed. In this paper; westudy how to efficiently discover frequent itemsets from large uncertain databases;interpreted under the Possible World Semantics. This is technically challenging; since anuncertain database induces an exponential number of possible worlds. To tackle thisproblem; we propose a novel methods to capture the itemset mining process as a probabilitydistribution function taking two models into account: the Poisson distribution and the normaldistribution. These model-based approaches extract frequent itemsets with a high degree ofaccuracy and support large databases. We apply our techniques to improve the …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2013,16,12
Similarity search and mining in uncertain databases,Matthias Renz; Reynold Cheng; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Managing; searching and mining uncertain data has achieved much attention in thedatabase community recently due to new sensor technologies and new ways of collectingdata. There is a number of challenges in terms of collecting; modelling; representing;querying; indexing and mining uncertain data. In its scope; the diversity of approachesaddressing these topics is very high because the underlying assumptions of uncertainty aredifferent across different papers. This tutorial provides a comprehensive and comparativeoverview of general techniques for the key topics in the fields of querying; indexing andmining uncertain data. In particular; it identifies the most generic types of probabilisticsimilarity queries and discusses general algorithmic methods to answer such queriesefficiently.

Sensor node selection for execution of continuous probabilistic queries in wireless sensor networks,Kam-Yiu Lam; Reynold Cheng; BiYu Liang; Jo Chau,Abstract Due to the error-prone properties of sensors; it is important to use multiple low-costsensors to improve the reliability of query results. However; using multiple sensors togenerate the value for a data item can be expensive; especially in wireless environmentswhere continuous queries are executed. Further; we need to distinguish effectively whichsensors are not working properly and discard them from being used.

Using uncertainty to provide privacy-preserving and high-quality location-based services,Reynold Cheng; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract. Location-based services; such as finding the nearest gas station; require users tosupply their location information. However; a user's location can be tracked without herconsent or knowledge. Lowering the spatial and temporal resolution of location data sent tothe server has been proposed as a solution. Although this technique is effective in protectingprivacy; it may be overkill and the quality of desired services can be severely affected. In thispaper; we investigate the relationship between uncertainty; privacy; and quality of services.We propose using probabilistic queries to precisely control location uncertainty. We alsosuggest a framework where uncertainty can be controlled to provide high quality; privacy-preserving services.,Workshop on Location Systems Privacy and Control; MobileHCI,2004,16,12
UV-diagram: a voronoi diagram for uncertain spatial databases,Xike Xie; Reynold Cheng; Man Lung Yiu; Liwen Sun; Jinchuan Chen,Abstract The Voronoi diagram is an important technique for answering nearest-neighborqueries for spatial databases. We study how the Voronoi diagram can be used for uncertainspatial data; which are inherent in scientific and business applications. Specifically; wepropose the Uncertain-Voronoi diagram (or UV-diagram); which divides the data space intodisjoint “UV-partitions”. Each UV-partition P is associated with a set S of objects; such thatany point q located in P has the set S as its nearest neighbor with nonzero probabilities. TheUV-diagram enables queries that return objects with nonzero chances of being the nearestneighbor (NN) of a given point q. It supports “continuous nearest-neighbor search”; whichrefreshes the set of NN objects of q; as the position of q changes. It also allows the analysisof nearest-neighbor information; for example; to find out the number of objects that are the …,The VLDB Journal,2013,15,21

An inherent property of any spatio-temporal dataset is uncertainty due to varioussources of imprecision. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the differentchallenges involved in managing uncertain spatial and spatio-temporal data and presentsstate-of-the-art techniques for addressing them.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,14,12
Efficient management of uncertainty in XML schema matching,Jian Gong; Reynold Cheng; David W Cheung,Abstract Despite advances in machine learning technologies a schema matching resultbetween two database schemas (eg; those derived from COMA++) is likely to be imprecise.In particular; numerous instances of" possible mappings" between the schemas may bederived from the matching result. In this paper; we study problems related to managingpossible mappings between two heterogeneous XML schemas. First; we study how toefficiently generate possible mappings for a given schema matching task. While this problemcan be solved by existing algorithms; we show how to improve the performance of thesolution by using a divide-and-conquer approach. Second; storing and querying a large setof possible mappings can incur large storage and evaluation overhead. For XML schemas;we observe that their possible mappings often exhibit a high degree of overlap. We hence …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,14,21
Filtering data streams for entity-based continuous queries,Reynold Cheng; Ben Kao; Alan Kwan; Sunil Prabhakar; Yicheng Tu,The idea of allowing query users to relax their correctness requirements in order to improveperformance of a data stream management system (eg; location-based services and sensornetworks) has been recently studied. By exploiting the maximum error (or tolerance) allowedin query answers; algorithms for reducing the use of system resources have beendeveloped. In most of these works; however; query tolerance is expressed as a numericalvalue; which may be difficult to specify. We observe that in many situations; users may not beconcerned with the actual value of an answer; but rather which object satisfies a query (eg;"who is my nearest neighbor?¿). In particular; an entity-based query returns only the namesof objects that satisfy the query. For these queries; it is possible to specify a tolerance that is"nonvalue-based.¿ In this paper; we study fraction-based tolerance; a type of nonvalue …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,14,5
Walking in the cloud: Parallel simrank at scale,Zhenguo Li; Yixiang Fang; Qin Liu; Jiefeng Cheng; Reynold Cheng; John Lui,Abstract Despite its popularity; SimRank is computationally costly; in both time and space. Inparticular; its recursive nature poses a great challenge in using modern distributedcomputing power; and also prevents querying similarities individually. Existing solutionssuffer greatly from these practical issues. In this paper; we break such dependency formaximum efficiency possible. Our method consists of offline and online phases. In offlinephase; a length-n indexing vector is derived by solving a linear system in parallel. At onlinequery time; the similarities are computed instantly from the index vector. Throughout; theMonte Carlo method is used to maximally reduce time and space. Our algorithm; calledCloudWalker; is highly parallelizable; with only linear time and space. Remarkably; itresponses to both single-pair and single-source queries in constant time. CloudWalker is …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,13,18
ProbTree: A query-efficient representation of probabilistic graphs,Silviu Maniu; Reynold Cheng; Pierre Senellart,Information in many applications; such as mobile wireless systems; social networks; androad networks; is captured by graphs; in many cases uncertain. We study the problem ofquerying a probabilistic graph; in particular; we examine source-to-target'queries; such ascomputing the shortest path between two vertices. Evaluating ST-queries over probabilisticgraphs is# P-hard; as it requires examining an exponential number of possible worlds'.Existing solutions to the ST-query problem; which sample possible worlds; have twodownsides:(i) many samples are needed for reasonable accuracy; and (ii) a possible worldcan be very large. To tackle these issues; we study the ProbTree; a data structure that storesa succinct representation of the probabilistic graph.

DQR: A probabilistic approach to diversified query recommendation,Ruirui Li; Ben Kao; Bin Bi; Reynold Cheng; Eric Lo,Abstract Web search queries issued by casual users are often short and with limitedexpressiveness. Query recommendation is a popular technique employed by searchengines to help users refine their queries. Traditional similarity-based methods; however;often result in redundant and monotonic recommendations. We identify five basicrequirements of a query recommendation system. In particular; we focus on therequirements of redundancy-free and diversified recommendations. We propose the DQRframework; which mines a search log to achieve two goals:(1) It clusters search log queriesto extract query concepts; based on which recommended queries are selected.(2) It employsa probabilistic model and a greedy heuristic algorithm to achieve recommendationdiversification. Through a comprehensive user study we compare DQR against five other …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,13,4
Metric and trigonometric pruning for clustering of uncertain data in 2D geometric space,Wang Kay Ngai; Ben Kao; Reynold Cheng; Michael Chau; Sau Dan Lee; David W Cheung; Kevin Y Yip,Abstract We study the problem of clustering data objects with location uncertainty. In ourmodel; a data object is represented by an uncertainty region over which a probability densityfunction (pdf) is defined. One method to cluster such uncertain objects is to apply the UK-means algorithm [1]; an extension of the traditional K-means algorithm; which assigns eachobject to the cluster whose representative has the smallest expected distance from it. Forarbitrary pdf; calculating the expected distance between an object and a clusterrepresentative requires expensive integration of the pdf. We study two pruning methods: pre-computation (PC) and cluster shift (CS) that can significantly reduce the number ofintegrations computed. Both pruning methods rely on good bounding techniques. Wepropose and evaluate two such techniques that are based on metric properties (Met) and …,Information Systems,2011,13,21
Quality-aware probing of uncertain data with resource constraints,Jinchuan Chen; Reynold Cheng,Abstract In applications like sensor network monitoring and location-based services; due tolimited network bandwidth and battery power; a system cannot always acquire accurate andfresh data from the external environment. To capture data errors in these environments;recent researches have proposed to model uncertainty as a probability distribution function(pdf); as well as the notion of probabilistic queries; which provide statistical guarantees onanswer correctness. In this paper; we present an entropy-based metric to quantify thedegree of ambiguity of probabilistic query answers due to data uncertainty. Based on thismetric; we develop a new method to improve the query answer quality. The main idea of thismethod is to acquire (or probe) data from a selected set of sensing devices; in order toreduce data uncertainty and improve the quality of a query answer.

Lgen—A Lattice-Based Candidate Set Generation Algorithm for I/O Efficient Association Rule Mining,Chi Lap Yip; KK Loo; Ben Kao; David Cheung; CK Cheng,Abstract Most algorithms for association rule mining are variants of the basic Apriorialgorithm [2]. One characteristic of these Aprioribased algorithms is that candidate itemsetsare generated in rounds; with the size of the itemsets incremented by one per round. Thenumber of database scans required by Apriori-based algorithms thus depends on the size ofthe largest large itemsets. In this paper we devise a more general candidate set generationalgorithm; LGen; which generates candidate itemsets of multiple sizes during each databasescan. We show that; given a reasonable set of suggested large itemsets; LGen cansignificantly reduce the number of I/O passes required. In the best cases; only two passesare sufficient to discover all the large itemsets irrespective of the size of the largest ones.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,1999,13,12
A framework for conditioning uncertain relational data,Ruiming Tang; Reynold Cheng; Huayu Wu; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract We propose a framework for representing conditioned probabilistic relational data.In this framework the existence of tuples in possible worlds is determined by Booleanexpressions composed from elementary events. The probability of a possible world iscomputed from the probabilities associated with these elementary events. In addition; a setof global constraints conditions the database. Conditioning is the formalization of theprocess of adding knowledge to a database. Some worlds may be impossible given theconstraints and the probabilities of possible worlds are accordingly re-defined. The newconstraints can come from the observation of the existence or non-existence of a tuple; fromthe knowledge of a specific rule; such as the existence of an exclusive set of tuples; or fromthe knowledge of a general rule; such as a functional dependency. We are therefore …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2012,12,3
Scalable evaluation of trajectory queries over imprecise location data,Xike Xie; Man L Yiu; Reynold Cheng; Hua Lu,Trajectory queries; which retrieve nearby objects for every point of a given route; can beused to identify alerts of potential threats along a vessel route; or monitor the adjacentrescuers to a travel path. However; the locations of these objects (eg; threats; succours) maynot be precisely obtained due to hardware limitations of measuring devices; as well ascomplex natures of the surroundings. For such data; we consider a common model; wherethe possible locations of an object are bounded by a closed region; called “impreciseregion”. Ignoring or coarsely wrapping imprecision can render low query qualities; andcause undesirable consequences such as missing alerts of threats and poor responserescue time. Also; the query is quite time-consuming; since all points on the trajectory areconsidered. In this paper; we study how to efficiently evaluate trajectory queries over …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,11,21
Probabilistic filters: A stream protocol for continuous probabilistic queries,Yinuo Zhang; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Pervasive applications; such as natural habitat monitoring and location-basedservices; have attracted plenty of research interest. These applications; which deploy a lot ofsensor devices to collect data from external environments; often have limited networkbandwidth and battery resources. The sensors also cannot record accurate values. Theuncertainty of data captured by a sensor should thus be considered for query evaluation. Tothis end; probabilistic queries; which consider data impreciseness and provide statisticalguarantees in answers; have been recently studied. We investigate the evaluation of a long-standing (or continuous) probabilistic query in a multi-user environment. We propose theprobabilistic filter protocol; which helps remote sensor devices to decide whether valuescollected should be reported to the query server.

Evaluating continuous probabilistic queries over imprecise sensor data,Yinuo Zhang; Reynold Cheng; Jinchuan Chen,Abstract Pervasive applications; such as natural habitat monitoring and location-basedservices; have attracted plenty of research interest. These applications deploy a largenumber of sensors (eg temperature sensors) and positioning devices (eg GPS) to collectdata from external environments. Very often; these systems have limited network bandwidthand battery resources. The sensors also cannot record accurate values. The uncertainty ofthese data hence has to been taken into account for query evaluation purposes. Inparticular; probabilistic queries; which consider data impreciseness and provide statisticalguarantees in answers; have been recently studied.

Effective community search over large spatial graphs,Yixiang Fang; Reynold Cheng; Xiaodong Li; Siqiang Luo; Jiafeng Hu,Abstract Communities are prevalent in social networks; knowledge graphs; and biologicalnetworks. Recently; the topic of community search (CS) has received plenty of attention.Given a query vertex; CS looks for a dense subgraph that contains it. Existing CS solutionsdo not consider the spatial extent of a community. They can yield communities whoselocations of vertices span large areas. In applications that facilitate the creation of socialevents (eg; finding conference attendees to join a dinner); it is important to find groups ofpeople who are physically close to each other. In this situation; it is desirable to have aspatial-aware community (or SAC); whose vertices are close structurally and spatially. Givena graph G and a query vertex q; we develop exact solutions for finding an SAC that containsq. Since these solutions cannot scale to large datasets; we have further designed three …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,10,19
Disk scheduling,Ben Kao; Reynold Cheng,Many real-time applications handle large amounts of data and require the support of a real-time database system. Examples include telephone switching; radar tracking; media servers;and computer-aided manufacturing. Many of these database systems are disk-residentbecause the amount of data they store is too large (and is too expensive) to be stored innonvolatile main memory.

Explore or exploit?: effective strategies for disambiguating large databases,Reynold Cheng; Eric Lo; Xuan S Yang; Ming-Hay Luk; Xiang Li; Xike Xie,Abstract Data ambiguity is inherent in applications such as data integration; location-basedservices; and sensor monitoring. In many situations; it is possible to" clean"; or remove;ambiguities from these databases. For example; the GPS location of a user is inexact due tomeasurement errors; but context information (eg; what a user is doing) can be used toreduce the imprecision of the location value. In order to obtain a database with a higherquality; we study how to disambiguate a database by appropriately selecting candidates toclean. This problem is challenging because cleaning involves a cost; is limited by a budget;may fail; and may not remove all ambiguities. Moreover; the statistical information about howlikely database objects can be cleaned may not be precisely known. We tackle thesechallenges by proposing two types of algorithms. The first type makes use of greedy …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,9,12
Querying and cleaning uncertain data,Reynold Cheng,Abstract The management of uncertainty in large databases has recently attractedtremendous research interest. Data uncertainty is inherent in many emerging and importantapplications; including location-based services; wireless sensor networks; biometric andbiological databases; and data stream applications. In these systems; it is important tomanage data uncertainty carefully; in order to make correct decisions and provide high-quality services to users. To enable the development of these applications; uncertaindatabase systems have been proposed. They consider data uncertainty as a “first-classcitizen”; and use generic data models to capture uncertainty; as well as provide queryoperators that return answers with statistical confidences. We summarize our work onuncertain databases in recent years. We explain how data uncertainty can be modeled …,*,2009,9,21
Sensors; uncertainty models; and probabilistic queries,Reynold Cheng; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract Sensors are often used to monitor the status of an environment continuously. Thesensor readings are reported to the application for making decisions and answering userqueries. For example; a fire alarm system in a building employs temperature sensors todetect any abrupt change in temperature. An aircraft is equipped with sensors to track windspeed; and radars are used to report the aircraft's location to a military application. Theseapplications usually include a database or server to which the sensor readings are sent.Limited network bandwidth and battery power imply that it is often not practical for the serverto record the exact status of an entity it monitors at every time instant. In particular; if thevalue of an entity (eg; temperature; location) monitored is constantly evolving; the recordeddata value may differ from the actual value. Querying the database can then produce …,*,2005,9,5
Evaluating multi-way joins over discounted hitting time,Wangda Zhang; Reynold Cheng; Ben Kao,The discounted hitting time (DHT); which is a random-walk similarity measure for graphnode pairs; is useful in various applications; including link prediction; collaborativerecommendation; and reputation ranking. We examine a novel query; called the multi-wayjoin (or n-way join); on DHT scores. Given a graph and n sets of nodes; the n-way joinretrieves a set of n-tuples with the k highest scores; according to some aggregation functionof DHT values. This query enables analysis and prediction of complex relationship among nsets of nodes. Since an n-way join is expensive to compute; we develop the Partial Joinalgorithm (or PJ). This solution decomposes an n-way join into a number of top-m 2-wayjoins; and combines their results to construct the answer of the n-way join. Since PJ maynecessitate the computation of top-(m+ 1) 2-way joins; we study an incremental solution …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,8,0
Scalable algorithms for nearest-neighbor joins on big trajectory data,Yixiang Fang; Reynold Cheng; Wenbin Tang; Silviu Maniu; Xuan Yang,Trajectory data are prevalent in systems that monitor the locations of moving objects. In alocation-based service; for instance; the positions of vehicles are continuously monitoredthrough GPS; the trajectory of each vehicle describes its movement history. We study joinson two sets of trajectories; generated by two sets M and R of moving objects. For each entityin M; a join returns its k nearest neighbors from R. We examine how this query can beevaluated in cloud environments. This problem is not trivial; due to the complexity of thetrajectory; and the fact that both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data have to behandled. To facilitate this operation; we propose a parallel solution framework based onMapReduce. We also develop a novel bounding technique; which enables trajectories to bepruned in parallel. Our approach can be used to parallelize existing single-machine …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,7,20
Kb-enabled query recommendation for long-tail queries,Zhipeng Huang; Bogdan Cautis; Reynold Cheng; Yudian Zheng,Abstract In recent years; query recommendation algorithms have been designed to providerelated queries for search engine users. Most of these solutions; which perform extensiveanalysis of users' search history (or query logs); are largely insufficient for long-tail queriesthat rarely appear in query logs. To handle such queries; we study a new solution; whichmakes use of a knowledge base (or KB); such as YAGO and Freebase. A KB is a richinformation source that describes how real-world entities are connected. We extract entitiesfrom a query; and use these entities to explore new ones in the KB. Those discoveredentities are then used to suggest new queries to the user. As shown in our experiments; ourapproach provides better recommendation results for long-tail queries than existingsolutions.,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,6,6
I/O-efficient algorithms for answering pattern-based aggregate queries in a sequence OLAP system,Chun Kit Chui; Ben Kao; Eric Lo; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Many kinds of real-life data exhibit logical ordering among their data items and arethus sequential in nature. In recent years; the concept of Sequence OLAP (S-OLAP) hasbeen proposed. The biggest distinguishing feature of SOLAP from traditional OLAP is thatdata sequences managed by an S-OLAP system are characterized by the subsequence/substring patterns they possess. An S-OLAP system thus supports pattern-based groupingand aggregation. Conceptually; an S-OLAP system maintains a sequence data cube whichis composed of sequence cuboids. Each sequence cuboid presents the answer of a pattern-based aggregate (PBA) query. This paper focuses on the I/O aspects of evaluating PBAqueries. We study the problems of joining plan selection and execution planning; which arethe core issues in the design of I/O-efficient cuboid materialization algorithms.

Guest Editors' Introduction: Special Section on Mining Large Uncertain and Probabilistic Databases,Reynold Cheng; Michael Chau; Minos Garofalakis; Jeffrey Xu Yu,RECENT years have witnessed the emergence of novel database applications in various nontraditionaldo- mains; including location-based services; sensor networks; RFID systems; and biologicaland biometric databases. Traditionally; data mining has been widely used to reveal interestingpatterns in the vast amounts of data generated by such applications. However; for most of theseemerging domains; data is often riddled with uncertainty; arising; for instance; from inherent measurementinaccuracies; sampling and curation errors; and network latencies; or even from intentional blurringof the data (to preserve anonymity). Such forms of data uncertainty have to be handledcarefully; or else the results of long and tedious data analyses could be inaccurate or evenincorrect. In particular; it is important to collect and distill the knowledge from experts in developingmining and data processing methods that are uncertainty- aware. Recently; there has …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,6,12
A probabilistic filter protocol for continuous queries,Jinchuan Chen; Reynold Cheng; Yinuo Zhang; Jian Jin,Abstract Pervasive applications; such as location-based services and natural habitatmonitoring; have attracted plenty of research interest. These applications make use of alarge number of remote positioning devices like Global Positioning System (GPS) forcollecting users' physical locations. Generally; these devices have battery power limitation.They also cannot report very accurate position values. In this paper; we consider theevaluation of a long-standing (or continuous) query over inaccurate location data collectedfrom positioning devices. Our goal is to develop an energy-efficient protocol; which providessome degree of confidence on the query answers evaluated on imperfect data.

Querying minimal steiner maximum-connected subgraphs in large graphs,Jiafeng Hu; Xiaowei Wu; Reynold Cheng; Siqiang Luo; Yixiang Fang,Abstract Given a graph G and a set Q of query nodes; we examine the Steiner Maximum-Connected Subgraph (SMCS). The SMCS; or G's induced subgraph that contains Q with thelargest connectivity; can be useful for customer prediction; product promotion; and teamassembling. Despite its importance; the SMCS problem has only been recently studied.Existing solutions evaluate the maximum SMCS; whose number of nodes is the largestamong all the SMCSs of Q. However; the maximum SMCS; which may contain a lot ofnodes; can be difficult to interpret. In this paper; we investigate the minimal SMCS; which isthe minimal subgraph of G with the maximum connectivity containing Q. The minimal SMCScontains much fewer nodes than its maximum counterpart; and is thus easier to beunderstood. However; the minimal SMCS can be costly to evaluate. We thus propose …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,5,6
On using broadcast index for efficient execution of shortest path continuous queries,Chun Jiang Zhu; Kam-Yiu Lam; Reynold CK Cheng; Chung Keung Poon,Abstract Various efficient indexing techniques have been proposed for formulatingbroadcast index to minimize the tune-in cost at mobile clients to support shortest path searchin a road network. However; none of them is designed for shortest path continuous queries(SPCQ). Due to frequent updates of traffic data; an SPCQ has to be invoked periodicallywhile the client is following the suggested shortest path to its destination. This could result inheavy path searching cost at the client. To reduce the tune-in and path searching costs atthe clients; in this paper; we propose the progressive approach (PA) in which we apply thenext region (NR) approach together with a hierarchical network approach to formulate thelocal networks at the clients for shortest path navigation. Since the shortest path may changedue to changing traffic; to minimize the path searching cost; we aim for an approximate …,Information Systems,2015,5,12
Fast evaluation of iceberg pattern-based aggregate queries,Zhian He; Petrie Wong; Ben Kao; Eric Lo; Reynold Cheng,Abstract A Sequence OLAP (S-OLAP) system provides a platform on which pattern-basedaggregate (PBA) queries on a sequence database are evaluated. In its simplest form; a PBAquery consists of a pattern template T and an aggregate function F. A pattern template is asequence of variables; each is defined over a domain. For example; the template T=(X; Y; Y;X) consists of two variables X and Y. Each variable is instantiated with all possible values inits corresponding domain to derive all possible patterns of the template. Sequences aregrouped based on the patterns they possess. The answer to a PBA query is a sequencecuboid (s-cuboid); which is a multidimensional array of cells. Each cell is associated with apattern instantiated from the query's pattern template. The value of each s-cuboid cell isobtained by applying the aggregate function F to the set of data sequences that belong to …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,5,21
A filter-based protocol for continuous queries over imprecise location data,Yifan Jin; Reynold Cheng; Ben Kao; Kam-Yiu Lam; Yinuo Zhang,Abstract In typical location-based services (LBS); moving objects (eg; GPS-enabled mobilephones) report their locations through a wireless network. An LBS server can use thelocation information to answer various types of continuous queries. Due to hardwarelimitations; location data reported by the moving objects are often uncertain. In this paper;we study efficient methods for the execution of Continuous Possible Nearest NeighborQuery (CPoNNQ) that accesses imprecise location data. A CPoNNQ is a standing query(which is active during a period of time) such that; at any time point; all moving objects thathave non-zero probabilities of being the nearest neighbor of a given query point arereported. To handle the continuous nature of a CPoNNQ; a simple solution is to requiremoving objects to continuously report their locations to the LBS server; which evaluates …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,5,12
Evaluating trajectory queries over imprecise location data,Xike Xie; Reynold Cheng; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract Trajectory queries; which retrieve nearby objects for every point of a given route;can be used to identify alerts of potential threats along a vessel route; or monitor theadjacent rescuers to a travel path. However; the locations of these objects (eg; threats;succours) may not be precisely obtained due to hardware limitations of measuring devices;as well as the constantly-changing nature of the external environment. Ignoring datauncertainty can render low query quality; and cause undesirable consequences such asmissing alerts of threats and poor response time in rescue operations. Also; the query isquite time-consuming; since all the points on the trajectory are considered. In this paper; westudy how to efficiently evaluate trajectory queries over imprecise location data; byproposing a new concept called the u-bisector.

Data uncertainty management in sensor networks,Sunil Prabhakar; Reynold Cheng,realized using such logical structures. For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,5,15

Packet cloaking: Protecting receiver privacy against traffic analysis,Reynold Cheng; David KY Yau; Jianyun Fu,With widespread use of the Internet; there is an increase in concern over users' privacy. Inparticular; an adversary may identify the receiver involved in a communication session byobserving the packet traffic. We propose a new routing mechanism; which we call packetcloaking; to protect the privacy of a receiver. The main idea of packet cloaking is to transmitmultiple copies of a sent packet to a selected group of k receivers; so that an adversary mayonly identify the true receiver with a probability of j. We present the system design to supportpacket cloaking. We also propose two metrics that measure the receiver privacy; based onevaluating the similarity between the sender/receiver traffic patterns. We have performedexperimental evaluations to verify the effectiveness of our approach.,Secure Network Protocols; 2007. NPSec 2007. 3rd IEEE Workshop on,2007,5,7
Managing uncertainty in constantly-evolving environments,Chun-Kong Cheng,Abstract In systems that monitor continuously-changing entities like temperature values andlocations of moving objects; data are obtained from sensors and streamed continuously tothe database. Due to limited bandwidth and battery power; it is infeasible for the system tokeep track of the actual values of the entities. Queries that use these database values canproduce incorrect answers. In this dissertation; we model the uncertainty inherent to dynamicsensor data. Based on the uncertainty model; we propose probabilistic queries; whichevaluate uncertain data and produce answers with probabilistic guarantees. We describe aquery classification scheme; and for each class; query evaluation algorithms and answerquality metrics are presented. We also study the semantics of probabilistic comparisonoperators that return imprecise comparison results. We illustrate how uncertainty …,*,2005,5,4

Evaluating Nearest-Neighbor Joins on Big Trajectory Data,Yixiang Fang; Reynold Cheng; Wenbin Tang; Silviu Maniu; Xuan Yang,Abstract—Trajectory data are abundant and prevalent in systems that monitor the locationsof moving objects. In a vehicle location-based service; the positions of vehicles arecontinuously monitored through GPS; each vehicle is associated with a trajectory thatdescribes its movement history. In species monitoring; animals are attached with sensors;whose positions can be frequently traced by scientists. An interesting avenue to generateand discover new knowledge from these data is by querying them. In this paper; we studythe evaluation of the join operator on trajectory data. Given two sets of trajectory data; M andR; our goal is to find; for each entity in M; its k nearest neighbors from R. Existing solutionsfor this query are designed for a single machine. Due to the abundance and size of trajectorydata; such solutions are no longer adequate. We hence examine how this query can be …,*,2014,4,12
Evaluating probabilistic queries over uncertain matching,Reynold Cheng; Jian Gong; David W Cheung; Jiefeng Cheng,A matching between two database schemas; generated by machine learning techniques(eg; COMA++); is often uncertain. Handling the uncertainty of schema matching has recentlyraised a lot of research interest; because the quality of applications rely on the matchingresult. We study query evaluation over an inexact schema matching; which is represented asa set of``possible mappings''; as well as the probabilities that they are correct. Since thenumber of possible mappings can be large; evaluating queries through these mappings canbe expensive. By observing the fact that the possible mappings between two schemas oftenexhibit a high degree of overlap; we develop two efficient solutions. We also present a fastalgorithm to compute answers with the k highest probabilities.

Online influence maximization (extended version),Siyu Lei; Silviu Maniu; Luyi Mo; Reynold Cheng; Pierre Senellart,Abstract: Social networks are commonly used for marketing purposes. For example; freesamples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or" seednodes"); with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it. One way to formalizemarketers' objective is through influence maximization (or IM); whose goal is to find the bestseed nodes to activate under a fixed budget; so that the number of people who getinfluenced in the end is maximized. Recent solutions to IM rely on the influence probabilitythat a user influences another one. However; this probability information may be unavailableor incomplete. In this paper; we study IM in the absence of complete information on influenceprobability. We call this problem Online Influence Maximization (OIM) since we learninfluence probabilities at the same time we run influence campaigns.

A structure-function analysis of human GDNF,Zheyu Chen; Zhiyong He; Cheng He; Changlin Lu; Xiangfu Wu,Abstract Based on the results of the X-ray structure analysis of rat GDNF; human GDNF genewas modified with deletion and insertion mutagenesis by using PCR methods. The variousmutants were all highly expressed in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were purified andtheir survival-promoting activities were determined by using cultures of the spinal cordneurons of embryonic mouse. The results showed that the cystine knot motif was critical forthe maintenance of GDNF structure; the alpha-helix; finger 1 and finger 2 region were criticalfor GDNF neurotrophic activity; and the N-terminus of human GDNF was not essential for itsbiological functions.,Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica,2000,3,4

SMe: explicit & implicit constrained-space probabilistic threshold range queries for moving objects,Zhi-Jie Wang; Bin Yao; Reynold Cheng; Xiaofeng Gao; Lei Zou; Haibing Guan; Minyi Guo,Abstract This paper studies the constrained-space probabilistic threshold range query(CSPTRQ) for moving objects; where objects move in a constrained-space (ie; objects areforbidden to be located in some specific areas); and objects' locations are uncertain. Wedifferentiate two forms of CSPTRQs: explicit and implicit ones. Specifically; for each movingobject o; we model its location uncertainty as a closed region; u; together with a probabilitydensity function. We also model a query range; R; as an arbitrary polygon. An explicit querycan be reduced to a search (over all the u) that returns a set of tuples in form of (o; p) suchthat p≥ pt; where p is the probability of o being located in R; and 0≤ pt≤ 1 is a givenprobabilistic threshold. In contrast; an implicit query returns only a set of objects (withoutattaching the specific probability information); whose probabilities being located in R are …,GeoInformatica,2016,2,12
Uncertain voronoi cell computation based on space decomposition,Tobias Emrich; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Reynold Cheng,Abstract The problem of computing Voronoi cells for spatial objects whose locations are notcertain has been recently studied. In this work; we propose a new approach to computeVoronoi cells for the case of objects having rectangular uncertainty regions. Since exactcomputation of Voronoi cells is hard; we propose an approximate solution. The main idea ofthis solution is to apply hierarchical access methods for both data and object space. Ourspace index is used to efficiently find spatial regions which must (not) be inside a Voronoicell. Our object index is used to efficiently identify Delauny relations; ie; data objects whichaffect the shape of a Voronoi cell. We develop three algorithms to explore index structuresand show that the approach that descends both index structures in parallel yields fast queryprocessing times. Our experiments show that we are able to approximate uncertain …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,2,12
Privacy preserving path recommendation for moving user on location based service,Yuqing Sun; Haoran Xu; Reynold Cheng,With the increasing adoption of location based services; privacy is becoming a majorconcern. To hide the identity and location of a request on location based service; mostmethods consider a set of users in a reasonable region so as to confuse their requests.When there are not enough users; the cloaking region needs expanding to a larger area orthe response needs delay. Either way degrades the quality-of-service. In this paper; wetackle the privacy problem in a predication way by recommending a privacy-preserving pathfor a requester. We consider the popular navigation application; where users maycontinuously query different location based servers during their movements. Based on a setof metrics on privacy; distance and the quality of services that a LBS requester often desires;a secure path is computed for each request according to user's preference; and can be …,Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing; 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on and 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing (UIC/ATC),2013,2,18
General threshold signature based on the Chinese remainder theorem,Cheng Guo; Chin-Chen Chang,This paper proposes a new weighted threshold signature based on Iftene's general secretsharing scheme and the RSA threshold signature; which is itself based on the Chinesereminder theorem. In our scheme; group members are divided into different subgroups; anda positive weight is associated to each subgroup; where all members of the same subgrouphave the same weight. The group signature can be generated if and only if the sum of theweights of members involved is greater than or equal to a fixed threshold value.,Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing (IIH-MSP); 2011 Seventh International Conference on,2011,2,12

Data hiding on two stage VQ compression codes,C-N Lin; C-C Chang; Y-K Chan,Abstract Data hiding in a cover image can be used to protect a confidential message beforebeing transmitted on the Internet. The stego image can be transmitted in either raw orcompressed format. The two major concerns about data hiding are hiding capacity and thestego image quality. Higher capacity allows the transmission of more confidential data. Agood stego image quality means that it should be visually undistorted and similar to theoriginal cover image to avoid arousing unwanted attention. In this paper; a data hidingstrategy is proposed based on two stage vector quantisation (VQ) coding. Data are hidden inboth the first stage VQ compression indices and the second stage VQ compression indices.The stego image is transmitted in its VQ compressed format. Experimental results showedthat the proposed method resulted in very high data hiding capacity and fairly high stego …,The Imaging Science Journal,2008,2,21

An efficient expression of timestamp and period in packet-based and cell-based schedulers,Dong Wei; Jianguo Chen; Nirwan Ansari,Scheduling algorithms are implemented in hardware in high-speed switches to provisionquality-of-service guarantees in both cell-based and packet-based networks. Being able toguarantee end-to-end delay and fairness; timestamp-based fair queuing algorithms havereceived much attention in the past few years. In timestamp-based fair queuing algorithms;the size of timestamp and period determines the supportable rates in terms of the range andaccuracy. Furthermore; it also determines the scheduler's memory in terms of off-chipbandwidth and storage space. An efficient expression can reduce the size of the timestampand period without compromising the accuracy. We propose a new expression of thetimestamp and period; which can be implemented in hardware for both high-speed packet-based and cell-based switches.

A shape recognition scheme based on real-valued boundary points,DJ Buehrer; CS Lu; CC Chang,An efficient shape recognition scheme based on three new ideas is presented. First; a newmethod is presented for estimating real-valued boundary points from the integer-valuedcoordinates and the grey-level values of binary images. Secondly; we can quickly determineall of the feature points with this representation by using an angle calculation formula andthe separating technique which are also proposed in this paper. Then; each shape isrepresented by an array of pairs; where each pair contains the coordinate of a feature pointand its distance from the centroid. Thirdly; in the matching process; we also propose a newsplit-merge technique to assist in the shape matching. The effectiveness of the shaperecognition scheme is clearly proven by the good recognition rates of our experiments.,淡江理工學刊,2000,2,5
Effective and efficient attributed community search,Yixiang Fang; Reynold Cheng; Yankai Chen; Siqiang Luo; Jiafeng Hu,Abstract Given a graph G and a vertex\(q\in G\); the community search query returns asubgraph of G that contains vertices related to q. Communities; which are prevalent inattributed graphs such as social networks and knowledge bases; can be used in emergingapplications such as product advertisement and setting up of social events. In this paper; weinvestigate the attributed community query (or ACQ); which returns an attributed community(AC) for an attributed graph. The AC is a subgraph of G; which satisfies both structurecohesiveness (ie; its vertices are tightly connected) and keyword cohesiveness (ie; itsvertices share common keywords). The AC enables a better understanding of how and whya community is formed (eg; members of an AC have a common interest in music; becausethey all have the same keyword “music”). An AC can be “personalized”; for example; an …,The VLDB Journal,2017,1,2
SEQ: Example-based Query for Spatial Objects,Siqiang Luo; Jiafeng Hu; Reynold Cheng; Jing Yan; Ben Kao,Abstract Spatial object search is prevalent in map services (eg; Google Maps). To rent anapartment; for example; one will take into account its nearby facilities; such as supermarkets;hospitals; and subway stations. Traditional keyword search solutions; such as the nearbyfunction in Google Maps; are insufficient in expressing the often complex attribute/spatialrequirements of users. Those require-ments; however; are essential to reflect the usersearch intention. In this paper; we propose the Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ); which allowsthe user to input a result example over an interface inside the map service. We then proposean effective similarity measure to evaluate the proximity between a candidate answer andthe given example. We conduct a user study to validate the effectiveness of SEQ.

Reliable Retrieval of Top-k Tags,Yong Xu; Reynold Cheng; Yudian Zheng,Abstract Collaborative tagging systems; such as Flickr and Del. icio. us; allow users toprovide keyword labels; or tags; for various Internet resources (eg; photos; songs; andbookmarks). These tags; which provide a rich source of information; have been used inimportant applications such as resource searching; webpage clustering; etc. However; tagsare provided by casual users; and so their quality cannot be guaranteed. In this paper; weexamine a question: given a resource r and a set of user-provided tags associated with r;can r be correctly described by the k most frequent tags? To answer this question; wedevelop the metric top-k sliding average similarity (top-k SAS) which measures the reliabilityof k most frequent tags. One threshold is then set to estimate whether the reliability issufficient for retrieving the top-k tags.

Managing uncertainty of large spatial databases,Reynold Cheng,Abstract Spatial data are prevalent in location-based services (LBS); sensor networks; andRFID monitoring systems. Data readings collected in these applications are often imprecise.The uncertainty in the data can arise from multiple sources; including measurement errorsdue to the sensing instrument and discrete sampling of the measurements. It is oftenimportant to record the imprecision and also to take it into account when processing thespatial data. The challenges of handling the uncertainty in spatial data includes modeling;semantics; query operators and types; efficient execution; and user interfaces. Probabilisticmodels have been proposed for handling the uncertainty. In this paper; we examine themodeling and querying issues of this kind of databases.,SIGSPATIAL Special,2016,1,16
Entropy-based Scheduling Policy for Cross Aggregate Ranking Workloads,Chengcheng Dai; Sarana Nutanong; Chi-Yin Chow; Reynold Cheng,Many data exploration applications require the ability to identify the top-k results accordingto a scoring function. We study a class of top-k ranking problems where top-k candidates in adataset are scored with the assistance of another set. We call this class of workloads crossaggregate ranking. Example computation problems include evaluating the Hausdorffdistance between two datasets; finding the medoid or radius within one dataset; and findingthe closest or farthest pair between two datasets. In this paper; we propose a parallel anddistributed solution to process cross aggregate ranking workloads. Our solution subdividesthe aggregate score computation of each candidate into tasks while constantly maintains thetentative top-k results as an uncertain top-k result set.

Uncertain Data Classification.,Reynold Cheng; Yixiang Fang; Matthias Renz,In emerging applications such as location-based services (LBS); sensor networks; andbiological databases; the values stored in the databases are often uncertain [11; 18; 19; 30].In an LBS; for example; the location of a person or a vehicle sensed by imperfect GPShardware may not be exact. This measurement error also occurs in the temperature valuesobtained by a thermometer; where 24% of measurements are off by more than 0. 5◦ C; orabout 36% of the normal temperature range [15]. Sometimes; uncertainty may be injected tothe data by the application; in order to provide a better protection of privacy. In demographicapplications; partially aggregated data sets; rather than personal data; are available [3]. InLBS; since the exact location of a person may be sensitive; researchers have proposed to“anonymize” a location value by representing it as a region [20]. For these applications …,*,2014,1,12

A secure image delivery scheme with regional protection capability using image inpainting and editing,C Qin; CC Chang; WB Lee; XP Zhang,Abstract In this paper; a secure image delivery scheme that can protect the privacy of secretregion in the transmitted image is proposed. The secret region that requires protection isfirstly analogised as the repairing and cloning region in the problems of image inpaintingand editing. By inpainting and modified Poisson editing; the original protection region caneffectively be concealed or disguised with other meaningful content. In the modified Poissonediting process; the twice Laplacian operator is used to improve the seamless transition onthe boundary of protection region. The bits generated by the original content of the regionare then reversibly embedded into the inpainted or disguised image to form the finalprotected image. The protected image can be delivered in channels securely; and theattacker cannot obtain the real content of the image without the keys. Experiments were …,The Imaging Science Journal,2013,1,0
Optimizing task assignment for crowdsourcing environments,Luyi Mo; Reynold Cheng; Xuan S Yang; Chenghui Ren; Siyu Lei; Eric Lo; Ben Kao; David W Cheung,ABSTRACT In a crowdsourcing system; Human Intelligence Tasks (HIT- s) (eg; sentencetranslation; photo matching; providing keywords for videos) can be conveniently specified. TheseHITs are available to a large pool of workers; who are paid upon completing their selectedHITs. Since these workers may have different capabilities; some difficult HITs may not be satisfactorilyperformed. If more workers are employed to perform these HITs; their result quality could be statisticallyimproved. In this paper; we address the important problem of deciding the number of workers(or plurality) for a given set of HITs. We propose a theoretically optimal algorithm given a fixed“budget” (ie; the amount of money paid for performing HITs). This solution determines the bestplural- ity of each HIT. We also observe that for a HIT that involves multiple-choice questions;its quality increases monotonical- ly with the number of workers; albeit in a decreasing …,*,2013,1,12

For these applications;probabilistic databases can be used to store uncertain data; and querying facilities areprovided to yield answers with statistical confidence. Given that a limited amount ofresources is available to “clean” the database (eg; by probing some sensor data values toget their latest values); we address the problem of choosing the set of uncertain objects to becleaned; in order to achieve the best improvement in the quality of query answers. For thispurpose; we present the PWS-quality metric; which is a universal measure that quantifies theambiguity of query answers under the possible world semantics. We study how PWS-qualitycan be efficiently evaluated for two major query classes:(1) queries that examine the …,*,2013,1,12

Reversible watermarking schemes based on expansion embedding using pixel partition strategies,TD Kieu; CC Chang,Abstract Reversible watermarking methods have drawn attention of many researchers inrecent years because original cover objects can be completely restored upon extraction ofembedded information. The prediction error expansion (PEE) embedding proposed byThodi and Rodriguez can embed one information bit into one cover pixel and achieve goodvisual quality of watermarked images. However; the PEE method is not a generalisedscheme and its embedding capacity measured by bit per pixel (bpp) and visual qualitymeasured by peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) can be improved. Thus; we propose twonovel schemes based on the PEE method by using pixel partition strategies to improveembedding capacity and/or visual quality. The first proposed scheme makes the PEEmethod be generalised and the second proposed scheme can embed more than 1 bpp …,The Imaging Science Journal,2012,1,12

Shallow multi-well plastic chip for thermal multiplexing,*,Disposable units in current use for performing PCR are limited by their heat block rampingrates and by the thermal diffusion delay time through the plastic wall as well as by thesample itself. This limitation has been overcome by forming a disposable plastic chip using asimple deformation process wherein one or more plastic sheets are caused; throughhydrostatic pressure; to conform to the surface of a suitable mold. After a given disposablechip has been filled with liquid samples; it is brought into close contact with an array ofheating blocks that seals each sample within its own chamber; allowing each sample to thenbe heat treated as desired.,*,2011,1,21

Negative Wh-words (NWHs) in Cantonese,Lawrence YL Cheung,In Cantonese; some wh-words (including bin (dou)'where'; dim'how'and me'what') can occurin a post-subject position to convey negative meaning.

Some practical issues related to inductor model in single-sensor measurement technique,Dongyuan Qiu; SYR Hui; HSH Chung,A non-dissipative single-sensor measurement principle has previously been proposed as asimple and effective means for providing control variables for feedforward and/or feedbackcontrol and also for parameter estimation. This approach can reduce the number of sensorsand eliminate the requirement of complex isolated feedback circuitry in many powerelectronic systems. In this paper; based on the high-frequency small-signal inductor model;the accuracy of the derived inductor voltage from single voltage sensor or single currentsensor is addressed. As the voltage difference between the actual and estimated inductorvoltage values can be estimated; it is feasible to check if compensation network in single-sensor measurement principle is necessary or not. Practical issues for measurement andcalculation of inductor parameters are also included and explained in the paper.,Power Electronics Specialists Conference; 2004.

The expression plasmid pET-GDNF was constructed by inserting GDNF cDNA intoplasmid pET-28a (+) containing T7 promoter and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Anexpression strain BLGDNF was selected. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the humanGDNF protein was highly expressed and accumulated up to above 30% of the total bacterialproteins in the form of inclusion body after the induction. The antibody to GDNF wasprepared by immunization of rat using purified GDNF protein. Purified and refolded GDNFprotein could significantly promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons.,Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica,1999,1,21
Fast Matching of Detour Routes and Service Areas,Siqiang Luo; Reynold Cheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Ben Kao; Shuigeng Zhou; Jiafeng Hu,Abstract—Novel road-network services; such as ride sharing; spatial crowdsourcing andkeyword-aware routing often need to find out whether there exists a route that can gothrough (or match) a service area. A ride-sharing system; for instance; may need to find for amoving taxi a route that passes through a region in which a passenger is located. Afundamental question is: given two locations s and t; and an area A on the road network; isthere a “reasonably short” route from s to t that also crosses A? This Route and AreaMatching (ROAM) query is important as 1) its efficient evaluation allows the applicationinvolved to recommend appropriate services to objects in an online manner; 2) its algorithmcan be incorporated into some sophisticated systems to optimize their performance. Despiteits importance; the ROAM query has not been well studied especially when “service area” …,*,*,1,10
Efficient Evaluation of Imprecise Location-Dependent Queries (Technical Report),Jinchuan Chen; Reynold Cheng,Abstract In location-based services; it is common for a user to issue a query based on hercurrent position. An example is the location-dependent range query; where the user'slocation is at the center of the query range. Very often; the query issuer's location isimprecise due to measurement error; sampling error; or message delay. She may also wantto protect her privacy by providing a less precise location. In this paper; we study theefficiency of queries that return probabilistic guarantees for location data with uncertainty.We classify this query into two types; based on whether the data (1) has no uncertainty (eg;shops and restaurants); or (2) has a controlled degree of uncertainty (eg; moving vehicles).Based on this classification; we develop three methods to improve the computational and I/Operformance. The first method expands the query range based on the query issuer's …,Department of Computing; The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,*,1,12

Special Issue: Real-Time Data Hiding and Visual Cryptography,C Kim; CC Chang; CN Yang; X Zhang; J Baek,Data hiding (DH) may embed secret data; copyright information; and annotation into variousmedia such as image; audio; video; or text. The embedded data should be invisible to awatchdog; and meanwhile the secret data have to stay hidden in a cover signal withoutdetection from steganalysis tools. For this reason; we should retain the good visual quality ofan image with the high embedding data. However; trade-offs exist between the embeddingcapacity and the degree of quality to cover media modification. That is; as one increases; theother must decrease. Thus; according to our need; we choose the best way to implementDH. Reversible DH (RDH) was derived from DH for sensitive applications such as militaryand hospital since 10 year ago. Recent research on RDH has been focused on encrypteddomains. Another topic of this special issue is visual cryptography scheme (VCS). In the …,Journal of Real-Time Image Processing,2018,*,10
TOAIN: a throughput optimizing adaptive index for answering dynamic k NN queries on road networks,Siqiang Luo; Ben Kao; Guoliang Li; Jiafeng Hu; Reynold Cheng; Yudian Zheng,Abstract We study the classical kNN queries on road networks. Existing solutions mostlyfocus on reducing query processing time. In many applications; however; system throughputis a more important measure. We devise a mathematical model that describes throughput interms of a number of system characteristics. We show that query time is only one of the manyparameters that impact throughput. Others include update time and query/update arrivalrates. We show that the traditional approach of improving query time alone is generallyinadequate in optimizing throughput. Moreover; existing solutions lack flexibility in adaptingto environments of different characteristics. We propose T oain; which is a very flexiblealgorithm that can be easily trained to adapt to a given environment for maximizing querythroughput.

Scalable Evaluation of k-NN Queries on Large Uncertain Graphs,Xiaodong Li; Reynold Cheng; Yixiang Fang; Jiafeng Hu; Silviu Maniu,Graphs are prevalent in social networks [10; 12]; traffic networks [11]; biological networks[31]; and mobile ad-hoc networks [13]. Due to noisy measurements [1]; hardware limitation[2]; inference models [9]; and privacy-preserving perturbation [4; 21]; these graphs areinherently uncertain. To model this error; the uncertain graph has been studied [1; 6; 15; 18].In this graph; each edge is associated with a probability distribution. Figure 1 (a) shows theprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network as an uncertain graph; where each node denotes aprotein; and each edge is an interaction between a pair of proteins. The value on each edgedenotes the probability that the interaction exists (called existence probability). For instance;the existential probability that the interaction between nodes A and B exists is 0.7. k-NNquery.

Dimensional Confinement in Carbon‐based Structures–From 3D to 1D,Nils Richter; Zongping Chen; Marie‐Luise Braatz; Fabienne Musseau; Nils‐Eike Weber; Akimitsu Narita; Klaus Müllen; Mathias Kläui,Abstract We present an overview of charge transport in selected one-; two-and three-dimensional carbon-based materials with exciting properties. The systems are atomicallydefined bottom-up synthesized graphene nanoribbons; doped graphene and turbostraticgraphene micro-disks; where up to 100 graphene layers are rotationally stacked. Forturbostratic graphene we show how this system lends itself to spintronic applications. Thisfollows from the inner graphene layers where charge carriers are protected and thus highlymobile. Doped graphene and graphene nanoribbons offer the possibility to tailor theelectronic properties of graphene either by introducing heteroatoms or by confining thesystem geometrically.

Efficient processing of shortest path queries in evolving graph sequences,Chenghui Ren; Eric Lo; Ben Kao; Xinjie Zhu; Reynold Cheng; David W Cheung,Abstract In many applications; information is best represented as graphs. In a dynamicworld; information changes and so the graphs representing the information evolve with time.We propose that historical graph-structured data be maintained for analytical processing.We call a historical evolving graph sequence an EGS. We observe that in many applications;graphs of an EGS are large and numerous; and they often exhibit much redundancy amongthem. We study the problem of efficient shortest path query processing on an EGS and putforward a solution framework called FVF. Two algorithms; namely; FVF-F and FVF-H; areproposed. While the FVF-F algorithm works on a sequence of flat graph clusters; the FVF-Halgorithm works on a hierarchy of such clusters. Through extensive experiments on both realand synthetic datasets; we show that our FVF framework is highly efficient in shortest …,Information Systems,2017,*,3
Uncertain Voronoi cell computation based on space decomposition,Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Zufle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Reynold Cheng,Abstract To facilitate (k)-Nearest Neighbor queries; the concept of Voronoi decomposition iswidely used. In this work; we propose solutions to extend the concept of Voronoi-cells touncertain data. Due to data uncertainty; the location; the shape and the extent of a Voronoicell are random variables. To facilitate reliable query processing despite the presence ofuncertainty; we employ the concept of possible-Voronoi cells and introduce the novelconcept of guaranteed-Voronoi cells: The possible-Voronoi cell of an object U consists of allpoints in space that have a non-zero probability of having U as their nearest-neighbor; andthe guaranteed-Voronoi cell; which consists of all points in space which must have U as theirnearest-neighbor. Since exact computation of both types of Voronoi cells is computationallyhard; we propose approximate solutions. Therefore; we employ hierarchical access …,Geoinformatica,2017,*,12
On Attributed Community Search,Yixiang Fang; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Communities; which are prevalent in attributed graphs (eg; social networks andknowledge bases) can be used in emerging applications such as product advertisement andsetting up of social events. Given a graph G and a vertex q ∈ G; the community search (CS)query returns a subgraph of G that contains vertices related to q. In this article; we study CSover two common attributed graphs; where (1) vertices are associated with keywords; and(2) vertices are augmented with locations. For keyword-based attributed graphs; weinvestigate the keyword-based attributed community (or KAC) query; which returns a KAC fora query vertex. A KAC satisfies both structure cohesiveness (ie; its vertices are tightlyconnected) and keyword cohesiveness (ie; its vertices share common keywords). For spatial-based attributed graphs; we aim to find the spatial-aware community (or SAC); whose …,International Workshop on Mobility Analytics for Spatio-temporal and Social Data,2017,*,18

When crowdsourcing tabular data;eg; the attribute values of an entity set; a worker's answers on the different attributes (eg; thenationality and age of a celebrity star) are often treated independently. This assumption isnot always true and can lead to suboptimal crowdsourcing performance. In this paper; wepresent the T-Crowd system; which takes into consideration the intricate relationshipsamong tasks; in order to converge faster to their true values. Particularly; T-Crowd integrateseach worker's answers on different attributes to effectively learn his/her trustworthiness andthe true data values. The attribute relationship information is also used to guide taskallocation to workers. Finally; T-Crowd seamlessly supports categorical and continuous …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02125,2017,*,12
Patient Satisfaction and Perspectives of Continuity of Care among Free Clinic Patients in the USA: A Qualitative Study,Akiko Kamimura; Jason Jei-Sun Chen; Guadalupe Aguilera; Mary Stoddard; Kai Sin; Mu Pye; Jeanie Ashby,Introduction: Free clinics are important resources for those who do not have access to healthcare other than the emergency room services in the United States. The purpose of this studywas to explore continuity of care and patient satisfaction from the perspectives of free clinicpatients. Methods: Five focus groups were conducted with patients at a free clinic in June2017 (N= 25). Thematic analysis was performed to identify themes in issues relating tocontinuity of care and patient satisfaction. Results: Continuity of care was not alwaysperceived positively. There were potential miscommunications between providers orreceptionists and patients. Patients may not be well informed of the available resources atthe clinic.

Meta Paths and Meta Structures: Analysing Large Heterogeneous Information Networks,Reynold Cheng; Zhipeng Huang; Yudian Zheng; Jing Yan; Ka Yu Wong; Eddie Ng,Abstract A heterogeneous information network (HIN) is a graph model in which objects andedges are annotated with types. Large and complex databases; such as YAGO and DBLP;can be modeled as HINs. A fundamental problem in HINs is the computation of closeness; orrelevance; between two HIN objects. Relevance measures; such as PCRW; PathSim; andHeteSim; can be used in various applications; including information retrieval; entityresolution; and product recommendation. These metrics are based on the use of meta-paths;essentially a sequence of node classes and edge types between two nodes in a HIN. In thistutorial; we will give a detailed review of meta-paths; as well as how they are used to definerelevance. In a large and complex HIN; retrieving meta paths manually can be complex;expensive; and error-prone. Hence; we will explore systematic methods for finding meta …,Asia-Pacific Web (APWeb) and Web-Age Information Management (WAIM) Joint Conference on Web and Big Data,2017,*,18
Efficient Pattern-Based Aggregation on Sequence Data,Zhian He; Petrie Wong; Ben Kao; Eric Lo; Reynold Cheng; Ziqiang Feng,A Sequence OLAP (S-OLAP) system provides a platform on which pattern-based aggregate(PBA) queries on a sequence database are evaluated. In its simplest form; a PBA queryconsists of a pattern template T and an aggregate function F. A pattern template is asequence of variables; each is defined over a domain. Each variable is instantiated with allpossible values in its corresponding domain to derive all possible patterns of the template.Sequences are grouped based on the patterns they possess. The answer to a PBA query isa sequence cuboid (s-cuboid); which is a multidimensional array of cells. Each cell isassociated with a pattern instantiated from the query's pattern template. The value of each s-cuboid cell is obtained by applying the aggregate function F to the set of data sequencesthat belong to that cell.

STEM: a suffix tree-based method for web data records extraction,Yixiang Fang; Xiaoqin Xie; Xiaofeng Zhang; Reynold Cheng; Zhiqiang Zhang,Abstract To automatically extract data records from Web pages; the data record extractionalgorithm is required to be robust and efficient. However; most of existing algorithms are notrobust enough to cope with rich information or noisy data. In this paper; we propose a novelsuffix tree-based extraction method (STEM) for this challenging task. First; we extract asequence of identifiers from the tag paths of Web pages. Then; a suffix tree is built on top ofthis sequence and four refining filters are proposed to screen out data regions that might notcontain data records. To evaluate model performance; we define an evaluation metric calledpattern similarity and perform rigorous experiments on five real data sets.

Motivated by this finding; we design the swappingindex and smart moving index on tagging quality. We also study the correlations in tagusage and propose the semantic measurement on tagging quality. The proposed methodsare evaluated against real datasets and the results show that they are more efficient thanprevious methods; which are appropriate for a large number of web resources.

Uncertain Voronoi Cell Computation Based on Space Decomposition,Matthias Renz; Reynold Cheng,Abstract. The problem of computing Voronoi cells for spatial objects whose locations are notcertain has been recently studied. In this work; we propose a new approach to computeVoronoi cells for the case of objects having rectangular uncertainty regions. Since exactcomputation of Voronoi cells is hard; we propose an approximate solution. The main idea ofthis solution is to apply hierarchical access methods for both data and object space. Ourspace index is used to efficiently find spatial regions which must (not) be inside a Voronoicell. Our object index is used to efficiently identify Delauny relations; ie; data objects whichaffect the shape of a Voronoi cell. We develop three algorithms to explore index structuresand show that the approach that descends both index structures in parallel yields fast queryprocessing times. Our experiments show that we are able to approximate uncertain …,Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases: 14th International Symposium; SSTD 2015; Hong Kong; China; August 26-28; 2015.

CLUDE: An Efficient Algorithm for LU Decomposition Over a Sequence of Evolving Graphs,CH Ren; Luyi Mo; CM Kao; CK Cheng; DWL Cheung,In many applications; entities and their relationships are represented by graphs. Examplesinclude the WWW (web pages and hyperlinks) and bibliographic networks (authors and co-authorship). A graph can be conveniently modeled by a matrix from which variousquantitative measures are derived. Some example measures include PageRank and SALSA(which measure nodes' importance); and Personalized PageRank and Random Walk withRestart (which measure proximities between nodes). To compute these measures; linearsystems of the form Ax= b; where A is a matrix that captures a graph's structure; need to besolved. To facilitate solving the linear system; the matrix A is often decomposed into twotriangular matrices (L and U). In a dynamic world; the graph that models it changes with timeand thus is the matrix A that represents the graph.

Mobilizing Religion and Conservation in Asia,Stephen M Awoyemi; Andrew G Gosler; Iris Ho; Jame Schaefer; Kwek Yan Chong,THE NEWS OF THE WEEK STORY “MEGADAM GETS GREEN LIGHT”(9 November; p. 726)seems to provide strong support for the cautionary Letter by B. Gong et al.(“Limits to religiousconservation efforts;” 9 November; p. 740) arguing that while Buddhism may be a powerfulresource for conservation; it cannot replace strong environmental governance and policy.The Xayaburi Dam is a very bad idea and clearly represents a massive threat to the ecologyof the Mekong River and its people. Yet it proceeds with the support of at least twopredominantly Buddhist countries; Laos and Thailand; where protests by Buddhist citizenshave gone unheeded (1).

ANEFFICIENT DATASTRUCTURE FORSTORING,Yung-Kuan Chan; Chin-Chen Chang,Abstract Based on the overlapping concept; this paper defines an efficient data structure;called the common-component binary tree (CCBT); to hold the linear quadtreescorresponding to a set of similar binary images. This structure removes the redundantinformation among the linear quadtrees. The processing time required by the operations onthe CCBT structure is only proportional to the number of involved nodes in a specified linearquadtree. Additionally; there is a high storage space reduction for storing the similar imagesbased on the CCBT structure.,Information Organization and Databases: Foundations of Data Organization,2012,*,16

Orogen development at the subduction-collision transition; Southern Taiwan: insights from fission track and U-Th/He thermocronology,L Mesalles; F Mouthereau; C Chang; M Bernet; AT Lin,Abstract The ongoing Taiwanese orogeny has long been thought to be the results of atemporally continuous with relatively constant deformation rates collision since~ 6Ma.However recent studies have questioned this view and suggest instead a polyphasedorogenic structuration with a major Pliocene increase in exhumations rates. In this study; wedemonstrate that the Taiwan mountain belt was created in two distinct phases; and constrainthe exhumation rates associated with each of them using thermochronometric tools. Ourresults are based on more than 30 new fission track (FT) ages (apatite and zircon) from Plio-Pleistocene conglomerates in the Southern Taiwan Pingtung foreland basin and fromvertically sampled profiles in the adjacent Southern Central Range mountains. The detritalrecord gives young orogenic peak ages ranging from~ 4.4 Ma to~ 6.7 Ma. This is the first …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2012,*,19

Robust diving control of AUV with L 2 disturbance attenuation method,Hongjian Wang; Ziyin Chen; Xinqian Bian; Heming Jia,Towards the diving control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); a robust controllerbuilt upon L 2 disturbance attenuation method with recursive backstepping technique isaddressed. External disturbances are eliminated through L 2 controller. A robust controllerincorporated with switching control scheme is proposed against the parameter uncertaintieswith guaranteed stability. Different from conventional parameter adaptive learning method;the decreasing problem of learning precision can be avoided due to the fast varying ofuncertain parameters; and parameter switching law can be obtained through the Lyapunovstability theory. The proposed controller yields asymptotical convergence to the given depthfor the vehicle. Finally; simulation experiments are employed to illustrate the effectiveness ofthe proposed control scheme.,Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA); 2012 10th World Congress on,2012,*,6

Crystal Structure of Cell Adhesion Molecule,Shuijun Zhang; Rongguang Zhang; Jianxun Qi; George F Jun Liu; Xiaomin Qian; Zhujun Chen; Xiang Xu; Feng Gao,The nectin and nectin-like molecule (Necl) family includes important cell adhesionmolecules (CAMs) characterized by their Iglike nature. Such CAMs regulate a broadspectrum of cell–cell interactions; including the interaction between NK cells and cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs) and their target cells. CAM members nectin-2 (CD112) and Necl-5(CD155) are believed to form homodimers (for nectin-2) or heterodimers in their functions forcell adhesion; as well as to interact with immune costimulatory receptor DNAX accessorymolecule 1 (DNAM-1)(CD226) to regulate functions of both NK and CTL cells. However; thestructural basis of the interactive mode of DNAM-1 with nectin-2 or Necl-5 is not yetunderstood.

A Framework for Conditioning Uncertain,Ruiming Tang; Reynold Cheng; Huayu Wu; Stephane Bressan,We propose a framework for representing conditioned probabilistic relational data. In thisframework the existence of tuples in possible worlds is determined by Boolean expressionscomposed from elementary events. The probability of a possible world is computed from theprobabilities associated with these elementary events. In addition; a set of global constraintsconditions the database. Conditioning is the formalization of the process of addingknowledge to a database. Some worlds may be impossible given the constraints and theprobabilities of possible worlds are accordingly re-defined. The new constraints can comefrom the observation of the existence or non-existence of a tuple; from the knowledge of aspecific rule; such as the existence of an exclusive set of tuples; or from the knowledge of ageneral rule; such as a functional dependency. We are therefore interested in computing …,*,2012,*,20

VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF FABRIC TACTILE PROPERTIES USING FUZZY INCLUSION DEGREE AND ANFIS,ZHEBIN XUE; XIANYI ZENG; LUDOVIC KOEHL; YAN CHEN,Abstract The current study is aimed to investigate how fabrics' tactile properties can beperceived through products' visual representations. Two major steps are taken to unveil thevisual compensatory mechanism. The first step is to describe the mechanism. A novelmethod based on rough sets and fuzzy sets theories is proposed to extract principal visualfeatures for each tactile property. In this part; the single-to-single and multiple-to-singlecorrelations are studied by applying this method. The second step is to quantify the exploredmechanism. A mathematical model between each tactile property and the correspondingprincipal visual features is established using an adaptive network-based fuzzy inferencesystem (ANFIS). This model has been proved to be capable of predicting fabrics' tactileproperties from the perceived visual features with a satisfactory accuracy.,*,2012,*,19

HIV-1 Gp41 Ectodomain Induces Activation of the CD74-Mediated ERK/MAPK Pathway to Enhance Viral Infection,Chang Zhou; Lu Lu; Suiyi Tan; Shibo Jiang; Ying-Hua Chen,Abstract Besides mediating the viral entry process; the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope protein gp41 can bind to many host cell components and regulate cell functions.Using a yeast two-hybrid system; we screened a human bone marrow cDNA library andidentified a novel gp41 binding protein; CD74 (the MHC class II-associated invariant chain).Here we report possible biological effects mediated by interaction between gp41 and CD74.We found that HIV-1 gp41 could directly bind to host CD74 in HIV-1-infected cells and thepeptide 6358 derived from gp41 loop region (aa597-611) could effectively block gp41-CD74interaction. As a result of this binding; rsgp41 and gp41 peptide 6358 activated the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway and significantly enhanced HIV-1 infection in vitro.Conversely; the enhancing effect could be suppressed by recombinant CD74 …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2011,*,5

SMN Regulates the Differentiation of Embryonic Stem Cells in Mice.,Wei-Fang Chang; Ji-Long Liu; Li-Ying Sung,Survival motor neuron (SMN) protein is the determining factor for neurodegenerativedisease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA); a leading genetic cause of infant death and one ofthe most common autosomal recessive diseases. It is well known that SMN is essential forthe biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). However; the role of SMN indevelopment is poorly understood. Here we use mouse model to study the expression ofSMN in early development and the role of SMN in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We showhigh levels of SMN in metaphase II oocytes and embryos at 1-to 4-cell stages. While it dropsat 8-cell stage; the SMN level increases at morula stage. We also find that SMN protein co-localizes with PLZF and TRA98; two spermatogonia markers; in undifferentiatedspermatogonia cells but not in matured spermatocytes.

Lossless Secret Sharing Scheme with High Quality Shares Based on VQ-Compressed Images,Chin-Chen Chang; Kuo-Nan Chen; Ngoc-Tu Huynh,In this paper; we propose an efficient secret sharing scheme without pixel expansion. Thescheme first uses the VQ-compression method to compress a secret image. This allowssenders to share a larger secret image than other methods. Moreover; the proposed methodalso allows participants to reconstruct a lossless secret image. The generated shadows aremeaningful with high quality; so the image does not attract any suspicion from attackers.Because the scheme uses XOR operation during the construction and revealing phases; it issuitable for secret sharing applications.,International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,2011,*,10

REVERSIBLE DATA HIDING FOR VQ INDICES USING PREDICTION ERRORS,Zhi-hui Wang; Chin-Chen Chang; Huynh Ngoc Tu; Ming-Chu Li,Abstract. Reversible data hiding techniques have received more and more attention inrecent years. Many researchers have proposed methods to directly hide secret data in animage. However; images are usually compressed and stored using compression techniquesin indices format. Hence; this paper proposes a novel and reversible data hiding method forvector quantization (VQ) compressed images. The proposed scheme exploits characteristicsof VQ indices and the prediction errors between them to embed the secret data and toguarantee that the original indices can be recovered to reconstruct the VQ compressedimage. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve higherembedding capacity and better bit rate compared to other schemes.,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL,2011,*,18

A Heuristic Algorithm for the QoS Problem Based on Multi-Constraints,Li-jun XIONG; Zheng XIE; Zhi CHEN; Jun ZHANG,On the communication network; QoS-based routing has become the hot technique in orderto fulfill the requirements of multimedia communications. Generally; finding a path in thenetwork that satisfies multiple independent constraints is known to be NP-complete. In thispaper; we discuss the multi-constrained path (MCP) problem. By transforming the problem todiscrete dynamic networks; which is acyclic; we propose a more efficient heuristic algorithmfor QoS routing. The running time complexity is reduced from O (Tmn) to O (Tm); where m isthe number of edges and n is the number of nodes; T is an integer defined by the algorithm.Further more; we theoretically prove the correctness of the algorithm. In the end; someexperimental results are presented to show that the proposed algorithm performs better thanother algorithms when used to solve the MCP problem.

Residue Dynamics of Fungicide Pyraclostrobin on Chinese Cabbages,Shao-jun ZHANG; Zhen-shan ZHENG; Yong-da CHEN; Li WANG; Xun QIAN,Liquid chromatography with UV detection was used to determine pyraclostrobin residues inChinese cabbage [Brassica compestris L. ssp. pekinensis (Lour) Olsson]. The dynamics ofdegradation of pyraclostrobin residues in Chinese cabbages in Hebei and Hunan Provinceswere studied. The results showed that the limit of determination was 0.04 mg· kg-1. Therecoveries were 70%~ 106% and coefficients of variation were 6.6%~ 10% between theconcentration of 0.04~ 2.00 mg· kg-1. The results indicated that the half lives ofpyraclostrobin in Chinese cabbages in Hebei and Hunan were 2.97 d and 3.34 d;respectively. According to the research findings; when pyraclostrobin being applied 3 and 4times to Chinese cabbage fields with dosages of active ingredient of 187.50 and 281.25 g·hm-2; the residues of pyraclostrobin in Chinese cabbages 7 days after the last application …,China Vegetables,2011,*,5

It can be integrated into current garment CADsystem for providing personalized design support. Two procedures of sensory evaluationhave been used. The first one aims at evaluating abstract fashion themes by means ofemotional descriptors. In this procedure; the evaluators; including fashion designers andconsumers; will give relevancy degrees between fashion themes and emotional descriptors.A fuzzy cognitive map is introduced to represent the corresponding results. It can beconsidered as a conceptual model characterizing the cognition level of evaluators onabstract fashion themes.

DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF cAMP AND CRH IN CELL VIABILITY AND CELL FUSION OF CYTOTROPHOBLASTIC CELLS,Y Chen; M Allars; C Abou-Seif; R Smith; RC Nicholson,Cell fusion of cytotrophoblasts is critical for a successful pregnancy; and is markedbiochemically by proteins such as human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and syncytin; andmorphologically as large multi-nucleated cells. Placental corticotrophin releasing hormone(CRH) plays diverse roles during pregnancy and has been linked to the length of gestation.It is well accepted that CRH expression could be upregulated by some hormones; such ashCG via cellular cAMP; and that trophoblastic cell fusion can be induced by Forskolin(increases cAMP). We have shown; by reporter gene assay in human primary placentalcells; that 8-Br-cAMP increased CRH gene expression. Thus; it is of interest to determine theroles of 8-Br-cAMP and CRH on trophoblast cell viability and cell fusion. Treatment with 8-Br-cAMP for 72 h significantly inhibited BeWo cell viability (MTT assay) by 29.7%(50 μM) and …,Reproduction; Fertility and Development,2010,*,0
313. EPIGENETIC REGULATION OF THE CRH GENE PROMOTER INVOLVES SPECIFIC CpG DE-METHYLATION,X Pan; C Abou-Seif; M Allars; Y Chen; RC Nicholson,Corticotropin Releasing Hormone (CRH); is expressed in many regions of the centralnervous system and in some peripheral tissues; and plays an important role in determininggestational length. In placenta; a cAMP regulatory site (CRE) is crucial for CRH generegulation. The promoter of CRH gene has 9 CpG sites; which should be the targets ofepigenetic regulation by DNA methylation. The BeWo cell line; derived from humangestational choriocarcinoma; has been widely used as an in vitro model for the placenta.BeWo cells only produce CRH after exposure to cAMP. The DNA methyl transferase (DNMT)inhibitor 5-aza-cytidine stimulates CRH expression 5-fold in camp treated BeWo cells;indicating the CRH promoter as a target of DNMTs. To evaluate methylation differences ofthe 9 CpG sites in CRH gene promoter in BeWo cells after treatment with cAMP. Genomic …,Reproduction; Fertility and Development,2010,*,19

Experimental study of dielectric window breakdown suppression technology under HPM in vacuum,Xi-Wei Hao; Guan-Jun Zhang; Hui-Jun Huang; Jin-Yong Fang; Chang-Hua Chen; Wen-Hua Huang,In order to restrain surface breakdown of dielectric window in HPM (High Power Microwave)devices; experimental research of surface breakdown suppression technology for PTFE isperformed under an S-band HPM experimental system in this paper. Different suppressiontechnologies are employed; such as surface polishing; surface notching and surface coatingtechnologies; etc. Experimental results show that polishing treatment on dielectric surfacecan increase surface breakdown threshold. The surface grooves parallel to the direction ofelectric field can reduce surface breakdown threshold; while the grooves perpendicular tothe direction of electric field can suppress surface breakdown; and the effect is influenced bythe depth and width of groove. The surface breakdown experiment of TiN coating on PTFEsurface is performed; and the results are also discussed.

A Novel Method to Solve Disparities Between Radiographic and Navigational Measurements of Limb Alignments in Computer Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,Tae Kyun Kim; YG Kang; CB Chang; BJ Chung; HJ Cho; SC Seong,Application of computer assisted navigation (CAN) has been documented to improve theaccuracy of limb alignment and implant positioning. However; a recent study reported that agreat deal of disparities occurred between the radiographic and navigational measurementscalling the basic argument for application of CAN to TKA into question. In the authors'practice using CAN for TKA; we have observed consistent disparities between thepreoperative radiographic assessments and intraoperative navigational assessments of limbalignment in the coronal plane. A large disparity between radiographic and navigationalassessments of limb alignment would be presenting a challenging question whether or notthe surgeon can rely on the information provided by the CAN system. We developed a novelmethod to measure the coronal limb alignment and have found that the radiographic …,Orthopaedic Proceedings,2010,*,12

Relationship Between Anatomical References And Sagittal Mechanical Axes Of Computer Assisted Navigation For Total Knee Arthroplasty,Byung June Chung; YG Kang; CB Chang; SJ Kim; SC Seong; TK Kim,Despite the well-documented improvement in coronal alignment achieved by computerassisted navigation; varying results have been reported for sagittal alignment. Currentnavigation systems rely on a sagittal femoral mechanical axis identified by the navigationsystem; but little information is available on the relationship between the sagittal mechanicalaxis and anatomical axes for intra-operative or postoperative radiographic assessments. Weasked whether deviations exist between sagittal femoral mechanical axis and anatomicalaxes and attempted to identify predictors of the deviations found. In 100 consecutive patients(200 knees) undergoing TKA; angles between two anatomical axes (the anterior cortical lineand mid-medullary line) and two sagittal mechanical axes identified by current navigationsystems were measured as proxies of the deviations between them on true lateral …,Orthopaedic Proceedings,2010,*,3

EFFECTS OF CAMP AND SERUM ON HUMAN TROPHOBLAST CELL VIABILITY AND DIFFERENTIATION,Y Chen; M Allars; C Abou-Seif; RC Nicholson,The formation of syncytium is a pivotal event for trophoblast cells to interact with theplacental bed. While cAMP is regarded as an inducer of syncytialisation; the affect ofdifferent culture conditions on this cAMP effect has not been explored. Therefore; the effectsof cAMP on cell differentiation and viability in the presence or absence of serum wereinvestigated in the human choriocarcinoma cell lines; BeWo and JEG-3. We observed that inthe absence of cAMP; BeWo cells grew best in media containing 10% FCS; followed bymedia containing charcoal-stripped 10% FCS (10% CCS); and less well in serum-freemedia. In the presence of cAMP (0.25~ 1.5 mM); our observations suggest different cellularprogrammes may be in play. Treatment of BeWo cells with 0.75 mM cAMP for 24h and 48h;in the absence of serum; increased cell viability (MTT assay) by 25.1% and 46.1 …,Reproduction; Fertility and Development,2009,*,20

RebaCQ: Query refinement based on consecutive queries,Chia-Hsin Hung; Shuo-En Tsai; Yi-Shin Chen,Previous studies reveal that half of the queries submitted to search engines have no follow-up click-through data. This may indicate that users are either dissatisfied with theperformance of current search engines or have difficulty formulating correct query keywordsrelated to their search intents. To address this issue; this paper proposes a query refinementmechanism called RebaCQ; which can help users obtain satisfactory pages as soon aspossible. By reusing user personal wisdom extracted from their previous consecutivequeries; RebaCQ can provide refined result sets closer to user intents. Our experimentalresults show that result accuracy is significantly increased after adapting RebaCQ.,Information Reuse & Integration; 2009. IRI'09. IEEE International Conference on,2009,*,18

High speed semiconductor optical amplifiers and their performance in pseudo-random bit-stream generation,NK Dutta; S Ma; Z Chen,Semiconductor optical amplifiers are important for wide range of applications includingoptical networks; optical tomography and optical logic systems. For many of theseapplications particularly for optical networks and optical logic high speed performance of theSOA is important. The speed of operation of SOA is limited by the gain and phase recoverytimes in the SOA. We have demonstrated higher speed operation (i) for SOAs with a carrierreservoir layer;(ii) for SOAs with a multi-quantum well modulation doped active region;and;(iii) for SOAs with a quantum dot (QD) active region. The multi-quantum well SOA hasbeen integrated with InGaAsP/InP based waveguides to build Mach-Zehnder interferometers(MZI). XOR optical logic has been demonstrated at 80 Gb/s using these SOA-MZI structures.XOR operation has been analyzed by solving the rate equation of the SOA; for SOAs with …,Photonics North 2009,2009,*,18

Island growth mechanism of SiCGe epilayer on SiC,Lian-bi LI; Zhi-ming CHEN; Qing-min LI,The growth mechanism of SiCGe films grown on SiC is analyzed by hot wall chemical vapordeposition (HWCVD). The SiCGe epilayer has two types of island structures; sphericalislands with diamond cubic structure and cascading triangular islands with zinc-blendestructure. The spherical island is produced by the precipitation Ge phase at hightemperature; while the cascading triangular island is the outcrop of stacking faulttetrahedron. Two reasons for the transition between the spherical and cascading triangularislands are disscussed. At high temperature; SiC phase is more stable than SiCGe phase;hence Ge content is decreased in the SiCGe film; which reduces the mismatch strainbetween the epilayer and the substrate; thus enhances the 2D growth and makes thespherical island change into the cascading triangular islands. Higher growth temperature …,Materials Science and Technology,2009,*,12

Microstructure of the BNf/Si3N4 Composites Prepared by LPCVD,Zhaofeng Chen; Shuicheng Wan; Zhiqiang Cheng; Chonghai Wang; Mingxia Zhang; Ling Li,ABSTRACT The BN/Si3N4 composites were prepared by LPCVD using SiCl4-NH3-Hr-Ar asprecursor at 950 C. The microstructure of the BN/Si3N4 composites was examined byscanning electron microscopy. The phase identification of the nanometer Si3N4 wasconfirmed by X-ray diffraction. The morphology and growth mechanism of the Si3N4 matrixwere investigated using chemical reaction kinetics and supersaturation-condensation-fusionmechanism. Because of the mismatching of the coefficient of the thermal expansion and thepoor wettability between the coating and the substrate; the coatings could be easily flakedaway. The internal surface of the Si3N4 shell was very smooth; which proved the poorwettability. The external surface of the Si3N4 shell was composed of the amorphousspheroid particles; which proved the SK growth model.,Science and Engineering of Composite Materials,2009,*,21

In 1999; Seo and Sweeney first proposed anauthenticated key agreement protocol using a pre-shared password. Later; Tseng pointedout that Seo and Sweeney's protocol suffered from the replay attack. Tseng then presentedan improvement to repair the weakness. Unfortunately; Ku and Wang soon showed thatTseng's protocol is insecure against the modification attack and the replay attack. Then; Kuand Wang proposed an improved version to overcome the weakness from which Tseng'sprotocol suffered. However; we find that Ku and Wang's protocol is vulnerable to the off-linepassword guessing attack.

An oil-immersed graphite cathode and water-cooled beam collector were introduced to increaseoutput stability. Experimental results indicate that BWO's efficiency is up to the highest 33%at optimum diode voltage; which is consistent with numerical simulations. The BWO couldstably operate at rates of 100 Hz with microwave output power of over 1 GW; and thecontinuous time was up to 5 seconds.,High Power Particle Beams (BEAMS); 2008 17th International Conference on,2008,*,12

Using Dominance Searching to Speed up Temporal Join Operation,Chih-Ying Chen; Jui-Feng Hu; Chin-Chen Chang,Abstract. This paper is concerned with the problem of efficient processing of temporal joinoperation on temporal relation. By mapping time intervals to points in the plane; we firstshow that the problem of determining the set of all matching tuples of a temporal join isequivalent to the dominance searching problem in the plane. Then; by using an efficientdata structure for solving the equivalent dominance searching problem as an index for theinner relation; we propose a nested-loops temporal join algorithm. For the case where theindex for the inner relations too large to fit in the primary memory; we propose anotherpartition-based temporal join algorithm which does not need any index for the operandrelations. Finally; in order to provide more efficient processing of temporal join; we propose acluster scheme and an index scheme to support efficient storage of tuples and direct …,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL,2008,*,19
An adaptive EMD embedding method by condensing secret messages based on consecutive ones transformation and token substitution,Chin-Feng Lee; Yi-Ren Wang; Chin-Chen Chang,Abstract A new exploiting modification direction embedding method (also called the EMDembedding for short) was proposed by Zhang et al. to show that their proposed method hashigh embedding capacity and high stego-image quality as well because at most one coverpixel need increase/decrease by one among n cover pixels. Adopting the advantages of theEMD embedding method; we develop a condensed technique based on consecutive onestransformation and token representation to squeeze out of more embedding spaces forsecret data to be embedded in a cover image. This contributes data embedding capacity.,Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Ubiquitous information management and communication,2008,*,12
A Parallel Conversion Algorithm Based upon Aryabhata Remainder Theorem for Residue Number System,Chin-Chen Chang; Jen-Ho Yang,Abstract. To solve the conversion problem in Residue Number System (RNS) with a generalmoduli set; a common solution is to use Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). In CRT; it hasto compute a modular arithmetic with a large number to adjust the final result; which is a time-consuming operation. On the contrary; Aryabhata Remainder Theorem (ART) distributes thistime-consuming operation into several modular arithmetic with smaller numbers in eachiteration. Thus; ART is more suitable than CRT for the parallel processing. In this paper; wepropose a parallel conversion algorithm based upon ART for RNS. Unlike the timecomplexities of the previous researches are O (n); ours is just O (log2n); where n is thenumber of the moduli in RNS. Therefore; our algorithm is more efficient than the previousones.,International Journal of Innovative Computing,2008,*,16

Robust Model for Pharmacokinetic Data in 2x2 Crossover Designs and its Application to Bioequivalence Test,Yuh-Ing Chen; Chi-Shen Huang,Abstract. To have a robust analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data in a 2x2 crossover designwhere involves both the test and reference drugs; we proposed a semi-parametric model fordrug concentrations in blood over time when the kinetic of the drugs under study is uncertainor too complicated. The proposed model primarily includes a smooth mean drugconcentration-time curve that can be estimated by using restricted cubic splines and an errorvariable which is distributed to a generalized gamma distribution (Stacy; 1962). To take intoaccount of the effect of subject's covariates on the drug concentration; we also consider asmooth function of covariates in the model which can be estimated by using tensor productregression spline (Eilers and Marx; 2003). A global bioequivalence test for the two drugs isthen suggested which is based on the difference between the two drug concentration …,COMPSTAT’2010 Book of Abstracts,2008,*,18

Permittivity modulation study of multiferroic AlN/NiFe/AlN films,DS Hung; YD Yao; KT Wu; JC Hsu; YC Chen; Y Ding,Abstract This paper reports the dielectric properties of AlN/NiFe/AlN multiferroelectric filmsthat were fabricated by the reactive sputtering system. The permittivity that was relative tothickness and number of NiFe layers was observed from 40 Hz to 30 MHz. In thisinvestigation; we found that the dielectric constant of the AlN/NiFe/AlN/multilayered film wasup to 60 for a nano-scale NiFe interlayer. The data indicated that the dielectric constant ofthe AlN/NiFe/AlN was strongly dependent on the number of the NiFe layers but weak to theirthickness. The dielectric tuniability of AlN/NiFe/AlN was also observed by in this study. Theresults concluded the dielectric-electric variation of AlN films that are modulated by the NiFeferromagnetic layers.(© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Dynamic mechanochemistry of seismic slip-nano spherules lubrication,Hidemi Tanaka; W Chen; Y Chen; Y Song; K Ma,Abstract The Chelungpu fault; which was activated during 1999Chi-Chi Earthquake; hadbeen drilled (Hole A; B and C) to recover the earthquake slip zone materials. We presenthere the results of nano-scale observations for identified slip zone materials (Ma; Tanaka etal.; 2006) by using HR-TEM and TXM technique. Minimum size of grains observed under HR-TEM is 3 nm. The grain size distribution for grains larger than 100 nm in diameter follows thefractal law and grain shape is highly irregular. Grains smaller than100 nm show somespecific characteristics; that is; smaller the grains; more the spherical shapes and more equi-granular. Thus; the grains smaller than 100 nm are no longer described by fractaldistribution model. By SAD and EDX analysis under HR-TEM; the nano spherules aremainly composed of crystallized quartz associated with minor amounts of carbonates and …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2007,*,21

Role of Monocyte-Induced Ca2+ Signaling in Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cell Reactive Oxygen Metabolite Production and Apoptosis,D Yang; SG Elner; AL Kindezelskii; X Chen; AJ Clark; HR Petty; VM Elner,Purpose:: Low-grade inflammation is now recognized to play a role in age-related maculardegeneration (AMD). The inflammatory response in AMD lesions is characterized bymononuclear phagocyte and lymphocyte infiltration of the outer blood-retina barrier that isformed by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). A key mechanistic element in AMDprogression is RPE dysfunction and apoptotic loss. In this study; we evaluated the role ofmonocyte (Mϕ)-induced sequential RPE Ca 2+ signaling; and reactive oxygen metabolite(ROM) production in RPE apoptosis. Methods:: Primary human RPE cell cultures; freshly-isolated human peripheral Mϕ; and U937 monocytic line were used. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) ormonocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was used to activate Mϕ.

No Deletion of CFHL1 and CFHL3 Genes in Age-Related Macular Degeneration,K Spencer; Y Chen; MA Hauser; S Schmidt; WK Scott; N Schnetz-Boutaud; A Agarwal; EA Postel; MA Pericak-Vance; JL Haines,Purpose:: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) impairs central vision and interfereswith normal daily tasks for as many as 7.5 million Americans. Much progress has been madein identifying genetic risk factors for AMD; including both susceptibility variants andprotective haplotypes in the complement factor H (CFH) gene on chromosome 1. Recently;deletion of the" CFH-like" genes CFHL1 and CFHL3 was found to be segregating with aparticular CFH haplotype; and deletion of these genes was suggested to be protective forAMD (Hughes et al. 2006). Methods:: We genotyped 3 tag SNPs from the original CFHputative deletion-carrying haplotype that perfectly differentiate this haplotype (GAA atrs2019724; rs1831281; and rs3753396); and identified 20 homozygotes (8 cases and 12controls) for the potential deletion out of our full dataset of 437 cases and 160 controls …,Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science,2007,*,18

Quality Assurances of Probabilistic Queries,Reynold Cheng; Edward Chan; Kam-Yiu Lam,Many applications use sensors extensively to capture and monitor the status of physicalentities. In a habitat-monitoring system; for example; the temperature values of birds' nestsare investigated through the use of wireless sensor networks (Deshpande 2004). Sensorsare also installed in different parts of the building; so that the temperature offices can beadjusted by an internal air-conditioning system. In fact; sensors are increasingly used invarious applications; which deliver monitoring and querying services based on variousattribute values of physical environments; such as location data; temperature; pressure;rainfall; wind speed; and UV-index.

A Novel Statistical Model for Speech Recognition and POS Tagging,Lichi Yuan; Zhigang Chen,Hidden Markov model is a statistical model which has been applied successfully to speechrecognition and natural language processing. However; it is based on three assumptions:(1)limited horizon;(2) time invariant (stationary);(3) the independence assumption ofobservations within a state.

A Bandwidth Efficiency of the Locally Adaptive Compression Method for Hiding Secret Messages.,Tzu-Chuen Lu; Chin-Chen Chang,Abstract This paper proposes a novel lossless informationhiding scheme that hidesinformation in locally adaptive compressed codes. The scheme is abbreviated as IHLAC forwider the efficiency of the compressed codes. IHLAC is designed for two objectives; one is tocompress a text file; the other is to hide secret information in it. According to the experimentalresults; IHLAC can easily and efficiently reach the objective of hiding huge secretinformation. IHLAC can exactly decompress the original text file and extract the secretinformation. Only a small number of extra bits are needed to record the hidden information.In addition; the IHLAC can be even used to hide secret information in image files withoutdistorting the image quality.,JCIS,2006,*,19

During electrophoresis; the hybrids (the dual-spiral structures formed inhybridization) would be unchained when targets were continuously removed. In this case;not only the non-specific binding labeled targets; but also the targets participating inhybridization would be removed. Therefore; only the perfectly matched sequences had thedistinct hybridization signals; the perfectly matched probes from the single-base mismatchedones could more easily be distinguished; and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) …,Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society; 2005.

No Anomaly Appearance in Pre-Earthquake Phenomena Center,C Chen; J Liu; P Lin; Y Chen; F Freund; H Yen,Abstract Most of studies about pre-earthquake phenomena are observed by theelectromagnetic (EM) emission and the geomagnetic filed anomalies; which are possiblyinfluenced from electric currents but the relationship between the phenomena andmechanisms is never understood completely due to many fail events. The sufficientmagnitude of current flows produced by rock-stressed is certainly existence; but theepicenter is also considered center of earthquake precursors. Sometimes; no pre-earthquake phenomena are confused so that the statistics is a method for supporting theobserved results.

A parallel modular exponentiation scheme for transformed exponents,Chin-Chen Chang; Yeu-Pong Lai,Abstract This paper introduces an efficient method to compute modular exponentiationoperations in parallel. For the parallel process of a modular exponentiation operation; theexponent is transformed into mixed radix digits first. Each digit is then an exponent for apartial result of the modular exponentiation operation. Because the computing processes forthese partial results are highly independent; they can be carried out concurrently. The basesin these partial exponentiation operations can be pre-computed and used till the exponentmoduli set changed. If the largest mixed radix digit is k-bits with respect to m exponentmoduli; the time complexity for the proposed scheme is then k+ log 2 m. The performingcomplexity is very efficient; compared with other methods. Since the comparison is based onthe same modular multiplication hardware; the performance is better if the fewer …,International Workshop on Advanced Parallel Processing Technologies,2005,*,18

EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS FOR MINING SHARE-FREQUENT ITEMSETS,Yu-Chiang Li1 Jieh-Shan Yeh; Chin-Chen Chang,ABSTRACT: Itemset share has been proposed to evaluate the significance of itemsets formining association rules in databases. The Fast Share Measure (FSM) algorithm is one ofthe best algorithms to discover all share-frequent itemsets efficiently. However; FSM is fastonly when dealing with small datasets. In this study; we shall propose a revised version ofFSM; called the Enhanced FSM (EFSM) algorithm that speeds up the share-frequentitemsets discovery process. In addition; we shall also present two additional algorithms;SuFSM and ShFSM; developed from EFSM. SuFSM and ShFSM prune the candidates moreefficiently than FSM and therefore can improve the performance significantly. Simulationresults reveal that the proposed methods perform significantly better than ZSP and FSM; andthe performance of ShFSM is the best.,Proceedings of the Eleventh International Fuzzy Systems Association World Congress (Volume Ⅰ),2005,*,12
Content-Based Retrieval Concept,Yung-Kuan Chan; Chin-Chen Chang,Abstract Because of the demand for efficient management in images; much attention hasbeen paid to image retrieval over the past few years. The text-based image retrieval systemis commonly used in traditional search engines (Ratha et al.; 1996); where a query isrepresented by keywords that are usually identified and classified by human beings. Sincepeople have different understandings on a particular image; the consistency is difficult tomaintain. When the database is larger; it is arduous to describe and classify the imagesbecause most images are complicated and have many different objects. There has been atrend towards developing the content-based retrieval system; which tries to retrieve imagesdirectly and automatically based on their visual contents.,*,2005,*,5

Sometimes We Just Can't Agree with Everyone—First Conjunct Agreement in Kiche,Lawrence Cheung,Kiche 2; a Mayan language spoken in Guatemala; has rich verbal morphology for subjectand object agreement. First conjunct (FC) agreement with the coordinate nominal object wasnoted in Cheung's (2004) preliminary study. Special privilege is given to the first conjunctwhen the coordinate DP occurs in some contexts; giving rise to asymmetry between the firstconjunct and the other conjunct (s). In this paper; the distribution of FC agreement will beexamined in a wider range of constructions and contexts such as sentences with differentword orders; postverbal subjects in questions and elements that force group reading ofcoordinate DPs. New findings about FC agreement will be reported. The rest of the paperwill be organized as follows. Section 2 will provide an introduction to FC agreement cross-linguistically and the syntactic environment for FC agreement in Kiche. In Section 3; I will …,*,2005,*,12

Adaptive Stream Filters for Entity-based Queries with Non-Value Tolerance Technical Report,Reynold Cheng; Ben Kao; Sunil Prabhakar; Alan Kwan; Yicheng Tu,Abstract We study the problem of applying adaptive filters for approximate query processingin a distributed stream environment. We propose filter bound assignment protocols with theobjective of reducing communication cost. Most previous works focus on value-basedqueries (eg; average) with numerical error tolerance. In this paper; we cover entity-basedqueries (eg; a nearest neighbor query returns object names rather than a single value). Inparticular; we study non-value-based tolerance (eg; the answer to the nearest-neighborquery should rank third or above). We investigate different non-value-based error tolerancedefinitions and discuss how they are applied to two classes of entity-based queries: non-rankbased and rank-based queries. Extensive experiments show that our protocols achievesignificant savings in both communication overhead and server computation.,*,2005,*,18
Efficient Join Processing over Uncertain Data Technical Report,Reynold Cheng; Yuni Xia; Sunil Prabhakar; Rahul Shah; Jeffrey S Vitter,Abstract In database systems that collect information about the external environment; suchas temperature and location values; it is often infeasible to obtain accurate information dueto measurement and sampling errors; and resource limitations. Queries evaluated overthese inaccurate data can potentially yield incorrect results. To avoid these problems. theidea of using uncertainty models (such as an interval associated with a probability densityfunction) instead of a single value for modeling a data item has been explored in recentyears. These works have focussed on simple queries such as range and nearest-neighborqueries. Queries that join multiple relations have not been addressed in earlier work despitethe significance of joins in databases. In this paper we address join queries over uncertaindata. As with other queries over uncertain data; these joins return probabilistic answers. A …,*,2005,*,12

Fast edge-based method for image magnification,CC Chang; GI Chen,Abstract For image magnification; nearest-neighbourhood interpolation; linear interpolationand bicubic interpolation are preferable for their rapidity; but they have a step-like boundaryproblem or blurring effect. To improve these defects; many edge-based methods havealready been proposed; and some are being developed. Nevertheless; their highcomplexities prevent them from being popular. This paper proposes a new fast edge-basedmethod. Several assumptions are made to speed up the edge estimation process; andseveral simple hybrid interpolations are proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed method is fast and the magnified images are vivid with sharp edges and smoothhomogeneous areas.,The Imaging Science Journal,2004,*,20
Free Ileocolic Flap for Reconstruction in Hypopharyngeal Cancer,Yi-Cheng Chang; Hung-Tao Hsiao; Kwang-Yi Tung; Yuan-Ching Chang; Yi-Shing Leu,Hypopharyngeal cancer is a difficult cancer to manage. The majority of patients alreadyhave advanced disease by the time they present. The 5-year survival for advanced cases isonly 20% to 25%. Pharyngolaryngectomy is usually necessary for advanced resectabledisease; but immediate reconstruction is a major problem. Since April 2003; we haveperformed one-stage reconstruction with a free ileocolic flap for six patients. All flaps havesurvived. The patients recovered the ability to swallow 20 to 21 days postoperatively andbegan speech rehabilitation on day 21. The ileocolic flap allows rapid restoration ofswallowing and speech without excessive morbidity.,中華民國整形外科醫學會雜誌,2004,*,12

Simulation of a near infrared light-activated 4H-SiC Darlington transistor switches,Hongbin Pu; Zhiming Chen; Xianfeng Feng; Baoshan Ma; Liuchen Li,The novel near infrared light-activated Darlington heterojunction transistor power switchmade of SiC has been proposed; in which SiCGe/SiC pn is employed to produce a basecurrent by means of optical illumination. By using two-dimensional numerical simulationMEDICI; the SiCGe/SiC photodetector can be triggered by a near infer-red laser beam if thecomposition parameters of the Sil-x-yCxGey have been chosen properly. Performance of thenear Infrared light-activated power switch was simulated; which has shown that the light-activated device has very good switching characteristics at 0.85/spl mu/m for optical intensityof 1.0 Watt/cm2. Based on our simulation results; the distribution of current density predictsthat the auxiliary transistor is turned on at first by a low density of photocurrent and then themain transistor is turned on.

Multiple Primary Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Extremities-Case Report,Yi-Cheng Chang; Yung-Fa Tsai; Kwang-Yi Tung,Multiple primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs) are common in the headand neck region; but synchronous CSCCs of the extremities have not been frequentlyreported in the literature. Multiple CSCCs carry a high risk of subsequent primary skincancer. CSCCs arising in a scar have higher rate of recurrence or metastasis than thoseoccurring in actinic keratoses. A patient presented with primary CSCCs on the ankle andwrist. She had a 14-year history of a scar on her ankle which became ulcerated 2 years priorto presentation; as well a numerous cancer precursors on her palms; fingers; and extremitiesthat had been investigated several years earlier. Although the ankle lesion was consistentwith Marjolin's ulcer; the synchronous wrist lesion and multiple precancerous lesions raisethe possibility of other etiologies; including cancer arising in actinic keratoses and/or …,中華民國整形外科醫學會雜誌,2003,*,12

A Calligraphic Images Retrieval Scheme (CIRS) Based on Color and Ink Densitv,Tzu-Chuen Lu; Chin-Chen Chang,[摘要]: 正An ever-increasing volume of Chinese calligraphic image data has significantlyincreased the demand for presenting an efficient method to find similar images in a hugecalligraphic image database. The calligraphic images retrieval scheme (CIRS) is a searchmethod for retrieving images from a database and is designed for use in searchingcalligraphy imagery. CIRS provides a processing scheme to extract color and ink densityfeatures from calligraphic images. Experimental results indicate that CIRS only takes a littlestorage space; can efficiently recognize similar images; and resists shifted; sharpened;blurred; noised; compressed; brightened; cropped; darkened; rotated; curved and changedtexture variants in calligraphic images. Therefore; the CIRS system allows a user to detectsimilar images efficiently.,Advances in Computation of Oriental Languages--Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Computer Processing of Oriental Languages,2003,*,5
A new key assignment scheme for enforcing complicated,Iuon-Chang Lin; Min-Shiang Hwang; Chin-Chen Chang,In a traditional key assignment scheme; an access control policy is used to solve the accesscontrol problem in a hierarchy. A higher security class can access lower security classes; butthe opposite is not allowed. However; in some cases; this can be troublesome because ofthe lack of flexibility.

Analysis of GDNFmRNA expression after firearm wound of spinal cord in rats,Haitao SONG; Lianshun JIA; ZHeyu CHEN,Objective To investigate the gene expression of Glial cell line-derived heurotrophic factor(GDNF) mRNA on T12~ L1 spinal cord after firearm wound of spinal cord (SCI) in rats.Methods The specimen of T12~ L1 spinal cord was taken respectively before and after SCI.The level of GDNF mRNA on spinal cord was observed and compared before and after SCI;using semi-quantitative RT-PCR method with β-actin as a inner consult. Results Minimexpression of GDNF mRNA was found on spinal cord before SCI; but it decreased 25%;71%; 82%; 86% on 1st d; 4th d; 7th d and 10th d respectively. Conclusion The reduction ofGDNF mRNA level on homologous segmental spinal cord would be caused by losing thesupport of GDNF mRNA from the target tissue through sciatic nerve; thus providing one oftheory foundations for foreign GDNF to be used in treating SCI.,*,2003,*,12

Martian Hydrogen Exosphere Charging Exchange with Solar Wind,Y Chen; PA Cloutier,Abstract Charge exchange of solar wind with Martian exosphere has been proved to play acrucial role in the formation of Magnetic pileup boundary (MPB) observed by MGS [Chen etal.; 2001]. However the question of how the Martian exosphere structure is altered by chargeexchange of solar wind quantitatively still stays open. Currently a 3-dimensional MonteCarlo collisional exosphere model is developed to answer this question. In this model effectsof planetary rotation; photoionization; Ly-scattering and charge exchange with solar windare included. Although the change of exospheric density profile is indistinctive; simulationresults show the existence of the hot atomic hydrogen population produce by chargeexchange does change the exospheric temperature structure greatly and the symmetry ofthe exospheric structure is destroyed totally at high altitude.

The yield of Λ and Λ hyperons is found to be approximatelyproportional to the number of negative hadrons. The production of Λ hyperons relative tonegative hadrons increases very rapidly with transverse momentum. The magnitude of theincrease cannot be described by existing hadronic string fragmentation models.,*,2002,*,12
Ab-Initio Calculation of the Si-L2; 3 and K Edge of AN Inactive Defect Model of Si,Yu Chen; Shang-Di Mo; WY Ching,Abstract We have applied a recently developed first-principle suppercell method thatincludes the core-hole electron interaction [1] to calculate the XANES/ELNES spectra of andefect model of Si which contains 90 Si atoms with odd-membered atomic rings [2]. Thedefect model is electronically and optically inactive. The calculated atom-by-atom ELNES ofK-edge and L-edge shows spectral differences; which is correlated with the odd-memberedrings and bond-length-and-bond-angle variation in the model. The results are consistentwith high-resolution transmission energy-loss spectroscopy measurements. Our calculationdemonstrates that the developed suppercell method with core-hole correction is effective tostudy the structures and compositions of grain boundaries and interfaces.

Cryptanalysis of the WD public-key cryptosystem,Hui-Feng Huang; Chin-Chen Chang,The theory of generalized inverses of matrices over finite fields has been used incryptographic applications in recent years. Wu and Dawson (1998) proposed a public-keycryptosystem based on generalized inverses of matrices. In 2001; Sun proposed a schemefor cryptanalysing Wu and Dawson's public-key cryptosystem. However; his method is timeintensive because message recovery requires the pre-computation of many plaintext andciphertext pairs (m/sub i/; c/sub i/). This paper shows how anyone knowing only the publickey and a ciphertext can easily retrieve the corresponding message by solving the linearequation system. Thus; it proves that the proposed cryptanalysis method is very efficient forbreaking Wu and Dawson's public-key cryptosystem.,Cyber Worlds; 2002. Proceedings.

Seismic Analyses of Viscously-Damped Structures With an Unbounded Foundation,CS Tsai; TC Chiang; BJ Chen; CK Cheng,abstract The method of supplemental damping for dissipating seismic energy has beenrecognized as an effective and attractive way to reduce the seismic response of structuresunder seismic loadings. In recent years; an extensive number of structural control deviceshave been proposed to mitigate the vibration response of structures subjected to wind loadand earthquake excitations. However; rare publications regarding the interactions betweenthe soil and seismically damped structure have been unfolded. In order to ensure the safetyof structures equipped with viscous fluid damper devices under seismic loadings; it isrequired to take into account the effects of radiation damping and the flexibility resulting fromthe unbounded soil media. In this study; two numerical methods; the consistent-infinitesimalfinite element cell method and the quiet boundary method; have been proposed to …,ASME 2002 Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference,2002,*,12

Concurrency Control of Soft-Real-Time and Non-Real-Time Transactions,Kam-Yiu Lam; Tei-Wei Kuo; Ben Kao; Tony SH Lee; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Current research in real-time concurrency control mainly focuses on theschedulability guarantee of hard real-time transactions and reducing the miss rate of softreal-time transactions. Although many new database applications with significant responsetime requirements; such as stock trading systems and traffic navigation systems; areemerging; little work has been done in the joint scheduling of traditional non-real-timetransactions and soft real-time transactions. There are also very limited results developed insupporting concurrency control for soft real-time transactions in traditional non-real-timeenvironments. In this paper; we study the performance of different real-time concurrencycontrol protocols for mixed soft real-time database systems (MSRTDBS); on which both non-real-time and soft real-time transactions execute.

Bi-level Lossless Calligraphy Compression Using Location Propagation and Width Inheritance,Chin-Chen Chang; Guu-In Chen,To digitize a calligraphic piece into a bi-level image has been shown to be appropriate. Forpreserving aesthetic features; lossless or near lossless compression is preferred. In thispaper; we propose a lossless compression method for bi-level calligraphic images. Eachsegment consisting of continuous pixels with foreground color is abbreviated into arepresentative pixel; and the number of the pruned pixels is recorded. The locationinformation and width information are then decomposed. To decrease redundancies; thelocation propagation approach and width inheritance approach are applied separately. Theproposed method has been compared with some lossless compression methods; such asWinZip; run-length; New S-tree; lossless pattern matching (LPM); and JBIG2.

The Implications of Unusual High Helium Isotopic Ratios in Non-Volcanic Area of Western Taiwan,TF Yang; Y Sano; Y Chen; C Kuo,Abstract Representative gas samples of fumaroles; springs; mud volcanoes; natural gaseswere collected from Taiwan for helium isotopes measurement. Samples from northern andeastern Taiwan exhibit higher 3He/4He ratios; which indicates significant mantle-derivedsignature. The result is not unexpected; since hydrothermal activity is still active at thoseareas. Nevertheless; some unusual high 3He/4He ratios are obtained from non-volcanicarea in western Taiwan. Carbon isotopes of CO2 and CO2/3He ratios in those samples aresimilar with those from mid-ocean ridge basalts; which believed to be derived from uppermantle. Hence; we are able to conclude that they are mantle-derived. Furthermore; wepropose that they are not in-situ mantle-derived volatiles.

Animations of Martian Field Line Configuration and Implications for Particle Deposition and Escape,DA Brain; DH Crider; F Bagenal; M Acuna; J Connerney; Y Chen; P Cloutier,Abstract The configuration of magnetic field lines near Mars is influenced by the crust andthe solar wind; and is an important component in our understanding of charged particlemotion and the shape of the Martian obstacle to the solar wind. We have created a model formagnetic topology at Mars that is simple to use and compares well to Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) magnetometer (MAG) data. This model is a linear superposition of previously existingmagnetic field models for the solar wind and the Martian crust. Multiple crustal models (egPurucker et al.; 2000) and solar wind models (eg Spreiter and Stahara;) were evaluatedindividually to determine where they best describe MGS observations. The resultingsuperposition model can be used to estimate the Martian magnetic field configuration as afunction of solar wind field strength and orientation; and planetary position.

The economy isbooming and the company has more orders than it has production capacity or raw materia]inventory to produce. However the company has considerable flexibility in how it producesspecialty steels. At the beginning of each time period planners assign a routing and a rawmaterial to each order in a list of orders to be completed. the objective is to maximize theorders that can be completed given constraints on workcenter capacity and raw materialinventory. Each order can follow more than one routing. Associated with each routing is arange of raw materials; any one of which can be used to produce the order. the problem canbe formulated as an integer linear programming problem.

A Compressed and Dynamic-range-based Expression of Timestamp and Period for Timestamp-based Schedulers,Dong Wei; Nirwan Ansari; Jianguo Chen,Scheduling algorithms are implemented in high-speed switches to provision quality-of-service guarantees in both cell-based and packet-based networks. Being able to guaranteeend-to-end delay and fairness; timestamp-based fair queuing algorithms have receivedmuch attention in the past few years. In timestamp-based fair queuing algorithms; the size oftimestamp and period determines the supportable rates in terms of the range and accuracy.Furthermore; it also determines the scheduler's memory in terms of access bandwidth andstorage space. An efficient expression can reduce the size of the timestamp and periodwithout compromising the supportable rate range and the accuracy.

Erbium-induced reconstructions on silicon (100) substrate,GR Chen; DW Gong; Jianhua Liu; Yu Fu; Zhong Huang; Ling Ye,Ultra-thin erbium layers are formed on Si (100) substrate by depositing 0.5 approximately 3ML Er atoms in an ultra-high vacuum system. The films deposited at room temperature are inthe amorphous form. After annealing at low temperatures; ordered structures form on thesurface. The surface reconstruction is studied by in situ reflection high energy electrondiffraction (RHEED). The transition of the RHEED patterns from (2X1) to (4X2) is observedwith the increase of Er coverage up to 1 monolayers after low temperature annealing.Several cluster models are adopted for simulating Er adatoms located at different sites on Si(100) substrate to determine the favorable surface geometry. The first principle discretevariational cluster method based on ab initio local density approximation is used to calculatethe total energies of different surface configurations.,Fourth International Conference on Thin Film Physics and Applications,2000,*,5

Mass Spectrometry of Active Species Convected from an Atmospheric Air Plasma in a Remote Exposure Reactor,DM Sheman; F Karakaya; Z Chen; JR Roth,Abstract The Remote Exposure Reactor (RER)[1] utilizes multiple panels covered with asurface layer of One Atmosphere Uniform Glow Discharge Plasma (OAUGDP) to generateactive species from air. These active species are capable of sterilizing the surfaces andincreasing the surface energy of materials [1]. Our investigations have shown that theenergizing voltage; the RF frequency; the RF power input; the number of panels generatingthe surface layers of the OAUGDP; and the distance active species are convected from theplasma panels to the workpiece all affect the killing times of microorganisms and otherplasma processing effects. The relative concentration of active species will be determined bymass spectrometry and reported as a function of the above plasma parameters and thedistance from the last plasma generating panel. Such information will be correlated with …,APS Meeting Abstracts,1999,*,19

It was found that the three timesimmunization by intramuscular route as well as with higher doses (100mug per mouse)could induce strong antibody responses in mice. When mice were pre-treated with procaineand then injected with pCD-HCV_ (1) intramuscularly or subcutaneously; the antibody levelswere rather higher than those directly injected with the same doses of pCD-HCV_ (1). Theseresults might provide a reference data for seek for the optimal methods for the developmentof HCV gene vaccine.,Shanghai mian yi xue za zhi,1999,*,18
Under Random Loading,Ouk Sub Lee; Zhi—wei Chen,The load interaction effect in variable am~ plitude fatigue test is a very important issue forcorrectly predicting fatigue life (Kim et al; 1996; Lee; 1998; Lee et al; 1998). The interactioneffect includes both overload retardation and under—Ioad acceleration phenomena.Explanations of retardation phenomenon were partly given on the concepts of crack tipplastic zone (Wheeler; 1972); residual stresses (Chang et al; 1981; He; 1981) in the plasticzone; and the crack closure (Elber; 1970); but a fully understanding of load interaction effect.still needs much research efforts. Some prediction methods that can simulate the retardationeffect were proposed in literatures (Chang et al; 1981; Elber; 1970; He; 1981; Wheeler;1972). We are examining some ofthem,KSME International Journal,1999,*,3

A model was established based on the experimental datafrom the two group tests by the software of multivariable step by step regression of all thequadratic terms. Using the model; the simulated tests were conducted by computer. Theresults of simulated tests showed that the propylene concentration was increased from 45%to 55%; and the nonene selectivity was increased by 0.3%-0.4%; if pressure was raised from2.5 to 3.5 Mpa; the nonene selectivity was increased by 0.3%-0.5%. On the other hand;when space velocity was raised from 2 to 6 h-1; benzene to propylene ratio from 1 to 4.5 …,PETROLEUM PROCESSING AND PETROCHEMICALS,1999,*,12
Studies on dual mycorrhizas of Eucalyptus globulus and E. urophylla II. Inoculant efficacy on the growth,Y Chen; M Gong; M Brundrett; B Dell,The second part of the results based on a glasshouse experiment. The inoculanteffectiveness of 4 VA mycorrhizal fungi and 1 ectomycorrhizal fungus alone or incombination on the growth of Eucalyptus globulus and E. urophylla saplings was reported.There were substantial differences on the growth among treatments (P< 0.005). Largeresponses of height growth and biomass stimulated by fungal inoculation were observed forboth plants during 16-week growing in a sterilized Karrakatta yellow sand. Average heightsof inoculated E. globulus and E. urophylla seedlings were respectively increased by up to28.86%(Laccaria+ Scutellospora; LS) and 86.65%(Laccaria+ Glomus; LG); compared tothose of uninoculated ones at 16 weeks after inoculation. Dry weights of sapling were up to129.93%(tops) and 119.93%(roots) for E. globulus; 133.34%(tops) and 174.83%(roots) …,Forest Research,1999,*,5
Studies on dual mycorrhizas of Eucalyptus globulus and E. urophylla. Ⅰ. Fungal colonization and interactions,Chen Yinglong; Gong Mingqin; M Brundrett; B Dell,Abstract This paper represents the first part of the results from a glasshouse experimentdesigned to compare the competition of ECM and VAM fungi on root colonization and effectson growth of two Eucalyptus species (E. globulus and E. urophylla). One ECM fungus(Laccaria lateritia) and three VAM fungi belonging to genera Glomus; Acaulospora andScutellospora; along with field soil as well; were used to inoculate Eucalyptus seedlingsalone or in combination. Both ECM and VAM fungi colonized and formed mycorrhizalassociations on roots of inoculated seedlings; though infective rates of VAM and ECM tipsper meter varied according to inoculant fungi and plant ages. There were some regressiveinteractions for colonization between the two fungi; as a general trend for ECM rootcolonization levels to increase with time at the expense of VAM colonization was …,Forest Research,1999,*,12
EFFECT OF NUTRITIONAL RESTRICTION ON BLOOD T_3; T_4; IgG AND SUN OF UJIMQIN GROWING RAMS,Chang-jin AO; Zhi-gong ZHAO; Xian-zhi HOU; Zhi-wei CHEN,Thirty-three 6-month-old Ujimqin growing rams with 29.85±1.74 kg BW were used to studiedthe effect of restriction of energy; protein; restriction starting time and duration on blood T3;T4 IgG and SUN of Ujimqin growing rams in cold season in the typical grassland of northernChina by orthogonal design (L9 (34)). The result indicated that the concentration of T3 andIgG were influnced by the experimental periods; temperture and intake of ME and DCP. SUNand T4 have homestasis and were not influenced by those factors. T3; T4; IgG; SUN and ME;DCP could reflect the restriction status of Ujimqin growing rams.,ACTA ZOONUTRIMENTA SINICA,1999,*,12

QCD Correction to sigma (e^+ e^---> ZH--> Zb\bar b),Chaohsi Chang; Xueqian Li; Wengan Ma; Wusheng Dai,Abstract We study the QCD corrections to the calculated values of sigma (e^+ e^---> ZH-->ZB\bar b); and find that for MH> 100 GeV; the process can be measured at the LEP energy toextract information of Higgs and the QCD corrections are negligible; namely the tree-levelcalculation is sufficiently accurate for the energy range; while for MH> 100 GeV; the Higgs-involved subprocess can only be investigated at NLC; and then the QCD correctionbecomes as large as 45%. For MH> 2m_t; considering the subprocess e^+ e^---> ZH-->Zt\bar t; the QCD corrections are also important and must be taken into account for the crosssection evaluation.,Communications in theoretical physics,1998,*,18

The Research to Decrease the “Start-Stop” Frequency of the Air Compressor in DF11 Quasi High Speed Passenger Train,X Qian; X Chen; X Zhao,ABSTRACT This paper analyses the alternately compressed air supplying of the mainreservoir with an air source or not in the DF11 quasi-high speed locomotive. While thelocomotive's running; the main reservoir works in two different states (compressor is workingor stopped) to output compressed air. According to the equations of energy; mass and state;it deduces the instantaneous pressure changing ratio of the main reservoir. Through thelinear procession; it obtains the simplified equations of the" start-stop" cycle T and thefrequency fofthe locomotive's air compressor. Based on the equations just mentioned; thepaper analyses the influential factors on f and points out ways to decrease the value.,*,1998,*,21

RESULTS: LA decreased significantly the heart rates and increased markedly thePR intervals at iv dose of 2 54±0 06 mg· kg-1. Up to 4 12-8 19 mg· kg-1; LA causedventricular premature beats (VP); ventricular tachycardia (VT); ventricular fibrillation (VF) andcardiac arrest (CA); respectively. LA (0 5 mg· kg-1; ip) prevented the arrhythmias induced byaconitine and BaCl 2 in rats and increased significantly the doses of ouabain to inducearrhythmias in guinea pigs. CONCLUSIONS: A low dose of LA can prevent the arrhythmias;whereas the high dose of LA can induce the arrhythmia and their relationship seems to bethe therapeutic action and the toxic reaction in heart of some anti arrhythmic drugs.,CHINESE PHARMACOLOGICAL BULLETIN,1997,*,5

Response analysis of systems under narrow band stationary and nonstationary random excitations,CWS To; Z Chen,The stochastic central difference (SCD) method was first introduced in 1984 by the firstauthor. Over the last decade various similar direct integration methods for random responseof multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems have also been proposed by the first author andhis associates. These direct integration schemes have been developed for the computation ofresponses of nonlinear MDOF systems under wide band stationary and nonstationary randomexcitations. This paper reports the results of an investigation the main aim of which is to extendthe SCD method and its various efficient and accurate derivatives to problems involving withnarrow band stationary and nonstationary random excitations. Results of two typical simple systemsobtained by the method proposed here are compared with those determined by the Monte Carlosimulation (MCS) technique. They indicate that the method is very efficient and accurate …,*,1996,*,12
The principle of nasal defects repair based on the frontal and temporal vessels anatomy,F Fan; Z Chen; N Wu; M Chen,Abstract After dissection of 9 corpes'(18 sides) vessels of the forehead; nose and temporal;we have discovered that the superatrochlear arteries run upward bilaterally; the branches ofthe supertrochelear arteries; the superficial branches of the supraorbital arteries and thefront branches of the superficial temporal form a network--the frontal artery anastomotic net.The main trank and the parital branches of the superficial temporal arteries give off 2-3 earbranches. Based on these findings; we have made a series of explor atire researches;designed several new kinds of skin flaps for repairing the nasal defects; and improved anumber traditional skin flaps. Guided by the above mentioned principles; we havesuccessfully reconstructed 32 different kinds of nasal defects and achieved good results.,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

Determination of the oxygen to metal atom ratio for sintered Gd 2 O 3-UO 2 pellets by spectrophotometry,Xiaohui Mei; Chongpei Zhou; Xunyin Wang; Shuming Zhu; Rong Cheng,A new method; spectrophotometry; to determine the oxygen to metal atom ratio (O/M) ofsintered Gd 2 O 3-UO 2 pellets has been introduced. Concentrated phosphoric acid is usedfor the preparation of tested solutions as a solvent. The specific wave lengths of U 6+ and U4+ ions are selected at 310 nm and 544 nm respectively with the absorbencies at theirspecific wavelengths; the U 6+ and U 4+ can be obtained by comparing with their standardcurves respectively. The O/M ratio will be calculated by means of the formula drawn fromelectrical neutrality theory. The Gd 2 O 3 content and micro-heterogeneity in sintered Gd 2 O3-UO 2 pellets have no obvious influence on the method. It is considered as a fairly idealmethod of determination of the O/M ratio of sintered Gd 2 O 3-UO 2 pellets. The standarddeviation is not more than+-0.003,Nuclear Power Engineering,1996,*,12
Observations of blood circulation disturbance in random skin flap,F Fan; Z Chen,Abstract Thirty-nine rats were used to study the mechanism of random flap necrosis. Arandom flap (3 cm x 9 cm) created on the back of each rat was observed with naked eye;microscope; skin thermometer and laser Doppler flowmeter. The average surviving length ofthe flap was 4.69+/-0.47 cm. We found that the following observations indicated circulationdisturbance in the" shock flap": After surgery; the color of the flap became dark; skintemperature kept falling; when the room temperature was about 20 degrees C; the flaptemperature was below 28.5-29.0 degrees C; at one hour postoperation; LDF valuedecreased more than 50%; microcirculation of the flap stagnated without recovery. Weconclude that necrosis of the flap can be fully predicted.,Zhonghua zheng xing shao shang wai ke za zhi= Zhonghua zheng xing shao shang waikf [ie waike] zazhi= Chinese journal of plastic surgery and burns,1995,*,5

Nonlinearity and disorder in the statistical mechanics of integrable systems,RK Bullough; J Timonen; Yu-zhong Chen,Abstract Attention is drawn to a theory of the statistical mechanics (SM) of the integrablemodels in 1+ 1 dimension—a theory of 'soliton statistical mechanics' classical and quantum[1–17]. This SM provides a generic example of integrable nonlinearity interacting withdisorder. In the generic classical examples; such as the classical SM of the sine-Gordonmodel; phonons provide disorder in which sit coherent structures—the kink-like solitons. Butthese solitons are dressed by the disorder; in equilibrium; while the breather-like solitonsbreak up to form the disordered structures which are the phonons in thermal equilibrium. Onthe other hand quantum solitons; dressed by both the vacuum and finite temperature effects;are nevertheless coherent ordered structures. In particular; the quantum breathers have adegree of freedom; and a consequent internal structure; which is localised in k-space …,*,1992,*,6

An improved energy flow model of gas-liquid mixture through orifice and its application to two parametric mass flow rate measurement,W Cao; Z Chen; Z Zhao; Y Xu,As the irreversible loss in gas-liquid two-phase flow can be described exactly by energyequation; the authors put forward a new method in calculating void fraction based on energymodel proposed by Lorenzi. This improved energy flow model has been used to treat theexperimental data. Three orifices whose area ratios M were different were used respectivelyto combine with an oval gear flowmeter in the test. Experimental results indicated that; whenthe improved energy flow model was used to treat the experimental data; neither the effect ofarea ratio of orifice nor the effect of range of quality had to be considered. In the range of thistest (0.00111< x< 0.745) for the single parametric measurement; the root mean squarefractional deviation of weight flow rate of mixture was 4.58%.

In this communication; 45 cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis and 21 cases ofhealthy tuberculin reactors were studied with regard to the changes of surface markers oflymphocytes and the expression of Fc and complement receptors on phagocytes after invitro incubation with PPD. After PPD stimulation; the monocytes with Fc and complementreceptors tended to increase in tuberculin-positive but not in tuberculin-negative patients orhealthy tuberculin reactors; and the active T lymphocytes were markedly increased innormal individuals but not in patients. Thus; the failure of lymphocytes from patients torespond to in vitro PPD activation with increased active T lymphocytes may account for …,Zhonghua Minguo wei sheng wu ji mian yi xue za zhi= Chinese journal of microbiology and immunology,1980,*,12
Humoral and cell-mediated immunities in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (author's transl),RF Cheng; KH Hsieh; CH Chang; HW Luan; TC Lee,Abstract Humoral and cell-mediated immunities were studied in 38 patients with pulmonarytuberculosis proved by sputum smears and/or cultures and chest X-rays. Nineteen healthyadults were included as control. The results showed that while the mean numbers of totalwhite blood cell count; polymorphonuclear leukocytes; monocytes; B-lymphocytes andserum IgG concentration were significantly increased in patients; there was no difference inthe mean numbers of lymphocytes; total T-lymphocytes; active T-lymphocytes;polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocyteswith Fc and complementreceptor and serumIgA and IgM concentrations between these two groups. These data indicate that the patientswith pulmonary tuberculosis are able to respond to infections with Mycobacteriumtuberculosis; but subtle functional derangement of lymphocytes of patients still can not be …,Zhonghua Minguo wei sheng wu ji mian yi xue za zhi= Chinese journal of microbiology and immunology,1980,*,6

Determination of lysine in wheats by extraction; dinitrophenylation and thin-layer chromatography,Jack Chung-Hsin Chen,Lysine is one of the essential amino acids for man and non-ruminant animals; and is knownto be the most limiting amino acid in the protein of wheat. It is generally accepted that lysinein wheat flour can become nutritionally unavailable during storage. If the relative humidity ishigh (701); or the moisture content of the sample exceeds certain limits; the Maillard reactionmay take place at temperatures as low as 30-hOG.(2). That reaction results in the formationof enzyme—resisting linkages between free a-amino group of lysine and the reducing groupof carbohydrate. The digestive process of animals can not split such a linkage; however; thelinkage may be quite labile to acid hydrolysis of the protein during amino acid analysis.Therefore; amino acid analysis give no information on the availability of lysine (3).,*,1971,*,12
Vibrational relaxation of hydrogen chloride,H Chen; C Moore,A kinetic model has been developed for this laser system which calculates the intensityprofile of the laser pulse as a function of time. The input data for the model include estimatesof the reaction rate into the specific vibrational levels of HC1 and cross sections forcollisional deactivation by the different chemical species in the laser medium. Thetheoretical model also requires as input data the photolysis flash intensity profile; the cavitygeometry; and the losses. A discussion of the model is given and a comparison is madebetween experiment and theory. The model is able to predict quantitative variations of thelaser pulse characteristics as a function of flash intensity; cavity losses; and reagent partialpressures. The quantitative calculations are in reasonable agreement with experiment. It isconcluded that 1) the most important single contribution to deactivation in the system is,IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics,1970,*,10

Variable Rate Data Hiding by Simple LSB Substitution and Quadtree Segmentation,Chi-Nan Lin; Chin-Chen Chang; Yung-Kuan Chan,Abstract—Data hiding using a simple LSB substitution approach can easily achieve highhiding capacity. The traditional simple LSB substitution data hiding schemes; and; laterenhanced by optimal pixel adjustment process (OPAP) hide fixed amount of data in everypixel of the host image. However; these schemes do not consider the natural characteristicsof the host image. This paper proposes a new way to hide different amount of data bits inevery pixel of the host image. The quadtree segmentation technique will be used to dividethe host image into different areas. Some areas are considered smooth areas and theothers; are complicated areas. More data can be hidden in the complicated areas and lessdata in the smooth areas. Experimental results showed that the proposed data hidingmethod results in visually undistorted stego-images with high PSNRs. Also; the smooth …,*,*,*,12

MSCE 2013 Organizing Committee,Chinchen Chang; Jin Yun; Dehuai Zeng; Xiaoming Liu; Xiaoxiao Yu; Chi Zhang; Bo Zhang; Lei Zhang,Abstract: Two new anthracene derivatives were synthesized as emitter for low power triplet-tripletannihilation upconversion. Compared with anthracene; the emitter exhibits high quantum yieldsup to 85%. Pd (II) tetraphenylporphyrin which was selected as the sensitizer with the existenceof BBA in DMF; We find a pretty high efficiency (Φuc=21.9%) of the upconversion fluorescenceat 532nm with a low excitation power density of 0.5w/cm2.With the comparison ofAnthracene; BBA and BTPA systems; quantum yield of the emitter is very important to the improvingof the efficiency of upconversion.,*,*,*,10

A Bi-Chromosome GA for Minimizing Total Intercell and Intracell Moves,CH Cheng; WH Lee; J Miltenburg,In the ideal case; cell design produces perfectly independent machine cells. That is; alloperations of parts in a part family are completed within a single machine cell. However; theideal case is rarely realized in practice. Very often; some of the parts in a part family have tomove between machine cells to use machines in different cells. Consequently; the degree ofmachine cell independence is reduced by intercell moves.,*,*,*,12
Greetings from the General Chairs,Chin-Chen Chang; Robert H Deng,Intelligent Information Processing is studying on fundamental theory and advancedtechnology of intelligence and knowledge for information processing. Artificial intelligencetechniques can be useful tools in this context. Intelligent systems can be applied tosearching the Internet and data-mining; interpreting Internet-derived material; the humanWeb interface; remote condition monitoring and many other areas.

Comet: A Crowdsourcing Multi-Label Task System,Reynold Cheng; Guoliang Li Yudian Zheng; Huiqi Hu,Abstract—Crowdsourcing platforms; such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT); can harnessthe power of human effort to solve problems that are difficult for computers (eg; sentimentanalysis and image labeling). A fundamental crowdsourcing task is labeling; where a humanworker is asked to answer the task; by selecting the correct label (s) among multiple givenchoices. For this kind of tasks; previous works often assume that a worker can only select asingle label. However; this is inadequate in many important applications (eg; imagetagging); where multiple labels (eg; items that appear in an image) are acquired from thecrowd. In this paper; we study the multi-label task; where a worker can select more than onelabel. In particular; we investigate the truth inference problem: Given workers' answers to amulti-label task; what are the correct labels of this task? We address this issue by …,*,*,*,10

Inorder to generate different representative human body measurements; we create a set ofvirtual 3D human bodies with a CAD software. These virtual 3D human bodies can be usedto simulate morphology of real body shapes from different angles. Next; for a specificapplication such as sport garments or professional suits; a procedure of sensory evaluationis organized so that a number of selected experts generate a list of relevant normalizedemotional descriptors and then evaluate the virtual human bodies using these descriptors.From the body measurements taken from these virtual human bodies; we extract the mostrelevant geometric features for each normalized emotional descriptor.

Analysis of Aftershock Hazard Using Power Prior Information,YI Chen; CS Huang,Abstract: Near real-time hazard assessment for large aftershocks post to a major earthquakeis usually urgent for disaster relief and rescue efforts. For regions that are short of enoughprevious aftershock sequences for an appropriate empirical prior distribution; we suggest toimplement a Bayesian analysis based on only one or few available previous aftershocksequences and limited current data in a short time after the mainshock. The prior informationin this Bayesian analysis is obtained directly from the likelihood of previous aftershocksequence with a certain power. We illustrate the use of the power prior Bayesian analysis onthe evaluation of the hazards of three aftershock sequences post to the Chi-Chi earthquake(ML= 7.6; 1999/9/21); the 331 event with ML= 6.8 on 2002/3/31 and the 1210 event with ML=6.4 on 2004/12/10.,*,*,*,18

Parametric Discrete Choice Models Based on the Scale Mixtures of Multivariate Normal Distributions (running title: Parametric Discrete Choice Models),ZHEN CHEN,SUMMARY. A rich class of parametric models is proposed for discrete choice data based onthe scale mixtures of multivariate normal distributions. With special connections tomultinomial probit; the new models can be implemented in a Bayesian framework withoutmuch di culty. The proposed class of models can be extended to panel data whereaccounting for heterogeneities is needed. This is done by building a Bayesian hierarchicalmodel within the random utility maximization framework. Model comparison using the Bayesfactor is developed. The new models and the estimation techniques are illustrated usingtravel mode choice and panel brand choice data.,*,*,*,21
A Note on the Estimation of the Multinomial Logit Model with Random E ects,Zhen CHEN; Lynn KUO,Abstract The multinomial logit model with random e ects is often used in modeling correlatednominal polytomous data. Given that there is no standard software of tting it; we advocateusing either a Poisson log-linear model or a Poisson nonlinear model; both with random eects. Their implementations can be carried out easily by many existing commercial statisticalpackages including SAS. A brand choice data set is used to illustrate the proposed methods.,*,*,*,12
A Composite Transition Model for Brand Choice and Purchase Timing Data,Lynn Kuo; Zhen Chen,Abstract A new approach for analyzing duration state data in brand-choice studies isexplored. This approach not only incorporates the correlation among repeated purchases fora subject; it also models the purchase timing and the brand decision jointly. The former isaccomplished by applying transition model approaches from longitudinal studies. The latteris done by conditioning on the brand choice variable. Then mixed multinomial logit modelsand Cox proportional hazards models are employed to model the marginal densities of thebrand choice and the conditional densities of the interpurchase time given the brand choice.We will illustrate our ndings by applying this new method to Nielsen household scannerpanel data.,*,*,*,12

DOCS: A Domain-Aware Crowdsourcing System Using Knowledge Bases (Technical Report),Yudian Zheng; Guoliang Li; Reynold Cheng,ABSTRACT Crowdsourcing is a new computing paradigm that harnesses human effort tosolve computer-hard problems; such as entity resolution and photo tagging. The crowd (orworkers) have diverse qualities and it is important to effectively model a worker's quality.Most of existing worker models assume that workers have the same quality on differenttasks. In practice; however; tasks belong to a variety of diverse domains; and workers havedifferent qualities on different domains. For example; a worker who is a basketball fanshould have better quality for the task of labeling a photo related to 'Stephen Curry'than theone related to 'Leonardo DiCaprio'. In this paper; we study how to leverage domainknowledge to accurately model a worker's quality. We examine using knowledge base (KB);eg; Wikipedia and Freebase; to detect the domains of tasks and workers. We develop …,*,*,*,12

Robust Fixed Rank Prediction for Large Spatio-Temporal Data Sets,Feng Chen; Yang Chen; Chang-Tien Lu; Yao-Jan Wu,Abstract—Efficient prediction for massive amounts of spatio-temporal data is an emergingchallenge in the data mining field. Fixed rank spatio-temporal prediction (FR-STP) offers apromising dimension-reduced approach for predicting large spatio-temporal data in lineartime; but is not applicable for the nonlinear dynamic environments popular in many realapplications. This deficiency can be systematically addressed by increasing the robustnessof the FR-STP using heavy tailed distributions; such as the Huber; Laplace; and Student's tdistributions. This paper presents a robust fixed rank spatio-temporal prediction (RFR-STP)approach that outperforms the FR-STP in nonlinear environments where the FR-STP'sdistribution assumptions are violated. This general RFR-STP algorithm utilizes theframework of Newton's methods for most popular heavy tailed distributions; and two …,*,*,*,23
Microarchi tecture Fabrication Process of the Artificial Bone,Zhongzhong Chen; Cheng Li; Zhiqiang Jiani; Zhiying Lu03,Abstract: By using bionic modeling and rapid prototyping technology; a novel system basedon air-pressure jet solidification (AJS) technique is developed to fabricate porousmicroarchitecture of the artificial bone. Acting as transitional carrier of the bone-implant; theporous scaffolds formed could provide proper porosity and interconnections for the growth ofbone tissue and nutrient transport. This approach is better than traditional fabricationprocesses; because the latter methods cannot fabricate a microarchitecture with spatialbending micropores so as to satisfy biological requirements.[Life Science Journal. 2006; 3(3): 88-93](ISSN: 1097-8135).,*,*,*,12
The relationship between the earthquake rate change and the gradient of stress change,YI Chen; CS Chen; WH Yang; KF Ma,Abstract: It has been widely discussed that the seismicity rate change before and after amainshock is related to the mainshock induced stress change. To see if it is true for thecomplex fault rupture of the 1999 Chi-Chi; Taiwan; earthquake; we use a universal Krigingmethod to explore how well the depth-dependent coulomb stress change explains theseismicity rate change. We also make such an exploration by correlating the rate changewith the magnitude of the gradient of the stress change. The results demonstrate that thegradient of the stress change is preferred to the stress change itself for describing theseismicity rate change.,*,*,*,12

The measured area of an indoor roomshould be divided into several unit areas. Each unit area can be considered as a simple cellin the 2D cellular model; and then we use a rectangular box to group those neighboringactive cells together to represent a moving object. Since people walk without a fixed styleand the color of objects may be similar with that of the background; the distribution of activecells is uncertain and incomplete. Therefore we apply the gray relational analysis to detectand track multiple moving objects. The experimental results demonstrated that the …,*,*,*,12

Considering the aggregated demand of global market this model focuses on themid-term master operations planning; executes the collaboration of global capacity planningof offshore factories; transportation planning as well as distribution planning. In the solvingprocess; the problem is divided into two phases: The first phase finds a solution for thecollaboration of global distribution centers and markets. Then; the second phase uses theoutcome as its initial solution to determine the collaboration of global production factories aswell as distribution centers. This decision model can be applied to global enterprises thathave already implemented ERP systems.,*,*,*,19
What really happens after ERP is implemented?–A performance analysis study for the ERP post implementation stage.,YW Fan; WH Tsai; PY Hsu; MS Cheng; JD Leu; CJ Wu,Abstract ERP systems offer organizations the potential for much greater competitiveadvantages. Therefore; managers in various industries have invested a lot to implementERP systems. The performance analysis of such large-scale systems; ERP; has become oneof the most important issues for both academic researchers and project managers. Despiteof the importance of performance analysis for the ERP post implementation stage; relativelymore research papers are discussing the selection and introduction of ERP systems.Therefore; this study aims to investigate the performance of ERP systems after it isimplemented successfully in organizations. DeLone and McLean's evaluation model ismodified to assess the overall ERP performance in this study. Then; a questionnaire surveywas conducted during the end of 2002 to April of 2003.

神经生长因子能有效促进树鼩海马神经干细胞的体外增殖,Liu-lin Xiong; Zhi-wei Chen; Ting-hua Wang,Abstract Neural stem cells promote neuronal regeneration and repair of brain tissue afterinjury; but have limited resources and proliferative ability in vivo. We hypothesized that nervegrowth factor would promote in vitro proliferation of neural stem cells derived from the treeshrews; a primate-like mammal that has been proposed as an alternative to primates inbiomedical translational research. We cultured neural stem cells from the hippocampus oftree shrews at embryonic day 38; and added nerve growth factor (100 μg/L) to the culturemedium. Neural stem cells from the hippocampus of tree shrews cultured without nervegrowth factor were used as controls.

INTEGRATED POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION-CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS MICRODEVICE FOR HANWOO ALLELE-SPECIFIC GENOTYPING,JY Choi; SJ Choi; Y Chen; HW Kim; SA You; HK Myeong; TS Seo,ABSTRACT In this study; we developed a polymerase chain reaction-capillaryelectrophoresis (PCR-CE) microdevice to perform the allele-specific (AS) gene amplificationand separation on a single wafer to identify Korean indigenous beef cattle; HANWOO. TheHANWOO allele-specific genotyping system consists of HANWOO-specific five homozygousSNP sites; a sex-typing gene and a house-keeping gene as a control. The amplicons wereproduced in a 260 nL PCR chamber and then subsequently separated in a 6 cm-long CEmicrochannel to generate a DNA fingerprint of HANWOO. This onsite HANWOO genotypingplatform can help the prompt prevention of zoonosis such as bovine spongiformencephalopathy (BSE) and efficient breed protection from imported beef cattle.,*,*,*,12

Trajectory Possible Nearest Neighbor Queries over Imprecise Location Da,Xike Xie; Man Lung Yiu; Reynold Cheng; Hua Lu,Abstract Trajectory queries; which retrieve nearby objects for every point of a given route;can be used to identify alerts of potential threats along a vessel route; or monitor theadjacent rescuers to a travel path. However; the locations of these objects (eg; threats;succours) may not be precisely obtained due to hardware limitations of measuring devices;as well as complex natures of the surroundings. For such data; we consider a commonmodel; where the possible locations of an object are bounded by a closed region; called“imprecise region”. Ignoring or coarsely wrapping imprecision can render low queryqualities; and cause undesirable consequences such as missing alerts of threats and poorresponse rescue time. Also; the query is quite time-consuming; since all points on thetrajectory are considered. In this paper; we study how to efficiently evaluate trajectory …,History,*,*,21

Syngas production from steam and dry reforming of methane over Ni-based catalyst in microchannel reactor: CFD modeling with elementary kinetics,Chenxi Cao; Nian Zhang; Yi Cheng,Abstract The major obstacles in syngas production from methane reforming are coking ofcatalyst and low process efficiency; which could be addressed by microchannel reactortechnology with optimized process design. We built comprehensive CFD models coupledwith microkinetics regarding steam and dry reforming of methane over Ni-based catalyst toguide the reactor design and process optimization. It was found that high space velocity andnear-isothermal operation are crucial for reducing coking risk and increasing processefficiency. Design rules and operating strategies were proposed accordingly.,*,*,*,12
A statistics-based sensor selection scheme for,S Han; E Chan; R Cheng; KY Lam,Abstract An approach to improve the reliability of query results based on error-prone sensorsis to use redundant sensors. However; this approach is expensive; moreover; some sensorsmay malfunction and their readings need to be discarded. In this paper; we propose astatistical approach to decide which sensors to be used to answer a query. In particular; wepropose to solve the problem with the aid of continuous probabilistic query (CPQ); which isoriginally used to manage uncertain data and is associated with a probabilistic guarantee onthe query result. Based on the historical data values from the sensors; the query type; andthe requirement on the query; we present methods to select an appropriate set of sensorsand provide reliable answers for aggregate queries. Our algorithm is demonstrated insimulation experiments to provide accurate and robust query results.,*,*,*,12

On Label-Aware Community Search,Yixiang Fang; Reynold Cheng; Siqiang Luo; Jiafeng Hu,ABSTRACT Recently; the retrieval of a community from large graph databases has captureda lot of attention. Given a vertex q of a graph; the community search operation finds asubgraph; or community; which contains vertices closely related to q. Communities areprevalent in social networks; bibliographical graphs; and knowledge bases; and they enableemerging applications like product advertisement and setting up of social events. Existingcommunity search algorithms; which are based mainly on the relationships (or edges)between vertices; overlook the important information carried by the attributes of vertices. Wefound that communities returned by these algorithms often consist of vertices havingkeywords about a variety of topics; and this makes it difficult to interpret the meanings behindthose communities. In this paper; we investigate how vertex attributes can be used to …,*,*,*,12

Multi-Scale Modeling of Hemodynamic Flows,RK Agarwal; GR Behrens; AS Anayiotos; CH Cheng; Y Ito; J Gray,Abstract The physics and mathematics involved in modeling of components ofcardiovascular system is very different from that in many other engineering problems. Forexample; the blood flows in vessels with a deformable boundary (the viscoelastic walls ofthe vessel) that may require modeling of fluid and tissue interaction and for smaller arteries;the non-Newtonian nature of the blood requires special constitutive models. To make theproblem computationally manageable; minor arteries such as arterioles; venules andcapillaries need to be truncated; which require equivalent outflow boundary conditions attruncated positions. Although the blood flow simulations in deforming large vessels (such ascoronary; carotid; femoral or iliac arteries) require the solution of 3-D Navier-Stokesequations; the truncated part of the cardiovascular system can be modeled by lumped …,Multi-Scale Modeling of Hemodynamic Flows RK Agarwaland GR Behrens………………………………………………………………………………… 1 Tans-scale Coupling in Multi-scale Simulation Yilong Bai; Haiying Wang; Feng Rong; Mengfen Xia and Fujiu Ke…………………………………………… 2 Spectral Analysis and Multiscale Modeling in Cellular Solids,*,*,21

Report No.: TR-99-01 Title: LGen-A Lattice-Based Candidate Set Generation Algorithm for I/O Efficient Association Rule Mining,Chi-Lap Yip; KK Loo; Ben Kao; David Cheung; CK Cheng,Abstract: Most algorithms for association rule mining are variants of the basic Apriorialgorithm. One characteristic of these Apriori-based algorithms is that candidate itemsets aregenerated in rounds; with the size of the itemsets incremented by one per round. Thenumber of database scans required by Apriori-based algorithms thus depends on the size ofthe largest large itemsets. In this paper we devise a more general candidate set generationalgorithm; LGen; which generates candidate itemsets of multiple sizes during each databasescan. We show that; given a reasonable set of suggested large itemsets; LGen cansignificantly reduce the number of I/O passes required. In the best cases; only two passesare sufficient to discover all the large itemsets irrespective of the size of the largest ones.Keywords: Data mining; association rules; lattice; Apriori; LGen,*,*,*,18

Change Tolerant Indexing for Constantly Evolving Data Technical Report CSD TR# 04-006,Reynold Cheng; Yuni Xia; Sunil Prabhakar Rahul Shah,Abstract Index structures are designed to optimize search performance; while at the sametime supporting efficient data updates. Although not explicit; existing index structures aretypically based upon the assumption that the rate of updates will be small compared to therate of querying. This assumption is not valid in streaming data environments such as sensorand moving object databases; where updates are received incessantly. In fact; for manyapplications; the rate of updates may well exceed the rate of querying.

Integrated Methods for Concurrency Control in Mixed Soft Real-Time Databases,Tony SH Lee; Kam-yiu Lam; Tei-Wei Kuo; Ben CM Kao; Reynold Cheng,Abstract In this paper; we propose integrated methods for concurrency control in mixed softreal-time database systems (MSRTDBS); which consist of both non-real-time and soft real-time transactions. The protocols should support the real-time processing of soft real-timetransactions and; at the same time; to minimize the mean response time of non-real-timetransactions. Our proposed protocols are mainly based on the two-phase locking (2PL) andoptimistic concurrency control (OCC) methods because the characteristics of the 2PL andOCC methods are well-known and can help in identifying issues in the joint scheduling ofnon-real-time and soft real-time transactions.,*,*,*,3

Department of Computer Science; Purdue University. Email: ckcheng@ cs. purdue. edu,Reynold Cheng,Abstract Due to the rapid development of positioning technologies such as GPS; cell-phonesand RF-IDs; location-based applications have been increasingly popular in these few years.While these applications promise to bring convenience (eg; m-commerce) and safety (eg;locating victims in emergency); they also raise the concern of location privacy. In particular;since our locations can be tracked at any time in any place; our private information such aswhere we have been at what time can be revealed without our consent. In this survey; westudy location-privacy related problems in a pervasive computing environment. Weinvestigate how legislations define and protect location privacy. We further discuss howprivacy laws are enforced through privacy policies. We also address the issue of howlocation information can be “unlinked” from a person's identity through the use of …,*,*,*,12
