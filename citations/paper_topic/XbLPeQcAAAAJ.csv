Identifying meaningful return information for XML keyword search,Ziyang Liu; Yi Chen,Abstract Keyword search enables web users to easily access XML data without the need tolearn a structured query language and to study possibly complex data schemas. Existingwork has addressed the problem of selecting qualified data nodes that match keywords andconnecting them in a meaningful way; in the spirit of inferring a where clause in XQuery.However; how to infer the return clause for keyword search is an open problem. To addressthis challenge; we present an XML keyword search engine; XSeek; to infer the semantics ofthe search and identify return nodes effectively. XSeek recognizes possible entities andattributes inherently represented in the data. It also distinguishes between search predicatesand return specifications in the keywords. Then based on the analysis of both XML datastructures and keyword match patterns; XSeek generates return nodes.

Reasoning and identifying relevant matches for xml keyword search,Ziyang Liu; Yi Chen,Abstract Keyword search is a user-friendly mechanism for retrieving XML data in web andscientific applications. An intuitively compelling but vaguely defined goal is to identifymatches to query keywords that are relevant to the user. However; it is hard to directlyevaluate the relevance of query results due to the inherent ambiguity of search semantics. Inthis work; we investigate an axiomatic framework that includes two intuitive and non-trivialproperties that an XML keyword search technique should ideally satisfy: monotonicity andconsistency; with respect to data and query. This is the first work that reasons about keywordsearch strategies from a formal perspective. Then we propose a novel semantics foridentifying relevant matches; which; to the best of our knowledge; is the only existingalgorithm that satisfies both properties. An efficient algorithm is designed for realizing this …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,186,15

An efficient XPath query processor for XML streams,Yi Chen; Susan B Davidson; Yifeng Zheng,Streaming XPath evaluation algorithms must record a potentially exponential number ofpattern matches when both predicates and descendant axes are present in queries; and theXML data is recursive. In this paper; we use a compact data structure to encode thesepattern matches rather than storing them explicitly. We then propose a polynomial timestreaming algorithm to evaluate XPath queries by probing the data structure in a lazyfashion. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only has a good theoreticalcomplexity bound but is also efficient in practice.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Query biased snippet generation in XML search,Yu Huang; Ziyang Liu; Yi Chen,Abstract Snippets are used by almost every text search engine to complement rankingscheme in order to effectively handle user searches; which are inherently ambiguous andwhose relevance semantics are difficult to assess. Despite the fact that XML is a standardrepresentation format of web data; research on generating result snippets for XML searchremains untouched. In this paper we present a system; eXtract; which addresses thisimportant yet open problem. We identify that a good XML result snippet should be a self-contained meaningful information unit of a small size that effectively summarizes this queryresult and differentiates it from others; according to which users can quickly assess therelevance of the query result. We have designed and implemented a novel algorithm tosatisfy these requirements and verified its efficiency and effectiveness through …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,125,10
Blas: An efficient xpath processing system,Yi Chen; Susan B Davidson; Yifeng Zheng,Abstract We present BLAS; a Bi-LAbeling based System; for efficiently processing complexXPath queries over XML data. BLAS uses P-labeling to process queries involvingconsecutive child axes; and D-labeling to process queries involving descendant axestraversal. The XML data is stored in labeled form; and indexed to optimize descendent axistraversals. Three algorithms are presented for translating complex XPath queries to SQLexpressions; and two alternate query engines are provided. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that the BLAS system has a substantial performance improvement compared totraditional XPath processing using D-labeling.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,94,20
Structured search result differentiation,Ziyang Liu; Peng Sun; Yi Chen,Abstract Studies show that about 50% of web search is for information exploration purpose;where a user would like to investigate; compare; evaluate; and synthesize multiple relevantresults. Due to the absence of general tools that can effectively analyze and differentiatemultiple results; a user has to manually read and comprehend potentially large results in anexploratory search. Such a process is time consuming; labor intensive and error prone. Withmeta information embedded; keyword search on structured data provides the potential forautomating or semi-automating the comparison of multiple results. In this paper we presentan approach for differentiating search results on structured data. We define thedifferentiability of query results and quantify the degree of difference. Then we define theproblem of identifying a limited number of valid features in a result that can maximally …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,93,17
Constraint preserving XML storage in relations,Yi Chen; Susan B Davidson; Yifeng Zheng,Abstract As XML becomes a standard for data representation on the internet; there is agrowing interest in storing XML using relational database technology. To date; none of thesetechniques have considered the semantics of XML as expressed by keys and foreign keys.In this paper; we present a storage mapping which preserves not only the content andstructure of XML data; but also its semantics.,*,2002,79,4
RRXS: Redundancy reducing XML storage in relations,Yi Chen; Susan Davidson; Carmem Hara; Yifeng Zheng,This chapter proposes a novel constraint definition called XML functional dependencies(XFDs) that capture structural as well as semantic information. It presents a set of rewritingrules for XFDs; and use them to design a polynomial time algorithm which; given an input setof XFDs; computes a reduced set of XFDs. Based on this algorithm; it presents a redundancyremoving storage mapping from XML to relations called redundancy reducing XML (RRXS).RRXS produces a relational design that preserves structural and semantic constraints of theXML data while reducing redundancies. The effectiveness of the mapping is demonstratedby experiments on three data sets. The chapter considers the problem of providing amapping from XML to a relational database taking structural as well as a broad class ofsemantic constraints into account. RRXS generates much smaller relational instances …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,77,20
XSeek: a semantic XML search engine using keywords,Ziyang Liu; Jeffrey Walker; Yi Chen,Abstract We present XSeek; a keyword search engine that enables users to easily accessXML data without the need of learning XPath or XQuery and studying possibly complex dataschemas. XSeek addresses a challenge in XML keyword search that has been neglected inthe literature: how to determine the desired return information; analogous to inferring a"return" clause in XQuery. To infer the search semantics; XSeek recognizes possible entitiesand attributes in the data; differentiates search predicates and return specifications in thekeywords; and generates meaningful search results based on the analysis.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,74,0
Efficient ticket routing by resolution sequence mining,Qihong Shao; Yi Chen; Shu Tao; Xifeng Yan; Nikos Anerousis,Abstract IT problem management calls for quick identification of resolvers to reportedproblems. The efficiency of this process highly depends on ticket routing---transferringproblem ticket among various expert groups in search of the right resolver to the ticket. Toachieve efficient ticket routing; wise decision needs to be made at each step of ticket transferto determine which expert group is likely to be; or to lead to the resolver. In this paper; weaddress the possibility of improving ticket routing efficiency by mining ticket resolutionsequences alone; without accessing ticket content. To demonstrate this possibility; a Markovmodel is developed to statistically capture the right decisions that have been made towardproblem resolution; where the order of the Markov model is carefully chosen according tothe conditional entropy obtained from ticket data. We also design a search algorithm …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,73,15
Designing and evaluating an XPath dialect for linguistic queries,Steven Bird; Yi Chen; Susan B Davidson; Haejoong Lee; Yifeng Zheng,Linguistic research and natural language processing employ large repositories of orderedtrees. XML; a standard ordered tree model; and XPath; its associated language; are naturalchoices for linguistic data and queries. However; several important expressive featuresrequired for linguistic queries are missing or hard to express in XPath. In this paper; wemotivate and illustrate these features with a variety of linguistic queries. Then we proposeextensions to XPath to support linguistic queries; and design an efficient query enginebased on a novel labeling scheme. Experiments demonstrate that our language is not onlysufficiently expressive for linguistic trees but also efficient for practical usage.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

XKvalidator: a constraint validator for XML,Yi Chen; Susan B Davidson; Yifeng Zheng,Abstract The role of XML in data exchange is evolving from one of merely conveying thestructure of data to one that also conveys its semantics. In particular; several proposals forkey and foreign key constraints have recently appeared; and aspects of these proposalshave been adopted within XMLSchema. In this paper; we examine the problem of checkingkeys and foreign keys in XML documents using a validator based on SAX. The algorithmrelies on an indexing technique based on the paths found in key definitions; and can beused for checking the correctness of an entire document (bulk checking) as well as forchecking updates as they are made to the document (incremental checking). The asymptoticperformance of the algorithm is linear in the size of the document or update. Furthermore;experimental results demonstrate reasonable performance.,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,65,0

Generative models for ticket resolution in expert networks,Gengxin Miao; Louise E Moser; Xifeng Yan; Shu Tao; Yi Chen; Nikos Anerousis,Abstract Ticket resolution is a critical; yet challenging; aspect of the delivery of IT services. Alarge service provider needs to handle; on a daily basis; thousands of tickets that reportvarious types of problems. Many of those tickets bounce among multiple expert groupsbefore being transferred to the group with the right expertise to solve the problem. Finding amethodology that reduces such bouncing and hence shortens ticket resolution time is a long-standing challenge. In this paper; we present a unified generative model; the OptimizedNetwork Model (ONM); that characterizes the lifecycle of a ticket; using both the content andthe routing sequence of the ticket. ONM uses maximum likelihood estimation; to representhow the information contained in a ticket is used by human experts to make ticket routingdecisions. Based on ONM; we develop a probabilistic algorithm to generate ticket routing …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,48,11
Query processing over incomplete autonomous databases,Garrett Wolf; Hemal Khatri; Bhaumik Chokshi; Jianchun Fan; Yi Chen; Subbarao Kambhampati,Abstract Incompleteness due to missing attribute values (aka" null values") is very commonin autonomous web databases; on which user accesses are usually supported throughmediators. Traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness ofanswer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes; even if they wind up beingrelevant to a user query. Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such possibleanswers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being pertinent answersto the query. The autonomous nature of web databases poses several challenges inrealizing this objective. Such challenges include the restricted access privileges imposed onthe data; the limited support for query patterns; and the bounded pool of database andnetwork resources in the web environment.

Processing keyword search on XML: a survey,Ziyang Liu; Yi Chen,Abstract Keyword search is a user-friendly approach for users to retrieve information fromXML data. Since an XML document can have a large size and contain a lot of information; anXML keyword search result should be a fragment of an XML document dynamicallyconstructed at query time; which is achievable due to the structuredness of XML. Processingkeyword searches on XML has several challenges; eg; what are the elements in the XMLdocument that are relevant to the query? How to generate the results efficiently and rank theresults meaningfully? How to present the results to the user in a way such that the user canquickly find the desired information? In this survey; we review the papers in the literature thatattempted to address these problems. We divide the existing approaches into severalclasses based on the problem they tackled; and perform a comprehensive analysis of …,World Wide Web Journal,2011,47,0
Wise: A workflow information search engine,Qihong Shao; Peng Sun; Yi Chen,Workflows are widely used for representing business processes; web services; scientificexperiments; and activities in daily life; like recipes. There is an increasing need for peopleto search a workflow repository using keywords and retrieve the relevant ones according totheir interests. A workflow hierarchy is a three dimensional object containing multi-resolutionabstraction views on the same workflow. This unique structure poses a new set ofchallenges compared to keyword search on tree or graph structures which are typicallyfound in XML or relational data. In this demonstration; we present an effective workflowsearch engine; WISE; which returns informative and concise search results; defined as theminimal views of the most specific workflow hierarchies containing matching keywords.,Data Engineering; 2009.

Efficient iceberg query evaluation using compressed bitmap index,Bin He; Hui-I Hsiao; Ziyang Liu; Yu Huang; Yi Chen,Decision support and knowledge discovery systems often compute aggregate values ofinteresting attributes by processing a huge amount of data in very large databases and/orwarehouses. In particular; iceberg query is a special type of aggregation query thatcomputes aggregate values above a user-provided threshold. Usually; only a small numberof results will satisfy the threshold constraint. Yet; the results often carry very important andvaluable business insights. Because of the small result set; iceberg queries offer manyopportunities for deep query optimization. However; most existing iceberg query processingalgorithms do not take advantage of the small-result-set property and rely heavily on thetuple-scan-based approach. This incurs intensive disk accesses and computation; resultingin long processing time especially when data size is large.

Incremental information extraction using relational databases,Luis Tari; Phan Huy Tu; Jorg Hakenberg; Yi Chen; Tran Cao Son; Graciela Gonzalez; Chitta Baral,Information extraction systems are traditionally implemented as a pipeline of special-purpose processing modules targeting the extraction of a particular kind of information. Amajor drawback of such an approach is that whenever a new extraction goal emerges or amodule is improved; extraction has to be reapplied from scratch to the entire text corpuseven though only a small part of the corpus might be affected. In this paper; we describe anovel approach for information extraction in which extraction needs are expressed in theform of database queries; which are evaluated and optimized by database systems. Usingdatabase queries for information extraction enables generic extraction and minimizesreprocessing of data by performing incremental extraction to identify which part of the data isaffected by the change of components or goals. Furthermore; our approach provides …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,42,15

Query expansion based on clustered results,Ziyang Liu; Sivaramakrishnan Natarajan; Yi Chen,Abstract Query expansion is a functionality of search engines that suggests a set of relatedqueries for a user-issued keyword query. Typical corpus-driven keyword query expansionapproaches return popular words in the results as expanded queries. Using theseapproaches; the expanded queries may correspond to a subset of possible query semantics;and thus miss relevant results. To handle ambiguous queries and exploratory queries;whose result relevance is difficult to judge; we propose a new framework for keyword queryexpansion: we start with clustering the results according to user specified granularity; andthen generate expanded queries; such that one expanded query is generated for eachcluster whose result set should ideally be the corresponding cluster. We formalize thisproblem and show its APX-hardness. Then we propose two efficient algorithms named …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,41,0

L-Tree: a dynamic labeling structure for ordered XML data,Yi Chen; George Mihaila; Rajesh Bordawekar; Sriram Padmanabhan,Abstract With the ever growing use of XML as a data representation format; we see anincreasing need for robust; high performance XML database systems. While most of therecent work focuses on efficient XML query processing; XML databases also need to supportefficient updates. To speed up query processing; various labeling schemes have beenproposed. However; the vast majority of these schemes have poor update performance. Inthis paper; we introduce a dynamic labeling structure for XML data: L-Tree and its order-preserving labeling scheme with O (log n) amortized update cost and O (log n) bits per label.L-Tree has good performance on updates without compromising the performance of queryprocessing. We present the update algorithm for L-Tree and analyze its complexity.,Current Trends in Database Technology-EDBT 2004 Workshops,2004,34,12

Detecting and resolving unsound workflow views for correct provenance analysis,Peng Sun; Ziyang Liu; Susan B Davidson; Yi Chen,Abstract Workflow views abstract groups of tasks in a workflow into high level compositetasks; in order to reuse sub-workflows and facilitate provenance analysis. However; unless aview is carefully designed; it may not preserve the dataflow between tasks in the workflow;ie; it may not be sound. Unsound views can be misleading and cause incorrect provenanceanalysis. This paper studies the problem of efficiently identifying and correcting unsoundworkflow views with minimal changes. In particular; given a workflow view; we wish to spliteach unsound composite task into the minimal number of tasks; such that the resulting viewis sound. We prove that this problem is NP-hard by reduction from independent set. We thenpropose two local optimality conditions (weak and strong); and design polynomial timealgorithms for correcting unsound views to meet these conditions.

In this paper; we study the problem ofusing historical ticket data to make smarter routing recommendations for new tickets; so as toimprove the efficiency of ticket routing; in terms of the Mean number of Steps To Resolve(MSTR) a ticket. Previous studies on this problem have been focusing on mining ticketresolution sequences to generate more informed routing recommendations.

A bi-labeling based XPath processing system,Yi Chen; Susan B Davidson; Yifeng Zheng,Abstract We present BLAS; a Bi-LAbeling based XPath processing System. BLAS uses twolabeling schemes to speed up query processing: P-labeling for processing consecutive child(or parent) axis traversals; and D-labeling for processing descendant (or ancestor) axistraversals. XML data are stored in labeled form and indexed. Algorithms are presented fortranslating XPath queries to SQL expressions. BLAS reduces the number of joins in the SQLquery translated from a given XPath query and reduces the number of disk accessesrequired to execute the SQL query compared with the traditional XPath processing using D-labeling alone. We also propose an approximate P-labeling scheme and the correspondingquery translation algorithm to handle XML data trees that contain a large number of distincttag names; and/or are very deep.

Efficient and scalable data evolution with column oriented databases,Ziyang Liu; Bin He; Hui-I Hsiao; Yi Chen,Abstract Database evolution is the process of updating the schema of a database or datawarehouse (schema evolution) and evolving the data to the updated schema (dataevolution). It is often desired or necessitated when changes occur to the data or the queryworkload; the initial schema was not carefully designed; or more knowledge of the databaseis known and a better schema is concluded. The Wikipedia database; for example; has hadmore than 170 versions in the past 5 years [8]. Unfortunately; although much research hasbeen done on the schema evolution part; data evolution has long been a prohibitivelyexpensive process; which essentially evolves the data by executing SQL queries and re-constructing indexes. This prevents databases from being flexibly and frequently changedbased on the need and forces schema designers; who cannot afford mistakes; to be …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,13,20
Personalized influential topic search via social network summarization,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yi Chen; Timos Sellis; J Shane Culpepper,Social networks are a vital mechanism to disseminate information to friends and colleagues.In this work; we investigate an important problem-the personalized influential topic search;or PIT-Search in a social network: Given a keyword query q issued by a user u in a socialnetwork; a PIT-Search is to find the top-k q-related topics that are most influential for thequery user u. The influence of a topic to a query user depends on the social connectionbetween the query user and the social users containing the topic in the social network. Tomeasure the topics' influence at the similar granularity scale; we need to extract the socialsummarization of the social network regarding topics. To make effective topic-aware socialsummarization; we propose two random-walk based approaches: random clustering and anL-length random walk.

Efficiently discovering critical workflows in scientific explorations,Qihong Shao; Peng Sun; Yi Chen,Abstract Existing workflow management systems assume that scientists have a well-specified workflow design before the execution. In reality; a lot of scientific discoveries aremade as a result of a dynamic process; where scientists keep proposing new hypothesesand verifying them through multiple tries of various experiments before achieving successfulexperimental results. Consequently; not all the experiments in a workflow execution havenecessarily contributed to the final result. In this paper; we investigate the problem ofeffectively reproducing the results of previous scientific workflow executions by discoveringthe critical experiments leading to the success and the logical constraints on their executionorder. Relational schema and SQL queries have been designed for effectively recording theworkflow execution log; efficiently identifying the critical experiments from the log; and …,Future Generation Computer Systems,2009,12,20
Assessing expertise awareness in resolution networks,Yi Chen; Shu Tao; Xifeng Yan; Nikos Anerousis; Qihong Shao,Problem resolution is a key issue in the IT service industry. A large service provider handles;on daily basis; thousands of tickets that report various types of problems from its customers.The efficiency of this process highly depends on the effective interactions among variousexpert groups; in search of the resolver to the reported problem. In fact; ticket transferdecisions reflect the expertise awareness between groups; thus encoding a sophisticatedresolution social network. In this paper; we propose a computational framework toquantitatively assess expertise awareness; ie; how well a group knows the expertise ofothers. An accurate assessment of expertise awareness could identify the weakestcomponents in a resolution system. The framework; built on our previously developedresolution engine; is able to calculate the performance difference caused by excluding a …,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2010 International Conference on,2010,11,0
TargetSearch: a ranking friendly XML keyword search engine,Ziyang Liu; Yichuan Cai; Yi Chen,This demo illustrates an XML search engine TargetSearch that addresses an open problemin XML keyword search: given relevant matches to keywords; how to compose query resultsproperly so that they can be effectively ranked and easily digested by users. Theapproaches adopted in the literature generate either overwhelmingly large results orfragmentary results; both of which may cause the ranking schemes to be ineffective.Intuitively; each query has a search target and each result should contain exactly oneinstance of the search target along with its evidence. We developed TargetSearch whichcomposes atomic and intact query results driven by users' search targets.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,11,19
Approximate structural matching over ordered XML documents,Nitin Agarwal; Magdiel Galan Oliveras; Yi Chen,There is an increasing need for an XML query engine that not only searches for exactmatches to a query but also returns" query-like" structures. We have designed anddeveloped XFinder; an efficient top K tree pattern query evaluation system; which reducesthe problem of approximate tree structural matching to a simpler problem of subsequencematching. However; since not all subsequences correspond to valid tree structures; it isexpensive to enumerate common subsequences between XML data and query and thenfilter the invalid ones. XFinder addresses this challenge by detecting and pruning structurallyirrelevant subsequence matches as early as possible. Experiments show the efficiency ofXFinder on various data and query sets.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2007. IDEAS 2007. 11th International,2007,11,20
Qpiad: Query processing over incomplete autonomous databases,Hemal Khatri; Jianchun Fan; Yi Chen; Subbarao Kambhampati,Incompleteness due to missing attribute values (aka" null values") is very common inautonomous Web databases; on which user accesses are usually supported throughmediators. Traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness ofanswer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes; even if they wind up beingrelevant to a user query. Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such relevantuncertain answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being relevantanswers to the query. However; the autonomous nature of the databases poses severalchallenges; such as the restricted access privileges; limited query patterns; and sensitivity ofdatabase and network resource consumption in the Web environment. We introduce a novelquery rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges to …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,11,20

Reliable ticket routing in expert networks,Gengxin Miao; Louise E Moser; Xifeng Yan; Shu Tao; Yi Chen; Nikos Anerousis,Abstract Problem ticket resolution is an important aspect of the delivery of IT services. Alarge service provider needs to handle; on a daily basis; thousands of tickets that reportvarious types of problems. Many of those tickets bounce among multiple expert groupsbefore being transferred to the group with the expertise to solve the problem. Finding amethodology that can automatically make reliable ticket routing decisions and that reducessuch bouncing and; hence; shortens ticket resolution time is a long-standing challenge.Reliable ticket routing forwards the ticket to an expert who either can solve the problemreported in the ticket; or can reach an expert who can resolve the ticket.

Viewability prediction for online display ads,Chong Wang; Achir Kalra; Cristian Borcea; Yi Chen,Abstract As a massive industry; display advertising delivers advertisers' marketing messagesto attract customers through graphic banners on webpages. Advertisers are charged by adserving; where their ads are shown in web pages. However; recent studies show that abouthalf of the ads were actually never seen by users because they do not scroll deep enough tobring the ads in-view. Thus; the ad pricing standards are shifting to a new model: ads arepaid if they are in view; not just being served. To the best of our knowledge; this paper is thefirst to address the important problem of ad viewability prediction which can improve theperformance of guaranteed ad delivery; real-time bidding; as well as recommender systems.We analyze a real-life dataset from a large publisher; identify a number of features thatimpact the scroll depth for a given user and a page; and propose a probabilistic latent …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,7,22
Generating sound workflow views for correct provenance analysis,Ziyang Liu; Susan B Davidson; Yi Chen,Abstract Workflow views abstract groups of tasks in a workflow into high level compositetasks; in order to reuse subworkflows and facilitate provenance analysis. However; unless aview is carefully designed; it may not preserve the dataflow between tasks in the workflow;that is; it may not be sound. Unsound views can be misleading and cause incorrectprovenance analysis. This article studies the problem of efficiently identifying and correctingunsound workflow views with minimal changes; and constructing minimal sound andelucidative workflow views with a set of user-specified relevant tasks. In particular; tworelated problems are investigated. First; given a workflow view; we wish to split eachunsound composite task into the minimal number of tasks; such that the resulting view issound. Second; given a workflow and a set of user specified relevant tasks; we generate …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,7,20
Evaluating Rank Accuracy based on Incomplete Pairwise Preferences,Brian Ackerman; Yi Chen,ABSTRACT Existing methods to measure the rank accuracy of a recommender systemassume the ground truth is either a set of user ratings or a total ordered list of items given bythe user with possible ties. However; in many applications we are only able to obtain implicituser feedback; which does not provide such comprehensive information; but only gives a setof pairwise preferences among items. Generally such pairwise preferences are notcomplete; and thus may not deduce a total order of items. In this paper; we propose a novelmethod to evaluate rank accuracy; expected discounted rank correlation; which addressesthe unique challenges of handling incomplete pairwise preferences in ground truth and alsoputs an emphasis on properly ranking items that users most prefer.,Workshop of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,2011,7,20
Cods: Evolving data efficiently and scalably in column oriented databases,Ziyang Liu; Sivaramakrishnan Natarajan; Bin He; Hui-I Hsiao; Yi Chen,Abstract Database evolution is the process of updating the schema of a database or datawarehouse (schema evolution) and evolving the data to the updated schema (dataevolution). Database evolution is often necessitated in relational databases due to thechanges of data or workload; the suboptimal initial schema design; or the availability of newknowledge of the database. It involves two steps: updating the database schema; andevolving the data to the new schema. Despite the capability of commercial RDBMSs to welloptimize query processing; evolving the data during a database evolution through SQLqueries is shown to be prohibitively costly. We designed and developed CODS; a platformfor efficient data level data evolution in column oriented databases; which evolves the datato the new schema without materializing query results or unnecessary compression …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,7,10
Challenges; Techniques and Directions in Building XSeek: an XML Search Engine,Ziyang Liu; Peng Sun; Yu Huang; Yichuan Cai; Yi Chen,Abstract The importance of supporting keyword searches on XML data has been widelyrecognized. Different from structured queries; keyword searches are inherently ambiguousdue to the inability/unwillingness of users to specify pinpoint semantics. As a result;processing keyword searches involves many unique challenges. In this paper we discussthe motivation; desiderata and challenges in supporting keyword searches on XML data.Then we present an XML keyword search engine; XSeek; which addresses the challengesin several aspects: identifying explicit relevant nodes; identifying implicit relevant nodes; andgenerating result snippets. At last we discuss the remaining issues and future researchdirections. 1,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2009,7,10
Efficient Path Query Processing on Encoded XML,Yi Chen; George A Mihaila; Susan B Davidson; Sriram Padmanabhan,ABSTRACT As XML has become a popular format for information exchange; the efficientprocessing of broadcast XML data on a constrained device (for example; a cell phone or aPDA) becomes a critical task. In this paper we present the EXPedite system: a new model ofdata processing; which “migrates” the power of the data-sending server to receivers forefficient processing. It consists of a general encoding scheme for servers; and streamingquery processing algorithms on encoded XML stream for client devices.

Ranking friendly result composition for XML keyword search,Ziyang Liu; Yichuang Cai; Yi Shan; Yi Chen,Abstract This paper addresses an open problem of keyword search in XML trees: givenrelevant matches to keywords; how to compose query results properly so that they can beeffectively ranked and easily understood by users. The approaches adopted in the literatureare oblivious to user search intention; making ranking schemes ineffective on such results.Intuitively; each query has a search target and each result should contain exactly oneinstance of the search target along with its evidence about its relevance to the query. In thispaper; we design algorithms that compose atomic and intact query results driven by users'search targets. To infer search targets; we analyze return specifications in the query; themodifying relationship among keyword matches and the entities involved in the search.Experimental evaluationsvalidate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2015,6,20
Differentiating search results on structured data,Ziyang Liu; Yi Chen,Abstract Studies show that about 50&percnt; of Web search is for information explorationpurposes; where a user would like to investigate; compare; evaluate; and synthesizemultiple relevant results. Due to the absence of general tools that can effectively analyzeand differentiate multiple results; a user has to manually read and comprehend potentiallarge results in an exploratory search. Such a process is time consuming; labor intensiveand error prone. Interestingly; we find that the metadata information embedded in structureddata provides a potential for automating or semi-automating the comparison of multipleresults. In this article we present an approach for structured data search result differentiation.We define the differentiability of query results and quantify the degree of difference. Then wedefine the problem of identifying a limited number of valid features in a result that can …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,6,20

Context-aware experience extraction from online health forums,Yunzhong Liu; Yi Chen; Jiliang Tang; Huan Liu,Online health forums provide a large repository for patients; caregivers; and researchers toseek valuable information. The extraction of patient-reported personal health experiencefrom the forums has many important applications. For example; medical researchers candiscover trustable knowledge from the extracted experience. Patients can search for peerswith similar experience and connect with them. In this paper; we model the extraction ofpatient experience as a classification problem: classifying each sentence in a forum post ascontaining patient experience or not containing patient experience. We propose to exploitthe sentence context information for such experience extraction task; and classify the contextinformation into global context and local context. A unified Context-Aware ExperienceExtraction (CARE) framework is proposed to incorporate these two types of context …,Healthcare Informatics (ICHI); 2015 International Conference on,2015,5,20
BayesWipe: A Multimodal System for Data Cleaning and Consistent Query Answering on Structured Data,Sushovan De; Yuheng Hu; Yi Chen; Subbarao Kambhampati,ABSTRACT Recent efforts in data cleaning have focused mainly on problems like datadeduplication; record matching; and data standardization; none of these focus on fixingincorrect attribute values in tuples. Correcting values in tuples is typically performed by aminimum cost repair of tuples that violate static constraints like CFDs (which have to beprovided by domain experts; or learned from a clean sample of the database). In this paper;we provide a method for correcting individual attribute values in a structured database usinga Bayesian generative model and a statistical error model learned from the noisy databasedirectly. We thus avoid the necessity for a domain expert or master data.

Learning thread reply structure on patient forums,Yunzhong Liu; Feng Chen; Yi Chen,Abstract The thread reply structure on patient forums is important for users and automatedtechniques to understand the discussion content and search information effectively.However; most online patient forums only have partially labeled structures. In patient forums;the discussions by patients and caregivers contain abundance of person references; whichprovide strong indication of the thread reply structure. In this paper; we propose usingperson reference resolution; combined with a statistical machine learning model; to learn theunknown thread structure on patient forums.

Patient-Centered Information Extraction for Effective Search on Healthcare Forum.,Yunzhong Liu; Yi Chen,Abstract Online healthcare forums are one of the major social media in Health 2.0 forpatients and caregivers to share personal experience and to help each other. However;current forums do not support effective information search and thus users are unable to fullyleverage the rich information in the forums. In this work; we propose patient-centeredinformation extraction to better organize the information in the forum and have developed apatient-centered medical information database extracted from a forum. In this system; thepatients discussed on the forum are identified and their shared medical information isaggregated and associated with the corresponding patients. The experimental evaluationshows that our system can provide better information search results than traditionalapproaches.,SBP,2013,5,12

WOLVES: achieving correct provenance analysis by detecting and resolving unsound workflow views,Peng Sun; Ziyang Liu; Sivaramakrishnan Natarajan; Susan B Davidson; Yi Chen,Abstract Workflow views abstract groups of tasks in a workflow into composite tasks; and areused for simplifying provenance analysis; workflow sharing and reuse. An unsound viewdoes not preserve the dataflow between tasks in the workflow; and can therefore causeincorrect provenance analysis. In this demo we present WOLVES; a system that efficientlyidentifies and corrects unsound workflow views with minimal changes (view correction).Since the view correction problem is NP-hard; WOLVES allows the user to choose betweentwo forms of local optimality; strong and weak.

On user views in scientific workflow systems,Susan Davidson; Yi Chen; Peng Sun; Sarah Cohen-Boulakia,Abstract—An increasing number of scientific workflow systems are providing support for theautomated tracking and storage of provenance information. However; the amount ofprovenance information recorded can become very large; even for a single execution of aworkflow–[6] estimates a ten-fold blowup of the size of the original input data. There istherefore a need to provide ways of allowing users to focus their attention on meaningfulprovenance information in provenance queries.

Storing and Discovering Critical Workflows from Log in Scientific Exploration,Qihong Shao; Michel Kinsy; Yi Chen,This paper aims at effectively reproducing the results of previous scientific workflowexecutions. We first identify the information that needs to be recorded in a workflowexecution log; based on which we then determine the data flow among experiments. Toeffectively record a workflow execution log in a relational database management system(RDBMS) when the workflow design is absent; we propose a generic relational storageschema. Then techniques have been designed to automatically discover the minimal set ofexperiments that must be performed in order to reproduce a scientific result by posingappropriate SQL queries. Although such SQL queries can be evaluated using an off-the-shelf database system; we investigate the unique characteristics of the workflow log dataand optimization techniques for evaluating such SQL queries efficiently.,Services; 2007 IEEE Congress on,2007,2,20
Webpage Depth-level Dwell Time Prediction,Chong Wang; Achir Kalra; Cristian Borcea; Yi Chen,Abstract The amount of time spent by users at specific page depths within webpages; calleddwell time; can be used by web publishers to decide where to place online ads and whattype of ads to place at different depths within a webpage. This paper presents a model topredict the dwell time for a given" user; webpage; depth" triplet based on historic datacollected by publishers. Dwell time prediction is difficult due to user behavior variability anddata sparsity. We adopt the Factorization Machines model because it is able to capture theinteraction between users and webpages; overcome the data sparsity issue; and provideflexibility to add auxiliary information such as the visible area of a user's browser.Experimental results using data from a large web publisher demonstrate that our modeloutperforms deterministic and regression-based comparison models.,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,1,0

GenerIE: Information extraction using database queries,Luis Tari; Huy Tu Phan; Jörg Hakenberg; Yi Chen; Cao Son Tran; Graciela Gonzalez; Chitta Baral,Information extraction systems are traditionally implemented as a pipeline of special-purpose processing modules. A major drawback of such an approach is that whenever anew extraction goal emerges or a module is improved; extraction has to be re-applied fromscratch to the entire text corpus even though only a small part of the corpus might beaffected. In this demonstration proposal; we describe a novel paradigm for informationextraction: we store the parse trees output by text processing in a database; and thenexpress extraction needs using queries; which can be evaluated and optimized bydatabases. Compared with the existing approaches; database queries for informationextraction enable generic extraction and minimize reprocessing. However; such anapproach also poses a lot of technical challenges; such as language design; optimization …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,1,15
Keyword Search on XML Data,Ziyang Liu; Yi Chen,Information search is an indispensable component of our lives. Due to the vast collections ofXML data on the web and in enterprises; providing users with easy access to XML is highlydesirable. The classical way of accessing XML data is through issuing structured queries;such as XPath/XQuery. However; in many applications it is inconvenientor impossible forusers to learn these query languages. Besides; the requirement that the user needs tocomprehend data schemas may well be overwhelming and infeasible; as the schemas arelikely complex; fast-evolving; or unavailable. A natural question to askis whether we canempower users to effectively access XML data simply using keyword queries. Ideally theresult of a keyword search on XML will automatically assemble relevantpieces of data,*,2010,1,0
Detecting and resolving unsound workflow views for efficient provenance analysis,Peng Sun; Ziyang Liu; S Davidson; Yi Chen,ABSTRACT Workflow views abstract groups of tasks in a workflow into high level compositetasks; in order to reuse sub-workflows and to facilitate provenance analysis. However;unless a view is carefully designed it may not preserve the dataflow between tasks in theworkflow; ie it may not be sound. Unsound views can be misleading and cause incorrectprovenance analysis. This paper studies the problem of efficiently identifying and correctingunsound workflow views with minimal changes. In particular; given a workflow view; we wishto split each unsound composite task into the minimal number of groups; such that theresulting view is sound. We prove that this problem is NP-hard by reduction fromindependent set. We then propose two local optimality conditions (weak and strong); anddesign polynomial time algorithms for correcting unsound views subject to these …,*,2009,1,20
Integrating querying and retrieval for biomedical information extraction,Luis Tari; Phan Huy Tu; Jörg Hakenberg; Yi Chen; Tran Cao Son; Graciela Gonzalez; Chitta Baral,Abstract—Biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) involves the automaticprocessing of documents in the biomedical domain for the purpose of extracting informationof interest from them. A common approach to BioNLP is through sequential application of aselection of modules (such as a named entity recognizer and a grammar parser followed byextraction) where the aggregated output is stored in an application-specific format. A majordrawback of this approach is that if a particular module is improved; then one needs to re-process the data from that point forward in order for the improvement to have an impact onthe final output. We propose a data-centric approach to minimize such re-computation byusing a database approach where the result of processing some general modules arestored in an appropriately designed database; and specific modules are implemented as …,*,2009,1,20
Patient‐centered and experience‐aware mining for effective adverse drug reaction discovery in online health forums,Yunzhong Liu; Jinhe Shi; Yi Chen,Abstract Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) have become a serious health problem and evena leading cause of death in the United States. Pre-marketing clinical trials and traditionalpost-marketing surveillance using voluntary and spontaneous report systems are insufficientfor ADR detection. On the other hand; online health forums provide valuable evidences in alarge scale and in a timely fashion through the active participation of patients; caregivers;and doctors. In this article; we present patient-centered and experience-aware miningframework for effective ADR discovery using online health forum data.

Probabilistic Models for Ad Viewability Prediction on the Web,Chong Wang; Achir Kalra; Li Zhou; Cristian Borcea; Yi Chen,Online display advertising has becomes a billion-dollar industry; and it keeps growing.Advertisers attempt to send marketing messages to attract potential customers via graphicbanner ads on publishers' webpages. Advertisers are charged for each view of a page thatdelivers their display ads. However; recent studies have discovered that more than half ofthe ads are never shown on users' screens due to insufficient scrolling. Thus; advertiserswaste a great amount of money on these ads that do not bring any return on investment.Given this situation; the Interactive Advertising Bureau calls for a shift toward charging byviewable impression; ie; charge for ads that are viewed by users. With this new pricingmodel; it is helpful to predict the viewability of an ad.

However; being oblivious to user search intention; a query result maycontain multiple instances of user search target; and multiple query results may containinformation for the same instance of user search target. With the misalignment betweenquery results and search targets; a ranking function is unable to effectively rank theinstances of search targets. In this paper we propose the concept of target-aware queryresults driven by inferred user search intention. We leverage the Information Theory anddevelop a general probability model to infer search targets by analyzing return specifiers;modifiers; relatedness relationships; and query keywords' information gain. Then wepropose two important properties for a target-aware result: atomicity and intactness. We …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2017,*,10
Ad Blocking and Counter-Ad Blocking: Analysis of Online Ad Blocker Usage,Shuai Zhao; Chong Wang; Achir Kalra; Leon Vaks; Cristian Borcea; Yi Chen,Abstract Compared with online advertising industry; there is an even faster increase of adblocker usage; which influence badly on publishers' and advertisers' business. Thus moreand more companies initialize their counter-ad blocking strategies; in which customerschoose to either disable their ad blockers or leave without seeing the content. There are alsocompanies which abandon their counter-ad blocking strategies after conducting them for awhile due to insufficient understanding of users' ad blocking behavior. In this study; weemployed a quasi-experiment framework and collected a large-size data with thecooperation with Forbes Media. We aim to identify factors influencing ad blocker usage.Furthermore; we will model the interaction effects among user profile; online behaviorpatterns; device features on ad blocker usage propensity. Our study contributes the …,*,2017,*,20
Revenue-Optimized Webpage Recommendation,Chong Wang; Achir Kalra; Cristian Borcea; Yi Chen,As a massive industry; display advertising delivers advertisers' marketing messages toattract customers throughbanners shown on webpages. For publishers; ie websites; displayadvertising is the most critical revenue source. Most existing webpage recommendersystems suggest webpages based on user interests only. However; the articles of interest tospecific users may not be profitable to publishers. Conversely; only recommending the mostprofitable articles may lose publishers' user base. To address this issue; we will conduct aseries of investigations and design Revenue-Optimized Recommendation; aims torecommend users webpages that optimize interestingness and ad revenue.,Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,*,15
Scalable Query Optimization for Efficient Data Processing Using MapReduce,Yi Shan; Yi Chen,MapReduce is widely acknowledged by both industry and academia as an effectiveprogramming model for query processing on big data. It is crucial to design an optimizerwhich finds the most efficient way to execute an SQL query using MapReduce. However;existing work in parallel query processing either falls short of optimizing an SQL query usingMapReduce or the time complexity of the optimizer it uses is exponential. Also; industrysolutions such as HIVE; and YSmart do not optimize the join sequence of an SQL query andcannot guarantee an optimal execution plan. In this paper; we propose a scalable optimizerfor SQL queries using MapReduce; named SOSQL. Experiments performed on GoogleCloud Platform confirmed the scalability and efficiency of SOSQL over existing work.,Big Data (BigData Congress); 2015 IEEE International Congress on,2015,*,20
Guest Editors Introduction: Special Section on Keyword Search on Structured Data,Surajit Chaudhuri; Yi Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu,WITH the prevalence of Web search engines; keyword search has become the most popularway for users to retrieve information from text documents. On the other hand; there is anenormous amount of valuable information stored in structured form (relational orsemistructured) in Internet; intranet; and enterprise databases. To query such data sources;users traditionally depended on specialized applications because for most users it is difficultto use structured or semistructured query languages. In recent years; enterprise search hasgained popularity where a,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,*,19

Efficient XPath query processing on stored and streaming XML data,Yi Chen,Abstract With XML emerging as the de facto standard for data representation format; efficientquery evaluation on XML data is a very important research challenge. Different applicationsrequire queries to be evaluated using different processing models. In some applications;XML data needs to be stored locally for query processing; for example; scientific data. Inother applications; XML data arrives continuously as a stream and requires on-lineprocessing; such as the streams for stock and traffic information.^ In this thesis we discusshow to efficiently evaluate XPath queries on locally stored XML data and XML streams. Wealso exploit an encoding format to speed up query processing.^ For locally stored XML data;a Bi-LAbeling based System (BLAS) is proposed to efficiently process XPath queries byleveraging well-developed relational technology. Compared to existing work on XPath …,*,2005,*,22
On Development and Optimization of Computing Workflows for Big Data Analytics in Brain Injury Research,Chase Wu; Yi Chen; Namas Chandra,Abstract—Many scientific applications are producing a colossal amount of data that must beprocessed and analyzed for scientific exploration and knowledge discovery. The brain injuryresearch at the Center for Injury Biomechanics; Materials and Medicine (CIBM3) at NewJersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is one such application. We propose to develop aworkflow-based solution that integrates various big data analytics approaches to support thebrain injury research. Within the workflow framework; the data-intensive analytics modulesare implemented and executed on big data platforms such as Hadoop using cloudcomputing resources in virtualized environments. The proposed workflow system is genericand can be adapted to other scientific domains with similar computing and networkingneeds.,*,*,*,10
