Index structures for path expressions,Tova Milo; Dan Suciu,Abstract In recent years there has been an increased interest in managing data that does notconform to traditional data models; like the relational or object oriented model. The reasonsfor this non-conformance are diverse. On the one hand; data may not conform to suchmodels at the physical level: it may be stored in data exchange formats; fetched from theWeb; or stored as structured files. One the other hand; it may not conform at the logical level:data may have missing attributes; some attributes may be of different types in different dataitems; there may be heterogeneous collections; or the schema may be too complex orchanges too often. The term semistructured data has been used to refer to such data. Thesemistructured data model consists of an edge-labeled graph; in which nodes correspond toobjects and edges to attributes or values.

Querying the world wide web,Alberto O Mendelzon; George A Mihaila; Tova Milo,The World Wide Web is a large; heterogeneous; distributed collection of documentsconnected by hypertext links. The most common technology currently used for searching theWeb depends on sending information retrieval requests to" index servers". One problem withthis is that these queries cannot exploit the structure and topology of the document network.The authors propose a query language; WebSQL; that takes advantage of multiple indexservers without requiring users to know about them; and that integrates textual retrieval withstructure and topology-based queries. They give a formal semantics for WebSQL using acalculus based on a novel" virtual graph" model of a document network. They propose anew theory of query cost based on the idea of" query locality;" that is; how much of thenetwork must be visited to answer a particular query. Finally; they describe a prototype …,Parallel and Distributed Information Systems; 1996.; Fourth International Conference on,1996,677,8
Using schema matching to simplify heterogeneous data translation,Tova Milo; Sagit Zohar,Abstract A broad spectrum of data is available on the Web in distinct heterogeneoussources; and stored under di erent formats. As the number of systems that utilize thisheterogeneous data grows; the importance of data translation and conversion mechanismsincreases greatly. In this paper we present a new translation system; based onschemamatching; aimed to simplify the intricate task of data conversion. We observe that inmany cases the schema of the data in the source system is very similar to the that of thetarget system. In such cases; much of the translation work can be done automatically; basedon the schemas similarity. This saves a lot of e ort for the user; limiting the amount ofprogramming needed. We de ne common schema and data models; in which schemas anddata (resp.) from many common models can be represented. Using a rulebased method …,vldb,1998,580,1
Typechecking for XML transformers,Tova Milo; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,Abstract We study the typechecking problem for XML (eXtensible Markup Language)transformers: given an XML transformation program and a DTD for the input XMLdocuments; check whether every result of the program conforms to a specified output DTD.We model XML transformers using a novel device called a k-pebble transducer; that canexpress most queries without data-value joins in XML-QL; XSLT; and other XML querylanguages. Types are modeled by regular tree languages; a robust extension of DTDs. Themain result of the paper is that typechecking for k-pebble transducers is decidable.Consequently; typechecking can be performed for a broad range of XML transformationlanguages; including XML-QL and a fragment of XSLT.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2003,383,10
Labeling dynamic XML trees,Edith Cohen; Haim Kaplan; Tova Milo,We consider online algorithms to label the nodes of an XML tree which is subject toinsertions and deletions of nodes. The labeling is done such that (1) each node is assigneda label immediately when it is inserted and this label remains unchanged; and (2) from apair of labels alone; one can decide whether one node is an ancestor of the other. Thisproblem arises in the context of XML databases that support queries on the structure of thedocuments as well as on the changes made to the documents over time. We consider herethe length of the assigned labels. We prove lower bounds on the length of labels whichsatisfy these requirements and provide labeling algorithms that match these bounds (up to aconstant factor). We also consider the same problem when “clues” that provide guaranteeson possible future insertions are given together with newly inserted nodes. Such clues …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2010,364,7
Querying and Updating the File.,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Tova Milo,Abstract We show how structured data stored in files can benefit from standard databasetechnology and in particular be queried and updated using database languages. Weintroduce the notion of structuring schema which consists of a grammar annotated withdatabase programs and of a database schema. We study the translation from structuredstrings to databases; and the converse. We adapt optimization techniques from relationaldatabases to our context.,VLDB,1993,238,2
Compact labeling schemes for ancestor queries,Serge Abiteboul; Haim Kaplan; Tova Milo,Abstract We consider the following problem. Give a rooted tree T; label the nodes of T in themost compact way such that given the labels of two nodes one can determine in constanttime; by looking only at the labels; if one node is an ancestor of the other. The best knownlabeling scheme is rather straightforward and uses labels of size at most 2 log n; where n isthe number of vertices In the tree. Our main result in this paper is a labeling scheme withmaximum label size close to 3/2 log n. Our motivation for studying this problem is enhancingthe performance of Web search engines. In the context of this application each indexeddocument is a tree and the labels of all trees are maintained in main memory. Thereforeeven small improvements in the maximum label size are important.,Proceedings of the twelfth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2001,223,7
Querying documents in object databases,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Vassilis Christophides; Tova Milo; Guido Moerkotte; Jérôme Siméon,structuring schemas that consist in grammars annotated with database programs. To querydocuments; we introduce an extension of OQL; the ODMG standard query language forobject databases. Our extension (named OQL-doc) allows us to query documents without aprecise knowledge of their structure using in particular generalized path expressions andpattern matching. This allows us to introduce in a declarative language (in the style of SQLor OQL); navigational and information retrieval styles of accessing data. Query processing inthe context of documents and path expressions leads to challenging implementation issues.We extend an object algebra with new operators to deal with generalized path expressions.We then consider two essential complementary optimization techniques. We show thatalmost standard database optimization techniques can be used to answer queries without …,International Journal on Digital Libraries,1997,223,7
Dynamic XML documents with distribution and replication,Serge Abiteboul; Angela Bonifati; Grégory Cobéna; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo,Abstract The advent of XML as a universal exchange format; and of Web services as a basisfor distributed computing; has fostered the apparition of a new class of documents: dynamicXML documents. These are XML documents where some data is given explicitly while otherparts are given only intensionally by means of embedded calls to web services that can becalled to generate the required information. By the sole presence of Web services; dynamicdocuments already include inherently some form of distributed computation. A higher levelof distribution that also allows (fragments of) dynamic documents to be distributed and/orreplicated over several sites is highly desirable in today's Web architecture; and in fact isalso relevant for regular (non dynamic) documents. The goal of this paper is to study newissues raised by the distribution and replication of dynamic XML data.

Similarity-based queries,HV Jagadish; Alberto O Mendelzon; Tova Milo,Abstract We develop a domain-independent framework for defining qneries in terms ofsimilarity of objects. Our framework has three components: a pattern language; atransformation rule language; and a query language. The pattern language specifiesclasses of objects; the transformation rule language defines similarity by specifying thesimilarity-preserving transformations; and the whole package is wrapped in a general querylanguage. The framework can be “tuned” to the needs of a specific application domain; suchas time sequences; molecules; text strings or images; by the choice of these languages. Wedemonstrate the framework by presenting a specific instance on a specific domain–thedomain of sequences. We start with sequences over a finite alphabet; and then considersequences over infinite ordered domains. The basic pattern language weuseis regular …,Proceedings of the fourteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1995,183,3
Active xml: Peer-to-peer data and web services integration,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Roger Weber,The content of an Active eXtensible Markup Language (AXML) document is dynamic;because it is possible to specify when a service call should be activated (for example; whenneeded; every hour; etc.); and for how long its result should be considered valid. Thus; thissimple mechanism allows capturing and combining different styles of data integration; suchas warehousing and mediation. To fully take advantage of the use of services; AXML alsoallows calling continuous services (that provide streams of answers) and servicessupporting intentional data (AXML document including service calls) as parameters and/orresult. The latter feature leads to powerful; recursive integration schemes. The AXMLframework is centered on AXML documents; which are XML documents that may containcalls to Web services. When calls included in an AXML document are fired; the latter is …,*,2002,178,18
Querying business processes,Catriel Beeri; Anat Eyal; Simon Kamenkovich; Tova Milo,Abstract We present in this paper BP-QL; a novel query language for querying businessprocesses. The BP-QL language is based on an intuitive model of business processes; anabstraction of the emerging BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) standard. Itallows users to query business processes visually; in a manner very analogous to how suchprocesses are typically specified; and can be employed in a distributed setting; whereprocess components may be provided by distinct providers (peers). We describe here thequery language as well as its underlying formal model. We consider the properties of thevarious language components and explain how they influenced the language design. Inparticular we distinguish features that can be efficiently supported; and those that incur aprohibitively high cost; or cannot be computed at all. We also present our implementation …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,177,7
Integrating and customizing heterogeneous e-commerce applications,Anat Eyal; Tova Milo,Abstract A broad spectrum of electronic commerce applications is currently available on theWeb; providing services in almost any area one can think of. As the number and variety ofsuch applications grow; more business opportunities emerge for providing new servicesbased on the integration and customization of existing applications.(Web shopping mallsand support for comparative shopping are just a couple of examples.) Unfortunately; thediversity of applications in each specific domain and the disparity of interfaces; applicationflows; actor roles in the business transaction; and data formats; renders the integration andmanipulation of applications a rather difficult task. In this paper we present the ApplicationManifold system; aimed at simplifying the intricate task of integration and customization of e-commerce applications.

Formal models of web queries,Alberto O Mendelzon; Tova Milo,Abstract We present a new formal model of query and computation on the Web. We focus ontwo important aspects that distinguish the access to Web data from the access to a standarddatabase system: the navigational nature of the access and the lack of concurrency control.We show that these two issues have significant effects on the computability of queries. Toillustrate the ideas and how they can be used in practice for designing appropriate Webquery languages; we consider a particular query language; the Web calculus; an abstractionand extension of the practical Web query language WebSQL.,Information Systems,1998,169,7

Schemas for integration and translation of structured and semi-structured data,Catriel Beeri; Tova Milo,Abstract With the emergence of the Web as a universal data repository; research hasrecently focused on data integration and data translation; and a common data model ofsemistructured data has been established. It is being realized; however; that having acommon schema model is also necessary; to support tasks such as query formulation;decomposition and optimization; or declarative specification of data translation. In this paperwe elaborate on the theoretical foundations of a middle-ware schema model. We presentexpressive and flexible schema definition languages; and investigate properties such asexpressive power and the complexity of decision problems that are significant in the contextof data translation and integration.,International conference on database theory,1999,158,15
Exchanging intensional XML data,Tova Milo; Serge Abiteboul; Bernd Amann; Omar Benjelloun; Fred Dang Ngoc,Abstract XML is becoming the universal format for data exchange between applications.Recently; the emergence of Web services as standard means of publishing and accessingdata on the Web introduced a new class of XML documents; which we call intensionaldocuments. These are XML documents where some of the data is given explicitly while otherparts are defined only intensionally by means of embedded calls to Web services. Whensuch documents are exchanged between applications; one has the choice of whether or notto materialize the intensional data (ie; to invoke the embedded calls) before the document issent. This choice may be influenced by various parameters; such as performance andsecurity considerations. This article addresses the problem of guiding this materializationprocess. We argue that---like for regular XML data---schemas (à la DTD and XML …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2005,151,20
Correspondence and translation for heterogeneous data,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Tova Milo,Abstract We presented a specification of the integration of heterogeneous data based oncorrespondence rules. We showed how a unique specification can served many purposes(including two-way translation) assuming some reasonable restrictions. We claim that theframework and restrictions are acceptable in practice; and in particular one can show that allthe document-OODB correspondences/translations of [2; 3] are covered. We are currentlyworking on further substantiating this by more experimentation. When applying the workpresented here a number of issues arise such as the specification of default values whensome information is missing in the translation. A more complex one is the introduction ofsome simple constraints in the model; eg; keys. Another important implementation issue is tochoose between keeping one of the representations virtual vs. materializing both. In …,International Conference on Database Theory,1997,147,15
The Active XML project: an overview,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Tova Milo,Abstract This paper provides an overview of the Active XML project developed at INRIA overthe past five years. Active XML (AXML; for short); is a declarative framework that harnessesWeb services for distributed data management; and is put to work in a peer-to-peerarchitecture. The model is based on AXML documents; which are XML documents that maycontain embedded calls to Web services; and on AXML services; which are Web servicescapable of exchanging AXML documents. An AXML peer is a repository of AXML documentsthat acts both as a client by invoking the embedded service calls; and as a server byproviding AXML services; which are generally defined as queries or updates over thepersistent AXML documents. The approach gracefully combines stored information with datadefined in an intensional manner as well as dynamic information. This simple; rather …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,146,1
Lazy query evaluation for Active XML,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Bogdan Cautis; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Nicoleta Preda,Abstract In this paper; we study query evaluation on Active XML documents (AXML for short);a new generation of XML documents that has recently gained popularity. AXML documentsare XML documents whose content is given partly extensionally; by explicit data elements;and partly intensionally; by embedded calls to Web services; which can be invoked togenerate data. A major challenge in the efficient evaluation of queries over such documentsis to detect which calls may bring data that is relevant for the query execution; and to avoidthe materialization of irrelevant information. The problem is intricate; as service calls may beembedded anywhere in the document; and service invocations possibly return datacontaining calls to new services. Hence; the detection of relevant calls becomes acontinuous process. Also; a good analysis must take the service signatures into …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,133,10
A comparison of labeling schemes for ancestor queries,Haim Kaplan; Tova Milo; Ronen Shabo,Abstract Motivated by a recent application in XML search engines we study the problem oflabeling the nodes of a tree (XML file) such that given the labels of two nodes one candetermine whether one node is an ancestor of the other. We describe several new prefix-based labeling schemes; where an ancestor query roughly amounts to testing whether onelabel is a prefix of the other. We compare our new schemes to a simple interval-basedscheme currently used by search engines; as well as; to schemes with the best theoreticalguarantee on the maximum label length. We performed our experimental evaluation on realXML data and on some families of random trees.,Proceedings of the thirteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2002,132,15
Active Views for Electronic Commerce.,Serge Abiteboul; Bernd Amann; Sophie Cluet; Anat Eyal; Laurent Mignet; Tova Milo,Abstract Electronic commerce is emerging as a major Web-supported application. In thispaper we argue that database technology can; and should; provide the backbone for a widerange of such applications. More precisely; we present here the ActiveViews system; which;relaying on an extensive use of database features including views; active rules (triggers);and enhanced mechanisms for notification; access control and logging/tracing of usersactivities; provides the needed basis for electronic commerce. Based on the emerging XMLstandards (DOM; query languages for XML; etc.); the system offers a novel declarative viewspecification language; describing the relevant data and activities of all actors (eg vendorsand clients) participating in electronic commerce activities. Then; acting as an applicationgenerator; the system generates an actual; possibly customized; Web application that …,VLDB,1999,126,20
Towards tractable algebras for bags,Stéphane Grumbach; Tova Milo,Abstract Bags; ie; sets with duplicates; are often used to implement relations in databasesystems. In this paper; we study the expressive power of algebras for manipulating bags.The algebra we present is a simple extension of the nested relation algebra. Our aim is toinvestigate how the use of bags in the language extends its expressive power and increasesits complexity. We consider two main issues; namely (i) the impact of the depth of bagnesting on the expressive power and (ii) the complexity and the expressive power inducedby the algebraic operations. We show that the bag algebra is more expressive than thenested relation algebra (at all levels of nesting); and that the difference may be subtle. Weestablish a hierarchy based on the structure of algebra expressions. This hierarchy is shownto be highly related to the properties of the powerset operator.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1996,125,7

XML with data values: typechecking revisited,Noga Alon; Tova Milo; Frank Neven; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,Abstract We investigate the typechecking problem for XML queries: statically verifying thatevery answer to a query conforms to a given output DTD; for inputs satisfying a given inputDTD. This problem had been studied by a subset of the authors in a simplified frameworkthat captured the structure of XML documents but ignored data values. We revisit here thetypechecking problem in the more realistic case when data values are present in documentsand tested by queries. In this extended framework; typechecking quickly becomesundecidable. However; it remains decidable for large classes of queries and DTDs ofpractical interest. The main contribution of the present paper is to trace a fairly tight boundaryof decidability for typechecking with data values. The complexity of typechecking in thedecidable cases is also considered.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2003,116,12
Putting lipstick on pig: Enabling database-style workflow provenance,Yael Amsterdamer; Susan B Davidson; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Julia Stoyanovich; Val Tannen,Abstract Workflow provenance typically assumes that each module is a" black-box"; so thateach output depends on all inputs (coarse-grained dependencies). Furthermore; it does notmodel the internal state of a module; which can change between repeated executions. Inpractice; however; an output may depend on only a small subset of the inputs (fine-graineddependencies) as well as on the internal state of the module. We present a novelprovenance framework that marries database-style and workflow-style provenance; by usingPig Latin to expose the functionality of modules; thus capturing internal state and fine-grained dependencies. A critical ingredient in our solution is the use of a novel form ofprovenance graph that models module invocations and yields a compact representation offine-grained workflow provenance. It also enables a number of novel graph …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,115,7
Positive active XML,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Tova Milo,Abstract The increasing popularity of XML and Web services have given rise to a newgeneration of documents; called Active XML documents (AXML); where some of the data isgiven explicitly while other parts are given intensionally; by means of embedded calls toWeb services. Web services in this context can exchange intensional information; usingAXML documents as parameters and results. The goal of this paper is to provide a formalfoundation for this new generation of AXML documents and services; and to studyfundamental issues they raise. We focus on Web services that are (1) monotone and (2)defined declaratively as conjunctive queries over AXML documents. We study the semanticsof documents and queries; the confluence of computations; termination and lazy queryevaluation.,Proceedings of the twenty-third ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2004,108,7
Optimizing queries on files,Mariano P Consens; Tova Milo,Abstract We present a framework which allows the user to access and manipulate datauniformly; regardless of whether it resides in a database or in the file system (or in both). Akey issue is the performance of the system. We show that text indexing; combined with newlydeveloped optimization techniques; can be used to provide an efficient high level interfaceto information stored in files. Furthermore; using these techniques; some queries can beevaluated significantly faster than in standard database implementations. We also study thetradeoff between efficiency and the amount of indexing.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1994,108,7
Using the crowd for top-k and group-by queries,Susan B Davidson; Sanjeev Khanna; Tova Milo; Sudeepa Roy,Abstract Group-by and top-k are fundamental constructs in database queries. However; thecriteria used for grouping and ordering certain types of data--such as unlabeled photosclustered by the same person ordered by age--are difficult to evaluate by machines. Incontrast; these tasks are easy for humans to evaluate and are therefore natural candidatesfor being crowd-sourced. We study the problem of evaluating top-k and group-by queriesusing the crowd to answer either type or value questions. Given two data elements; theanswer to a type question is" yes" if the elements have the same type and therefore belongto the same group or cluster; the answer to a value question orders the two data elements.The assumption here is that there is an underlying ground truth; but that the answersreturned by the crowd may sometimes be erroneous. We formalize the problems of top-k …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Database Theory,2013,101,7
Autocompletion for mashups,Ohad Greenshpan; Tova Milo; Neoklis Polyzotis,Abstract A mashup is a Web application that integrates data; computation and UI elementsprovided by several components into a single tool. The concept originated from theunderstanding that there is an increasing number of applications available on the Web anda growing need to combine them in order to meet user requirements. This paper presentsMatchUp; a system that supports rapid; on-demand; intuitive development of mashups;based on a novel autocompletion mechanism. The key observation guiding thedevelopment of MatchUp is that mashups developed by different users typically sharecommon characteristics; they use similar classes of mashup components and glue themtogether in a similar manner. MatchUp exploits these similarities to recommend usefulcompletions (missing components and connections between them) for a user's partial …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,98,10
Colt: continuous on-line tuning,Karl Schnaitter; Serge Abiteboul; Tova Milo; Neoklis Polyzotis,Abstract The physical schema of a database plays a critical role in performance. Self-tuningis a cost-effective and elegant solution to optimize the physical configuration for thecharacteristics of the query load. Existing techniques operate in an off-line fashion; bychoosing a fixed configuration that is tailored to a subset of the query load. The generatedconfigurations therefore ignore any temporal patterns that may exist in the actual loadsubmitted to the system. This demonstration introduces COLT (Continuous On-Line Tuning);a novel self-tuning framework that continuously monitors the incoming queries and adjuststhe system configuration in order to maximize query performance. The key idea behindCOLT is to gather performance statistics at different levels of detail and to carefully allocateprofiling resources to the most promising candidate configurations. Moreover; COLT uses …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,95,20
Monitoring business processes with queries,Catriel Beeri; Anat Eyal; Tova Milo; Alon Pilberg,Abstract Many enterprises nowadays use business processes; based on the BPEL standard;to achieve their goals. These are complex; often distributed; processes.

BP-Mon (Business Processes Monitoring) is anovel query language for monitoring business processes; that allows users to visually definemonitoring tasks and associated reports; using a simple intuitive interface; similar to thoseused for designing BPEL processes.

Type inference for queries on semistructured data,Tova Milo; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the problem of type checking and type inference for queries oversemistructured data. Introducing a novel traces technique; we show that the problem isdifficult in general (NP-complete); but can be solved in PTIME for many practical cases;including; in particular; queries over XML data. Besides being interesting by itself; we showthat type inference and the related traces technique have several important applications;facilitating query formulation; optimization; and verification.,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,93,2
A signature technique for similarity-based queries,Christos Faloutsos; HV Jagadish; Alberto O Mendelzon; Tova Milo,Jagadish et al.(see Proc. ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART PODS; p. 36-45; 1995) developeda general framework for posing queries based on similarity. The framework enables a formaldefinition of the notion of similarity for an application domain of choice; and then its use inqueries to perform similarity-based search. We adapt this framework to the specializeddomain of real-valued sequences.(Although some of the ideas we present are applicable toother types of data as well). In particular we focus on whole-match queries. By whole-matchquery we mean the case where the user has to specify the whole sequence. Similarity-based search can be computationally very expensive. The computation cost dependsheavily on the length of sequences being compared. To make such similarity testing feasibleon large data sets; we propose the use of a signature based technique.

Tools for data translation and integration,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Tova Milo; Pini Mogilevsky; Jerome Siméon; Sagit Zohar,Abstract A broad spectrum of data is available on the Web in distinct heterogeneoussources; stored under different formats. As the number of systems that utilize this data grows;the importance of data conversion mechanisms increases greatly. We present here anoverview of a French-Israeli research project aimed at developing tools to simplify theintricate task of data translation. The solution is based on a middleware data model to whichvarious data sources are mapped; and a declarative language for specifying translationswithin the middleware model. A complementary schema-based mechanism is used toautomate some of the translation. Some particular aspects of the solution are detailed in [3;7; 10].,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,1999,84,12
Querying network directories,HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Tova Milo; Divesh Srivastava; Dimitra Vista,Abstract Heirarchically structured directories have recently proliferated with the growth of theInternet; and are being used to store not only address books and contact information forpeople; but also personal profiles; network resource information; and network and servicepolicies. These systems provide a means for managing scale and heterogeneity; whileallowing for conceptual unity and autonomy across multiple directory servers in the network;in a way for superior to what conventional relational or object-oriented databases offer. Yet;in deployed systems today; much of the data is modeled in an ad hoc manner; and many ofthe more sophisticated “queries” involve navigational access.

Active xml: A data-centric perspective on web services,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Roger Weber,Summary We propose in this chapter a peer-to-peer architecture that allows for theintegration of distributed data and Web services. It relies on a language; Active XML; wheredocuments embed calls to Web services that are used to enrich them; and new Webservices may be defined by XQuery queries on such active documents. Embedding calls tofunctions or even to Web services inside data is not a new idea. Our contribution; however;is to turn them into a powerful tool for data and services integration. In particular; thelanguage includes linguistic features to control the timing of service call activations. Variousscenarios are captured; such as mediation; data warehousing and distributed computation.A first prototype is also described.,*,2004,78,20
Algebras for querying text regions,Mariano P Consens; Tova Milo,Abstract There is a significant amount of interest in combining and extending database andinformation retrieval technologies to manage textual data. The challenge is becoming morerelevant due to the increased availability of documents in digital form. Document data has anatural hierarchical structure; which may be made explicit due to the use of markupconventions(as it is the case with SGML). An important aspect of managing structured andsemi-structured textual data consists of supporting the efficient retrieval of text componentsbased both on their content and structure. In this paper we study issues related to theexpressive power and optimization of a class of algebras that support combining string(orpattern) searches with queries on the hierarchical structure of the text. The region algebrastudied is a set-at-a-time algebra for manipulating-tezt regions(substrings of the text) that …,Proceedings of the fourteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1995,78,15
Crowd mining,Yael Amsterdamer; Yael Grossman; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Harnessing a crowd of Web users for data collection has recently become a wide-spread phenomenon. A key challenge is that the human knowledge forms an open worldand it is thus difficult to know what kind of information we should be looking for. Classicdatabases have addressed this problem by data mining techniques that identify interestingdata patterns. These techniques; however; are not suitable for the crowd. This is mainly dueto properties of the human memory; such as the tendency to remember simple trends andsummaries rather than exact details. Following these observations; we develop here for thefirst time the foundations of crowd mining. We first define the formal settings. Based on these;we design a framework of generic components; used for choosing the best questions to askthe crowd and mining significant patterns from the answers. We suggest general …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,75,7
A sample-and-clean framework for fast and accurate query processing on dirty data,Jiannan Wang; Sanjay Krishnan; Michael J Franklin; Ken Goldberg; Tim Kraska; Tova Milo,Abstract In emerging Big Data scenarios; obtaining timely; high-quality answers toaggregate queries is difficult due to the challenges of processing and cleaning large; dirtydata sets. To increase the speed of query processing; there has been a resurgence ofinterest in sampling-based approximate query processing (SAQP). In its usual formulation;however; SAQP does not address data cleaning at all; and in fact; exacerbates answerquality problems by introducing sampling error. In this paper; we explore an intriguingopportunity. That is; we explore the use of sampling to actually improve answer quality. Weintroduce the Sample-and-Clean framework; which applies data cleaning to a relativelysmall subset of the data and uses the results of the cleaning process to lessen the impact ofdirty data on aggregate query answers. We derive confidence intervals as a function of …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,62,15
On-line index selection for shifting workloads,Karl Schnaitter; Serge Abiteboul; Tova Milo; Neoklis Polyzotis,Abstract This paper introduces COLT (Continuous On-Line Tuning); a novel framework thatcontinuously monitors the workload of a database system and enriches the existing physicaldesign with a set of effective indices. The key idea behind COLT is to gather performancestatistics at different levels of detail and to carefully allocate profiling resources to the mostpromising candidate configurations. Moreover; COLT uses effective heuristics to self-regulate its own performance; lowering its overhead when the system is well tuned andbeing more aggressive when the workload shifts and it becomes necessary to re-tune thesystem. We describe an implementation of the proposed framework in the PostgreSQLdatabase system and evaluate its performance experimentally. Our results validate theeffectiveness of COLT and demonstrate its ability to modify the system configuration in …,Proceedings of the 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering Workshop,2007,60,10
Diagnosis of asynchronous discrete event systems: datalog to the rescue!,Serge Abiteboul; Zoë Abrams; Stefan Haar; Tova Milo,Abstract We consider query optimization techniques for data intensive P2P applications. Weshow how to adapt an old technique from deductive databases; namely Query-Sub-Query(QSQ); to a setting where autonomous and distributed peers share large volumes ofinterelated data. We illustrate the technique with an important telecommunication problem;the diagnosis of distributed telecom systems. We show that (i) the problem can be modeledusing Datalog programs; and (ii) it can benefit from the large battery of optimizationtechniques developed for Datalog. In particular; we show that a simple generic use of theextension of QSQ achieves an optimization as good as that previously provided bydedicated diagnosis algorithms. Furthermore; we show that it allows solving efficiently amuch larger class of system analysis problems.,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2005,60,1
Short and simple labels for small distances and other functions,Haim Kaplan; Tova Milo,Abstract We present a labeling scheme for rooted trees which allows to compute; from thelabel ofv alone; unique identifiers for the ancestors of v that are at distance at most d from v.For any constant d our labeling scheme produce labels of length logn+ O (√ log n); and ford∈ O (√ log n) the labels are still of length O (logn). In particular; given the labels of twonodes u and v we can determine from the labels alone whether u is the parent of v or viceversa; whether u and v are siblings; and whether u and v are at distance at most d from eachother. The need for such labeling scheme arises in several application areas; including inparticular communication networks and search engines for large collections of Web XMLfiles. In the latter application XML files are viewed as trees; and typical queries ask for XMLfiles containing a particular set of nodes with specific ancestor; parent; or sibling …,Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures,2001,60,20
Modeling the mashup space,Serge Abiteboul; Ohad Greenshpan; Tova Milo,Abstract We introduce a formal model for capturing the notion of mashup in its globality. Thebasic component in our model is the mashlet. A mashlet may query data sources; importother mashlets; use external Web services; and specify complex interaction patternsbetween its components. A mashlet state is modeled by a set of relations and its logicspecified by datalog-style active rules. We are primarily concerned with changes in amashlet state relations and rules. The interactions with users and other applications; as wellas the consequent effects on the mashlets composition and behavior; are captured bystreams of changes. The model facilitates dynamic mashlets composition; interaction andreuse; and captures the fundamental behavioral aspects of mashups.,Proceedings of the 10th ACM workshop on Web information and data management,2008,59,10
Boosting topic-based publish-subscribe systems with dynamic clustering,Tova Milo; Tal Zur; Elad Verbin,Abstract We consider in this paper a class of Publish-Subscribe (pub-sub) systems calledtopic-based systems; where users subscribe to topics and are notified on events that belongto those subscribed topics. With the recent flourishing of RSS news syndication; thesesystems are regaining popularity and are raising new challenging problems. In most of themodern topics-based systems; the events in each topic are delivered to the subscribers via asupporting; distributed; data structure (typically a multicast tree). Since peers in the networkmay come and go frequently; this supporting structure must be continuously maintained sothat" holes" do not disrupt the events delivery. The dissemination of events in each topic thusincurs two main costs:(1) the actual transmission cost for the topic events; and (2) themaintenance cost for its supporting structure. This maintenance overhead becomes …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,59,7
A database interface for file update,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Tova Milo,Abstract Database systems are concerned with structured data. Unfortunately; data is stilloften available in an unstructured manner (eg; in files) even when it does have a stronginternal structure (eg; electronic documents or programs). In a previous paper [2]; wefocussed on the use of high-level query languages to access such files and developedoptimization techniques to do so. In this paper; we consider how structured data stored infiles can be updated using database update languages. The interest of using databaselanguages to manipulate files is twofold. First; it opens database systems to< i> external</i>data. This concerns data residing in files or data transiting on communication channels andpossibly coming from other databases [2]. Secondly; it provides high level query/updatefacilities to systems that usually rely on very primitive linguistic support.(See [6] for recent …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,58,15
Asking the right questions in crowd data sourcing,Rubi Boim; Ohad Greenshpan; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Neoklis Polyzotis; Wang-Chiew Tan,Crowd-based data sourcing is a new and powerful data procurement paradigm thatengages Web users to collectively contribute information. In this work; we target the problemof gathering data from the crowd in an economical and principled fashion. We present AskIt!; a system that allows interactive data sourcing applications to effectively determine whichquestions should be directed to which users for reducing the uncertainty about the collecteddata. Ask It! uses a set of novel algorithms for minimizing the number of probing (questions)required from the different users. We demonstrate the challenge and our solution in thecontext of a multiple-choice question game played by the ICDE'12 attendees; targeted togather information on the conference's publications; authors and colleagues.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,56,1
Provenance views for module privacy,Susan B Davidson; Sanjeev Khanna; Tova Milo; Debmalya Panigrahi; Sudeepa Roy,Abstract Scientific workflow systems increasingly store provenance information about themodule executions used to produce a data item; as well as the parameter settings andintermediate data items passed between module executions. However; authors/owners ofworkflows may wish to keep some of this information confidential. In particular; a modulemay be proprietary; and users should not be able to infer its behavior by seeing mappingsbetween all data inputs and outputs. The problem we address in this paper is the following:Given a workflow; abstractly modeled by a relation R; a privacy requirement? and costsassociated with data. The owner of the workflow decides which data (attributes) to hide; andprovides the user with a view R'which is the projection of R over attributes which have notbeen hidden. The goal is to minimize the cost of hidden data while guaranteeing that …,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,52,20
Typechecking XML views of relational databases,Noga Alon; Tova Milo; Frank Neven; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,Abstract Motivated by the need to export relational databases as XML data in the context ofthe Web; we investigate the typechecking problem for transformations of relational data intotree data (XML). The problem consists of statically verifying that the output of everytransformation belongs to a given output tree language (specified for XML by a DTD); forinput databases satisfying given integrity constraints. The typechecking problem isparameterized by the class of formulas defining the transformation; the class of output treelanguages; and the class of integrity constraints. While undecidable in its most generalformulation; the typechecking problem has many special cases of practical interest that turnout to be decidable. The main contribution of this article is to trace a fairly tight boundary ofdecidability for typechecking in this framework. In the decidable cases we examine the …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2003,52,5
Web services and data integration,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Tova Milo,Abstract The developments of XML [4] and Web services [3] are changing radically the art ofdata integration. We briefly describe Web services and consider some of their impact ondata integration. We argue that XML and Web services provide the proper infrastructure fordata integration at the Web scale. This is illustrated by some work going on at INRIA onActive XML; that is XML extended by allowing the embedding of calls to Web services.,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2002. WISE 2002.

Diversification and refinement in collaborative filtering recommender,Rubi Boim; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov,Abstract This paper considers a popular class of recommender systems that are based onCollaborative Filtering (CF) and proposes a novel technique for diversifying therecommendations that they give to users. Items are clustered based on a unique notion ofpriority-medoids that provides a natural balance between the need to present highly rankeditems vs. highly diverse ones. Our solution estimates items diversity by comparing therankings that different users gave to the items; thereby enabling diversification even incommon scenarios where no semantic information on the items is available. It also providesa natural zoom-in mechanism to focus on items (clusters) of interest and recommendingdiversified similar items. We present DiRec a plug-in that implements the above conceptsand allows CF Recommender systems to diversify their recommendations.

Correspondence and translation for heterogeneous data,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Tova Milo,Abstract Data integration often requires a clean abstraction of the different formats in whichdata are stored; and means for specifying the correspondences/relationships between datain different worlds and for translating data from one world to another. For that; we introducein this paper a middleware data model that serves as a basis for the integration task; and adeclarative rules language for specifying the integration. We show that using the language;correspondences between data elements can be computed in polynomial time in manycases; and may require exponential time only when insensitivity to order or duplicates areconsidered. Furthermore; we show that in most practical cases the correspondence rulescan be automatically turned into translation rules to map data from one representation toanother. Thus; a complete integration task (derivation of correspondences; transformation …,Theoretical Computer Science,2002,45,4
Displaying data in multidimensional relevance space with 2D visualization maps,Jackie Assa; Daniel Cohen-Or; Tova Milo,Abstract This paper introduces a tool for visualizing a multidimensional mlevance space;Abstractly; the information to be displayed consists of a large number of objects; a set offeatures that ate likely to be of interest to the user; and some function that measures therelevance level of every object to the various features. The goal is to provide the user with aconcise and comprehensible visualization of that information. For the type of applications weconcentrate on; the exact relevance measures of the objects am not significant Thii enablesaccuracy to be traded for a clearer display. The idea is to “flatten” the multidimensionality ofthe featuw space into a 2D “relevance map”; capturing the inter-relations among thefeatures; without causing too many ambiguous interpretations of the results. To better reflectthe nature of the data and to n? solve the ambiguity we refine the given set of features …,Proceedings of the 8th conference on Visualization'97,1997,42,15
An algebra for POMSETS,Stephane Grumbach; Tova Milo,Abstract We study languages for manipulating partially ordered structures with duplicates(eg trees; lists). As a general framework; we consider the pomset (partially ordered multiset)datatype. We introduce an algebra for pomsets; which generalizes traditional algebras for(nested) sets; bags and lists. This paper is motivated by the study of the impact of differentlanguage primitives on the expressive power. We show that the use of partially orderedtypes increases the expressive power significantly. Surprisingly; it turns out that the algebrawhen restricted to both unordered (bags) and totally ordered (lists) intermediate types; yieldsthe same expressive power as fixpoint logic with counting on relational databases. Ittherefore constitutes a rather robust class of relational queries. On the other hand; we obtaina characterization of PTIME queries on lists by considering only totally ordered types.,International Conference on Database Theory,1995,40,7
A logical view of structured files,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Tova Milo,Abstract. Structured data stored in files can benefit from standard database technology. Inparticular; we show here how such data can be queried and updated using declarativedatabase languages. We introduce the notion of structuring schema; which consists of agrammar annotated with database programs. Based on a structuring schema; a file can beviewed as a database structure; queried and updated as such. For queries; we show thatalmost standard database optimization techniques can be used to answer queries withouthaving to construct the entire database. For updates; we study in depth the propagation tothe file of an update specified on the database view of this file. The problem is not feasible ingeneral and we present a number of negative results. The positive results consist oftechniques that allow to propagate updates efficiently under some reasonable locality …,The VLDB Journal,1998,37,20
Algebras for querying text regions: Expressive power and optimization,Mariano P Consens; Tova Milo,Abstract There is a significant amount of interest in combining and extending database andinformation retrieval technologies to manage textual data. The challenge is becoming morerelevant due to increased availability of documents in digital form. Document data has anatural hierarchical structure; which may be made explicit due to the use of markupconventions (as with SGML). An important aspect of managing structured andsemistructured textual data consists of supporting the efficient retrieval of text componentsbased both on their content and on their structure. In this paper we study issues related tothe expressive power and optimization of a class of algebras that support combining string(or pattern) searches with queries on the hierarchical structure of the text.

Views in a large-scale XML repository,Vincent Aguilera; Sophie Cluet; Tova Milo; Pierangelo Veltri; Dan Vodislav,Abstract. We are interested in defining and querying views in a huge and highlyheterogeneous XML repository (Web scale). In this context; view definitions are very large;involving lots of sources; and there is no apparent limitation to their size. This raisesinteresting problems that we address in the paper:(i) how to distribute views over severalmachines without having a negative impact on the query translation process;(ii) how toquickly select the relevant part of a view given a query;(iii) how to minimize the cost ofcommunicating potentially large queries to the machines where they will be evaluated. Thesolution that we propose is based on a simple view definition language that allows forautomatic generation of views. The language maps paths in the view abstract DTD to pathsin the concrete source DTDs. It enables a distributed implementation of the view system …,the VLDB Journal,2002,35,8
Using the doubling dimension to analyze the generalization of learning algorithms,Nader H Bshouty; Yi Li; Philip M Long,Abstract Given a set F of classifiers and a probability distribution over their domain; one candefine a metric by taking the distance between a pair of classifiers to be the probability thatthey classify a random item differently. We prove bounds on the sample complexity of PAClearning in terms of the doubling dimension of this metric. These bounds imply knownbounds on the sample complexity of learning halfspaces with respect to the uniformdistribution that are optimal up to a constant factor. We then prove a bound that holds for anyalgorithm that outputs a classifier with zero error whenever this is possible; this bound is interms of the maximum of the doubling dimension and the VC-dimension of F andstrengthens the best known bound in terms of the VC-dimension alone. Finally; we show thatthere is no bound on the doubling dimension of halfspaces in R n in terms of n that holds …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2009,34,2

Each tool can beused in a stand-alone mode; in combination with the other tools; or even in conjunction withother systems.

Circuits for Datalog Provenance.,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Sudeepa Roy; Val Tannen,ABSTRACT The annotation of the results of database queries with provenance informationhas many applications. This paper studies provenance for datalog queries. We start byconsidering provenance representation by (positive) Boolean expressions; as pioneered inthe theories of incomplete and probabilistic databases. We show that even for linear datalogprograms the representation of provenance using Boolean expressions incurs a super-polynomial size blowup in data complexity. We address this with an approach that is novel inprovenance studies; showing that we can construct in PTIME poly-size (data complexity)provenance representations as Boolean circuits. Then we present optimization techniquesthat embed the construction of circuits into seminaive datalog evaluation; and further reducethe size of the circuits. We also illustrate the usefulness of our approach in multiple …,ICDT,2014,32,5
On provenance minimization,Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Val Tannen,Abstract Provenance information has been proved to be very effective in capturing thecomputational process performed by queries; and has been used extensively as the input tomany advanced data management tools (eg; view maintenance; trust assessment; or queryanswering in probabilistic databases). We observe here that while different (set-) equivalentqueries may admit different provenance expressions when evaluated on the samedatabase; there is always some part of these expressions that is common to all. We refer tothis part as the core provenance. In addition to being informative; the core provenance isalso useful as a compact input to the aforementioned data management tools. We formallydefine the notion of core provenance. We study algorithms that; given a query; compute anequivalent (called p-minimal) query that for every input database; the provenance of …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,32,2

In such systems; repositories of workflowspecifications and of provenance graphs that represent their executions will be madeavailable as part of scientific information sharing. This will allow users to search and queryboth workflow specifications and their provenance graphs: Scientists who wish to performnew analyses may search workflow repositories to find specifications of interest to reuse ormodify. They may also search provenance information to understand the meaning of aworkflow; or to debug a specification.

Functional and predictive programming in OODB's,Catriel Beeri; Tova Milo,The object oriented paradigm offers a rich set of data structuring and manipulation facilities.Object oriented data models generalize the nested relations/complex object models; thatsupport the construction of complex values using trqde; set and other constructors; andthose that support ADT definitions[2; 3; 4; 9; 10; 17; 20]. Recently; much attention is paid todeclarative languages for these models. The relational model supports three querylanguage paradigms: algebra; calculus and logic programming. These have been extendedin the late 80's to the nested relations/complex object models; by adding operations andpredicates for dealing with sets (such as zc S) and new algebraic operations such as nest;unnest; powerset[1]. Extensions of these paradigms to full object-oriented models are nowbeing investigated[6; 13; 16].

Querying structural and behavioral properties of business processes,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract BPQL is a novel query language for querying business process specifications;introduced recently in [5; 6]. It is based on an intuitive model of business processes asrewriting systems; an abstraction of the emerging BPEL (Business Process ExecutionLanguage) standard [7]. BPQL allows users to query business processes visually; in amanner very analogous to the language used to specify the processes. The goal of thepresent paper is to study the formal model underlying BPQL and investigate its properties aswell as the complexity of query evaluation. We also study its relationship to previouslysuggested formalisms for process modeling and querying. In particular we propose a queryevaluation algorithm of polynomial data complexity that can be applied uniformly to querieson the structure of the process specification as well as on the potential behavior of the …,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,2007,28,7

Query-based monitoring of BPEL business processes,Catriel Beeri; Anat Eyal; Tova Milo; Alon Pilberg,A Business Process (BP for short) consists of a group of business activities undertaken byone or more organizations in pursuit of some particular goal. It often interacts with other BPscarried by the same or other organizations; and the software implementing it is fairlycomplex. Standards facilitate the design; deployment; and execution of BPs. In particular; therecent BPEL standard (Business Process Execution Language [3]); provides an XML-basedlanguage to describe the interface between the participants in a process; as well as the fulloperational logic of the process and its execution flow. BPEL specifications are automaticallycompiled into executable code that implements the described BP and runs on a BPELapplication server.

Here; data analysts aretypically interested only in task-specific views of the data; and they expect to be able tointeractively manipulate the data in a natural and seamless way—possibly on a phone ortablet; and possibly via a spreadsheet or similar interface without having to carry the fullmachinery of a DBMS.

This demo presents MatchUp; a system thatsupports rapid; on-demand; intuitive development of mashups; based on a novelautocompletion mechanism. The key observation guiding the development of MatchUp isthat mashups developed by different users typically share common characteristics; they usesimilar classes of mashup components and glue them together in a similar manner.MatchUp exploits these similarities to predict; given a user's partial mashup specification;what are the most likely potential completions (missing components and connection …,Data Engineering; 2009.

Object migration may introduce typing conflicts due to the differenttyping constraints imposed by the classes. We present a coercion-like adaptation processthat automatically resolves these conflicts. The process combines re-classification of objectsand modification of attributes.

On probabilistic fixpoint and markov chain query languages,Daniel Deutch; Christoph Koch; Tova Milo,Abstract We study highly expressive query languages such as datalog; fixpoint; and while-languages on probabilistic databases. We generalize these languages such thatcomputation steps (eg datalog rules) can fire probabilistically. We define two possiblesemantics for such query languages; namely inflationary semantics where the results ofeach computation step are added to the current database and noninflationary queries thatinduce a random walk in-between database instances. We then study the complexity ofexact and approximate query evaluation under these semantics.,Proceedings of the twenty-ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2010,23,7
Reasoning about XML update constraints,Bogdan Cautis; Serge Abiteboul; Tova Milo,Abstract We introduce in this paper a class of constraints for describing how an XMLdocument can evolve; namely XML update constraints. For these constraints; we study theimplication problem; giving algorithms and complexity results for constraints of varyingexpressive power. Besides classical constraint implication; we also consider an instance-based approach in which we take into account data. More precisely; we study implicationwith respect to a current tree instance; resulting from a series of unknown updates. The mainmotivation of our work is reasoning about data integrity under update restrictions in contextswhere owners may lose control over their data; such as in publishing or exchange.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2009,23,7
BP-Mon: query-based monitoring of BPEL business processes,Catriel Beeri; Anat Eyal; Tova Milo; Alon Pilberg,Abstract A Business Process (BP for short) consists of some business activities undertakenby one or more organizations in pursuit of some particular goal. It often interacts with otherBPs of the same or other organizations and the software implementing it is rather complex.Two complementary instruments facilitate the design; development; and management of thiscomplex software. The first is the use of standards. In particular; the recent BPEL standard(Business Process Execution Language [5]) provides an XML-based language to describethe operational logic and execution flow of the BP; as well as the interfaces it exposes toother BPs. A BP specification written in BPEL can be automatically compiled into an actualcode that implements the BP; and can be executed on a BPEL server. The secondinstrument is the use of supporting BP management tools for (1) designing the BP BPEL …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2008,23,14
Querying the world wide web,Alberto O Mendelzon George A Mihaila; Tova Milo,Abstract The World Wide Web is a large; heterogeneous; distributed collection of documentsconnected by hypertext links. The most common technology currently used for searching theWeb depends on sending information retrieval requests to" index servers" that index asmany documents as they can find by navigating the network. One problem with this is thatusers must be aware of the various index servers (over a dozen of them are currentlydeployed on the Web); of their strengths and weaknesses; and of the peculiarities of theirquery interfaces. A more serious problem is that these queries cannot exploit the structureand topology of the document network. In this paper we propose a query language;WebSQL; that takes advantage of multiple index servers without requiring users to knowabout them; and that integrates textual retrieval with structure and topology-based queries …,Proc.

Type inference and type checking for queries on execution traces,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract This paper studies; for the first time; the management of type information for animportant class of semi-structured data: nested DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) thatdescribe execution traces of business processes (BPs for short). Specifically; we considerhere type inference and type checking for queries over BP execution traces. The queries thatwe consider select portions of the traces that are of interest to the user; the types describethe possible shape of the execution traces in the input/output of the query. We formallydefine and characterize here three common classes of BP execution traces and theirrespective notions of type inference and type checking. We study the complexity of the twoproblems for query languages of varying expressive power and present efficient typeinference/checking algorithms whenever possible. Our analysis offers a nearly complete …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,22,22
Regular rewriting of active XML and unambiguity,Serge Abiteboul; Tova Milo; Omar Benjelloun,Abstract We consider here the exchange of Active XML (AXML) data; ie; XML documentswhere some of the data is given explicitly while other parts are given only intensionally ascalls to Web services. Peers exchanging AXML data agree on a data exchange schema thatspecifies in particular which parts of the data are allowed to be intensional. Before sending adocument; a peer may need to rewrite it to match the agreed data exchange schema; bycalling some of the services and materializing their data. Previous works showed that therewriting problem is undecidable in the general case and of high complexity in somerestricted cases. We argue here that this difficulty is somewhat artificial. Indeed; we studywhat we believe to be a more adequate; from a practical view point; rewriting problem that is(1) in the spirit of standard 1-unambiguity constraints imposed on XML schema and (2) …,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2005,22,7
On the complexity of mining itemsets from the crowd using taxonomies,Antoine Amarilli; Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo,Abstract: We study the problem of frequent itemset mining in domains where data is notrecorded in a conventional database but only exists in human knowledge. We provideexamples of such scenarios; and present a crowdsourcing model for them. The model usesthe crowd as an oracle to find out whether an itemset is frequent or not; and relies on aknown taxonomy of the item domain to guide the search for frequent itemsets. In the spirit ofdata mining with oracles; we analyze the complexity of this problem in terms of (i) crowdcomplexity; that measures the number of crowd questions required to identify the frequentitemsets; and (ii) computational complexity; that measures the computational effort requiredto choose the questions. We provide lower and upper complexity bounds in terms of the sizeand structure of the input taxonomy; as well as the size of a concise description of the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3248,2013,21,20
Managing distributed workspaces with active XML,Serge Abiteboul; Jérôme Baumgarten; Angela Bonifati; Gregory Cobena; Cosmin Cremarenco; Florin Dragan; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Nicoleta Preda,1 Introduction The tremendous evolution of the Web has brought the need for platformsallowing to easily deploy distributed data management applications. The current trend goestowards the de-centralization of such platforms; and in particular to peer-to-peerarchitectures. In this spirit; the Active XML system [1; 2; 3; 7](AXML; for short) provides a peer-to-peer data integration platform; based on Web standards such as XML; and Web services[8]. The system is centered around AXML documents: XML documents where parts of thecontent is explicit XML data; whereas other parts are dynamically generated by calls to Webservices on the same or on other peers. By including Web service calls; AXML documentsalready have an inherent form of distributed computation. A higher level of distribution thatalso allows (fragments of) AXML documents and (some of the) Web services that they use …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,21,7

Evaluating top-k queries over business processes,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,A Business Process (BP) consists of some business activities undertaken by one or moreorganizations in pursuit of some business goal. Tools for querying and analyzing BPspecifications are extremely valuable for companies as they allow to optimize the BP;identify potential problems; and reduce operational costs. In particular; given a BPspecification; identifying the top-k execution flows that are most likely to occur in practice outof those satisfying the query criteria; is crucial for various applications. To address this need;we introduce in this paper the notion of {\em likelihood} for BP execution flows; and study top-k query evaluation (finding the $ k $ most likely matches) for queries over BP specifications.We analyze the complexity of query evaluation in this context and present novel algorithmsfor computing top-k query results. To our knowledge; this is the first paper that studies …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,19,20
Skyline queries with noisy comparisons,Benoit Groz; Tova Milo,Abstract We study in this paper the computation of skyline queries-a popular tool formulticriteria data analysis-in the presence of noisy input. Motivated by crowdsourcingapplications; we present the first algorithms for skyline evaluation in a computation modelwhere the input data items can only be compared through noisy comparisons. In this modelcomparisons may return wrong answers with some probability; and confidence can beincreased through independent repetitions of a comparison. Our goal is to minimize thenumber of comparisons required for computing or verifying a candidate skyline; whilereturning the correct answer with high probability. We design output-sensitive algorithms;namely algorithms that take advantage of the potentially small size of the skyline; andanalyze the number of comparison rounds of our solutions. We also consider the problem …,Proceedings of the 34th acm sigmod-sigact-sigai symposium on principles of database systems,2015,18,7
Deriving probabilistic databases with inference ensembles,Julia Stoyanovich; Susan Davidson; Tova Milo; Val Tannen,Many real-world applications deal with uncertain or missing data; prompting a surge ofactivity in the area of probabilistic databases. A shortcoming of prior work is the assumptionthat an appropriate probabilistic model; along with the necessary probability distributions; isgiven. We address this shortcoming by presenting a framework for learning a set ofinference ensembles; termed meta-rule semi-lattices; or MRSL; from the complete portion ofthe data. We use the MRSL to infer probability distributions for missing data; anddemonstrate experimentally that high accuracy is achieved when a single attribute value ismissing per tuple. We next propose an inference algorithm based on Gibbs sampling thataccurately predicts the probability distribution for multiple missing values. We also developan optimization that greatly improves performance of multi-attribute inference for …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,18,7
Top-k projection queries for probabilistic business processes,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract A Business Process (BP) consists of some business activities undertaken by one ormore organizations in pursuit of some business goal. Tools for querying and analyzing BPspecifications are extremely valuable for companies. In particular; given a BP specification;identifying the top-k flows that are most likely to occur in practice; out of those satisfying agiven query criteria; is crucial for various applications such as personalized advertizementand BP web-site design. This paper studies; for the first time; top-k query evaluation forqueries with projection in this context. We analyze the complexity of the problem for differentclasses of distribution functions for the flows likelihood; and provide efficient (PTIME)algorithms whenever possible.

Calculi for bags and their complexity,Stephane Grumbach; Tova Milo; Yoram Kornatzky,Abstract In this paper; we propose calculi to express queries over bags (ie multisets); andstudy their complexity. We show that the calculus for bags is undecidable in general.Nevertheless; simple syntactic restrictions on the calculus result in computable languages.We provide here two restricted calculi with bounded complexity; and show that therestrictions are minimal. Indeed; any looser restriction leads to non computable queries.,*,1994,18,7
Uncertainty in crowd data sourcing under structural constraints,Antoine Amarilli; Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo,Abstract Applications extracting data from crowdsourcing platforms must deal with theuncertainty of crowd answers in two different ways: first; by deriving estimates of the correctvalue from the answers; second; by choosing crowd questions whose answers are expectedto minimize this uncertainty relative to the overall data collection goal. Such problems arealready challenging when we assume that questions are unrelated and answers areindependent; but they are even more complicated when we assume that the unknownvalues follow hard structural constraints (such as monotonicity). In this vision paper; weexamine how to formally address this issue with an approach inspired by [2]. We describe ageneralized setting where we model constraints as linear inequalities; and use them toguide the choice of crowd questions and the processing of answers. We present the main …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,16,7
CrowdMiner: Mining association rules from the crowd,Yael Amsterdamer; Yael Grossman; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract This demo presents CrowdMiner; a system enabling the mining of interesting datapatterns from the crowd. While traditional data mining techniques have been usedextensively for finding patterns in classic databases; they are not always suitable for thecrowd; mainly because humans tend to remember only simple trends and summaries ratherthan exact details. To address this; CrowdMiner employs a novel crowd-mining algorithm;designed specifically for this context. The algorithm iteratively chooses appropriatequestions to ask the crowd; while aiming to maximize the knowledge gain at each step. Wedemonstrate CrowdMiner through a Well-Being portal; constructed interactively by miningthe crowd; and in particular the conference participants; for common health related practicesand trends.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,16,10
Declarative platform for data sourcing games,Daniel Deutch; Ohad Greenshpan; Boris Kostenko; Tova Milo,Abstract Harnessing a crowd of users for the collection of mass data (data sourcing) hasrecently become a wide-spread practice. One effective technique is based on games as atool that attracts the crowd to contribute useful facts. We focus here on the data managementlayer of such games; and observe that the development of this layer involves challengessuch as dealing with probabilistic data; combined with recursive manipulation of this data.These challenges are difficult to address using current declarative data managementframework works; and we thus propose here a novel such framework; and demonstrate itsusefulness in expressing different aspects in the data management of Trivia-like games. Wehave implemented a system prototype with our novel data management framework at itscore; and we highlight key issues in the system design; as well as our experimentations …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,16,22
A quest for beauty and wealth (or; business processes for database researchers),Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract While classic data management focuses on the data itself; research on BusinessProcesses considers also the context in which this data is generated and manipulated;namely the processes; the users; and the goals that this data serves. This allows theanalysts a better perspective of the organizational needs centered around the data. As such;this research is of fundamental importance. Much of the success of database systems in thelast decade is due to the beauty and elegance of the relational model and its declarativequery languages; combined with a rich spectrum of underlying evaluation and optimizationtechniques; and efficient implementations. This; in turn; has lead to an economic wealth forboth the users and vendors of database systems. Similar beauty and wealth are sought for inthe context of Business Processes. Much like the case for traditional database research …,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,16,15

-Schema-driven Customization of Web Services,Serge Abiteboul; J Baumgarten; Omar Benjelloun; F Dang Ngoc; Tova Milo; B Amann,This chapter discusses schema-driven customization of Web services. Web services areemerging as a standard mean of publishing and accessing data on the Web; by providing astandard XML-based protocol to invoke remote programs over the Web (simple objectaccess protocol (SOAP)); along with a standard language to describe them (web servicedescription language (WSDL)). XML is becoming the universal format for data exchangebetween applications. Recently; the use of XML documents; where some of the data is givenexplicitly; while other parts are defined by programs that generate the relevant data; startedgaining popularity. This chapter refers to such documents as intensional documents.Materialization is the process of invoking some of the programs included in an XMLdocument and replacing them by their results.

Query-oriented data cleaning with oracles,Moria Bergman; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract As key decisions are often made based on information contained in a database; it isimportant for the database to be as complete and correct as possible. For this reason; manydata cleaning tools have been developed to automatically resolve inconsistencies indatabases. However; data cleaning tools provide only best-effort results and usually cannoteradicate all errors that may exist in a database. Even more importantly; existing datacleaning tools do not typically address the problem of determining what information ismissing from a database. To overcome the limitations of existing data cleaning techniques;we present QOCO; a novel query-oriented system for cleaning data with oracles. Under thisframework; incorrect (resp. missing) tuples are removed from (added to) the result of a querythrough edits that are applied to the underlying database; where the edits are derived by …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,15,7
Labeling workflow views with fine-grained dependencies,Zhuowei Bao; Susan B Davidson; Tova Milo,Abstract This paper considers the problem of efficiently answering reachability queries overviews of provenance graphs; derived from executions of workflows that may includerecursion. Such views include composite modules and model fine-grained dependenciesbetween module inputs and outputs. A novel view-adaptive dynamic labeling scheme isdeveloped for efficient query evaluation; in which view specifications are labeled statically(ie as they are created) and data items are labeled dynamically as they are produced duringa workflow execution. Although the combination of fine-grained dependencies and recursiveworkflows entail; in general; long (linear-size) data labels; we show that for a large naturalclass of workflows and views; labels are compact (logarithmic-size) and reachability queriescan be evaluated in constant time. Experimental results demonstrate the benefit of this …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,14,7
Top-k and clustering with noisy comparisons,Susan Davidson; Sanjeev Khanna; Tova Milo; Sudeepa Roy,Abstract We study the problems of max/top-k and clustering when the comparisonoperations may be performed by oracles whose answer may be erroneous. Comparisonsmay either be of type or of value: given two data elements; the answer to a type comparisonis “yes” if the elements have the same type and therefore belong to the same group (cluster);the answer to a value comparison orders the two data elements. We give efficient algorithmsthat are guaranteed to achieve correct results with high probability; analyze the cost of thesealgorithms in terms of the total number of comparisons (ie; using a fixed-cost model); andshow that they are essentially the best possible. We also show that fewer comparisons areneeded when values and types are correlated; or when the error model is one in which theerror decreases as the distance between the two elements in the sorted order increases …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,13,20
Labeling recursive workflow executions on-the-fly,Zhuowei Bao; Susan B Davidson; Tova Milo,Abstract This paper presents a compact labeling scheme for answering reachability queriesover workflow executions. In contrast to previous work; our scheme allows nodes (processesand data) in the execution graph to be labeled on-the-fly; ie; in a dynamic fashion. In thisway; reachability queries can be answered as soon as the relevant data is produced. Wefirst show that; in general; for workflows that contain recursion; dynamic labeling ofexecutions requires long (linear-size) labels. Fortunately; most real-life scientific workflowsare linear recursive; and for this natural class we show that dynamic; yet compact(logarithmic-size) labeling is possible. Moreover; our scheme labels the executions in lineartime; and answers any reachability query in constant time. We also show that linearrecursive workflows are; in some sense; the largest class of workflows that allow compact …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,13,7
Using markov chain monte carlo to play trivia,Daniel Deutch; Ohad Greenshpan; Boris Kostenko; Tova Milo,We introduce in this Demonstration a system called Trivia Masster that generates a verylarge Database of facts in a variety of topics; and uses it for question answering. The factsare collected from human users (the “crowd”); the system motivates users to contribute to theDatabase by using a Trivia Game; where users gain points based on their contribution. Akey challenge here is to provide a suitable Data Cleaning mechanism that allows to identifywhich of the facts (answers to Trivia questions) submitted by users are indeedcorrect/reliable; and consequently how many points to grant users; how to answer questionsbased on the collected data; and which questions to present to the Trivia players; in order toimprove the data quality. As no existing single Data Cleaning technique provides asatisfactory solution to this challenge; we propose here a novel approach; based on a …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,13,7
An algebra for pomsets,Stéphane Grumbach; Tova Milo,Abstract We study languages for manipulatingpartially orderedstructures withduplicates (eg;trees; lists). As a general framework; we consider thepomset (partially ordered multiset) datatype. We introduce an algebra forpomsets; which generalizes traditional algebras for(nested) sets; bags; and lists. This paper is motivated by the study of the impact of differentlanguage primitives on the expressive power. We show that the use of partially orderedtypes increases the expressive power significantly. Surprisingly; it turns out that the algebrawhen restricted to both unordered (bags) and totally ordered (lists) intermediate types; yieldsthe same expressive power as fixpoint logic with counting on relational databases. Ittherefore constitutes a rather robust class of relational queries. On the other hand; we obtaina characterization of PTIME queries on lists by considering only totally ordered types.,Information and Computation,1999,13,7
On the power of algebras with recursion,Catriel Beeri; Tova Milo,Abstract We consider the relationship between the deductive and the functional/algebraicquery language paradigms. Previous works considered this subject for a non-recursivealgebra; or an algebra with a fixed point operation; and the corresponding class of deductivequeries is that defined by stratified programs. We consider here algebraic languagesextended by general recursive definitions. We also consider languages that allow non-restricted use of negation. It turns out that recursion and negation in the algebraic paradigmneed to be studied together. The semantics used for the comparison is the valid semantics;although other well-known declarative semantics can also be used to derive similar results.We show that the class of queries expressed by general deduction with negation can becaptured using algebra with recursive definitions.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1993,13,3
Subtyping in OODB's,Catriel Beeri; Tova Milo,Object-oriented databases(OODB'S) are now the subject of intense research anddevelopment efforts. The motivation for this interest is that the object-oriented paradigmoffers a rich set of data structuring and manipulation facilities; and it is believed that thesemake it ideally suited for supporting both new and existing types of applications[1; 2; 3].Informally; an 00DB supports all or most of the following features: Atomic values such asintegers and characters are built into the system. Composite; complex; values can beconstructed from atomic and other complex values. Many systems use for that constructorssuch as set; tuple; and array. A more general approach is to allow arbitrary construction ofADT's. In addition to values; a notion of object is supported. An object has an identity that isunique(different from that of any other object). It also has a state; that may be an atomic or …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1991,13,7
Direc: Diversified recommendations for semantic-less collaborative filtering,Rubi Boim; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov,In this demo we present DiRec; a plug-in that allows Collaborative Filtering (CF)Recommender systems to diversify the recommendations that they present to users. DiRecestimates items diversity by comparing the rankings that different users gave to the items;thereby enabling diversification even in common scenarios where no semantic informationon the items is available. Items are clustered based on a novel notion of priority-medoidsthat provides a natural balance between the need to present highly ranked items vs. highlydiverse ones. We demonstrate the operation of DiRec in the context of a movierecommendation system. We show the advantage of recommendation diversification and itsfeasibility even in the absence of semantic information.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,12,20

A Model for Fine-Grained Data Citation.,Susan B Davidson; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Gianmaria Silvello,ABSTRACT An increasing amount of information is being collected in structured; evolving;curated databases; driving the question of how information extracted from such datasets viaqueries should be cited. Unlike traditional research products; such books and journals;which have a fixed granularity; data citation is a challenge because the granularity varies.Different portions of the database; with varying granularity; may have different citations.Furthermore; there are an infinite number of queries over a database; each accessing andgenerating different subsets of the database; so we cannot hope to explicitly attach a citationto every possible result set and/or query. We present the novel problem of automaticallygenerating citations for general queries over a relational database; and explore a solutionbased on a set of citation views; each of which attaches a citation to a view of the …,CIDR,2017,11,7
SampleClean: Fast and Reliable Analytics on Dirty Data.,Sanjay Krishnan; Jiannan Wang; Michael J Franklin; Ken Goldberg; Tim Kraska; Tova Milo; Eugene Wu,Abstract An important obstacle to accurate data analytics is dirty data in the form of missing;duplicate; incorrect; or inconsistent values. In the SampleClean project; we have developeda new suite of techniques to estimate the results of queries when only a sample of data canbe cleaned. Some forms of data corruption; such as duplication; can affect samplingprobabilities; and thus; new techniques have to be designed to ensure correctness of theapproximate query results. We first describe our initial project on computing statisticallybounded estimates of sum; count; and avg queries from samples of cleaned data. Wesubsequently explored how the same techniques could apply to other problems in databaseresearch; namely; materialized view maintenance. To avoid expensive incrementalmaintenance; we maintain only a sample of rows in a view; and then leverage …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2015,11,22
Optimal top-k query evaluation for weighted business processes,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Neoklis Polyzotis; Tom Yam,Abstract A Business Process (BP for short) consists of a set of activities that achieve somebusiness goal when combined in a flow. Among all the (maybe infinitely many) possibleexecution flows of a BP; analysts are often interested in identifying flows that are" mostimportant"; according to some weight metric. This paper studies the following problem: givena specification of such a BP; a weighting function over BP execution flows; a query; and anumber k; identify the k flows with the highest weight among those satisfying the query. Weprovide here; for the first time; a provably optimal algorithm for identifying the top-k weightedflows of a given BP; and use it for efficient top-k query evaluation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,11,7
Foundations of crowd data sourcing,Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo,Abstract Crowdsourcing techniques are very powerful when harnessed for the purpose ofcollecting and managing data. In order to provide sound scientific foundations forcrowdsourcing and support the development of efficient crowdsourcing processes; adequateformal models must be defined. In particular; the models must formalize uniquecharacteristics of crowd-based settings; such as the knowledge of the crowd and crowd-provided data; the interaction with crowd members; the inherent inaccuracies anddisagreements in crowd answers; and evaluation metrics that capture the cost and effort ofthe crowd. In this paper; we review the foundational challenges in modeling crowd-baseddata sourcing; for its two main tasks; namely; harvesting data and processing it with the helpof the crowd. For each of the two task types; we dive into the details of one foundational …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2015,10,4
Making interval-based clustering rank-aware,Julia Stoyanovich; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Tova Milo,Abstract In online applications; such as online dating; users often query and rank largecollections of structured items. Top results tend to be homogeneous; which hinders dataexploration. For example; a dating website user who is looking for a partner between 20 and40 years old; and who sorts the matches by income from higher to lower; will see a largenumber of matches in their late 30s who hold an MBA degree and work in the financialindustry; before seeing any matches in different age groups and walks of life. An alternativeto presenting results in a ranked list is to find clusters in the result space; identified by acombination of attributes that correlate with rank. Such clusters may describe matchesbetween 35 and 40 with an MBA; matches between 25 and 30 who work in the softwareindustry; etc.; allowing for data exploration of ranked results.

Approximated summarization of data provenance,Eleanor Ainy; Pierre Bourhis; Susan B Davidson; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract Many modern applications involve collecting large amounts of data from multiplesources; and then aggregating and manipulating it in intricate ways. The complexity of suchapplications; combined with the size of the collected data; makes it difficult to understandhow the resulting information was derived. Data provenance has proven helpful in thisrespect; however; maintaining and presenting the full and exact provenance informationmay be infeasible due to its size and complexity. We therefore introduce the notion ofapproximated summarized provenance; which provides a compact representation of theprovenance at the possible cost of information loss. Based on this notion; we present a novelprovenance summarization algorithm which; based on the semantics of the underlying dataand the intended use of provenance; outputs a summary of the input provenance …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,9,15
Finding optimal probabilistic generators for XML collections,Serge Abiteboul; Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We study the problem of; given a corpus of XML documents and its schema; findingan optimal (generative) probabilistic model; where optimality here means maximizing thelikelihood of the particular corpus to be generated. Focusing first on the structure ofdocuments; we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best generative probabilisticmodel; in the absence of constraints. We further study the problem in the presence ofintegrity constraints; namely key; inclusion; and domain constraints. We study in this casetwo different kinds of generators. First; we consider a continuation-test generator thatperforms; while generating documents; tests of schema satisfiability; these tests prevent fromgenerating a document violating the constraints but; as we will see; they are computationallyexpensive. We also study a restart generator that may generate an invalid document and …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Database Theory,2012,9,15
Navigating in complex mashed-up applications,Daniel Deutch; Ohad Greenshpan; Tova Milo,Abstract Mashups integrate a set of Web-services and data sources; often referred to asmashlets. We study in this paper a common scenario where these mashlets are componentsof larger Web-Applications. In this case; integration of mash-lets yields a set of inter-connected applications; referred to as Mashed-up Applications (abbr. MashAPP). Whileinteractions between the mashlets enrich the individual applications; they also rendernavigation within them more intricate for the user; as actions in one application may affectothers. To assist users in their navigation through MashAPPs we provide a solution basedon a simple; generic model for MashAPPs and navigation flows within them. Queries overthe model allow users to describe navigation flows of interest; and an effective queryevaluation algorithm provides users with recommendations on how to navigate within the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,9,7
Goal-oriented web-site navigation for on-line shoppers,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Tom Yam,Abstract Web-sites for on-line shopping typically offer a vast number of product options andcombinations thereof. While this is very useful; it often makes the navigation in the site andthe identification of the" ideal" purchase (where the notion of ideal differs among users) aconfusing; non-trivial experience. This demonstration presents ShopIT (ShoppIng assitanT);a system that assists on-line shoppers by suggesting the most effective navigation paths fortheir specified criteria and preferences. The suggestions are continually adapted tochoices/decisions taken by the users while navigating. ShopITis based on a set of novel;adaptive; provably optimal algorithms for TOP-K query evaluation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,9,15
On genericity and parametricity,Catriel Beeri; Tova Milo; Paula Ta-Shma,Genericity is a property of queries expressed in declarative query languages. The idea; firstexpressed in [2; 7]; is that data values are uninterpreted; hence a query should be invariantunder isomorphisms(ie element renaming) of dat abases. This has been generalized;following[10]; to account for preservation of constants. This concept of genericity is intimatelyrelated to classical relational database research; that considered databases as constructedover an abstract domain of uninterpreted elements. However; the scope of database modelshas vastly expanded in the last decade. Multiple domains; use of domain functions andpredicates; user-defined types; and bulk types—these are essential components of recentdata models. Genericity is central to many results in the theory of databases; yet littleattention has been paid to it in the development of the new models. This paper tries to …,Proceedings of the fifteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1996,9,4
QOCO: A query oriented data cleaning system with oracles,Moria Bergman; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract As key decisions are often made based on information contained in a database; it isimportant for the database to be as complete and correct as possible. For this reason; manydata cleaning tools have been developed to automatically resolve inconsistencies indatabases. However; data cleaning tools provide only best-effort results and usually cannoteradicate all errors that may exist in a database. Even more importantly; existing datacleaning tools do not typically address the problem of determining what information ismissing from a database. To tackle these problems; we present QOCO; a novel queryoriented cleaning system that leverages materialized views that are defined by user queriesas a trigger for identifying the remaining incorrect/missing information. Given a user query;QOCO interacts with domain experts (which we model as oracle crowds) to identify …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,8,7
NL 2 CM: A Natural Language Interface to Crowd Mining,Yael Amsterdamer; Anna Kukliansky; Tova Milo,Abstract The joint processing of general data; which can refer to objective data such asgeographical locations; with individual data; which is related to the habits and opinions ofindividuals; is required in many real-life scenarios. For this purpose; crowd mining platformscombine searching knowledge bases for general data; with mining the crowd for individual;unrecorded data. Existing such platforms require queries to be stated in a formal language.To bridge the gap between naïve users; who are not familiar with formal query languages;and crowd mining platforms; we develop NL2CM; a prototype system which translatesnatural language (NL) questions into well-formed crowd mining queries. The mix of generaland individual information needs raises unique challenges. In particular; the different typesof needs must be identified and translated into separate query parts. To account for these …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,8,1

A propagation model for provenance views of public/private workflows,Susan B Davidson; Tova Milo; Sudeepa Roy,Abstract We study the problem of concealing functionality of a proprietary or private modulewhen provenance information is shown over repeated executions of a workflow whichcontains both public and private modules. Our approach is to use provenance views to hidecarefully chosen subsets of data over all executions of the workflow to ensure Γ-privacy: foreach private module and each input x; the module's output f (x) is indistinguishable from Γ--1other possible values given the visible data in the workflow executions. We show that Γ-privacy cannot be achieved simply by combining solutions for individual private modules;data hiding must also be propagated through public modules. We then examine how muchadditional data must be hidden and when it is safe to stop propagating data hiding. Theanswer depends strongly on the workflow topology as well as the behavior of public …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Database Theory,2013,8,2
A structural/temporal query language for business processes,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract A Business Process consists of multiple business activities; which; when combinedin a flow; achieve some particular goal. These processes usually operate in a distributedenvironment and the software implementing them is fairly complex. Thus; effective tools foranalysis of the possible executions of such processes are extremely important forcompanies (Beeri et al.; 2006; 2007 [4; 5]);(Deutch and Milo; 2008 [13]); these tools canallow to debug and optimize the processes; and to make an optimal use of them. The goal ofthe present paper is to consider a formal model underlying Business Processes and studyquery languages over such processes. We study in details the relationship of the proposedmodel with previously suggested formalisms for processes modeling and querying. Inparticular we propose a query evaluation algorithm of polynomial data complexity that …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2012,8,20
Improved recommendations via (more) collaboration,Rubi Boim; Haim Kaplan; Tova Milo; Ronitt Rubinfeld,Abstract We consider in this paper a popular class of recommender systems that are basedon Collaborative Filtering (CF for short). CF is the process of predicting customer ratings toitems based on previous ratings of (similar) users to (similar) items; and is typically used by asingle organization; using its own customer ratings. We argue here that a multi-organizationcollaboration; even for organizations operating in different subject domains; can greatlyimprove the quality of the recommendations that the individual organizations provide to theirusers. To substantiate this claim; we present C2F (Collaborative CF); a recommendersystem that retains the simplicity and efficiency of classical CF; while allowing distinctorganizations to collaborate and boost their recommendations. C2F employs CF in adistributed fashion that improves the quality of the generated recommendations; while …,Procceedings of the 13th International Workshop on the Web and Databases,2010,8,4
BP-Ex: a uniform query engine for business process execution traces,Eran Balan; Tova Milo; Tal Sterenzy,Abstract Many enterprises nowadays use business processes; based on the BPEL standard;to achieve their goals. Analyzing the execution of such processes is critical for enforcingbusiness policies and meeting efficiency and reliability goals. The BP-Ex system presentedin this demo is an important component of BP-Suite; a novel tools suite based on the BPELstandard; which offers a uniform; query-based; user-friendly interface for BP analysis. BP-suite allows to gracefully combine the analysis of process specifications; monitoring of runtime behavior; and posteriorly querying of execution traces (logs); for a comprehensiveprocess management. BP-Ex is the BP-Suite query engine for process execution traces. Thegoal of this demo is to highlight the particular challenges that had to be addressed to supportthe suite's uniform; intuitive query interface; over (possibly very large) execution traces …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,8,7
Database and XML technologies,Zohra Bellahsène; Tova Milo; Michael Rys; Dan Suciu; Rainer Unland,The theme of the XML Database Symposium (XSym) is the convergence of databasetechnology with XML technology. Since the first International XML Symposium in 2003;XSym has continued to provide a forum for academics; practitioners; users and vendors todiscuss the use of and synergy between advanced XML technologies. XSym 2006 received32 full paper submissions. Each submitted paper underwent a rigorous review byindependent referees. These proceedings represent a collection of eight excellent researchpapers. Their focus is on building XML repositories and covers the following topics: XMLquery processing; caching; indexing and navigation support; structural matching; temporalXML; and XML updates.

A natural language interface for querying general and individual knowledge,Yael Amsterdamer; Anna Kukliansky; Tova Milo,Abstract Many real-life scenarios require the joint analysis of general knowledge; whichincludes facts about the world; with individual knowledge; which relates to the opinions orhabits of individuals. Recently developed crowd mining platforms; which were designed forsuch tasks; are a major step towards the solution. However; these platforms require users tospecify their information needs in a formal; declarative language; which may be toocomplicated for naïve users. To make the joint analysis of general and individual knowledgeaccessible to the public; it is desirable to provide an interface that translates the userquestions; posed in natural language (NL); into the formal query languages that crowdmining platforms support. While the translation of NL questions to queries over conventionaldatabases has been studied in previous work; a setting with mixed individual and general …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,7,1
Understanding Local Structure in Ranked Datasets.,Julia Stoyanovich; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Susan B Davidson; Marie Jacob; Tova Milo,ABSTRACT Ranked data is ubiquitous in real-world applications. Rankings arise naturallywhen users express preferences about products and services; when voters cast ballots inelections; when funding proposals are evaluated based on their merits and universitydepartments based on their reputation; or when genes are ordered based on theirexpression levels under various experimental conditions. We observe that ranked dataexhibits interesting local structure; representing agreement of subsets of rankers oversubsets of items. Being able to model; identify and describe such structure is important;because it enables novel kinds of analysis with the potential of making ground-breakingimpact; but is challenging to do effectively and efficiently.

Active XML; Security and Access Control.,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Bogdan Cautis; Tova Milo; SA Xyleme,Abstract XML and Web services are revolutioning the automatic management of distributedinformation; somewhat in the same way that HTML; Web browsers and search enginesmodified human access to world wide information. We argue in this paper that thecombination of XML and Web services allows for a novel distributed data managementparadigm; where the exchanged information mixes materialized and intensional; active;information. We illustrate the flexibility of this approach by presenting Active XML; alanguage that is based on embedding Web service calls in XML data. We focus on twoparticular issues; namely security and access control.,SBBD,2004,7,8
Managing General and Individual Knowledge in Crowd Mining Applications.,Yael Amsterdamer; Susan B Davidson; Anna Kukliansky; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Amit Somech,ABSTRACT Crowd mining frameworks combine general knowledge; which can refer to anontology or information in a database; with individual knowledge obtained from the crowd;which captures habits and preferences. To account for such mixed knowledge; along withuser interaction and optimization issues; such frameworks must employ a complex processof reasoning; automatic crowd task generation and result analysis. In this paper; we describea generic architecture for crowd mining applications. This architecture allows us to examineand compare the components of existing crowdsourcing systems and point out extensionsrequired by crowd mining. It also highlights new research challenges and potential reuse ofexisting techniques/components. We exemplify this for the OASSIS project and for otherprominent crowdsourcing frameworks.,CIDR,2015,6,7
Methods for boosting recommender systems,Rubi Boim; Tova Milo,Online shopping has grown rapidly over the past few years. Besides the convenience ofshopping directly from ones home; an important advantage of e-commerce is the greatvariety of items that online stores offer. However; with such a large number of items; itbecomes harder for vendors to determine which items are more relevant for a given user.Recommender Systems are programs that attempt to assist in such scenarios by presentingthe user a small subset of items which she is likely to find interesting. We consider in thiswork a popular class of such systems that are based on Collaborative Filtering (CF for short).CF is the process of predicting user ratings to items based on previous ratings of (similar)users to (similar) items. The objective of this research is to develop new algorithms andmethods for boosting CF based Recommender Systems.

Compact labeling scheme for xml ancestor queries,Haim Kaplan; Tova Milo; Ronen Shabo,Abstract XML documents are often viewed as trees (basically the parse tree of thedocument); and queries over such documents typically test for ancestor relationships amongtree nodes. Search engines process such queries using an index structure summarizing theancestor relations. In the index; each document item (tree node) is identified using somelogical id (node label); such that; given two labels; the engine can determine the ancestorrelationship between the corresponding nodes. The length of the labels is a main factor ofthe index size. Therefore; reducing this length; even by a constant factor; is a critical issue. Inthis work we consider the following problem. Given a rooted XML tree T; label the nodes of Tin the most compact way such that given the labels of two nodes; one can determine inconstant time; by looking at the labels only; whether one node is an ancestor of the other …,Theory of Computing Systems,2007,6,1
Querying the file,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Tova Milo,Abstract Database systems are concerned with structured data. Unfortunately; data is oftenstored in an unstructured manner (eg in files) even when it does have a strong internalstructure (eg electronic documents or programs). Unfortunately; data stored in files cannotbenefit from database technology and in particular; has to rely on very primitive linguisticsupport. In this paper; we show how structured files can be queried using (high-level)database languages. In [2](see Chapter 3.3. 2) we address the problem of updates.,*,2000,6,15
Comparison of functional and predicative query paradigms,Catriel Beeri; Tova Milo,Abstract In the last decade many extensions of the relational model were proposed; andbasic properties of the relational model were investigated in their contexts. In particular; theequivalence of calculus and algebra; and the relative expressive power of other relatedlanguages were explored. This paper investigates this subject in a general framework;independently of any specific data type constructors that may exist in specific models; withthe goal of making explicit the conditions that enable translation between query languages.The framework is based on a combination the well-founded approach of deductive programsand the initial algebra approach of algebraic specifications. The latter does not supportnegation (ie; disequations); hence our combination contributes to the theory of algebraicspecifications. Given the framework; we present the predicative and functional …,journal of computer and system sciences,1997,6,7
Business Processes: A Database Perspective,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract While classic data management focuses on the data itself; research on BusinessProcesses also considers the context in which this data is generated and manipulated;namely the processes; users; and goals that this data serves. This provides the analysts abetter perspective of the organizational needs centered around the data. As such; thisresearch is of fundamental importance. Much of the success of database systems in the lastdecade is due to the beauty and elegance of the relational model and its declarative querylanguages; combined with a rich spectrum of underlying evaluation and optimizationtechniques; and efficient implementations. Much like the case for traditional databaseresearch; elegant modeling and rich underlying technology are likely to be highlybeneficiary for the Business Process owners and their users; both can benefit from easy …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2012,5,11
Mob data sourcing,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract Crowdsourcing is an emerging paradigm that harnesses a mass of users to performvarious types of tasks. We focus in this tutorial on a particular form of crowdsourcing; namelycrowd (or mob) datasourcing whose goal is to obtain; aggregate or process data.

A fine-grained workflow model with provenance-aware security views,Zhuowei Bao; Susan B Davidson; Tova Milo,Abstract In this paper we propose a fine-grained workflow model; based on context-freegraph grammars; in which the dependency relation between the inputs and outputs of amodule is explicitly specified as a bipartite graph. Using this model; we develop an accesscontrol mechanism that supports provenance-aware security views. Our security model notonly protects sensitive data and modules from unauthorized access; but also provides theflexibility to expose correct or partially correct data dependency relationships within theprovenance information.,a) A,2011,5,15
Navigating through mashed-up applications with compass,Daniel Deutch; Ohad Greenshpan; Tova Milo,Mashups integrate a set of complementary Web-services and data sources; often referred toas mashlets. We consider here a common scenario where the integrated mashlets are partof larger Web-applications; and their integration yields a set of inter-connected applications.We refer to them as Mashed-up Applications (abbr. MashAPP). The inter-connectionsbetween the mashlets enrich the individual Web-applications; but at the same time make theuser navigation within them more intricate as actions in one application may affect others. Toaddress this difficulty; we present COMPASS; a system that assists users in their navigationthrough MashAPPs. The system employs a novel top-k algorithm to propose users the mosteffective navigation paths for their specified goals. The suggestions are continually adaptedto choices taken by the users while navigating.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,5,7
Querying and monitoring distributed business processes,Tova Milo; Daniel Deutch,Abstract A business process (BP for short) consists of a group of business activitiesundertaken by one or more organizations in pursuit of some particular goal. It usuallyoperates in a cross-organization; distributed environment and the software implementing it isfairly complex. Standards facilitate the design; deployment; and execution of BPs. Inparticular; the recent BPEL standard (Business Process Execution Language); provides anXML-based language to describe the interface between the participants in a process; as wellas the full operational logic of the process and its execution flow. BPEL specifications areautomatically compiled into executable code that implements the described BP and runs ona BPEL application server. Processes execution is traced; and their run-time behavior canbe recorded in standard XML formats.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,5,7
Digital signatures for modifiable collections,Serge Abiteboul; Bogdan Cautis; Amos Fiat; Tova Milo,The common assumption about digital signatures is that they disallow any kind ofmodification on signed data. However; a more flexible approach is often needed and hasbeen advocated lately; one in which some restricted modifications may still occur; withoutinvalidating the data. This is made possible by offering signatures which are homomorphicwith respect to some operation on the message domain. Starting from the signature (s) ofsome data instance (s); computed by the data owner; anybody else can derive the signaturecorresponding to a new data instance; if obtained only via some accepted operation from theprevious one (s). More; updated signatures should be indistinguishable from the onescomputed by the data owner and this updating step should be applicable as many times asneeded. This paper deals with the signing of insert-only collections; in which element …,Availability; Reliability and Security; 2006. ARES 2006. The First International Conference on,2006,5,1

Towards a language for the fully generic queries,Catriel Beeri; Tova Milo; Paula Ta-Shma,Database queries differ in one fundamental aspect from regular functions--they are generic;that is invariant under database isomorphisms. This property was first discussed in [AU79].At about the same time;[CHS0] posed the problem whether there is a complete querylanguage; that is a language that expresses precisely the computable generic databasefunctious; and presented an affirmative answer. Over the years; tile notion of genericity hasbeen refined. Clearly; if a constant is used in a query; the query cannot be expected to beinvariant under renamings that do not preserve it. Consequently; Hull and Yap [HY84]introduced the idea of invariance under isomorphisms that preserve some constants. Theirnotion of C-genericity; where C is a finite set of constants; is essential to capture functionssuch as O'A= 3 (R) as queries. But now; if we consider the query O'prime (A)(R); we see …,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,1997,5,1
Type inference and type checking for queries over execution traces,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract We study here Type Inference and Type Checking for queries over the executiontraces of Business Processes. We define formal models for such execution traces; allowingto capture various realistic scenarios of partial information about these traces. We thendefine corresponding notions of types; and the problems of type inference and type checkingin this context. We further provide a comprehensive study of the decidability and complexityof these problems; in various cases; and suggest efficient algorithms where possible.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,4,7
On models and query languages for probabilistic processes,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract Probabilistic processes appear naturally in various contexts; with applications toBusiness Processes; XML data management and more. Many models for specifying andquerying such processes exist in the literature; a main goal of research in this area is todesign models that are expressive enough to capture real-life processes and analysis tasks;but at the same time allow for efficient query evaluation. We depict the model established in[13; 16; 17; 18]; and claim that it achieves a good balance between expressivity and queryevaluation complexity. We compare and contrast the model with other common models forprobabilistic processes; highlighting the different choices made in models design and theireffect on expressivity and incurred complexity.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2010,4,15

More on Updating the File.,Serge Abiteboul; Sophie Cluet; Tova Milo,Abstract We present a framework which allows to view information stored in les as if it werean integral part of the database system. We study how high level database updatelanguages can be used to update les; and show that such updates can be executed eciently.The update technique is based on unparsing-a new tool for mapping database objects tostrings. We investigate the conditions under which the use of unparsing is possible and ecient. Furthermore; we show that unparsing combined with a previously developed queryoptimization technique provides an e cient update mechanism.,BDA,1994,4,7
Rudolf: interactive rule refinement system for fraud detection,Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract Credit card frauds are unauthorized transactions that are made or attempted by aperson or an organization that is not authorized by the card holders. In addition to machinelearning-based techniques; credit card companies often employ domain experts to manuallyspecify rules that exploit domain knowledge for improving the detection process. Over time;however; as new (fraudulent and legitimate) transaction arrive; these rules need to beupdated and refined to capture the evolving (fraud and legitimate) activity patterns. The goalof the RUDOLF system that is demonstrated here is to guide and assist domain experts inthis challenging task. RUDOLF automatically determines a best set of candidate adaptationsto existing rules to capture all fraudulent transactions and; respectively; omit all legitimatetransactions. The proposed modifications can then be further refined by domain experts …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,3,7
An efficient MapReduce cube algorithm for varied datadistributions,Tova Milo; Eyal Altshuler,Abstract Data cubes allow users to discover insights from their data and are commonly usedin data analysis. While very useful; the data cube is expensive to compute; in particularwhen the input relation is very large. To address this problem; we consider cubecomputation in MapReduce; the popular paradigm for distributed big data processing; andpresent an efficient algorithm for computing cubes over large data sets. We show that ournew algorithm consistently performs better than the previous solutions. In particular; existingtechniques for cube computation in MapReduce suffer from sensitivity to the distribution ofthe input data and their performance heavily depends on whether or not; and how exactly;the data is skewed. In contrast; the cube algorithm that we present here is resilient andsignificantly outperforms previous solutions for varying data distributions. At the core of …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,3,22
Answering regular path queries on workflow provenance,Xiaocheng Huang; Zhuowei Bao; Susan B Davidson; Tova Milo; Xiaojie Yuan,This paper proposes a novel approach for efficiently evaluating regular path queries overprovenance graphs of workflows that may include recursion. The approach assumes that anexecution g of a workflow G is labeled with query-agnostic reachability labels using anexisting technique. At query time; given g; G and a regular path query R; the approachdecomposes R into a set of subqueries R 1;...; R k that are safe for G. For each safesubquery R i; G is rewritten so that; using the reachability labels of nodes in g; whether or notthere is a path which matches R i between two nodes can be decided in constant time. Theresults of each safe subquery are then composed; possibly with some small unsaferemainder; to produce an answer to R. The approach results in an algorithm that significantlyreduces the number of subqueries k over existing techniques by increasing their size and …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,3,20
Ontology assisted crowd mining,Yael Amsterdamer; Susan B Davidson; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Amit Somech,Abstract We present OASSIS (for Ontology ASSISted crowd mining); a prototype systemwhich allows users to declaratively specify their information needs; and mines the crowd foranswers. The answers that the system computes are concise and relevant; and representfrequent; significant data patterns. The system is based on (1) a generic model that capturesboth ontological knowledge; as well as the individual knowledge of crowd members fromwhich frequent patterns are mined;(2) a query language in which users can specify theirinformation needs and types of data patterns they seek; and (3) an efficient query evaluationalgorithm; for mining semantically concise answers while minimizing the number ofquestions posed to the crowd.

Approximated Provenance for Complex Applications.,Eleanor Ainy; Susan B Davidson; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract Many applications now involve the collection of large amounts of data from multipleusers; and then aggregating and manipulating it in intricate ways. The complexity of suchapplications; combined with the size of the collected data; makes it difficult to understandhow information was derived; and consequently difficult to asses its credibility; to optimizeand debug its derivation; etc. Provenance has been helpful in achieving such goals indifferent contexts; and we illustrate its potential for novel complex applications such as thoseperforming crowd-sourcing. Maintaining (and presenting) the full and exact provenanceinformation may be infeasible for such applications; due to the size of the provenance and itscomplex structure. We propose some initial directions towards addressing this challenge;through the notion of approximated provenance.,TAPP,2014,3,7
Top-k queries over web applications,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Neoklis Polyzotis,Abstract The core logic of web applications that suggest some particular service; such asonline shopping; e-commerce etc.; is typically captured by Business Processes (BPs).Among all the (maybe infinitely many) possible execution flows of a BP; analysts are ofteninterested in identifying flows that are “most important”; according to some weight metric. Thegoal of the present paper is to provide efficient algorithms for top-k query evaluation over thepossible executions of Business Processes; under some given weight function. Uniquedifficulties in top-k analysis in this settings stem from (1) the fact that the number of possibleexecution flows of a given BP is typically very large; or even infinite in presence of recursionand (2) that the weights (eg; likelihood; monetary cost; etc.) induced by actions performedduring the execution (eg; product purchase) may be inter-dependent (due to probabilistic …,The VLDB Journal,2013,3,3
Auto-completion learning for XML,Serge Abiteboul; Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Editing an XML document manually is a complicated task. While many XML editorsexist in the market; we argue that some important functionalities are missing in all of them.Our goal is to makes the editing task simpler and faster. We present ALEX (Auto-completionLearning Editor for XML); an editor that assists the users by providing intelligent auto-completion suggestions.

Crowd-based data sourcing,Tova Milo,Abstract Harnessing a crowd of Web users for the collection of mass data has recentlybecome a wide-spread phenomenon [9]. Wikipedia [20] is probably the earliest and bestknown example of crowd-sourced data and an illustration of what can be achieved with acrowd-based data sourcing model. Other examples include social tagging systems forimages; which harness millions of Web users to build searchable databases of taggedimages; traffic information aggregators like Waze [17]; and hotel and movie ratings likeTripAdvisor [19] and IMDb [18].,International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems,2011,3,10
Active XML,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Tova Milo,1. Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,3,1
Querying DAG-shaped Execution Traces Through Views.,Maya Ben-Ari; Tova Milo; Elad Verbin,ABSTRACT The question whether a given set of views; defined by queries; can be used toanswer another query; arises in several contexts such as query optimization; dataintegration and semantic caching [24; 10; 12]. This paper studies a specific instance of thisproblem; where the queried data has the shape of a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and thequery language uses DAG patterns to retrieve portions of the data graph that are of interest.Our study is motivated by a particular application domain concerning the analysis of Web-based Business Processes (BPs for short). Such DAGs/DAG patterns are the standard wayto model/query BP execution traces [3]. Previous research considered tree-shaped XMLdata and (general) graph-shaped Semi-Structured data. We show that the particular DAGshape of BP execution traces makes the problem easier than for general graphs; yet …,WebDB,2009,3,4
Querying web-based applications under models of uncertainty,Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,Abstract Many businesses offer their services to customers via Web-based applicationinterfaces. Reasoning about execution flows of such applications is extremely valuable forcompanies. Such reasoning must often operate under terms of uncertainty and partialinformation; due to partial tracing; effects of unknown external parameters; and more. Theobjectives of this research are (1) to define models for capturing Web application executions;with partial information and uncertainly of various flavors;(2) to design algorithms that allowfor efficient reasoning over applications/execution traces under these models; and (3) toprovide practical implementations that exploit these sound theoretical foundations foreffective optimization of Web applications.

Compact samples for data dissemination,Tova Milo; Assaf Sagi; Elad Verbin,Abstract We consider data dissemination in a peer-to-peer network; where each user wishesto obtain some subset of the available information objects. In most of the modern algorithmsfor such data dissemination; the users periodically obtain samples of peer IDs (possibly withsome summary of their content). They then use the samples for connecting to other peersand downloading data pieces from them. For a set O of information objects; we call a sampleof peers; containing at least k possible providers for each object o∈ O; a k-sample. In orderto balance the load; the k-samples should be fair; in the sense that for every object; itsproviders should appear in the sample with equal probability.

On-line Database Tuning,Karl Schnaitter; Serge Abiteboul; Tova Milo; Neoklis Polyzotis,Abstract This paper introduces Colt (Continuous On-Line Tuning); a novel self-tuningframework that continuously monitors the incoming queries and adjusts the systemconfiguration in order to maximize query performance. The key idea behind Colt is to gatherperformance statistics at different levels of detail and to carefully allocate profiling resourcesto the most promising candidate configurations. Moreover; Colt uses effective heuristics toself-regulate its own performance; lowering its overhead when the system is well tuned andbeing more aggressive when the workload shifts and it becomes necessary to re-tune thesystem. We detail the design of the generic Colt system; and present its specialization to theimportant problem of selecting an effective set of indices for a relational query load.

Subtyping in OODBs,Catriel Beeri; Tova Milo,Abstract One of the central concepts supported by object-oriented databases is isarelationship. Its intuitive simplicity is deceptive. In reality; this term denotes several concepts;such as subtyping; subset relationships; and inheritance of structure and/or behavior. Eachof these is non-trivial; and their interaction may be quite subtle. This paper deals withsubtyping and its properties; in the context of a model that allows arbitrary data types andtype constructors (but no function constructor). For simplicity a model based on the algebraicspecification approach is used; which partially explains the inability to deal with the functionconstructor. Two intuitive ideas about subtyping are generalized and investigated: first; thatthe set of elements associated with a subtype is a subset of the set associated withsupertype; and second; that each element of the subtype may be used in any place where …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1995,3,15
Dance: Data cleaning with constraints and experts,Ahmad Assadi; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov,Video: https://youtu.be/IssLjM2WQQQ I. INTRODUCTION Data cleaning is a long standing problemthat has attracted much research interest in the past years in the databases community. Populartechniques for data cleaning use data- integrity and consistency rules to identify errors in thedata and to automatically resolve them; eg by fining a minimal repair that will resolve the constraintsviolation [1]; or by using predefined priorities among possible resolutions [2]. Such automaticsolutions however cannot ensure precision of the repairs since they do not have enough evidenceabout the actual errors and thus may in fact lead to wrong results with respect to the groundtruth. In order to overcome the limitations of such automatic techniques it has been suggestedto use domain experts that have extensive knowledge about the ground truth; to examine thepotential updates and choose which should be applied to the database [2]; [3]; [4]; [5] …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,2,12
Top-k Querying of Unknown Values under Order Constraints,Antoine Amarilli; Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Many practical scenarios make it necessary to evaluate top-k queries over dataitems with partially unknown values. This paper considers a setting where the values aretaken from a numerical domain; and where some partial order constraints are given overknown and unknown values: under these constraints; we assume that all possible worldsare equally likely. Our work is the first to propose a principled scheme to derive the valuedistributions and expected values of unknown items in this setting; with the goal ofcomputing estimated top-k results by interpolating the unknown values from the known ones.We study the complexity of this general task; and show tight complexity bounds; proving thatthe problem is intractable; but can be tractably approximated. We then consider the case oftree-shaped partial orders; where we show a constructive PTIME solution. We also …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2017,2,20
React: Context-sensitive recommendations for data analysis,Tova Milo; Amit Somech,Abstract Data analysis may be a difficult task; especially for non-expert users; as it requiresdeep understanding of the investigated domain and the particular context. In this demo wepresent REACT; a system that hooks to the analysis UI and provides the users withpersonalized recommendations of analysis actions. By matching the current user session toprevious sessions of analysts working with the same or other data sets; REACT is able toidentify the potentially best next analysis actions in the given user context. Unlike previouswork that mainly focused on individual components of the analysis work; REACT provides aholistic approach that captures a wider range of analysis action types by utilizing novelnotions of similarity in terms of the individual actions; the analyzed data and the entireanalysis workflow.,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,2,7

On the Complexity of Evaluating Order Queries with the Crowd.,Benoît Groz; Tova Milo; Sudeepa Roy,One of the foremost challenges for information technology over the last few years has beento explore; understand; and extract useful information from large amounts of data. Someparticular tasks such as annotating data or matching entities have been outsourced tohuman workers for many years. But the last few years have seen the rise of a new researchfield called crowdsourcing that aims at delegating a wide range of tasks to human workers;building formal frameworks; and improving the efficiency of these processes. The databasecommunity has thus been suggesting algorithms to process traditional data manipulationoperators with the crowd; such as joins or filtering. This is even more useful when comparingthe underlying “tuples” is a subjective decision–eg; when they are photos; text; or simplynoisy data with different variations and interpretations–and can presumably be done …,IEEE Data Eng.

Optimized union of non-disjoint distributed data sets,Itay Dar; Tova Milo; Elad Verbin,Abstract In a variety of applications; ranging from data integration to distributed queryevaluation; there is a need to obtain sets of data items from several sources (peers) andcompute their union. As these sets often contain common data items; avoiding thetransmission of redundant information is essential for effective union computation. In thispaper we define the notion of optimal union plans for non-disjoint data sets residing ondistinct peers; and present efficient algorithms for computing and executing such optimalplans. Our algorithms avoid redundant data transmission and optimally exploit the networkbandwidth capabilities. A challenge in the design of optimal plans is the lack of a completemap of the distribution of the data items among peers. We analyze the information requiredfor optimal planning and propose novel techniques to obtain compact; cheap to …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,2,17

Peer-to-peer data integration with active XML,Tova Milo,Abstract The advent of XML as a universal exchange format and of Web services as a basisfor distributed computing; has fostered the emergence of a new class of documents that wecall Active XML documents (AXML in short). These are XML documents where some of thedata is given explicitly while other parts are given only intentionally by means of embeddedcalls to web services; that can be called to generate the required information. We argue thatAXML provides powerful means for the modeling and integration of distributed dynamic Webdata. AXML can capture various integration scenarios including peer-to-peer data mediationand warehousing; while providing support for new features of Web services such assubscription; service directories; and controlling data changes.

Schema-based data translation,Tova Milo; Sagit Zohar,Data integration and translation is a problem facing many organizations that wish to utilizeWeb data. A broad spectrum of data is available on the Web in distinct heterogeneoussources; stored under different formats: a speci c database vendor format; SGML or Latex(documents); DX formats (scienti c data); Step (CAD/CAM data); etc. Their integration is avery active eld of research and development;(see for instance; for a very small sample; 16;10; 14; 13; 26; 22; 15; 4; 3]). A key observation is that; often; the application programs usedby organizations can only handle data of a speci c format.(eg Web browsers; like Netscape;expect les in HTML format; and relational databases expect relations).

Answering conjunctive queries with inequalities,Paraschos Koutris; Tova Milo; Sudeepa Roy; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we study the complexity of answering conjunctive queries (CQ) withinequalities (≠). In particular; we are interested in comparing the complexity of the querywith and without inequalities. The main contribution of our work is a novel combinatorialtechnique that enables us to use any Select-Project-Join query plan for a given CQ withoutinequalities in answering the CQ with inequalities; with an additional factor in running timethat only depends on the query. The key idea is to define a new projection operator; whichkeeps a small representation (independent of the size of the database) of the set of inputtuples that map to each tuple in the output of the projection; this representation is used toevaluate all the inequalities in the query. Second; we generalize a result by Papadimitriouand Yannakakis (1997) and give an alternative algorithm based on the color-coding …,Theory of Computing Systems,2017,1,1

Filtering with the Crowd: CrowdScreen revisited (technical report),Benoît Groz; Ezra Levin; Isaac Meilijson; Tova Milo,Filtering a set of items; based on a set of properties that can be verified by humans; is acommon application of CrowdSourcing. When the workers are error-prone; each item ispresented to multiple users; to limit the probability of misclassification. Since the Crowd is arelatively expensive resource; minimizing the number of questions per item may naturallyresult in big savings. Several algorithms to address this minimization problem have beenpresented in the CrowdScreen framework by Parameswaran et al. However; thosealgorithms do not scale well and therefore cannot be used in scenarios where high accuracyis required in spite of high user error rates. The goal of this paper is thus to devise algorithmsthat can cope with such situations. To achieve this; we provide new theoretical insights to theproblem; then use them to develop a new efficient algorithm.

Technical Perspective: Enlisting the power of the crowd,Tova Milo,Crowdsourcing is a powerful new project management and procurement strategy thatenables the realization of values associated with an" open call" to an unlimited pool ofpeople; typically through Web-based technology. Our focus here is on an important form ofcrowdsourcing where the crowd's task is to generate or source data. Generally speaking;crowd-based data sourcing is invoked to obtain data; to aggregate and/or fuse data; toprocess data; or; more directly; to develop dedicated applications or solutions over thesourced data.Wikipedia is probably the earliest and best-known example of crowdsourceddata and an illustration of what can be achieved with a crowd-based data-sourcing model.Other examples include social tagging systems for images that harness millions of Webusers to build searchable databases of tagged images; traffic information aggregators like …,Communications of the ACM,2015,1,7

In the mood4: Recommendation by examples,Rubi Boim; Tova Milo,Abstract Traditional recommender systems generate personalized recommendations basedon a profile that they create for each user.

We present an efficient algorithm for finding the best probabilistic model; inabsence of constraints. We further study the problem in presence of integrity constraints(key; inclusion; and domain constraints) and consider in this case two different kinds ofgenerators: a continuation-test generator that performs; while generating; some tests ofschema satisfiability; these tests allow avoiding the violation of constraints (but as we show;are costly to implement); and a restart generator that may generate an invalid document andthen restart and try again.,BDA (Bases de données avancées),2011,1,7
On the optimality of top-k algorithms for Interactive Web Applications.,Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo,ABSTRACT In an interactive Web application; the application state changes according touser choices/actions. To assist users in their interaction with such applications; there is aneed to provide them with recommendations for the top-k (according to some ranking metric)interactions. These recommendations must be continually updated; as the user interacts withthe application; to be consistent with the actual choices she makes. Efficiency of computationis critical here to provide fast response time and a pleasant user experience. This paperestablishes formal foundations for measuring the optimality of top-k algorithms of theaforementioned type; ie how well they perform relative to other algorithms; with respect to allpossible input instances.

A natural language interface for querying general and individual knowledge (full version),Yael Amsterdamer; A Kuliansky; Tova Milo,Abstract Many real-life scenarios require the joint analysis of general knowledge; whichincludes facts about the world; with individual knowledge; which relates to the opinions orhabits of individuals. Recently developed crowd mining platforms; which were designed forsuch tasks; are a major step towards the solution. However; these platforms require users tospecify their information needs in a formal; declarative language; which may be toocomplicated for naıve users. To make the joint analysis of general and individual knowledgeaccessible to the public; it is desirable to provide an interface that translates the userquestions; posed in natural language (NL); into the formal query languages that crowdmining platforms support. While the translation of NL questions to queries over conventionaldatabases has been studied in previous work; a setting with mixed individual and general …,*,*,1,2

Data provenance has been provenhelpful in this respect in different contexts; however; maintaining and presenting the full andexact provenance may be infeasible; due to its size and complex structure. For that reason;we introduce the notion of approximated summarized provenance; where we seek acompact representation of the provenance at the possible cost of information loss. Based onthis notion; we have developed PROX; a system for the management; presentation and useof data provenance for complex applications. We propose to demonstrate PROX in the …,Advances in database technology: proceedings. International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2016,*,15
Optimal Probabilistic Generation of XML Documents,Serge Abiteboul; Yael Amsterdamer; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We study the problem of; given a corpus of XML documents and its schema; findingan optimal (generative) probabilistic model; where optimality here means maximizing thelikelihood of the particular corpus to be generated. Focusing first on the structure ofdocuments; we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best generative probabilisticmodel; in the absence of constraints. We further study the problem in the presence ofintegrity constraints; namely key; inclusion; and domain constraints. We study in this casetwo different kinds of generators. First; we consider a continuation-test generator thatperforms; while generating documents; tests of schema satisfiability; these tests prevent fromgenerating a document violating the constraints but; as we will see; they are computationallyexpensive. We also study a restart generator that may generate an invalid document and …,Theory of Computing Systems,2015,*,1

Dismantling Complicated Query Attributes with Crowd.,Matan Laadan; Tova Milo,ABSTRACT We study the problem of query evaluation with the help of the crowd; when thevalue of the queried attributes is not available in the database and is also hard for the crowdto estimate. Rather than asking users directly about these attributes; we propose a novelalternative approach that first uses the crowd to dismantle the query attributes into finerrelated ones (whose value estimation is easier); then assemble them to yield betterestimation for the query attributes. We show that it is sometimes beneficial not to onlydismantle the query attributes themselves; but rather to continue dismantling newlydiscovered attributes. We provide a careful statistical analysis to estimate the potentialbenefit (and cost) of dismantling each of the so-far-discovered attributes. Building on thisanalysis; we present an effective algorithm that balances between attributes dismantling …,EDBT,2015,*,8

Answering Planning Queries with the Crowd (Technical report),Haim Kaplan; Ilia Lotosh; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov,Abstract Recent research has shown that crowd sourcing can be used effectively to solveproblems that are difficult for computers; eg; optical character recognition and identificationof the structural configuration of natural proteins [34]. In this paper we propose to use thepower of the crowd to address yet another difficult problem that frequently occurs in a dailylife-answering planning queries whose output is a sequence of objects/actions; when thegoal; ie; the notion of “best output”; is hard to formalize. For example; planning the sequenceof places/attractions to visit in the course of a vacation; where the goal is to enjoy theresulting vacation the most; or planning the sequence of courses to take in an academicschedule planning; where the goal is to obtain solid knowledge of a given subject domain.Such goals may be easily understandable by humans; but hard or even impossible to …,*,2013,*,7

More recently; the Web has made the world wide and intranet publicationof data much simpler; by relying on HTML; Web browsers; plain-text search engines andquery forms. However; the management of distributed information remained cumbersome.The situation is dramatically improving today with the introduction of XML [18] and Webservices [21].

We consider the problem of storing and accessing documents (SGML and HTML;in particular) using database technology. To specify the database image of documents; weuse structuring schemas that consist in grammars annotated with database programs. Toquery documents; we introduce an extension of OQL; the ODMG standard query languagefor object databases. Our extension (named OQL-doc) allows to query documents without aprecise knowledge of their structure using in particular generalized path expressions andpattern matching. This allows us to introduce in a declarative language (in the style of SQLor OQL); navigational and information retrieval styles of accessing data.

Interactive Rule Refinement for Fraud Detection,Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Wang-Chiew Tan,ABSTRACT Credit card frauds are unauthorized transactions that are made or attempted bya person or an organization that is not authorized by the card holders. Fraud with general-purpose cards (credit; debit cards etc.) is a billion dollar industry and companies aretherefore investing significant efforts in identifying and preventing them. In addition tomachine learning-based techniques; credit card companies often employ domain experts tomanually specify rules that exploit general or domain knowledge for improving the detectionprocess. Over time; however; as new (fraudulent and legitimate) transaction arrive; theserules need to be updated and refined to capture the evolving (fraud and legitimate) activitypatterns. The goal of the RUDOLF system described in this paper is to guide and assistdomain experts in this challenging task. RUDOLF automatically determines the “best” …,*,*,*,1

Data Engineering,Sanjay Krishnan; Jiannan Wang; Michael J Franklin; Ken Goldberg; Tim Kraska; Tova Milo; Eugene Wu; Yachao Lu; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract There has been much research on various aspects of Approximate QueryProcessing (AQP); such as different sampling strategies; error estimation mechanisms; andvarious types of data synopses. However; many subtle challenges arise when building anactual AQP engine that can be deployed and used by real world applications. Thesesubtleties are often ignored (or at least not elaborated) by the theoretical literature andacademic prototypes alike. For the first time to the best of our knowledge; in this article; wefocus on these subtle challenges that one must address when designing an AQP system.Our intention for this article is to serve as a handbook listing critical design choices thatdatabase practitioners must be aware of when building or using an AQP system; not toprescribe a specific solution to each challenge.,*,*,*,15
On the Complexity of Top-k Querying for Incomplete Data under Order Constraints,Antoine Amarilli; Yael Amsterdamer; Tova Milo; Pierre Senellart,ABSTRACT Obtaining data values is often expensive; eg; when they are retrieved fromhuman workers; from remote data repositories; or via complex computations. As a result; itmay be challenging to answer queries; because we can only use the incomplete fragment ofthe data that we could afford to obtain. In this paper; we consider a scenario where thevalues are taken from a numerical domain; and where some partial order constraints aregiven over the missing and known values. In such a setting; we study the evaluation of top-kselection queries over incomplete data. Our work is the first to provide a way to estimate thevalue of the top-k items (rather than just determining the items); doing so through a novelinterpolation scheme. It is also the first; to our knowledge; to formally study the computationalcomplexity of the problem. To set the background; we first formulate the problem of top-k …,*,*,*,15

The obtained database is comprised of many facts; contributed by manydifferent users; as a consequence; it contains erroneous data. The key challenge in thesystem development thus lies in the design of effective methods to evaluate queries oversuch dirty Databases. We found that no single existing technique provides a satisfactorysolution to this challenge; in all cases; consequently; we have employed a novel approach;based on a declarative framework for defining recursive and probabilistic Data Cleaningrules. Our solution employs an algorithm that is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo …,*,*,*,1
Minimizing Uncertainty in Crowd Data Sourcing,Rubi Boim; Ohad Greenshpan; Tova Milo; Slava Novgorodov; Neoklis Polyzotis; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract—Crowd data sourcing engages human users to contribute information to adatabase by answering specific questions. A typical use case is in e-commerce sites; wherecustomers are asked to rate the products they purchase or the corresponding sellers; withthe ultimate goal of creating a database of product or seller ratings. In this work; weinvestigate the problem of selecting which questions to ask and to which users in order tominimize uncertainty in the resulting database with respect to an application-specifiedcriterion (eg; the shape of the rating distribution in the previous example). We formalize theoptimization problem and analyze its hardness for different practical scenarios where thereare constraints on the total number of questions; the number of questions per user; or thequestions that users are likely to answer. For the tractable cases; we develop optimal …,*,*,*,4
Recommendation by Examples,Rubi Boim; Tova Milo,ABSTRACT Recommender systems usually rely on user profiles to generate personalizedrecommendations. We argue here that such profiles are often too coarse to capture thecurrent user's state of mind/desire. For example; a serious user that usually prefersdocumentary features may; at the end of a long and tiring conference; be in the mood for alighter entertaining movie; not captured by her usual profile. As communicating one's state ofmind to a system in (key) words may be difficult; we propose in this work an alternativemethod which allows users to describe their current desire/mood through examples. Ouralgorithms utilizes the user's examples to refine the recommendations generated by a givensystem; considering several; possibly competing; desired properties of the recommendeditems set (rating; similarity; diversity; coverage). The algorithms are based on a simple …,*,*,*,20

An Algebra for Pomsets,Tova Milo,Abstract We study languages for manipulating partially ordered structures with duplicates(eg trees; lists). As a general framework; we consider the pomset (partially ordered multiset)data type. We introduce an algebra for pomsets; which generalizes traditional algebras for(nested) sets; bags and lists. This paper is motivated by the study of the impact of di erentlanguage primitives on the expressive power. We show that the use of partially orderedtypes increases the expressive power signi cantly. Surprisingly; it turns out that the algebrawhen restricted to both unordered (bags) and totally ordered (lists) intermediate types; yieldsthe same expressive power as xpoint logic with counting on relational databases. It thereforeconstitutes a rather robust class of relational queries. On the other hand; we obtain acharacterization of PTIME queries on lists by considering only totally ordered types.
