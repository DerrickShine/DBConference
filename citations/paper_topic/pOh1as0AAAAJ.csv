TelegraphCQ: continuous dataflow processing,Sirish Chandrasekaran; Owen Cooper; Amol Deshpande; Michael J Franklin; Joseph M Hellerstein; Wei Hong; Sailesh Krishnamurthy; Samuel R Madden; Fred Reiss; Mehul A Shah,At Berkeley; we are developing TelegraphCQ [1; 2]; a dataflow system for processingcontinuous queries over data streams. TelegraphCQ is based on a novel; highly-adaptivearchitecture supporting dynamic query workloads in volatile data streaming environments. Inthis demonstration we show our current version of TelegraphCQ; which we implemented byleveraging the code base of the open source PostgreSQL database system. AlthoughTelegraphCQ differs significantly from a traditional database system; we found that asignificant portion of the PostgreSQL code was easily reusable. We also found theextensibility features of PostgreSQL very useful; particularly its rich data types and the abilityto load user-developed functions. Challenges: As discussed in [1]; sharing and adaptivityare our main techniques for implementing a continuous query system.

Model-driven data acquisition in sensor networks,Amol Deshpande; Carlos Guestrin; Samuel R Madden; Joseph M Hellerstein; Wei Hong,Abstract Declarative queries are proving to be an attractive paradigm for ineracting withnetworks of wireless sensors. The metaphor that" the sensornet is a database" isproblematic; however; because sensors do not exhaustively represent the data in the realworld. In order to map the raw sensor readings onto physical reality; a model of that reality isrequired to complement the readings. In this paper; we enrich interactive sensor queryingwith statistical modeling techniques. We demonstrate that such models can help provideanswers that are both more meaningful; and; by introducing approximations withprobabilistic confidences; significantly more efficient to compute in both time and energy.Utilizing the combination of a model and live data acquisition raises the challengingoptimization problem of selecting the best sensor readings to acquire; balancing the …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,1340,22
Approximate data collection in sensor networks using probabilistic models,David Chu; Amol Deshpande; Joseph M Hellerstein; Wei Hong,Wireless sensor networks are proving to be useful in a variety of settings. A core challengein these networks is to minimize energy consumption. Prior database research hasproposed to achieve this by pushing data-reducing operators like aggregation and selectiondown into the network. This approach has proven unpopular with early adopters of sensornetwork technology; who typically want to extract complete" dumps" of the sensor readings;ie; to run" SELECT*" queries. Unfortunately; because these queries do no data reduction;they consume significant energy in current sensornet query processors. In this paper weattack the" SELECT" problem for sensor networks. We propose a robust approximatetechnique called Ken that uses replicated dynamic probabilistic models to minimizecommunication from sensor nodes to the network's PC base station. In addition to data …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,544,4
Adaptive query processing,Amol Deshpande; Zachary Ives; Vijayshankar Raman,Abstract As the data management field has diversified to consider settings in which queriesare increasingly complex; statistics are less available; or data is stored remotely; there hasbeen an acknowledgment that the traditional optimize-then-execute paradigm is insufficient.This has led to a plethora of new techniques; generally placed under the common banner ofadaptive query processing; that focus on using runtime feedback to modify query processingin a way that provides better response time or more efficient CPU utilization.,Foundations and Trends® in Databases,2007,323,23
Representing and querying correlated tuples in probabilistic databases,Prithviraj Sen; Amol Deshpande,Probabilistic databases have received considerable attention recently due to the need forstoring uncertain data produced by many real world applications. The widespread use ofprobabilistic databases is hampered by two limitations:(1) current probabilistic databasesmake simplistic assumptions about the data (eg; complete independence among tuples) thatmake it difficult to use them in applications that naturally produce correlated data; and (2)most probabilistic databases can only answer a restricted subset of the queries that can beexpressed using traditional query languages. We address both these limitations byproposing a framework that can represent not only probabilistic tuples; but also correlationsthat may be present among them. Our proposed framework naturally lends itself to thepossible world semantics thus preserving the precise query semantics extant in current …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Adaptive query processing: Technology in evolution,Joseph M.  Hellerstein; Michael J.  Franklin; Sirish Chandrasekaran; Amol Deshpande; Kris Hildrum; Samuel Madden; Vijayshankar Raman; Mehul A.  Shah,Abstract As query engines are scaled and federated; they must cope with highlyunpredictable and changeable environments. In the Telegraph project; we are attempting toarchitect and implement a continuously adaptive query engine suitable for global-areasystems; massive parallelism; and sensor networks. To set the stage for our research; wepresent a survey of prior work on adaptive query processing; focusing on threecharacterizations of adaptivity: the frequency of adaptivity; the effects of adaptivity; and theextent of adaptivity. Given this survey; we sketch directions for research in the Telegraphproject.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2000,277,10
MauveDB: supporting model-based user views in database systems,Amol Deshpande; Samuel Madden,Abstract Real-world data---especially when generated by distributed measurementinfrastructures such as sensor networks---tends to be incomplete; imprecise; and erroneous;making it impossible to present it to users or feed it directly into applications. The traditionalapproach to dealing with this problem is to first process the data using statistical orprobabilistic models that can provide more robust interpretations of the data. Currentdatabase systems; however; do not provide adequate support for applying models to suchdata; especially when those models need to be frequently updated as new data arrives inthe system. Hence; most scientists and engineers who depend on models for managing theirdata do not use database systems for archival or querying at all; at best; databases serve asa persistent raw data store. In this paper we define a new abstraction called model-based …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,217,3

Cache-and-query for wide area sensor databases,Amol Deshpande; Suman Nath; Phillip B Gibbons; Srinivasan Seshan,Abstract Webcams; microphones; pressure gauges and other sensors provide exciting newopportunities for querying and monitoring the physical world. In this paper we focus onquerying wide area sensor databases; containing (XML) data derived from sensors spreadover tens to thousands of miles. We present the first scalable system for executing XPATHqueries on such databases. The system maintains the logical view of the data as a singleXML document; while physically the data is fragmented across any number of host nodes.For scalability; sensor data is stored close to the sensors; but can be cached elsewhere asdictated by the queries. Our design enables self starting distributed queries that jump directlyto the lowest common ancestor of the query result; dramatically reducing query responsetimes.

Exploiting correlated attributes in acquisitional query processing,Amol Deshpande; Carlos Guestrin; Wei Hong; Samuel Madden,Sensor networks and other distributed information systems (such as the Web) mustfrequently access data that has a high per-attribute acquisition cost; in terms of energy;latency; or computational resources. When executing queries that contain several predicatesover such expensive attributes; we observe that it can be beneficial to use correlations toautomatically introduce low-cost attributes whose observation will allow the query processorto better estimate die selectivity of these expensive predicates. In particular; we show how tobuild conditional plans that branch into one or more sub-plans; each with a different orderingfor the expensive query predicates; based on the runtime observation of low-cost attributes.We frame the problem of constructing the optimal conditional plan for a given user query andset of candidate low-cost attributes as an optimization problem.

Online filtering; smoothing and probabilistic modeling of streaming data,Bhargav Kanagal; Amol Deshpande,In this paper; we address the problem of extending a relational database system to facilitateefficient real-time application of dynamic probabilistic models to streaming data. We use therecently proposed abstraction of model-based views for this purpose; by allowing users todeclaratively specify the model to be applied; and by presenting the output of the models tothe user as a probabilistic database view. We support declarative querying over such viewsusing an extended version of SQL that allows for querying probabilistic data. Underneath weuse particle filters; a class of sequential Monte Carlo algorithms; to represent the presentand historical states of the model as sets of weighted samples (particles) that are kept up-to-date as new data arrives. We develop novel techniques to convert the queries on the model-based view directly into queries over particle tables; enabling highly efficient query …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Using state modules for adaptive query processing,Vijayshankar Raman; Amol Deshpande; Joseph M Hellerstein,We present a query architecture in which join operators are decomposed into theirconstituent data structures (State Modules; or SteMs); and dataflow among these SteMs ismanaged adaptively by an eddy routing operator [R. Avnur et al.;(2000)]. Breaking theencapsulation of joins serves two purposes. First; it allows the eddy to observe multiplephysical operations embedded in a join algorithm; allowing for better calibration and controlof these operations. Second; the SteM on a relation serves as a shared materialization point;enabling multiple competing access methods to share results; which can be leveraged bymultiple competing join algorithms. Our architecture extends prior work significantly;allowing continuously adaptive decisions for most major aspects of traditional queryoptimization: choice of access methods and join algorithms; ordering of operators; and …,Data Engineering; 2003.

A unified approach to ranking in probabilistic databases,Jian Li; Barna Saha; Amol Deshpande,Abstract The dramatic growth in the number of application domains that naturally generateprobabilistic; uncertain data has resulted in a need for efficiently supporting complexquerying and decision-making over such data. In this paper; we present a unified approachto ranking and top-k query processing in probabilistic databases by viewing it as a multi-criteria optimization problem; and by deriving a set of features that capture the key propertiesof a probabilistic dataset that dictate the ranked result. We contend that a single; specificranking function may not suffice for probabilistic databases; and we instead propose twoparameterized ranking functions; called PRF ω and PRF e; that generalize or canapproximate many of the previously proposed ranking functions.

Independence is good: Dependency-based histogram synopses for high-dimensional data,Amol Deshpande; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Approximating the joint data distribution of a multi-dimensional data set through acompact and accurate histogram synopsis is a fundamental problem arising in numerouspractical scenarios; including query optimization and approximate query answering. Existingsolutions either rely on simplistic independence assumptions or try to directly approximatethe full joint data distribution over the complete set of attributes. Unfortunately; bothapproaches are doomed to fail for high-dimensional data sets with complex correlationpatterns between attributes. In this paper; we propose a novel approach to histogram-basedsynopses that employs the solid foundation of statistical interaction models to explicitlyidentify and exploit the statistical characteristics of the data.

Although we had implemented some parts of this technology in earlier Java-basedprototypes; our experiences were not positive. As a result; we decided to use PostgreSQL;an open source RDBMS as a starting point for our new implementation. In March 2003; wecompleted an alpha milestone of TelegraphCQ. In this paper; we report on the developmentstatus of our project; with a focus on architectural issues.

Using Probabilistic Models for Data Management in Acquisitional Environments.,Amol Deshpande; Carlos Guestrin; Samuel Madden; JM Hellerstein; W Hong,Abstract Traditional database systems; particularly those focused on capturing andmanaging data from the real world; are poorly equipped to deal with the noise; loss; anduncertainty in data. We discuss a suite of techniques based on probabilistic models that aredesigned to allow database to tolerate noise and loss. These techniques are based onexploiting correlations to predict missing values and identify outliers. Interestingly;correlations also provide a way to give approximate answers to users at a significantly lowercost and enable a range of new types of queries over the correlation structure itself. Weillustrate a host of applications for our new techniques and queries; ranging from sensornetworks to network monitoring to data stream management. We also present a unifiedarchitecture for integrating such models into database systems; focusing in particular on …,CIDR,2005,128,10
Lifting the burden of history from adaptive query processing,Amol Deshpande; Joseph M Hellerstein,Abstract Adaptive query processing schemes attempt to re-optimize query plans during thecourse of query execution. A variety of techniques for adaptive query processing have beenproposed; varying in the granularity at which they can make decisions [8]. The eddy [1] is themost aggressive of these techniques; with the flexibility to choose tuple-by-tuple how toorder the application of operators. In this paper we identify and address a fundamentallimitation of the original eddies proposal: the burden of history in routing. We observe thatrouting decisions have long-term effects on the state of operators in the query; and canseverely constrain the ability of the eddy to adapt over time. We then propose a mechanismwe call STAIRs that allows the query engine to manipulate the state stored inside theoperators and undo the effects of past routing decisions. We demonstrate that eddies with …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,120,4
PrDB: managing and exploiting rich correlations in probabilistic databases,Prithviraj Sen; Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor,Abstract Due to numerous applications producing noisy data; eg; sensor data; experimentaldata; data from uncurated sources; information extraction; etc.; there has been a surge ofinterest in the development of probabilistic databases. Most probabilistic database modelsproposed to date; however; fail to meet the challenges of real-world applications on twocounts:(1) they often restrict the kinds of uncertainty that the user can represent; and (2) thequery processing algorithms often cannot scale up to the needs of the application. In thiswork; we define a probabilistic database model; PrDB; that uses graphical models; a state-of-the-art probabilistic modeling technique developed within the statistics and machinelearning community; to model uncertain data.

The cornerstone of our system is a novel; user-extensible; highly tunable; anddistributed hierarchical index structure called DeltaGraph; that enables compact recording ofthe historical network information; and that supports efficient retrieval of historical graphsnapshots for single-site or parallel processing. Our system exposes a generalprogrammatic API to process and analyze the retrieved snapshots. Along with the originalgraph data; DeltaGraph can also maintain and index auxiliary information; this functionalitycan be used to extend the structure to efficiently execute queries like subgraph patternmatching over historical data.

Managing large dynamic graphs efficiently,Jayanta Mondal; Amol Deshpande,Abstract There is an increasing need to ingest; manage; and query large volumes of graph-structured data arising in applications like social networks; communication networks;biological networks; and so on. Graph databases that can explicitly reason about thegraphical nature of the data; that can support flexible schemas and node-centric or edge-centric analysis and querying; are ideal for storing such data. However; although there ismuch work on single-site graph databases and on efficiently executing different types ofqueries over large graphs; to date there is little work on understanding the challenges indistributed graph databases; needed to handle the large scale of such data.

Exploiting shared correlations in probabilistic databases,Prithviraj Sen; Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor,Abstract There has been a recent surge in work in probabilistic databases; propelled in largepart by the huge increase in noisy data sources---from sensor data; experimental data; datafrom uncurated sources; and many others. There is a growing need for databasemanagement systems that can efficiently represent and query such data. In this work; weshow how data characteristics can be leveraged to make the query evaluation process moreefficient. In particular; we exploit what we refer to as shared correlations where the sameuncertainties and correlations occur repeatedly in the data. Shared correlations occur mainlydue to two reasons:(1) Uncertainty and correlations usually come from general statistics andrarely vary on a tuple-to-tuple basis;(2) The query evaluation procedure itself tends to re-introduce the same correlations.

Efficient stepwise selection in decomposable models,Amol Deshpande; Minos Garofalakis; Michael I Jordan,Abstract In this paper; we present an efficient algorithm for performing stepwise selection inthe class of decomposable models. We focus on the forward selection procedure; but wealso discuss how backward selection and the combination of the two can be performedefficiently. The main contributions of this paper are (1) a simple characterization for theedges that can be added to a decomposable model while retaining its decomposability and(2) an efficient algorithm for enumerating all such edges for a given decomposable model inO (n 2) time; where n is the number of variables in the model. We also analyze thecomplexity of the overall stepwise selection procedure (which includes the complexity ofenumerating eligible edges as well as the complexity of deciding how to" progress").

SWORD: scalable workload-aware data placement for transactional workloads,Abdul Quamar; K Ashwin Kumar; Amol Deshpande,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of transparently scaling out transactional(OLTP) workloads on relational databases; to support database-as-a-service in cloudcomputing environment. The primary challenges in supporting such workloads includechoosing how to partition the data across a large number of machines; minimizing thenumber of distributed transactions; providing high data availability; and tolerating failuresgracefully. Capturing and modeling the transactional workload over a period of time; andthen exploiting that information for data placement and replication has been shown toprovide significant benefits in performance; both in terms of transaction latencies and overallthroughput.

An initial study of overheads of eddies,Amol Deshpande,Abstract An eddy [2] is a highly adaptive query processing operator that continuouslyreoptimizes a query in response to changing runtime conditions. It does this by treatingquery processing as routing of tuples through operators and making per-tuple routingdecisions. The benefits of such adaptivity can be significant; especially in highly dynamicenvironments such as data streams; sensor query processing; web querying; etc. Variousparties have asserted that the cost of making per-tuple routing decisions is prohibitive. Wehave implemented eddies in the PostgreSQL open source database system [1] in the contextof the TelegraphCQ project. In this paper; we present an" apples-to-apples" comparison ofPostgreSQL query processing overhead with and without eddies. Our results show that withsome minor tuning; the overhead of the eddy mechanism is negligible.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2004,62,4

Read-once functions and query evaluation in probabilistic databases,Prithviraj Sen; Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor,Abstract Probabilistic databases hold promise of being a viable means for large-scaleuncertainty management; increasingly needed in a number of real world applicationsdomains. However; query evaluation in probabilistic databases remains a computationalchallenge. Prior work on efficient exact query evaluation in probabilistic databases haslargely concentrated on query-centric formulations (eg; safe plans; hierarchical queries); inthat; they only consider characteristics of the query and not the data in the database. It iseasy to construct examples where a supposedly hard query run on an appropriate databasegives rise to a tractable query evaluation problem. In this paper; we develop efficient queryevaluation techniques that leverage characteristics of both the query and the data in thedatabase.

Bisimulation-based approximate lifted inference,Prithviraj Sen; Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor,Abstract There has been a great deal of recent interest in methods for performing liftedinference; however; most of this work assumes that the first-order model is given as input tothe system. Here; we describe lifted inference algorithms that determine symmetries andautomatically lift the probabilistic model to speedup inference. In particular; we describeapproximate lifted inference techniques that allow the user to trade off inference accuracy forcomputational efficiency by using a handful of tunable parameters; while keeping the errorbounded. Our algorithms are closely related to the graph-theoretic concept of bisimulation.We report experiments on both synthetic and real data to show that in the presence ofsymmetries; run-times for inference can be improved significantly; with approximate liftedinference providing orders of magnitude speedup over ground inference.,Proceedings of the twenty-fifth conference on uncertainty in artificial intelligence,2009,53,13
Consensus answers for queries over probabilistic databases,Jian Li; Amol Deshpande,Abstract We address the problem of finding a" best" deterministic query answer to a queryover a probabilistic database. For this purpose; we propose the notion of a consensus world(or a consensus answer) which is a deterministic world (answer) that minimizes theexpected distance to the possible worlds (answers). This problem can be seen as ageneralization of the well-studied inconsistent information aggregation problems (eg rankaggregation) to probabilistic databases. We consider this problem for various types ofqueries including SPJ queries; Top-k ranking queries; group-by aggregate queries; andclustering. For different distance metrics; we obtain polynomial time optimal orapproximation algorithms for computing the consensus answers (or prove NP-hardness).Most of our results are for a general probabilistic database model; called and/xor tree …,Proceedings of the twenty-eighth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2009,51,22

However; much of the research in this area has focused onefficient query evaluation and has largely ignored two key issues that commonly arise inuncertain data management: First; how to provide explanations for query results; eg; Why isthis tuple in my result? or Why does this output tuple have such high probability?. Second;the problem of determining the sensitive input tuples for the given query; eg; users areinterested to know the input tuples that can substantially alter the output; when theirprobabilities are modified (since they may be unsure about the input probability values).Existing systems provide the lineage/provenance of each of the output tuples in addition tothe output probabilities; which is a boolean formula indicating the dependence of the …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,48,16
Decoupled query optimization for federated database systems,Amol Deshpande; Joseph M Hellerstein,We study the problem of query optimization in federated relational database systems. Thenature of federated databases explicitly decouples many aspects of the optimizationprocess; often making it imperative for the optimizer to consult underlying data sources whiledoing cost-based optimization. This not only increases the cost of optimization; but alsochanges the trade-offs involved in the optimization process significantly. The dominant costin the decoupled optimization process is the" cost of costing" that traditionally has beenconsidered insignificant. The optimizer can only afford a few rounds of messages to theunderlying data sources and hence the optimization techniques in this environment must begeared toward gathering all the required cost information with minimal communication.

Cloud datamanagement systems today need to serve a range of different workloads; from analyticalread-heavy workloads to transactional (OLTP) workloads. For both the service providers andthe users; it is critical to minimize the consumption of resources like CPU; memory;communication bandwidth; and energy; without compromising on service-level agreementsif any.

On computing compression trees for data collection in wireless sensor networks,Jian Li; Amol Deshpande; Samir Khuller,We address the problem of efficiently gathering correlated data from a wireless sensornetwork; with the aim of designing algorithms with provable optimality guarantees; andunderstanding how close we can get to the known theoretical lower bounds. Our proposedapproach is based on finding an optimal or a near-optimal {\em compression tree} for agiven sensor network: a compression tree is a directed tree over the sensor network nodessuch that the value of a node is compressed using the value of its parent. We focus on {\embroadcast communication} model in this paper; but our results are more generally applicableto a unicast communication model as well.

Ef? cient Query Evaluation over Temporally Correlated Probabilistic Streams,Bhargav Kanagal; Amol Deshpande,Many real world applications such as sensor networks and other monitoring applicationsnaturally generate probabilistic streams that are highly correlated in both time and space.Query processing over such streaming data must be cognizant of these correlations; sincethey can significantly alter the final query results. Several prior works have suggestedapproaches to handling correlations in probabilistic databases. However those approachesare either unable to represent the types of correlations that probabilistic streams exhibit; orcan not be applied directly because of their complexity. In this paper; we develop a systemfor managing and querying such streams by exploiting the fact that most real-worldprobabilistic streams exhibit highly structured Markovian correlations.

Data placement and replica selection for improving co-location in distributed environments,K Ashwin Kumar; Amol Deshpande; Samir Khuller,Abstract: Increasing need for large-scale data analytics in a number of application domainshas led to a dramatic rise in the number of distributed data management systems; bothparallel relational databases; and systems that support alternative frameworks likeMapReduce. There is thus an increasing contention on scarce data center resources likenetwork bandwidth; further; the energy requirements for powering the computing equipmentare also growing dramatically. As we show empirically; increasing the execution parallelismby spreading out data across a large number of machines may achieve the intended goal ofdecreasing query latencies; but in most cases; may increase the total resource and energyconsumption significantly. For many analytical workloads; however; minimizing querylatencies is often not critical; in such scenarios; we argue that we should instead focus on …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1302.4168,2013,36,10
Adaptive query processing: why; how; when; what next?,Amol Deshpande; Zachary Ives; Vijayshankar Raman,Abstract Adaptive query processing has been the subject of a great deal of recent work;particularly in emerging data management environments such as data integration and datastreams. We provide an overview of the work in this area; identifying its common themes;laying out the space of query plans; and discussing open research problems. We discusswhy adaptive query processing is needed; how it is being implemented; where it is mostappropriately used; and finally; what next; ie; open research problems.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,36,10
Vertexica: your relational friend for graph analytics!,Alekh Jindal; Praynaa Rawlani; Eugene Wu; Samuel Madden; Amol Deshpande; Mike Stonebraker,Abstract In this paper; we present Vertexica; a graph analytics tools on top of a relationaldatabase; which is user friendly and yet highly efficient. Instead of constraining programmersto SQL; Vertexica offers a popular vertex-centric query interface; which is more natural foranalysts to express many graph queries. The programmers simply provide their vertex-compute functions and Vertexica takes care of efficiently executing them in the standard SQLengine. The advantage of using Vertexica is its ability to leverage the relational features andenable much more sophisticated graph analysis. These include expressing graphalgorithms which are difficult in vertex-centric but straightforward in SQL and the ability tocompose end-to-end data processing pipelines; including pre-and post-processing ofgraphs as well as combining multiple algorithms for deeper insights. Vertexica has a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,35,10
Approximation algorithms for stochastic boolean function evaluation and stochastic submodular set cover,Amol Deshpande; Lisa Hellerstein; Devorah Kletenik,Abstract We present approximation algorithms for two problems: Stochastic BooleanFunction Evaluation (SBFE) and Stochastic Submodular Set Cover (SSSC). Our results forSBFE problems are obtained by reducing them to SSSC problems through the constructionof appropriate utility functions. We give a new algorithm for the SSSC problem that we callAdaptive Dual Greedy. We use this algorithm to obtain a 3-approximation algorithm solvingthe SBFE problem for linear threshold formulas. We also get a 3-approximation algorithm forthe closely related Stochastic Min-Knapsack problem; and a 2-approximation for a naturalspecial case of that problem. In addition; we prove a new approximation bound for aprevious algorithm for the SSSC problem; Adaptive Greedy. We consider an approach toapproximating SBFE problems using existing techniques; which we call the Q-value …,*,2014,34,22
Lineage processing over correlated probabilistic databases,Bhargav Kanagal; Amol Deshpande,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of scalably evaluating conjunctive queriesover correlated probabilistic databases containing tuple or attribute uncertainties. Likeprevious work; we adopt a two-phase approach where we first compute lineages of theoutput tuples; and then compute the probabilities of the lineage formulas. However unlikeprevious work; we allow for arbitrary and complex correlations to be present in the data;captured via a forest of junction trees. We observe that evaluating even read-once (treestructured) lineages (eg; those generated by hierarchical conjunctive queries); polynomiallycomputable over tuple independent probabilistic databases; is# P-complete for lightlycorrelated probabilistic databases like Markov sequences. We characterize the complexity ofexact computation of the probability of the lineage formula on a correlated database using …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,33,10
Predictive modeling-based data collection in wireless sensor networks,Lidan Wang; Amol Deshpande,Abstract We address the problem of designing practical; energy-efficient protocols for datacollection in wireless sensor networks using predictive modeling. Prior work has suggestedseveral approaches to capture and exploit the rich spatio-temporal correlations prevalent inWSNs during data collection. Although shown to be effective in reducing the data collectioncost; those approaches use simplistic corelation models and further; ignore manyidiosyncrasies of WSNs; in particular the broadcast nature of communication. Our proposedapproach is based on approximating the joint probability distribution over the sensors usingundirected graphical models; ideally suited to exploit both the spatial correlations and thebroadcast nature of communication. We present algorithms for optimally using such a modelfor data collection under different communication models; and for identifying an …,*,2008,32,10
Minimizing communication cost in distributed multi-query processing,Jian Li; Amol Deshpande; Samir Khuller,Increasing prevalence of large-scale distributed monitoring and computing environmentssuch as sensor networks; scientific federations; Grids etc.; has led to a renewed interest inthe area of distributed query processing and optimization. In this paper we address ageneral; distributed multi-query processing problem motivated by the need to minimize thecommunication cost in these environments. Specifically we address the problem of optimallysharing data movement across the communication edges in a distributed communicationnetwork given a set of overlapping queries and query plans for them (specifying theoperations to be executed). Most of the problem variations of our general problem can beshown to be NP-Hard by a reduction from the Steiner tree problem. However; we show thatthe problem can be solved optimally if the communication network is a tree; and present a …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,31,10
A temporal pattern search algorithm for personal history event visualization,Taowei David Wang; Amol Deshpande; Ben Shneiderman,We present Temporal Pattern Search (TPS); a novel algorithm for searching for temporalpatterns of events in historical personal histories. The traditional method of searching forsuch patterns uses an automaton-based approach over a single array of events; sorted bytime stamps. Instead; TPS operates on a set of arrays; where each array contains all eventsof the same type; sorted by time stamps. TPS searches for a particular item in the patternusing a binary search over the appropriate arrays. Although binary search is considerablymore expensive per item; it allows TPS to skip many unnecessary events in personalhistories. We show that TPS's running time is bounded by O (m 2 n lg (n)); where m is thelength of (number of events) a search pattern; and n is the number of events in a record(history). Although the asymptotic running time of TPS is inferior to that of a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,30,22
Lightweight graphical models for selectivity estimation without independence assumptions,Kostas Tzoumas; Amol Deshpande; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT As a result of decades of research and industrial development; modern queryoptimizers are complex software artifacts. However; the quality of the query plan chosen byan optimizer is largely determined by the quality of the underlying statistical summaries.Small selectivity estimation errors; propagated exponentially; can lead to severely sub-optimal plans. Modern optimizers typically maintain one-dimensional statistical summariesand make the attribute value independence and join uniformity assumptions for efficientlyestimating selectivities. Therefore; selectivity estimation errors in today's optimizers arefrequently caused by missed correlations between attributes. We present a selectivityestimation approach that does not make the independence assumptions. By carefully usingconcepts from the field of graphical models; we are able to factor the joint probability …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,29,14
Flow algorithms for parallel query optimization,Amol Deshpande; Lisa Hellerstein,We address the problem of minimizing the response time of a multi-way join query usingpipelined (inter-operator) parallelism; in a parallel or a distributed environment. We observethat in order to fully exploit the parallelism in the system; we must consider a new class of"interleaving" plans; where multiple query plans are used simultaneously to minimize theresponse time of a query (or to maximize the tuple-throughput of the system). We cast thequery planning problem in this environment as a" flow maximization problem"; and presentpolynomial-time algorithms that (statically) find the optimal set of plans to use for a givenquery; for a large class of multi-way join queries. Our proposed algorithms also naturallyextend to query optimization over web services. Finally we present an extensiveexperimental evaluation that demonstrates both the need to consider such plans in …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,29,22
Principles of dataset versioning: Exploring the recreation/storage tradeoff,Souvik Bhattacherjee; Amit Chavan; Silu Huang; Amol Deshpande; Aditya Parameswaran,Abstract The relative ease of collaborative data science and analysis has led to aproliferation of many thousands or millions of versions of the same datasets in manyscientific and commercial domains; acquired or constructed at various stages of dataanalysis across many users; and often over long periods of time. Managing; storing; andrecreating these dataset versions is a non-trivial task. The fundamental challenge here is thestorage-recreation trade-off: the more storage we use; the faster it is to recreate or retrieveversions; while the less storage we use; the slower it is to recreate or retrieve versions.Despite the fundamental nature of this problem; there has been a surprisingly little amount ofwork on it. In this paper; we study this trade-off in a principled manner: we formulate sixproblems under various settings; trading off these quantities in various ways; demonstrate …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,28,22
Model-based querying in sensor networks,Amol Deshpande; Carlos Guestrin; Sam Madden,Advances in high throughput sequencing and ''omics''technologies and the resultingexponential growth in the amount of macromolecular sequence; structure; gene expressionmeasurements; have unleashed a transformation of biology from a data-poor science into anincreasingly data-rich science. Despite these advances; biology today; much like physicswas before Newton and Leibnitz; has remained a largely descriptive science. Machinelearning [6] currently offers some of the most cost-effective tools for building predictivemodels from biological data; eg; for annotating new genomic sequences; for predictingmacromolecular function; for identifying functionally important sites in proteins; for identifyinggenetic markers of diseases; and for discovering the networks of genetic interactions thatorchestrate important biological processes [3].

IrisNet is a potentially global network of smartsensing nodes; with webcams or other monitoring devices; and organizing nodes thatprovide the means to query recent and historical sensor-based data. IrisNet exploits the factthat high-volume sensor feeds are typically attached to devices with significant computingpower and storage; and running a standard operating system. It uses aggressive filtering;smart query routing; and semantic caching to dramatically reduce network bandwidthutilization and improve query response times.

Representing tuple and attribute uncertainty in probabilistic databases,Prithviraj Sen; Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor,There has been a recent surge in work in probabilistic databases; propelled in large part bythe huge increase in noisy data sources-sensor data; experimental data; data fromuncurated sources; and many others. There is a growing need to be able to flexiblyrepresent the uncertainties in the data; and to efficiently query the data. Building on existingprobabilistic database work; we present a unifying framework which allows a flexiblerepresentation of correlated tuple and attribute level uncertainties. An important capability ofour representation is the ability to represent shared correlation structures in the data. Weprovide motivating examples to illustrate when such shared correlation structures are likelyto exist. Representing shared correlations structures allows the use of sophisticatedinference techniques based on lifted probabilistic inference that; in turn; allows us to …,Data Mining Workshops; 2007.

Energy efficient monitoring in sensor networks,Amol Deshpande; Samir Khuller; Azarakhsh Malekian; Mohammed Toossi,Abstract In this paper we study a set of problems related to efficient energy management formonitoring applications in wireless sensor networks. We study several generalizations of abasic problem called Set k-Cover; which can be described as follows: we are given a set ofsensors; and a set of regions to be monitored. Each region can be monitored by a subset ofthe sensors. To increase the lifetime of the sensor network; we would like to partition thesensors into k sets (or time-slots) and activate each partition in a different time-slot. The goalis to find the partitioning that maximizes the coverage of the regions. This problem is knownto be NP-hard. We first develop improved approximation algorithms for this problem basedon its similarities to the max k-cut problem. We then consider a variation; called Set (k; α)-cover; where each sensor is allowed to be active in α different time-slots.

Eagr: Supporting continuous ego-centric aggregate queries over large dynamic graphs,Jayanta Mondal; Amol Deshpande,Abstract In this paper; we present EAGr; a system for supporting large numbers ofcontinuous neighborhood-based (" ego-centric") aggregate queries over large; highlydynamic; rapidly evolving graphs. Examples of such queries include computation ofpersonalized; tailored trends in social networks; anomaly or event detection incommunication or financial transaction networks; local search and alerts in spatio-temporalnetworks; to name a few. Key challenges in supporting such continuous queries include veryhigh update rates typically seen in these situations; large numbers of queries that need to beexecuted simultaneously; stringent low latency requirements. In this paper; we propose aflexible; general; extensible in-memory framework for executing different types of ego-centricaggregate queries over large dynamic graphs with low latencies.

Graphical models for uncertain data,Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor; Prithviraj Sen,Abstract Graphical models are a popular and well-studied framework for compactrepresentation of a joint probability distribution over a large number of interdependentvariables; and for efficient reasoning about such a distribution. They have been provenuseful in a wide range of domains from natural language processing to computer vision tobioinformatics. In this chapter; we present an approach to using graphical models formanaging and querying large-scale uncertain databases. We present a unified frameworkbased on the concepts from graphical models that can model not only tuple-level andattribute-level uncertainties; but can also handle arbitrary correlations that may be presentamong the data; our framework can also naturally capture shared correlations where thesame uncertainties and correlations occur repeatedly in the data.

Flow algorithms for two pipelined filter ordering problems,Anne Condon; Amol Deshpande; Lisa Hellerstein; Ning Wu,Abstract Pipelined filter ordering is a central problem in database query optimization; andhas received renewed attention recently in the context of environments such as the web;continuous high-speed data streams and sensor networks. We present algorithms for twonatural extensions of the classical pipelined filter ordering problem:(1) a distributional typeproblem where the filters run in parallel and the goal is to maximize throughput; and (2) anadversarial type problem where the goal is to minimize the expected value of multiplicativeregret. We show that both problems can be solved using similar flow algorithms; which findan optimal ordering scheme in time O (n 2); where n is the number of filters. Our algorithm for(1) improves on an earlier O (n 3 log n) algorithm of Kodialam.,Proceedings of the twenty-fifth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2006,23,23
Subgraph pattern matching over uncertain graphs with identity linkage uncertainty,Walaa Eldin Moustafa; Angelika Kimmig; Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor,There is a growing need for methods that can represent and query uncertain graphs. Theseuncertain graphs are often the result of an information extraction and integration system thatattempts to extract an entity graph or a knowledge graph from multiple unstructured sources[25];[7]. Such an integration typically leads to identity uncertainty; as different data sourcesmay use different references to the same underlying real-world entities. Integration usuallyalso introduces additional uncertainty on node attributes and edge existence. In this paper;we propose the notion of a probabilistic entity graph (PEG); a formal model that uniformlyand systematically addresses these three types of uncertainty. A PEG is a probabilistic graphmodel that defines a distribution over possible graphs at the entity level. We introduce ageneral framework for constructing a PEG given uncertain data at the reference level and …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,21,22
NScale: neighborhood-centric large-scale graph analytics in the cloud,Abdul Quamar; Amol Deshpande; Jimmy Lin,Abstract There is an increasing interest in executing complex analyses over large graphs;many of which require processing a large number of multi-hop neighborhoods or subgraphs.Examples include ego network analysis; motif counting; finding social circles; personalizedrecommendations; link prediction; anomaly detection; analyzing influence cascades; andothers. These tasks are not well served by existing vertex-centric graph processingframeworks; where user programs are only able to directly access the state of a single vertexat a time; resulting in high communication; scheduling; and memory overheads in executingsuch tasks. Further; most existing graph processing frameworks ignore the challenges inextracting the relevant portions of the graph that an analysis task is interested in; andloading those onto distributed memory.

Efficiently adapting graphical models for selectivity estimation,Kostas Tzoumas; Amol Deshpande; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Query optimizers rely on statistical models that succinctly describe the underlyingdata. Models are used to derive cardinality estimates for intermediate relations; which in turnguide the optimizer to choose the best query execution plan. The quality of the resulting planis highly dependent on the accuracy of the statistical model that represents the data. It is wellknown that small errors in the model estimates propagate exponentially through joins; andmay result in the choice of a highly sub-optimal query execution plan. Most commercialquery optimizers make the attribute value independence assumption: all attributes areassumed to be statistically independent. This reduces the statistical model of the data to acollection of one-dimensional synopses (typically in the form of histograms); and it permitsthe optimizer to estimate the selectivity of a predicate conjunction as the product of the …,The VLDB Journal,2013,20,3
Declarative analysis of noisy information networks,Walaa Eldin Moustafa; Galileo Namata; Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor,There is a growing interest in methods for analyzing data describing networks of all types;including information; biological; physical; and social networks. Typically the data describingthese networks is observational; and thus noisy and incomplete; it is often at the wrong levelof fidelity and abstraction for meaningful data analysis. This has resulted in a growing bodyof work on extracting; cleaning; and annotating network data. Unfortunately; much of thiswork is ad hoc and domain-specific. In this paper; we present the architecture of a datamanagement system that enables efficient; declarative analysis of large-scale informationnetworks. We identify a set of primitives to support the extraction and inference of a networkfrom observational data; and describe a framework that enables a network analyst to easilyimplement and combine new extraction and analysis techniques; and efficiently apply …,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,20,10
Network-aware join processing in global-scale database federations,Xiaodan Wang; Randal Burns; Andreas Terzis; Amol Deshpande,We introduce join scheduling algorithms that employ a balanced network utilization metric tooptimize the use of all network paths in a global-scale database federation. This metricallows algorithms to exploit excess capacity in the network; while avoiding narrow; long-haulpaths. We give a two-approximate; polynomial-time algorithm for serial (left-deep) joinschedules. We also present extensions to this algorithm that explore parallel schedules;reduce resource usage; and define trade-offs between computation and network utilization.We evaluate these techniques within the SkyQuery federation of Astronomy databases usingspatial-join queries submitted by SkyQuery's users. Experiments show that our algorithmsrealize near-optimal network utilization with minor computational overhead.,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,20,22
Hone: Scaling down hadoop on shared-memory systems,K Ashwin Kumar; Jonathan Gluck; Amol Deshpande; Jimmy Lin,Abstract The underlying assumption behind Hadoop and; more generally; the need fordistributed processing is that the data to be analyzed cannot be held in memory on a singlemachine. Today; this assumption needs to be re-evaluated. Although petabyte-scale data-stores are increasingly common; it is unclear whether" typical" analytics tasks require morethan a single high-end server. Additionally; we are seeing increased sophistication inanalytics; eg; machine learning; which generally operates over smaller and more refineddatasets. To address these trends; we propose" scaling down" Hadoop to run on shared-memory machines. This paper presents a prototype runtime called Hone; intended to beboth API and binary compatible with standard (distributed) Hadoop. That is; Hone can takean existing Hadoop jar and efficiently execute it; without modification; on a multi-core …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,19,23

Graphgen: Exploring interesting graphs in relational data,Konstantinos Xirogiannopoulos; Udayan Khurana; Amol Deshpande,Abstract Analyzing interconnection structures among the data through the use of graphalgorithms and graph analytics has been shown to provide tremendous value in manyapplication domains. However; graphs are not the primary choice for how most data iscurrently stored; and users who want to employ graph analytics are forced to extract datafrom their data stores; construct the requisite graphs; and then use a specialized engine towrite and execute their graph analysis tasks. This cumbersome and costly process not onlyraises barriers in using graph analytics; but also makes it hard to explore and identify hiddenor implicit graphs in the data.

Maximizing expected utility for stochastic combinatorial optimization problems,Jian Li; Amol Deshpande,We study the stochastic versions of a broad class of combinatorial problems where theweights of the elements in the input dataset are uncertain. The class of problems that westudy includes shortest paths; minimum weight spanning trees; and minimum weightmatchings over probabilistic graphs; and other combinatorial problems like knapsack. Weobserve that the expected value is inadequate in capturing different types of risk averse orrisk-prone behaviors; and instead we consider a more general objective which is tomaximize the expected utility of the solution for some given utility function; rather than theexpected weight (expected weight becomes a special case). We show that we can obtain apolynomial time approximation algorithm with additive error ϵ for any ϵ>; 0; if there is apseudopolynomial time algorithm for the exact version of the problem (This is true for the …,Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS); 2011 IEEE 52nd Annual Symposium on,2011,17,10

Common practice for sharing and collaborating ondatasets involves creating or storing multiple copies of the dataset; one for each stage ofanalysis; with no provenance information tracking the relationships between these datasets.This results not only in wasted storage; but also makes it challenging to track and integratemodifications made by different users to the same dataset.

Nonetheless; there are applications;including online advertising; cloud computing and crowdsourcing markets; where detailedand fine-grained user data must be disclosed. We consider a new data sharing paradigmand introduce the problem of privacy-aware data partitioning; where a sensitive dataset mustbe partitioned among k untrusted parties (adversaries).

Algorithms for distributional and adversarial pipelined filter ordering problems,Anne Condon; Amol Deshpande; Lisa Hellerstein; Ning Wu,Abstract Pipelined filter ordering is a central problem in database query optimization. Theproblem is to determine the optimal order in which to apply a given set of commutative filters(predicates) to a set of elements (the tuples of a relation); so as to find; as efficiently aspossible; the tuples that satisfy all of the filters. Optimization of pipelined filter ordering hasrecently received renewed attention in the context of environments such as the Web;continuous high-speed data streams; and sensor networks. Pipelined filter orderingproblems are also studied in areas such as fault detection and machine learning undernames such as learning with attribute costs; minimum-sum set cover; and satisficing search.We present algorithms for two natural extensions of the classical pipelined filter orderingproblem:(1) a distributional-type problem where the filters run in parallel and the goal is to …,ACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG),2009,12,4
Big graph analytics systems,Da Yan; Yingyi Bu; Yuanyuan Tian; Amol Deshpande; James Cheng,Abstract In recent years we have witnessed a surging interest in developing Big Graphprocessing systems. To date; tens of Big Graph systems have been proposed. This tutorialprovides a timely and comprehensive review of existing Big Graph systems; andsummarizes their pros and cons from various perspectives. We start from the existing vertex-centric systems; which which a programmer thinks intuitively like a vertex when developingparallel graph algorithms. We then introduce systems that adopt other computationparadigms and execution settings. The topics covered in this tutorial include programmingmodels and algorithm design; computation models; communication mechanisms; out-of-coresupport; fault tolerance; dynamic graph support; and so on. We also highlight future researchopportunities on Big Graph analytics.,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,11,22
Storing and analyzing historical graph data at scale,Udayan Khurana; Amol Deshpande,Abstract: The work on large-scale graph analytics to date has largely focused on the study ofstatic properties of graph snapshots. However; a static view of interactions between entitiesis often an oversimplification of several complex phenomena like the spread of epidemics;information diffusion; formation of online communities}; and so on. Being able to findtemporal interaction patterns; visualize the evolution of graph properties; or even simplycompare them across time; adds significant value in reasoning over graphs. However;because of lack of underlying data management support; an analyst today has to manuallynavigate the added temporal complexity of dealing with large evolving graphs. In this paper;we present a system; called Historical Graph Store; that enables users to store largevolumes of historical graph data and to express and run complex temporal graph …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.08960,2015,11,22
Saving on cooling: The thermal scheduling problem,Koyel Mukherjee; Samir Khuller; Amol Deshpande,In this abstract we define some very basic scheduling problems motivated by increasingpower density and consequent cooling considerations in data centers and multi-core chips.Modern data centers consist of thousands of computers closely packed in a dense space;typically arranged as hundreds of racks of processors. The energy costs of a data centerhave been compared to that of a small town; with a significant portion contributed by the costincurred in cooling the machines [1]. The energy cost of cooling is directly driven by thesupply temperature (denoted Tsup) of the cold air being blown in to cool the data center–theincoming air is often kept at a lower than necessary temperature to prevent hotspots fromforming since those can damage the hardware. For instance; it has been observed thatservers near the top of a rack often run hotter and are subject to higher failure rates [3] …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2012,11,23
Ego-centric graph pattern census,Walaa Eldin Moustafa; Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor,There is increasing interest in analyzing networks of all types including social; biological;sensor; computer; and transportation networks. Broadly speaking; we may be interested inglobal network-wide analysis (eg; centrality analysis; community detection) where theproperties of the entire network are of interest; or local ego-centric analysis where the focusis on studying the properties of nodes (egos) by analyzing their neighborhood sub graphs. Inthis paper we propose and study ego-centric pattern census queries; a new type of graphanalysis query; where a given structural pattern is searched for in every node'sneighborhood and the counts are reported or used in further analysis.

A graph-based approach to vehicle tracking in traffic camera video streams,Hamid Haidarian Shahri; Galileo Namata; Saket Navlakha; Amol Deshpande; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract Vehicle tracking has a wide variety of applications from law enforcement to trafficplanning and public safety. However; the image resolution of the videos available from mosttraffic camera systems; make it difficult to track vehicles based on unique identifiers likelicense plates. In many cases; vehicles with similar attributes are indistinguishable from oneanother due to image quality issues. Often; network bandwidth and power constraints limitthe frame rate; as well. In this paper; we discuss the challenges of performing vehicletracking queries over video streams from ubiquitous traffic cameras. We identify thelimitations of tracking vehicles individually in such conditions and provide a novel graph-based approach using the identity of neighboring vehicles to improve the performance. Weevaluate our approach using streaming video feeds from live traffic cameras available on …,Proceedings of the 4th workshop on Data management for sensor networks: in conjunction with 33rd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases,2007,11,10
Sharing-aware horizontal partitioning for exploiting correlations during query processing,Kostas Tzoumas; Amol Deshpande; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Optimization of join queries based on average selectivities is suboptimal in highlycorrelated databases. In such databases; relations are naturally divided into partitions; eachpartition having substantially different statistical characteristics. It is very compelling todiscover such data partitions during query optimization and create multiple plans for a givenquery; one plan being optimal for a particular combination of data partitions. This scenariocalls for the sharing of state among plans; so that common intermediate results are notrecomputed. We study this problem in a setting with a routing-based query execution enginebased on eddies [1]. Eddies naturally encapsulate horizontal partitioning and maximal statesharing across multiple plans. We define the notion of a conditional join plan; a novelrepresentation of the search space that enables us to address the problem in a principled …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,9,22

Parallel pipelined filter ordering with precedence constraints,Amol Deshpande; Lisa Hellerstein,Abstract In the parallel pipelined filter ordering problem; we are given a set of n filters thatrun in parallel. The filters need to be applied to a stream of elements; to determine whichelements pass all filters. Each filter has a rate limit ri on the number of elements it canprocess per unit time; and a selectivity pi; which is the probability that a random element willpass the filter. The goal is to maximize throughput. This problem appears naturally in avariety of settings; including parallel query optimization in databases and query processingover Web services. We present an O (n 3) algorithm for this problem; given tree-structuredprecedence constraints on the filters. This extends work of Condon et al.[2009] andKodialam [2001]; who presented algorithms for solving the problem without precedenceconstraints. Our algorithm is combinatorial and produces a sparse solution. Motivated by …,ACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG),2012,7,22
Local structure and determinism in probabilistic databases,Theodoros Rekatsinas; Amol Deshpande; Lise Getoor,Abstract While extensive work has been done on evaluating queries over tuple-independentprobabilistic databases; query evaluation over correlated data has received much lessattention even though the support for correlations is essential for many natural applicationsof probabilistic databases; eg; information extraction; data integration; computer vision; etc.In this paper; we develop a novel approach for efficiently evaluating probabilistic queriesover correlated databases where correlations are represented using a factor graph; a classof graphical models widely used for capturing correlations and performing statisticalinference. Our approach exploits the specific values of the factor parameters and thedeterminism in the correlations; collectively called local structure; to reduce the complexity ofquery evaluation. Our framework is based on arithmetic circuits; factorized …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,7,18
Toward on-line schema evolution for non-stop systems,Amol Deshpande; Michael Hicks,Schemas are a central component of any database system; and have been an area ofintense research from the very beginning of the field. In the past; this work has mainlyfocused on using conceptual modeling techniques to generate schemas from applicationrequirements; schema normalization; schema mapping and schema matching in dataintegration systems. Dynamically changing schemas; on the other hand; have receivedmuch less attention; especially in the context of relational database systems. We conjecturethree reasons for this:(1) a perception that schemas do not need to evolve; ie; that they areessentially static;(2) a belief that if they do need to evolve; it can be done off-line; and (3) thateven if on-line evolution was desirable; it is too hard to implement.

Algorithms for the thermal scheduling problem,Koyel Mukherjee; Samir Khuller; Amol Deshpande,The energy costs for cooling a data center constitute a significant portion of the overallrunning costs. Thermal imbalance and hot spots that arise due to imbalanced workloadslead to significant wasted cooling effort-in order to ensure that no equipment is operatingabove a certain temperature; the data center may be cooled more than necessary. Thereforeit is desirable to schedule the workload in a data center in a thermally aware manner;assigning jobs to machines not just based on local load of the machines; but based on theoverall thermal profile of the data center. This is challenging because of the spatial cross-interference between machines; where a job assigned to a machine may impact not onlythat machine's temperature; but also nearby machines. Here; we continue formal analysis ofthe thermal scheduling problem that we initiated recently [25]. In that work; the notion of …,Parallel & Distributed Processing (IPDPS); 2013 IEEE 27th International Symposium on,2013,6,22
Energy efficient monitoring in sensor networks,Amol Deshpande; Samir Khuller; Azarakhsh Malekian; Mohammed Toossi,Abstract We study a set of problems related to efficient battery energy utilization formonitoring applications in a wireless sensor network with the goal to increase the sensornetwork lifetime. We study several generalizations of a basic problem called Set k-Cover.The problem can be described as follows: we are given a set of sensors; and a set of targetsto be monitored. Each target can be monitored by a subset of the sensors. To increase thelifetime of the sensor network; we would like to partition the sensors into k sets (or time-slots); and activate each set of sensors in a different time-slot; thus extending the battery lifeof the sensors by a factor of k. The goal is to find a partitioning that maximizes the totalcoverage of the targets for a given k. This problem is known to be NP-hard. We develop animproved approximation algorithm for this problem using a reduction to Max k-Cut …,Algorithmica,2011,6,22
Data compression in sensor networks,Amol Deshpande,realized using such logical structures. For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,6,10

Stream querying and reasoning on social data,Jayanta Mondal; Amol Deshpande,While a great many useful statistical models and visualizations have been developed toexplore large-scale complex networks; fewer have attempted to relate these models to datagenerated by samples. While; in many fields; complete (or near-complete) data is widelyavailable; and while the Internet has made even more readily available; complete dataabout large-scale complex networks sufficient to answer many compelling social sciencequestions does not exist and cannot be reasonably generated. In these cases; samplingtheory must be used to connect data to models. This proves difficult for a variety of reasonssuch as: data collection methodologies which; while attempting to overcome nonresponsebias; deviate from standard sampling practices; and; the non-independence of both firstneighbors and second neighbors.

On computing compression trees for data collection in sensor networks,Jian Li; Amol Deshpande; Samir Khuller,Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently gathering correlated data from a wired or awireless sensor network; with the aim of designing algorithms with provable optimalityguarantees; and understanding how close we can get to the known theoretical lowerbounds. Our proposed approach is based on finding an optimal or a near-optimal {\emcompression tree} for a given sensor network: a compression tree is a directed tree over thesensor network nodes such that the value of a node is compressed using the value of itsparent. We consider this problem under different communication models; including the {\embroadcast communication} model that enables many new opportunities for energy-efficientdata collection. We draw connections between the data collection problem and a previouslystudied graph concept; called {\em weakly connected dominating sets}; and we use this to …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0907.5442,2009,5,22
Mining a world of smart sensors,Suman Nath; Amol Deshpande; Phillip B Gibbons; Srinivasan Seshan,Imagine driving towards a destination in a busy metropolitan area. While stopped at a trafficlight; you query your PDA specifying your destination and criteria for desirable parkingspaces (eg; within two blocks of your destination; at least a four hour meter). You get backdirections to an available parking space satisfying your criteria. Hours later; you realize thatyour meter is about to run out. You query your PDA to discover that; historically; meterenforcers are not likely to pass by your car in the next hour. A half hour later; you return toyour car and discover that although it has not been ticketed; it has been dented! Queryingyour PDA; you get back images showing how your car was dented and by whom.

Crowdgather: Entity extraction over structured domains,Theodoros Rekatsinas; Amol Deshpande; Aditya Parameswaran,Abstract: Crowdsourced entity extraction is often used to acquire data for many applications;including recommendation systems; construction of aggregated listings and directories; andknowledge base construction. Current solutions focus on entity extraction using a singlequery; eg; only using" give me another restaurant"; when assembling a list of all restaurants.Due to the cost of human labor; solutions that focus on a single query can be highlyimpractical. In this paper; we leverage the fact that entity extraction often focuses on {\emstructured domains}; ie; domains that are described by a collection of attributes; eachpotentially exhibiting hierarchical structure. Given such a domain; we enable a richer spaceof queries; eg;" give me another Moroccan restaurant in Manhattan that does takeout".Naturally; enabling a richer space of queries comes with a host of issues; especially since …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.06823,2015,4,4
Pstore: an efficient storage framework for managing scientific data,Souvik Bhattacherjee; Amol Deshpande; Alan Sussman,Abstract In this paper; we present the design; implementation; and evaluation of PStore; a no-overwrite storage framework for managing large volumes of array data generated byscientific simulations. PStore consists of two modules; a data ingestion module and a queryprocessing module; that respectively address two of the key challenges in scientificsimulation data management. The data ingestion module is geared toward handling thehigh volumes of simulation data generated at a very rapid rate; which often makes itimpossible to offload the data onto storage devices; the module is responsible for selectingan appropriate compression scheme for the data at hand; chunking the data; and thencompressing it before sending it to the storage nodes.

Hinge: enabling temporal network analytics at scale,Udayan Khurana; Amol Deshpande,Abstract However; much of the prior work on those topics has been restricted to staticnetworks; a primary reason being the lack of efficient temporal data management systems tostore and query large dynamic network datasets.

Prdb: Managing large-scale correlated probabilistic databases,Amol Deshpande,Abstract Increasing numbers of real-world application domains are generating data that isinherently noisy; incomplete; and probabilistic in nature. Statistical inference andprobabilistic modeling often introduce another layer of uncertainty on top of that. Examplesof such data include measurement data collected by sensor networks; observation data inthe context of social networks; scientific and biomedical data; and data collected by variousonline cyber-sources. Over the last few years; numerous approaches have been proposed;and several systems built; to integrate uncertainty into databases. However; theseapproaches typically make simplistic and restrictive assumptions concerning the types ofuncertainties that can be represented. Most importantly; they often make highly restrictiveindependence assumptions; and cannot easily model rich correlations among the tuples …,International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management,2009,4,10
On using correlation-based synopses during query optimization,Amol V Deshpande; Joseph M Hellerstein,Abstract In recent years; a variety of complex synopsis structures have been proposed tocapture statistical correlations present in database relations. The goal of that work has beento improve cardinality estimation during query optimization by improving statistics on basetables. In order to use the correlation information for multi-table estimations as well;synopses must also be constructed on intermediate result tables during query optimization.We address that problem here; and show how to efficiently integrate multi-dimensionalhistograms and other complex synopsis structures into the search algorithm of a traditionalquery optimizer such as that of System R. A main challenge in this work is minimizing thecomputational expense of dynamically computing synopses on intermediate tables duringquery optimization. We show that one only needs to construct a very small subset of all …,*,2002,4,18

Catching worms; Trojan horses and PUPs: Unsupervised detection of silent delivery campaigns,Bum Jun Kwon; Virinchi Srinivas; Amol Deshpande; Tudor Dumitraş,Abstract: The growing commoditization of the underground economy has given rise tomalware delivery networks; which charge fees for quickly delivering malware or unwantedsoftware to a large number of hosts. To provide this service; a key method is theorchestration of silent delivery campaigns; which involve a group of downloaders thatreceive remote commands and that deliver their payloads without any user interaction.These campaigns have not been characterized systematically; unlike other aspects ofmalware delivery networks. Moreover; silent delivery campaigns can evade detection byrelying on inconspicuous downloaders on the client side and on disposable domain nameson the server side. We describe Beewolf; a system for detecting silent delivery campaignsfrom Internet-wide records of download events.

Typicallythe data describing these networks is observational; and thus noisy and incomplete; it isoften at the wrong level of fidelity and abstraction for meaningful data analysis. Thisdemonstration presents GrDB; a system that enables data analysts to write declarativeprograms to specify and combine different network data cleaning tasks; visualize the output;and engage in the process of decision review and correction if necessary. The declarativeinterface of GrDB makes it very easy to quickly write analysis tasks and execute them overdata; while the visual component facilitates debugging the program and performing finegrained corrections.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,3,22

Graphgen: Adaptive graph processing using relational databases,Konstantinos Xirogiannopoulos; Virinchi Srinivas; Amol Deshpande,Abstract Graph querying and analytics are becoming an increasingly important componentof the arsenal of tools for extracting different kinds of insights from data. Despite an immenseamount of work on those topics; graphs are largely still handled in an ad hoc manner; in partbecause most data continues to reside in relational-like data management systems; andbecause graph analytics/querying typically forms a small portion of the overall analysispipelines. In this paper we describe an end-to-end graph analysis framework; calledGraphGen; that sits atop an RDBMS; and supports graph querying/analytics through:(a)defining graphs as transformations over underlying relational datasets (as Graph-Views)and (b) specifying queries or analytics on those graphs using either a high-level language orJava programs against a simple graph API.

Extracting and analyzing hidden graphs from relational databases,Konstantinos Xirogiannopoulos; Amol Deshpande,Abstract Analyzing interconnection structures among underlying entities or objects in adataset through the use of graph analytics can provide tremendous value in manyapplication domains. However; graphs are not the primary representation choice for storingmost data today; and in order to have access to these analyses; users are forced to manuallyextract data from their data stores; construct the requisite graphs; and then load them intosome graph engine in order to execute their graph analysis task. Moreover; in many cases(especially when the graphs are dense); these graphs can be significantly larger than theinitial input stored in the database; making it infeasible to construct or analyze such graphsin memory.

Delta encoding is an effective and widely-used solution to compactlystore a large number of datasets; that simultaneously exploits redundancies across themand keeps the average retrieval cost of reconstructing any dataset low. However; supportingany kind of rich retrieval or querying functionality; beyond single dataset checkout; ischallenging in such storage engines.

Such patterns oftenneed to reason about how the nodes are connected to each other (ie; the structuralcomponent) as well as how the nodes behave in the network (ie; the activity component). Anexample of such an activity-driven subgraph pattern is a clique of users in a social network(the structural predicate); who each have posted more than 10 messages in last 2 hours (theactivity-based predicate).

On Sharing Private Data with Multiple Non-Colluding Adversaries,Theodoros Rekatsinas; Amol Deshpande; Ashwin Machanavajjhala,Abstract: We present SPARSI; a theoretical framework for partitioning sensitive data acrossmultiple non-colluding adversaries. Most work in privacy-aware data sharing has considereddisclosing summaries where the aggregate information about the data is preserved; butsensitive user information is protected. Nonetheless; there are applications; including onlineadvertising; cloud computing and crowdsourcing markets; where detailed and fine-graineduser-data must be disclosed. We consider a new data sharing paradigm and introduce theproblem of privacy-aware data partitioning; where a sensitive dataset must be partitionedamong k untrusted parties (adversaries). The goal is to maximize the utility derived bypartitioning and distributing the dataset; while minimizing the amount of sensitive informationdisclosed. The data should be distributed so that an adversary; without colluding with …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1302.6556,2013,1,23

Ranking and clustering in probabilistic databases,Jian Li; Barna Saha; Amol Deshpande,Abstract The dramatic growth in the number of application domains that naturally generateprobabilistic; uncertain data has resulted in a need for efficiently supporting complexquerying and decision-making over such data. In this paper; we address the problem of on-the-fly clustering and ranking over probabilistic databases. We begin with a systematicexploration of ranking in probabilistic databases by viewing it as a multi-criteria optimizationproblem; and by deriving a set of features that capture the key properties of a probabilisticdataset that dictate the ranked result. We contend that a single; specific ranking function maynot suffice for probabilistic databasess; and we instead propose two parameterized rankingfunctions; called P RFw and P RFe; that can approximate many of the previously proposedranking functions. We present several novel algorithms for efficient computing such …,*,2008,1,4
Building Internet-Scale Sensor Services using a Hierarchy of Brilliant Rocks,Phillip B Gibbons; Brad Karp; Srinivasan Seshan; Suman Nath; Amol Deshpande; Yan Ke,Abstract Motivated by continuing advances in low-cost; low-power computation andcommunication devices; the research community has aggressively pursued an agenda insensor networks that focuses on algorithms and systems for contiguous; localizeddeployments of resource-limited devices; such as smart dust and motes. Yet many usefulsensor services require significantly greater computational and/or storage resources; eg;those that use streams from video cameras as input. These services will need the greater;PC-class resources of brilliant rocks; beyond those of smart dust. Further; little to no attentionhas been given the design of a wide-area sensor network architecture that allows users toview an Internet-scale collection of sensors as a unit.

Thread Migration in the River Dataflow Environment,Ron Avnur; Amol Deshpande; Mohana K Lakhamraju,Abstract River is a prototype IO programming environment for large-scale cluster ofworkstations. The assignment of the data flow and its operators called modules toparticipating nodes is currently done statically before any processing starts. The flow isdynamic because some data can be routed to modules that are processing data faster. Weintroduce module migration by migrating the underlying thread as an orthogonal load-balancing method. Module migration can help reduce load on nodes and improveperformance by co-locating modules that communicate frequently.,University of California Berkeley CS Dept. Technical Report,*,1,22
Managing and Querying Multi-versioned Documents using a Distributed Key-Value Store,Souvik Bhattacherjee; Amol Deshpande,Abstract: We address the problem of compactly storing a large number of versions(snapshots) of a collection of keyed documents or records in a distributed environment;while efficiently answering a variety of retrieval queries over those; including retrieving full orpartial versions; and evolution histories for specific keys.

RStore: efficient multiversion document management in the cloud,Souvik Bhattacherjee; Amol Deshpande,Abstract Motivation. The iterative and exploratory nature of the data science process;combined with an increasing need to support debugging; historical queries; auditing;provenance; and reproducibility; warrants the need to store and query a large number ofversions of a dataset. This realization has led to many efforts at building data managementsystems that support versioning as a first-class construct; both in academia [1; 3; 5; 6] and inindustry (eg; git; Datomic; noms). These systems typically support rich versioning/branchingfunctionality and complex queries over versioned information but lack the capability to hostversions of a collection of keyed records or documents in a distributed environment or acloud. Alternatively; key-value stores 1 (eg; Apache Cassandra; HBase; MongoDB) areappealing in many collaborative scenarios spanning geographically distributed teams …,Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing,2017,*,10
Parallel SPARQL Query Optimization,Buwen Wu; Yongluan Zhou; Hai Jin; Amol Deshpande,Existing parallel SPARQL query optimizers assume hash-based data partitioning and adoptplan enumeration algorithms with unnecessarily high complexity. Therefore; they cannoteasily accommodate other partitioning methods and only consider an unnecessarily limitedplan space. To address these problems; we first define a generic RDF data partitioningmodel to capture the common structure of various state-of-the-art RDF data partitioningmethods. Then we propose a query plan enumeration algorithm that not only has an optimalefficiency; but also accommodates different data partitioning methods. Furthermore; basedon a solid analysis of the complexity of the plan enumeration algorithm; we propose two newheuristic methods that can consider a much larger plan space than the existing methods;and at the same time can still confine the search space of the algorithm.

An Integer Programming Approach to Temporal Pattern Matching Queries,Megan Monroe; Amol Deshpande,Around the globe; an increasing number of our actions and activities are being recorded andstored as categorized; time stamped events. This type of data; which comprises electronichealth records; shipment tracking data; and process logs; is well-suited to the tabularstructure of standard database relations. The difficulty; however; is that temporal patternmatching queries (one of the most common types of queries over this type of data) are notwell-suited to standard relational query processing. This difficulty is exacerbated when thequestion is not only whether an event record matches a given query; but how best to matchthe events in the record to the events in the query when multiple options are present. In thispaper; we demonstrate that temporal pattern matching queries can be formulated andsolved as integer programs.

Design of triple band rectangular microstrip antenna using two elements,A Deshpande; A Kadam; V Dongre,Abstract This paper describes the design of the triple band rectangular microstrip antennausing inset feed where three bands are combined with only two dual band patches. Theantenna is designed to operate in the ISM band at 2.4 GHz; lower UNII band at 5.2 GHz andWiMAX at 3.6 GHz. The dimensions of each single element of the microstrip antenna; atthese operating frequencies are calculated using transmission line model. Each element ofinset fed antenna will resonate at two frequencies (Hence Dual band patches).

The class ofproblems that we study includes shortest paths; minimum weight spanning trees; andminimum weight matchings over probabilistic graphs; top-k queries over probabilisticdatasets; and other combinatorial problems like knapsack.

Handling estimation errors in database query processing,Amol Vishnupant Deshpande,Abstract A query optimizer is among the core pieces of a modern database managementsystem; responsible for choosing a query execution plan for a user-provided declarativequery. Query optimizers typically employ a cost estimation procedure to compare costs ofdifferent execution plans. Errors in this estimation process are quite common and arise dueto reasons such as incomplete and insufficient statistical information about the data; andhighly variable runtime environments that can affect the plan costs in unpredictablemanners. Two approaches have been previously proposed for handling such estimationerrors:(1) building sophisticated synopsis techniques that succintly summarize the data inthe database and thus provide more statistical information to the query optimizer; and (2)aggressive reoptimization schemes that attempt to change the execution plans chosen to …,*,2004,*,4

NEED OF PRIVACY PRESERVATION IN CLOUD DATABASES,Niraja Jain; B Raghu; V Khanaa; AV Deshpande,Abstract: The data is growing enormously with every passing day. With the paradigm shift inthe technology used to store; manage and retrieve the data from file storage to relationaldatabases to today's cloud databases; the need to process the query efficiently whilepreserving the privacy had always been the priority. The dynamism of the query and theoptimization of the resources used for query execution are the aspects that don't change inany situation. The timing constraint on the query execution could be instantaneous; urgent;leisurely or indefinite. But in almost all the scenarios the effective storage; manipulation anddata retrieval is the key. While retrieving the data stored in cloud; privacy preservation is ofutmost importance. We propose an experimental setup to test the effectiveness of somestorage policies in cloud databases that may help in effective retrieval of the data while …,*,*,*,4

This isespecially true for networks of mobile devices because of higher potential for data loss anderrors.

Thetraditional approach to dealing with these issues is to incorporate a statistical model of thereal-world phenomenon into the processing of sensor data; models can help in providingmore robust interpretations of sensor readings; by accounting for spatial and temporalbiases; by identifying faults; and by allowing estimation of missing values or future states.We illustrate this through two representative sensor data processing tasks.

E cient Stepwise Selection in Decomposable Models,Amol Deshpande; Minos Garofalakis; Michael I Jordan,Abstract In this paper; we present an e cient algorithm for performing stepwise selection inthe class of decomposable models. We focus on the forward selection procedure; but wealso discuss how backward selection and the combination of the two can be performed eciently. The main contributions of this paper are (1) a simple characterization for the edgesthat can be added to a decomposable model while retaining its decomposability and (2) ane cient algorithm for enumerating all such edges for a given decomposable model in O (n2)time; where n is the number of variables in the model. We also analyze the complexity of theoverall stepwise selection procedure (which includes the complexity of enumerating eligibleedges as well as the complexity of deciding how to\progress"). We use the KL divergence ofthe model from the saturated model as our metric; but the results we present here extend …,*,*,*,22
Message from the Organizing Committee,Alexandros Labrinidis; Samuel R Madden; Amol Deshpande; Qiong Luo,The past few years have seen substantial amounts of computer science research on sensornetworks as they have the potential to bring an unprecedented level of access to thephysical world. Other subfields of Computer Science have had a number of workshops onthe topic. Also; there are now at least two major conferences–the Conference on InformationProcessing in Sensor Networks (IPSN); started in 2002 (the 2006 IPSN was held in April);and the ACM Conference on Sensor Systems (SenSys); started in 2003 (the 2006 SenSyswill be held in November). These conferences have published a small number of databasepapers; but there is no exclusive forum for discussion on early and innovative work on datamanagement in sensor networks. We believe that the DMSN 2006 workshop; building on thesuccesses of the DMSN 2004 and DMSN 2005 workshops; fills a significant gap in the …,*,*,*,10
Graph Analytics on Relational Databases,Alekh Jindal; Samuel Madden; Amol Deshpande; Michael Stonebraker,Abstract Graph analytics is getting increasingly popular these days and there is a deluge ofnew systems for graph analytics. However; it is not clear how good or bad are the relationaldatabases for graph analytics. In this talk; I will share our experiences with graph analyticson relational databases. Contrary to the popular belief; modern relational databases canhave very good performance over graph analytics. Furthermore; we can offer better (andefficient) programming interfaces for expressing graph queries in relational databases;thereby not forcing the users to SQL.,*,*,*,19

Working Group: Lineage/Provenance,Anish Das Sarma; Amol Deshpande; Thomas Hubauer; Ihab Ilyas; Birgitta König-Ries; Matthias Renz; Martin Theobald,Abstract. The following summary tries to capture a collection of state-of-the-art techniquesand challenges for future work on lineage management in uncertain and probabilisticdatabases that we discussed in our working group. It was one half of a larger committee thatwe had initially formed; which then got split into two groups—one focusing on lineage as ameans of explanation of data; and one focusing more on lineage usage in probabilisticdatabases (see also the “Explanation” working group report for more details on the firstsubgroup).,*,*,*,4

Optimization Techniques for “Scaling Down” Hadoop on Multi-Core; Shared-Memory Systems,K Ashwin Kumar Jonathan Gluck; Amol Deshpande; Jimmy Lin,ABSTRACT The underlying assumption behind Hadoop and; more generally; the need fordistributed processing is that the data to be analyzed cannot be held in memory on a singlemachine. Today; this assumption needs to be re-evaluated. Although petabyte-scaledatastores are increasingly common; it is unclear whether “typical” analytics tasks requiremore than a single high-end server. Additionally; we are seeing increased sophistication inanalytics; eg; machine learning; where we process smaller and more refined datasets. Toaddress these trends; we propose “scaling down” Hadoop to run on multi-core; shared-memory machines. This paper presents a prototype runtime called Hone (“Hadoop One”)that is API compatible with Hadoop. With Hone; we can take an existing Hadoop applicationand run it efficiently on a single server. This allows us to take existing MapReduce …,*,*,*,22
