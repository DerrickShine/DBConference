Progressive skyline computation in database systems,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Greg Fu; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract The skyline of a d-dimensional dataset contains the points that are not dominatedby any other point on all dimensions. Skyline computation has recently receivedconsiderable attention in the database community; especially for progressive methods thatcan quickly return the initial results without reading the entire database. All the existingalgorithms; however; have some serious shortcomings which limit their applicability inpractice. In this article we develop branch-and-bound skyline (BBS); an algorithm based onnearest-neighbor search; which is I/O optimal; that is; it performs a single access only tothose nodes that may contain skyline points. BBS is simple to implement and supports alltypes of progressive processing (eg; user preferences; arbitrary dimensionality; etc).Furthermore; we propose several interesting variations of skyline computation; and show …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2005,865,6
An optimal and progressive algorithm for skyline queries,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Greg Fu; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract The skyline of a set of d-dimensional points contains the points that are notdominated by any other point on all dimensions. Skyline computation has recently receivedconsiderable attention in the database community; especially for progressive (or online)algorithms that can quickly return the first skyline points without having to read the entiredata file. Currently; the most efficient algorithm is NN (< u> n</u> earest< u> n</u>eighbors); which applies the divide-and-conquer framework on datasets indexed by R-trees.Although NN has some desirable features (such as high speed for returning the initialskyline points; applicability to arbitrary data distributions and dimensions); it also presentsseveral inherent disadvantages (need for duplicate elimination if d> 2; multiple accesses ofthe same node; large space overhead).

Query processing in spatial network databases,Dimitris Papadias; Jun Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,Abstract Despite the importance of spatial networks in real-life applications; most of thespatial database literature focuses on Euclidean spaces. In this paper we propose anarchitecture that integrates network and Euclidean information; capturing pragmaticconstraints. Based on this architecture; we develop a Euclidean restriction and a networkexpansion framework that take advantage of location and connectivity to efficiently prune thesearch space. These frameworks are successfully applied to the most popular spatialqueries; namely nearest neighbors; range search; closest pairs and e-distance joins; in thecontext of spatial network databases.,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,772,10
Anatomy: Simple and effective privacy preservation,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract This paper presents a novel technique; anatomy; for publishing sensitive data.Anatomy releases all the quasi-identifier and sensitive values directly in two separate tables.Combined with a grouping mechanism; this approach protects privacy; and captures a largeamount of correlation in the microdata. We develop a linear-time algorithm for computinganatomized tables that obey the l-diversity privacy requirement; and minimize the error ofreconstructing the microdata. Extensive experiments confirm that our technique allowssignificantly more effective data analysis than the conventional publication method based ongeneralization. Specifically; anatomy permits aggregate reasoning with average error below10%; which is lower than the error obtained from a generalized table by orders ofmagnitude.,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,751,10
The TPR*-tree: an optimized spatio-temporal access method for predictive queries,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Jimeng Sun,Abstract A predictive spatio-temporal query retrieves the set of moving objects that willintersect a query window during a future time interval. Currently; the only access method forprocessing such queries in practice is the TPR-tree. In this paper we first perform an analysisto determine the factors that affect the performance of predictive queries and show thatseveral of these factors are not considered by the TPR-tree; which uses theinsertion/deletion algorithms of the R*-tree designed for static data. Motivated by this; wepropose a new index structure called the TPR*-tree; which takes into account the uniquefeatures of dynamic objects through a set of improved construction algorithms. In addition;we provide cost models that determine the optimal performance achievable by any data-partition spatio-temporal access method. Using experimental comparison; we illustrate …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,714,20
Personalized privacy preservation,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract We study generalization for preserving privacy in publication of sensitive data. Theexisting methods focus on a universal approach that exerts the same amount of preservationfor all persons; with-out catering for their concrete needs. The consequence is that we maybe offering insufficient protection to a subset of people; while applying excessive privacycontrol to another subset. Motivated by this; we present a new generalization frameworkbased on the concept of personalized anonymity. Our technique performs the minimumgeneralization for satisfying everybody's requirements; and thus; retains the largest amountof information from the microdata. We carry out a careful theoretical study that leads tovaluable insight into the behavior of alternative solutions. In particular; our analysismathematically reveals the circumstances where the previous work fails to protect privacy …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,601,20
Continuous nearest neighbor search,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Qiongmao Shen,A continuous nearest neighbor query retrieves the nearest neighbor (NN) of every point on aline segment. The result contains a set of tuples; such that point is the NN of all points in thecorresponding interval. Existing methods for continuous nearest neighbor search are basedon the repetitive application of simple NN algorithms; which incurs significant overhead. Inthis paper; one proposes techniques that solve the problem by performing a single query forthe whole input segment. As a result; the cost; depending on the query and datasetcharacteristics; may drop by orders of magnitude. CNN queries are essential for severalapplications such as location-based commerce and geographic informationsystems.Continuous Nearest Neighbor Search Yufei Tao Dimitris Papadias Qiongmao ShenDepartment of Computer Science Hong Kong University of Science and Technology …,*,2002,577,10
M-invariance: towards privacy preserving re-publication of dynamic datasets,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract The previous literature of privacy preserving data publication has focused onperforming" one-time" releases. Specifically; none of the existing solutions supports re-publication of the microdata; after it has been updated with insertions< u> and</u> deletions.This is a serious drawback; because currently a publisher cannot provide researchers withthe most recent dataset continuously. This paper remedies the drawback. First; we reveal thecharacteristics of the re-publication problem that invalidate the conventional approachesleveraging k-anonymity and l-diversity. Based on rigorous theoretical analysis; we develop anew generalization principle m-invariance that effectively limits the risk of privacy disclosurein re-publication. We accompany the principle with an algorithm; which computes privacy-guarded relations that permit retrieval of accurate aggregate information about the …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,484,20
The mv3r-tree: A spatio-temporal access method for timestamp and interval queries,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Among the various types of spatio-temporal queries; the most common ones involve windowqueries in time. In particular; timestamp (or timeslice) queries retrieve all the objects thatintersect a window at a specific timestamp. Interval queries include multiple consecutivetimestamps. Although several indexes have been developed for either type; currently theredoes not exist a structure that can efficiently process both query types. This is a significantproblem due to the fundamental importance of these queries in any spatio-temporal systemthat deals with historical information retrieval. Our paper addresses the problem byproposing the MV3R-tree; a structure that utilizes the concepts of multi-version B-trees and3D R-trees. Extensive experimentation proves that MV3R-trees compare favorably withspecialized structures aimed at timestamp and interval window queries; both in terms of …,Proceedings of Very Large Data Bases Conference (VLDB); 11-14 September; Rome,2001,435,20
Efficient OLAP operations in spatial data warehouses,Dimitris Papadias; Panos Kalnis; Jun Zhang; Yufei Tao,Abstract Spatial databases store information about the position of individual objects inspace. In many applications however; such as traffic supervision or mobile communications;only summarized data; like the number of cars in an area or phones serviced by a cell; isrequired. Although this information can be obtained from transactional spatial databases; itscomputation is expensive; rendering online processing inapplicable. Driven by the non-spatial paradigm; spatial data warehouses can be constructed to accelerate spatial OLAPoperations. In this paper we consider the star-schema and we focus on the spatialdimensions. Unlike the non-spatial case; the groupings and the hierarchies can benumerous and unknown at design time; therefore the well-known materialization techniquesare not directly applicable. In order to address this problem; we construct an ad-hoc …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,434,19
Location-based spatial queries,Jun Zhang; Manli Zhu; Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract In this paper we propose an approach that enables mobile clients to determine thevalidity of previous queries based on their current locations. In order to make this possible;the server returns in addition to the query result; a validity region around the client's locationwithin which the result remains the same. We focus on two of the most common spatial querytypes; namely nearest neighbor and window queries; define the validity region in each caseand propose the corresponding query processing algorithms. In addition; we provideanalytical models for estimating the expected size of the validity region. Our techniques cansignificantly reduce the number of queries issued to the server; while introducing minimalcomputational and network overhead compared to traditional spatial queries.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,354,10
Indexing multi-dimensional uncertain data with arbitrary probability density functions,Yufei Tao; Reynold Cheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Wang Kay Ngai; Ben Kao; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract In an" uncertain database"; an object o is associated with a multi-dimensionalprobability density function (pdf); which describes the likelihood that o appears at eachposition in the data space. A fundamental operation is the" probabilistic range search"which; given a value pq and a rectangular area rq; retrieves the objects that appear in rqwith probabilities at least p q. In this paper; we propose the U-tree; an access methoddesigned to optimize both the I/O and CPU time of range retrieval on multi-dimensionalimprecise data. The new structure is fully dynamic (ie; objects can be incrementallyinserted/deleted in any order); and does not place any constraints on the data pdfs. Weverify the query and update efficiency of U-trees with extensive experiments.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,350,10
Time-parameterized queries in spatio-temporal databases,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Time-parameterized queries (TP queries for short) retrieve (i) the actual result at thetime that the query is issued;(ii) the validity period of the result given the current motion of thequery and the database objects; and (iii) the change that causes the expiration of the result.Due to the highly dynamic nature of several spatio-temporal applications; TP queries areimportant both as standalone methods; as well as building blocks of more complexoperations. However; little work has been done towards their efficient processing. In thispaper; we propose a general framework that covers time-parameterized variations of themost common spatial queries; namely window queries; k-nearest neighbors and spatialjoins. In particular; each of these TP queries is reduced to nearest neighbor search wherethe distance functions are defined according to the query type. This reduction allows the …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,320,0
Reverse kNN search in arbitrary dimensionality,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Xiang Lian,Abstract Given a point q; a reverse k nearest neighbor (RkNN) query retrieves all the datapoints that have q as one of their k nearest neighbors. Existing methods for processing suchqueries have at least one of the following deficiencies:(i) they do not support arbitrary valuesof k (ii) they cannot deal efficiently with database updates;(iii) they are applicable only to 2Ddata (but not to higher dimensionality); and (iv) they retrieve only approximate results.Motivated by these shortcomings; we develop algorithms for exact processing of RkNN witharbitrary values of k on dynamic multidimensional datasets. Our methods utilize aconventional data-partitioning index on the dataset and do not require any pre-computation.In addition to their flexibility; we experimentally verify that the proposed algorithmsoutperform the existing ones even in their restricted focus.,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,318,19
Mining; indexing; and querying historical spatiotemporal data,Nikos Mamoulis; Huiping Cao; George Kollios; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Yufei Tao; David W Cheung,Abstract In many applications that track and analyze spatiotemporal data; movements obeyperiodic patterns; the objects follow the same routes (approximately) over regular timeintervals. For example; people wake up at the same time and follow more or less the sameroute to their work everyday. The discovery of hidden periodic patterns in spatiotemporaldata; apart from unveiling important information to the data analyst; can facilitate datamanagement substantially. Based on this observation; we propose a framework thatanalyzes; manages; and queries object movements that follow such patterns. We define thespatiotemporal periodic pattern mining problem and propose an effective and fast miningalgorithm for retrieving maximal periodic patterns. We also devise a novel; specialized indexstructure that can benefit from the discovered patterns to support more efficient execution …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,318,0
Catching the best views of skyline: A semantic approach based on decisive subspaces,Jian Pei; Wen Jin; Martin Ester; Yufei Tao,Abstract The skyline operator is important for multi-criteria decision making applications.Although many recent studies developed efficient methods to compute skyline objects in aspecific space; the fundamental problem on the semantics of skylines remains open: Whyand in which subspaces is (or is not) an object in the skyline? Practically; users may also beinterested in the skylines in any subspaces. Then; what is the relationship between theskylines in the subspaces and those in the super-spaces? How can we effectively analyzethe subspace skylines? Can we efficiently compute skylines in various subspaces? In thispaper; we investigate the semantics of skylines; propose the subspace skyline analysis; andextend the full-space skyline computation to subspace skyline computation.

Prediction and indexing of moving objects with unknown motion patterns,Yufei Tao; Christos Faloutsos; Dimitris Papadias; Bin Liu,Abstract Existing methods for peediction spatio-temporal databases assume that objectsmove according to linear functions. This severely limits their applicability; since in practicemovement is more complex; and individual objects may follow drastically diffferent motionpatterns. In order to overcome these problems; we first introduce a general framework formonitoring and indexing moving objects; where (i) each boject computes individually thefunction that accurately captures its movement and (ii) a server indexes the object locationsat a coarse level and processes queries using a filter-refinement mechanism. Our secondcontribution is a novel recursive motion function that supports a broad class of non-linearmotion patterns. The function does not presume any a-priori movement but can postulate theparticular motion of each object by examining its locations at recent timestamps.

Maintaining sliding window skylines on data streams,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,The skyline of a multidimensional data set contains the" best" tuples according to anypreference function that is monotonic on each dimension. Although skyline computation hasreceived considerable attention in conventional databases; the existing algorithms areinapplicable to stream applications because 1) they assume static data that are stored in thedisk (rather than continuously arriving/expiring); 2) they focus on" one-time" execution thatreturns a single skyline (in contrast to constantly tracking skyline changes); and 3) they aimat reducing the I/O overhead (as opposed to minimizing the CPU-cost and main-memoryconsumption). This paper studies skyline computation in stream environments; where queryprocessing takes into account only a" sliding window" covering the most recent tuples.

Group nearest neighbor queries,Dimitris Papadias; Qiongmao Shen; Yufei Tao; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Given two sets of points P and Q; a group nearest neighbor (GNN) query retrieves the point(s) of P with the smallest sum of distances to all points in Q. Consider; for instance; threeusers at locations q/sub 1/q/sub 2/and q/sub 3/that want to find a meeting point (eg; arestaurant); the corresponding query returns the data point p that minimizes the sum ofEuclidean distances| pq/sub i/| for 1/spl les/i/spl les/3. Assuming that Q fits in memory and Pis indexed by an R-tree; we propose several algorithms for finding the group nearestneighbors efficiently. As a second step; we extend our techniques for situations where Qcannot fit in memory; covering both indexed and nonindexed query points.

Subsky: Efficient computation of skylines in subspaces,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jian Pei,Given a set of multi-dimensional points; the skyline contains the best points according to anypreference function that is monotone on all axes. In practice; applications that require skylineanalysis usually provide numerous candidate attributes; and various users depending ontheir interests may issue queries regarding different (small) subsets of the dimensions.Formally; given a relation with a large number (eg; ge 10) of attributes; a query aims atfinding the skyline in an arbitrary subspace with a low dimensionality (eg; 2). The existingalgorithms do not support subspace skyline retrieval efficiently because they (i) requirescanning the entire database at least once; or (ii) are optimized for one particular subspacebut incur significant overhead for other subspaces. In this paper; we propose a techniqueSUBSKY which settles the problem using a single B-tree; and can be implemented in any …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Aggregate nearest neighbor queries in spatial databases,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Chun Kit Hui,Abstract Given two spatial datasets P (eg; facilities) and Q (queries); an aggregate nearestneighbor (ANN) query retrieves the point (s) of P with the smallest aggregate distance (s) topoints in Q. Assuming; for example; n users at locations q 1;… qn; an ANN query outputs thefacility p∈ P that minimizes the sum of distances &verbar; pq i &verbar; for 1≤ i≤ n that theusers have to travel in order to meet there. Similarly; another ANN query may report the pointp∈ P that minimizes the maximum distance that any user has to travel; or the minimumdistance from some user to his/her closest facility. If Q fits in memory and P is indexed by anR-tree; we develop algorithms for aggregate nearest neighbors that capture several versionsof the problem; including weighted queries and incremental reporting of results. Then; weanalyze their performance and propose cost models for query optimization. Finally; we …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2005,249,18
On the anonymization of sparse high-dimensional data,Gabriel Ghinita; Yufei Tao; Panos Kalnis,Existing research on privacy-preserving data publishing focuses on relational data: in thiscontext; the objective is to enforce privacy-preserving paradigms; such as k-anonymity and l-diversity; while minimizing the information loss incurred in the anonymizing process (iemaximize data utility). However; existing techniques adopt an indexing-or clustering-basedapproach; and work well for fixed-schema data; with low dimensionality. Nevertheless;certain applications require privacy-preserving publishing of transaction data (or basketdata); which involves hundreds or even thousands of dimensions; rendering existingmethods unusable. We propose a novel anonymization method for sparse high-dimensionaldata. We employ a particular representation that captures the correlation in the underlyingdata; and facilitates the formation of anonymized groups with low information loss. We …,Data Engineering; 2008.

Indexing spatio-temporal data warehouses,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; P Kanis; Jun Zhang,Spatio-temporal databases store information about the positions of individual objects overtime. In many applications; however; such as traffic supervision or mobile communicationsystems; only summarized data; like the average number of cars in an area for a specificperiod; or the number of phones serviced by a cell each day; is required. Although thisinformation can be obtained from operational databases; its computation is expensive;rendering online processing inapplicable. A vital solution is the construction of a spatio-temporal data warehouse. In this paper; we describe a framework for supporting OLAPoperations over spatio-temporal data. We argue that the spatial and temporal dimensionsshould be modeled as a combined dimension on the data cube and we present datastructures which integrate spatio-temporal indexing with pre-aggregation.

Spatio-temporal aggregation using sketches,Yufei Tao; George Kollios; Jeffrey Considine; Feifei Li; Dimitris Papadias,Several spatio-temporal applications require the retrieval of summarized information aboutmoving objects that lie in a query region during a query interval (eg; the number of mobileusers covered by a cell; traffic volume in a district; etc.). Existing solutions have the distinctcounting problem: if an object remains in the query region for several timestamps during thequery interval; it will be counted multiple times in the result. We solve this problem byintegrating spatio-temporal indexes with sketches; traditionally used for approximate queryprocessing. The proposed techniques can also be applied to reduce the space requirementsof conventional spatio-temporal data and to mine spatio-temporal association rules.,Data Engineering; 2004.

Quality and efficiency in high dimensional nearest neighbor search,Yufei Tao; Ke Yi; Cheng Sheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high dimensional space is an important problemin many applications. Ideally; a practical solution (i) should be implementable in a relationaldatabase; and (ii) its query cost should grow sub-linearly with the dataset size; regardless ofthe data and query distributions. Despite the bulk of NN literature; no solution fulfills bothrequirements; except locality sensitive hashing (LSH). The existing LSH implementationsare either rigorous or adhoc. Rigorous-LSH ensures good quality of query results; butrequires expensive space and query cost. Although adhoc-LSH is more efficient; itabandons quality control; ie; the neighbor it outputs can be arbitrarily bad. As a result;currently no method is able to ensure both quality and efficiency simultaneously in practice.Motivated by this; we propose a new access method called the locality sensitive B-tree …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,178,4
Reverse nearest neighbors in large graphs,Man Lung Yiu; Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,A reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query returns the data objects that have a query point astheir nearest neighbor (NN). Although such queries have been studied quite extensively inEuclidean spaces; there is no previous work in the context of large graphs. In this paper; weprovide a fundamental lemma; which can be used to prune the search space whiletraversing the graph in search for RNN. Based on it; we develop two RNN methods; aneager algorithm that attempts to prune network nodes as soon as they are visited and a lazytechnique that prunes the search space when a data point is discovered. We study retrievalof an arbitrary number k of reverse nearest neighbors; investigate the benefits ofmaterialization; cover several query types; and deal with cases where the queries and thedata objects reside on nodes or edges of the graph.

Distance-based representative skyline,Yufei Tao; Ling Ding; Xuemin Lin; Jian Pei,Given an integer $ k $; a {\em representative skyline} contains the $ k $ skyline points thatbest describe the tradeoffs among different dimensions offered by the full skyline. Althoughthis topic has been previously studied; the existing solution may sometimes produce $ k $points that appear in an arbitrarily tiny cluster; and therefore; fail to be representative.Motivated by this; we propose a new definition of representative skyline that minimizes thedistance between a non-representative skyline point and its nearest representative. We alsostudy algorithms for computing distance-based representative skylines. In 2D space; there isa dynamic programming algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution.

Range search on multidimensional uncertain data,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Reynold Cheng,Abstract In an uncertain database; every object o is associated with a probability densityfunction; which describes the likelihood that o appears at each position in amultidimensional workspace. This article studies two types of range retrieval fundamental tomany analytical tasks. Specifically; a nonfuzzy query returns all the objects that appear in asearch region rq with at least a certain probability t q. On the other hand; given an uncertainobject q; fuzzy search retrieves the set of objects that are within distance &epsiv; q from qwith no less than probability t q. The core of our methodology is a novel concept of“probabilistically constrained rectangle”; which permits effective pruning/validation ofnonqualifying/qualifying data.

The Bdual-Tree: indexing moving objects by space filling curves in the dual space,Man Lung Yiu; Yufei Tao; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Existing spatiotemporal indexes suffer from either large update cost or poor queryperformance; except for the B x-tree (the state-of-the-art); which consists of multiple B+-treesindexing the 1D values transformed from the (multi-dimensional) moving objects based on aspace filling curve (Hilbert; in particular). This curve; however; does not consider objectvelocities; and as a result; query processing with a B x-tree retrieves a large number of falsehits; which seriously compromises its efficiency. It is natural to wonder" can we obtain betterperformance by capturing also the velocity information; using a Hilbert curve of a higherdimensionality?". This paper provides a positive answer by developing the B dual-tree; anovel spatiotemporal access method leveraging pure relational methodology.

Querying about the past; the present; and the future in spatio-temporal databases,Jimeng Sun; Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Bin Liu,Moving objects (eg; vehicles in road networks) continuously generate large amounts ofspatio-temporal information in the form of data streams. Efficient management of suchstreams is a challenging goal due to the highly dynamic nature of the data and the need forfast; online computations.

In particular; we firstpropose an incrementally updateable; multidimensional histogram for present-time queries.Second; we develop a general architecture for maintaining and querying historical data.Third; we implement a stochastic approach for predicting the results of queries that refer tothe future.

Reverse nearest neighbor search in metric spaces,Yufei Tao; Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis,Given a set D of objects; a reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query returns the objects o in Dsuch that o is closer to a query object q than to any other object in D; according to a certainsimilarity metric. The existing RNN solutions are not sufficient because they either 1) rely onprecomputed information that is expensive to maintain in the presence of updates or 2) areapplicable only when the data consists of" Euclidean objects" and similarity is measuredusing the L 2 norm. In this paper; we present the first algorithms for efficient RNN search ingeneric metric spaces. Our techniques require no detailed representations of objects; andcan be applied as long as their mutual distances can be computed and the distance metricsatisfies the triangle inequality.

Preservation of proximity privacy in publishing numerical sensitive data,Jiexing Li; Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract We identify proximity breach as a privacy threat specific to numerical sensitiveattributes in anonymized data publication. Such breach occurs when an adversaryconcludes with high confidence that the sensitive value of a victim individual must fall in ashort interval---even though the adversary may have low confidence about the victim's actualvalue. None of the existing anonymization principles (eg; k-anonymity; l-diversity; etc.) caneffectively prevent proximity breach. We remedy the problem by introducing a novel principlecalled (ε; m)-anonymity. Intuitively; the principle demands that; given a QI-group G; for everysensitive value x in G; at most 1/m of the tuples in G can have sensitive values" similar" to x;where the similarity is controlled by ε. We provide a careful analytical study of the theoreticalcharacteristics of (ε; m)-anonymity; and the corresponding generalization algorithm.

A threshold-based algorithm for continuous monitoring of k nearest neighbors,Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias; Spiridon Bakiras; Yufei Tao,Assume a set of moving objects and a central server that monitors their positions over time;while processing continuous nearest neighbor queries from geographically distributedclients. In order to always report up-to-date results; the server could constantly obtain themost recent position of all objects. However; this naive solution requires the transmission ofa large number of rapid data streams corresponding to location updates. Intuitively; currentinformation is necessary only for objects that may influence some query result (ie; they maybe included in the nearest neighbor set of some client). Motivated by this observation; wepresent a threshold-based algorithm for the continuous monitoring of nearest neighbors thatminimizes the communication overhead between the server and the data objects.

Efficient historical R-trees,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,The historical R-tree (HR-tree) is a spatio-temporal access method aimed at the retrieval ofwindow queries in the past. The concept behind the method is to keep an R-tree for eachtimestamp in history; but to allow consecutive trees to share branches when the underlyingobjects do not change. New branches are only created to accommodate updates from theprevious timestamp. Although existing implementations of HR-trees process timestamp(window) queries very efficiently; they are hardly applicable in practice due to excessivespace requirements and poor interval query performance. This paper addresses theseproblems by proposing the HR+-tree; which occupies a small fraction of the space requiredfor the corresponding HR-tree (for typical conditions about 20%); while improving intervalquery performance several times. Our claims are supported by extensive experimental …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2001. SSDBM 2001. Proceedings. Thirteenth International Conference on,2001,120,22
An efficient cost model for optimization of nearest neighbor search in low and medium dimensional spaces,Yufei Tao; Jun Zhang; Dimitris Papadias; Nikos Mamoulis,Existing models for nearest neighbor search in multidimensional spaces are not appropriatefor query optimization because they either lead to erroneous estimation or involve complexequations that are expensive to evaluate in real-time. This article proposes an alternativemethod that captures the performance of nearest neighbor queries using approximation. Foruniform data; our model involves closed formulae that are very efficient to compute andaccurate for up to 10 dimensions. Further; the proposed equations can be applied onnonuniform data with the aid of histograms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the modelby using it to solve several optimization problems related to nearest neighbor search.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,117,0
All-nearest-neighbors queries in spatial databases,Jun Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao,Given two sets A and B of multidimensional objects; the all-nearest-neighbors (ANN) queryretrieves for each object in A its nearest neighbor in B. Although this operation is common inseveral applications; it has not received much attention in the database literature. In thispaper we study alternative methods for processing ANN queries depending on whether Aand B are indexed: Our algorithms are evaluated through extensive experimentation usingsynthetic and real datasets. The performance studies show that they are an order ofmagnitude faster than a previous approach based on closest-pairs query processing.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004.

Querying communities in relational databases,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lijun Chang; Yufei Tao,Keyword search on relational databases provides users with insights that they can not easilyobserve using the traditional RDBMS techniques. Here; an l-keyword query is specified by aset of l keywords;{k1; k2;···; kl}. It finds how the tuples that contain the keywords areconnected in a relational database via the possible foreign key references. Conceptually; itis to find some structural information in a database graph; where nodes are tuples andedges are foreign key references. The existing work studied how to find connected trees foran l-keyword query. However; a tree may only show partial information about how thosetuples that contain the keywords are connected. In this paper; we focus on findingcommunities for an l-keyword query. A community is an induced subgraph that contains allthe l-keywords within a given distance. We propose new efficient algorithms to find all/top …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,113,20
Progressive computation of the min-dist optimal-location query,Donghui Zhang; Yang Du; Tian Xia; Yufei Tao,Abstract This paper proposes and solves the min-dist optimal-location query in spatialdatabases. Given a set S of sites; a set O of weighted objects; and a spatial region Q; the min-dist optimal-location query returns a location in Q which; if a new site is built there; minimizesthe average distance from each object to its closest site. This query can help a franchise (egMcDonald's) decide where to put a new store in order to maximize the benefit to itscustomers. To solve this problem is challenging; for there are theoretically infinite number oflocations in Q; all of which could be candidates. This paper first provides a theorem thatlimits the number of candidate locations without losing the power to find exact answers.Then it provides a progressive algorithm that quickly suggests a location; tells the maximumerror it may have; and keeps refining the result. When the algorithm finishes; the exact …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,107,20
Efficient skyline and top-k retrieval in subspaces,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jian Pei,Skyline and top-k queries are two popular operations for preference retrieval. In practice;applications that require these operations usually provide numerous candidate attributes;whereas; depending on their interests; users may issue queries regarding different subsetsof the dimensions. The existing algorithms are inadequate for subspace skyline/top-k searchbecause they have at least one of the following defects: 1) they require scanning the entiredatabase at least once; 2) they are optimized for one subspace but incur significantoverhead for other subspaces; or 3) they demand expensive maintenance cost or spaceconsumption. In this paper; we propose a technique SUBSKY; which settles both types ofqueries by using purely relational technologies. The core of SUBSKY is a transformation thatconverts multidimensional data to one-dimensional (1D) values. These values are …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,106,10
Probabilistic spatial queries on existentially uncertain data,Xiangyuan Dai; Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao; Michail Vaitis,Abstract We study the problem of answering spatial queries in databases where objectsexist with some uncertainty and they are associated with an existential probability. The goalof a thresholding probabilistic spatial query is to retrieve the objects that qualify the spatialpredicates with probability that exceeds a threshold. Accordingly; a ranking probabilisticspatial query selects the objects with the highest probabilities to qualify the spatialpredicates. We propose adaptations of spatial access methods and search algorithms forprobabilistic versions of range queries and nearest neighbors and conduct an extensiveexperimental study; which evaluates the effectiveness of proposed solutions.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,104,0
Spatial queries in dynamic environments,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Conventional spatial queries are usually meaningless in dynamic environmentssince their results may be invalidated as soon as the query or data objects move. In thispaper we formulate two novel query types; time parameterized and continuous queries;applicable in such environments. A time-parameterized query retrieves the actual result atthe time when the query is issued; the expiry time of the result given the current motion of thequery and database objects; and the change that causes the expiration. A continuous queryretrieves tuples of the form< result; interval>; where each result is accompanied by a futureinterval; during which it is valid. We study time-parameterized and continuous versions of themost common spatial queries (ie; window queries; nearest neighbors; spatial joins);proposing efficient processing algorithms and accurate cost models.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2003,103,10
Selectivity estimation for predictive spatio-temporal queries,Yufei Tao; Jimeng Sun; Dimitris Papadias,We propose a cost model for selectivity estimation of predictive spatio-temporal windowqueries. Initially; we focus on uniform data proposing formulae that capture both points andrectangles; and any type of object/query mobility combination (ie; dynamic objects; dynamicqueries or both). Then; we apply the model to nonuniform datasets by introducing spatio-temporal histograms; which in addition to the spatial; also consider the velocity distributionsduring partitioning. The advantages of our techniques are (i) high accuracy (1-2 orders ofmagnitude lower error than previous techniques);(ii) ability to handle all query types; and (iii)efficient handling of updates.,Data Engineering; 2003.

Mining distance-based outliers from large databases in any metric space,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Let R be a set of objects. An object o∈ R is an outlier; if there exist less than kobjects in R whose distances to o are at most r. The values of k; r; and the distance metricare provided by a user at the run time. The objective is to return all outliers with the smallestI/O cost. This paper considers a generic version of the problem; where no information isavailable for outlier computation; except for objects' mutual distances. We prove an upperbound for the memory consumption which permits the discovery of all outliers by scanningthe dataset 3 times. The upper bound turns out to be extremely low in practice; eg; less than1% of R. Since the actual memory capacity of a realistic DBMS is typically larger; we developa novel algorithm; which integrates our theoretical findings with carefully-designed heuristicsthat leverage the additional memory to improve I/O efficiency. Our technique reports all …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,98,10
RPJ: Producing fast join results on streams through rate-based optimization,Yufei Tao; Man Lung Yiu; Dimitris Papadias; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract We consider the problem of" progressively" joining relations whose records arecontinuously retrieved from remote sources through an unstable network that may incurtemporary failures. The objectives are to (i) start reporting the first output tuples as soon aspossible (before the participating relations are completely received); and (ii) produce theremaining results at a fast rate. We develop a new algorithm RPJ (< u> R</u> ate-based< u>P</u> rogressive< u> J</u> oin) based on solid theoretical analysis. RPJ maximizes theoutput rate by optimizing its execution according to the characteristics of the join relations(eg; data distribution; tuple arrival pattern; etc.). Extensive experiments prove that ourtechnique delivers results significantly faster than the previous methods.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,96,10
Range aggregate processing in spatial databases,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,A range aggregate query returns summarized information about the points falling in a hyper-rectangle (eg; the total number of these points instead of their concrete ids). This paperstudies spatial indexes that solve such queries efficiently and proposes the aggregate Point-tree (aP-tree); which achieves logarithmic cost to the data set cardinality (independently ofthe query size) for two-dimensional data. The aP-tree requires only small modifications tothe popular multiversion structural framework and; thus; can be implemented and appliedeasily in practice. We also present models that accurately predict the space consumptionand query cost of the aP-tree and are therefore suitable for query optimization. Extensiveexperiments confirm that the proposed methods are efficient and practical.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,89,20
Privacy preservation in database applications: A survey,Shui-Geng Zhou; Feng Li; Yu-Fei Tao; XK Xiao,*,Chinese Journal of Computers,2009,87
Anonymous publication of sensitive transactional data,Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis; Yufei Tao,Existing research on privacy-preserving data publishing focuses on relational data: in thiscontext; the objective is to enforce privacy-preserving paradigms; such as k-anonymity and ℓ-diversity; while minimizing the information loss incurred in the anonymizing process (ie;maximize data utility). Existing techniques work well for fixed-schema data; with lowdimensionality. Nevertheless; certain applications require privacy-preserving publishing oftransactional data (or basket data); which involve hundreds or even thousands ofdimensions; rendering existing methods unusable. We propose two categories of novelanonymization methods for sparse high-dimensional data. The first category is based onapproximate nearest-neighbor (NN) search in high-dimensional spaces; which is efficientlyperformed through locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). In the second category; we propose …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,85,12
Continuous privacy preserving publishing of data streams,Bin Zhou; Yi Han; Jian Pei; Bin Jiang; Yufei Tao; Yan Jia,Abstract Recently; privacy preserving data publishing has received a lot of attention in bothresearch and applications. Most of the previous studies; however; focus on static data sets.In this paper; we study an emerging problem of continuous privacy preserving publishing ofdata streams which cannot be solved by any straightforward extensions of the existingprivacy preserving publishing methods on static data. To tackle the problem; we develop anovel approach which considers both the distribution of the data entries to be published andthe statistical distribution of the data stream. An extensive performance study using both realdata sets and synthetic data sets verifies the effectiveness and the efficiency of our methods.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,85,10
Multidimensional reverse kNN search,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Xiang Lian; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Given a multidimensional point q; a reverse k nearest neighbor (R k NN) queryretrieves all the data points that have q as one of their k nearest neighbors. Existing methodsfor processing such queries have at least one of the following deficiencies: they (i) do notsupport arbitrary values of k;(ii) cannot deal efficiently with database updates;(iii) areapplicable only to 2D data but not to higher dimensionality; and (iv) retrieve onlyapproximate results. Motivated by these shortcomings; we develop algorithms for exact R kNN processing with arbitrary values of k on dynamic; multidimensional datasets. Ourmethods utilize a conventional data-partitioning index on the dataset and do not require anypre-computation. As a second step; we extend the proposed techniques to continuous R kNN search; which returns the R k NN results for every point on a line segment. We …,The VLDB Journal,2007,83,22
Clustering uncertain data based on probability distribution similarity,Bin Jiang; Jian Pei; Yufei Tao; Xuemin Lin,Clustering on uncertain data; one of the essential tasks in mining uncertain data; postssignificant challenges on both modeling similarity between uncertain objects anddeveloping efficient computational methods. The previous methods extend traditionalpartitioning clustering methods like $(k) $-means and density-based clustering methods likeDBSCAN to uncertain data; thus rely on geometric distances between objects. Suchmethods cannot handle uncertain objects that are geometrically indistinguishable; such asproducts with the same mean but very different variances in customer ratings. Surprisingly;probability distributions; which are essential characteristics of uncertain objects; have notbeen considered in measuring similarity between uncertain objects. In this paper; wesystematically model uncertain objects in both continuous and discrete domains; where …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,80,14
Historical spatio-temporal aggregation,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Spatio-temporal databases store information about the positions of individualobjects over time. However; in many applications such as traffic supervision or mobilecommunication systems; only summarized data; like the number of cars in an area for aspecific period; or phone-calls serviced by a cell each day; is required. Although thisinformation can be obtained from operational databases; its computation is expensive;rendering online processing inapplicable. In this paper; we present specialized methods;which integrate spatio-temporal indexing with pre-aggregation. The methods supportdynamic spatio-temporal dimensions for the efficient processing of historical aggregatequeries without a priori knowledge of grouping hierarchies. The superiority of the proposedtechniques over existing methods is demonstrated through a comprehensive probabilistic …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2005,76,20
On anti-corruption privacy preserving publication,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jiexing Li; Donghui Zhang,This paper deals with a new type of privacy threat; called" corruption"; in anonymized datapublication. Specifically; an adversary is said to have corrupted some individuals; if s/he hasalready obtained their sensitive values before consulting the released information.Conventional generalization may lead to severe privacy disclosure in the presence ofcorruption. Motivated by this; we advocate an alternative anonymization technique thatintegrates generalization with perturbation and stratified sampling. The integration providesstrong privacy guarantees; even if an adversary has corrupted any number of individuals.We verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique through experiments with real data.,Data Engineering; 2008.

The goal of athresholding probabilistic spatial query is to retrieve the objects that qualify the spatialpredicates with probability that exceeds a threshold. Accordingly; a ranking probabilisticspatial query selects the objects with the highest probabilities to qualify the spatialpredicates.

Efficient and accurate nearest neighbor and closest pair search in high-dimensional space,Yufei Tao; Ke Yi; Cheng Sheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Nearest Neighbor (NN) search in high-dimensional space is an important problemin many applications. From the database perspective; a good solution needs to have twoproperties:(i) it can be easily incorporated in a relational database; and (ii) its query costshould increase sublinearly with the dataset size; regardless of the data and querydistributions. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a well-known methodology fulfilling bothrequirements; but its current implementations either incur expensive space and query cost;or abandon its theoretical guarantee on the quality of query results. Motivated by this; weimprove LSH by proposing an access method called the Locality-Sensitive B-tree (LSB-tree)to enable fast; accurate; high-dimensional NN search in relational databases. Thecombination of several LSB-trees forms a LSB-forest that has strong quality guarantees …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,72,11
On skylining with flexible dominance relation,Tian Xia; Donghui Zhang; Yufei Tao,Given a set of d dimensional objects; a skyline query finds the objects (" skyline") that are notdominated by others. However; skylines do not always provide useful query results to users;and existing methods of various skyline queries have at least one of the followingdrawbacks:(1) the size of skyline objects can not be controlled; or can be only increased oronly decreased but not both;(2) skyline objects do not have built-in ranks;(3) skylines do notreflect users' weights (preferences) at different dimensions. In this paper; we propose aunified approach; the¿-skyline; to effectively solve all three drawbacks. We explore theproperties of¿-skylines and propose two different algorithms to compute¿-skylines.,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,72,15
Branch-and-bound processing of ranked queries,Yufei Tao; Vagelis Hristidis; Dimitris Papadias; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Despite the importance of ranked queries in numerous applications involving multi-criteria decision making; they are not efficiently supported by traditional database systems.In this paper; we propose a simple yet powerful technique for processing such queriesbased on multi-dimensional access methods and branch-and-bound search. Theadvantages of the proposed methodology are:(i) it is space efficient; requiring only a singleindex on the given relation (storing each tuple at most once);(ii) it achieves significant (ie;orders of magnitude) performance gains with respect to the current state-of-the-art;(iii) it canefficiently handle data updates; and (iv) it is applicable to other important variations ofranked search (including the support for non-monotone preference functions); at no extraspace overhead.

Analysis of predictive spatio-temporal queries,Yufei Tao; Jimeng Sun; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Given a set of objects S; a spatio-temporal window query q retrieves the objects of Sthat will intersect the window during the (future) interval q T. A nearest neighbor query qretrieves the objects of S closest to q during q T. Given a threshold d; a spatio-temporal joinretrieves the pairs of objects from two datasets that will come within distance d from eachother during q T. In this article; we present probabilistic cost models that estimate theselectivity of spatio-temporal window queries and joins; and the expected distance betweena query and its nearest neighbor (s). Our models capture any query/object mobilitycombination (moving queries; moving objects or both) and any data type (points andrectangles) in arbitrary dimensionality. In addition; we develop specialized spatio-temporalhistograms; which take into account both location and velocity information; and can be …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2003,71,10
Massive graph triangulation,Xiaocheng Hu; Yufei Tao; Chin-Wan Chung,Abstract This paper studies I/O-efficient algorithms for settling the classic triangle listingproblem; whose solution is a basic operator in dealing with many other graph problems.Specifically; given an undirected graph G; the objective of triangle listing is to find all thecliques involving 3 vertices in G. The problem has been well studied in internal memory; butremains an urgent difficult challenge when G does not fit in memory; rendering any algorithmto entail frequent I/O accesses. Although previous research has attempted to tackle thechallenge; the state-of-the-art solutions rely on a set of crippling assumptions to guaranteegood performance. Motivated by this; we develop a new algorithm that is provably I/O andCPU efficient at the same time; without making any assumption on the input G at all. Thealgorithm uses ideas drastically different from all the previous approaches; and …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2013,69,3
Distributed skyline retrieval with low bandwidth consumption,Lin Zhu; Yufei Tao; Shuigeng Zhou,We consider skyline computation when the underlying data set is horizontally partitionedonto geographically distant servers that are connected to the Internet. The existing solutionsare not suitable for our problem; because they have at least one of the followingdrawbacks:(1) applicable only to distributed systems adopting vertical partitioning orrestricted horizontal partitioning;(2) effective only when each server has limited computingand communication abilities; and (3) optimized only for skyline search in subspaces butinefficient in the full space. This paper proposes an algorithm; called feedback-baseddistributed skyline (FDS); to support arbitrary horizontal partitioning. FDS aims at minimizingthe network bandwidth; measured in the number of tuples transmitted over the network. Thecore of FDS is a novel feedback-driven mechanism; where the coordinator iteratively …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,69,19
Fast nearest neighbor search with keywords,Yufei Tao; Cheng Sheng,Conventional spatial queries; such as range search and nearest neighbor retrieval; involveonly conditions on objects' geometric properties. Today; many modern applications call fornovel forms of queries that aim to find objects satisfying both a spatial predicate; and apredicate on their associated texts. For example; instead of considering all the restaurants; anearest neighbor query would instead ask for the restaurant that is the closest among thosewhose menus contain “steak; spaghetti; brandy” all at the same time. Currently; the bestsolution to such queries is based on the IR 2-tree; which; as shown in this paper; has a fewdeficiencies that seriously impact its efficiency. Motivated by this; we develop a new accessmethod called the spatial inverted index that extends the conventional inverted index tocope with multidimensional data; and comes with algorithms that can answer nearest …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2014,64,8

Due to the importanceof those applications and the rapidly increasing amount of uncertain data collected andaccumulated; analyzing large collections of uncertain data has become an important taskand has attracted more and more interest from the database community.

On efficient spatial matching,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yufei Tao; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract This paper proposes and solves a new problem called spatial matching (SPM). LetP and O be two sets of objects in an arbitrary metric space; where object distances aredefined according to a norm satisfying the triangle inequality. Each object in O represents acustomer; and each object in P indicates a service provider; which has a capacitycorresponding to the maximum number of customers that can be supported by the provider.SPM assigns each customer to her/his nearest provider; among all the providers whosecapacities have not been exhausted in serving other closer customers. We elaborate theapplications where SPM is useful; and develop algorithms that settle this problem with alinear number O (| P|+| O|) of nearest neighbor queries.

Minimal mapreduce algorithms,Yufei Tao; Wenqing Lin; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract MapReduce has become a dominant parallel computing paradigm for big data; ie;colossal datasets at the scale of tera-bytes or higher. Ideally; a MapReduce system shouldachieve a high degree of load balancing among the participating machines; and minimizethe space usage; CPU and I/O time; and network transfer at each machine. Although theseprinciples have guided the development of MapReduce algorithms; limited emphasis hasbeen placed on enforcing serious constraints on the aforementioned metrics simultaneously.This paper presents the notion of minimal algorithm; that is; an algorithm that guarantees thebest parallelization in multiple aspects at the same time; up to a small constant factor.

The hardness and approximation algorithms for l-diversity,Xiaokui Xiao; Ke Yi; Yufei Tao,Abstract The existing solutions to privacy preserving publication can be classified into thetheoretical and heuristic categories. The former guarantees provably low information loss;whereas the latter incurs gigantic loss in the worst case; but is shown empirically to performwell on many real inputs. While numerous heuristic algorithms have been developed tosatisfy advanced privacy principles such as l-diversity; t-closeness; etc.; the theoreticalcategory is currently limited to k-anonymity which is the earliest principle known to havesevere vulnerability to privacy attacks. Motivated by this; we present the first theoretical studyon l-diversity; a popular principle that is widely adopted in the literature. First; we show thatoptimal l-diverse generalization is NP-hard even when there are only 3 distinct sensitivevalues in the microdata. Then; an (l· d)-approximation algorithm is developed; where d is …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,57,12
Superseding nearest neighbor search on uncertain spatial databases,Sze Man Yuen; Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jian Pei; Donghui Zhang,This paper proposes a new problem; called superseding nearest neighbor search; onuncertain spatial databases; where each object is described by a multidimensionalprobability density function. Given a query point q; an object is a nearest neighbor (NN)candidate if it has a nonzero probability to be the NN of q. Given two NN-candidates o 1 ando 2; o 1 supersedes o 2 if o 1 is more likely to be closer to q. An object is a supersedingnearest neighbor (SNN) of q; if it supersedes all the other NN-candidates. Sometimes noobject is able to supersede every other NN-candidate. In this case; we return the SNN-core-the minimum set of NN-candidates each of which supersedes all the NN-candidates outsidethe SNN-core. Intuitively; the SNN-core contains the best objects; because any objectoutside the SNN-core is worse than all the objects in the SNN-core. We show that the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,56,2
Cost models for overlapping and multiversion structures,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Jun Zhang,Abstract Overlapping and multiversion techniques are two popular frameworks thattransform an ephemeral index into a multiple logical-tree structure in order to supportversioning databases. Although both frameworks have produced numerous efficientindexing methods; their performance analysis is rather limited; as a result there is no clearunderstanding about the behavior of the alternative structures and the choice of the bestone; given the data and query characteristics. Furthermore; query optimization based onthese methods is currently impossible. These are serious problems due to the incorporationof overlapping and multiversion techniques in several traditional (eg; financial) andemerging (eg; spatiotemporal) applications. In this article; we reduce performance analysisof overlapping and multiversion structures to that of the corresponding ephemeral …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2002,56,0
Optimal algorithms for crawling a hidden database in the web,Cheng Sheng; Nan Zhang; Yufei Tao; Xin Jin,Abstract A hidden database refers to a dataset that an organization makes accessible on theweb by allowing users to issue queries through a search interface. In other words; dataacquisition from such a source is not by following static hyper-links. Instead; data areobtained by querying the interface; and reading the result page dynamically generated. This;with other facts such as the interface may answer a query only partially; has preventedhidden databases from being crawled effectively by existing search engines. This paperremedies the problem by giving algorithms to extract all the tuples from a hidden database.Our algorithms are provably efficient; namely; they accomplish the task by performing only asmall number of queries; even in the worst case. We also establish theoretical resultsindicating that these algorithms are asymptotically optimal--ie; it is impossible to improve …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,55,11
Angel: Enhancing the utility of generalization for privacy preserving publication,Yufei Tao; Hekang Chen; Xiaokui Xiao; Shuigeng Zhou; Donghui Zhang,Generalization is a well-known method for privacy preserving data publication. Despite itsvast popularity; it has several drawbacks such as heavy information loss; difficulty ofsupporting marginal publication; and so on. To overcome these drawbacks; we developANGEL; 1 a new anonymization technique that is as effective as generalization in privacyprotection; but is able to retain significantly more information in the microdata. ANGEL isapplicable to any monotonic principles (eg; l-diversity; t-closeness; etc.); with its superiority(in correlation preservation) especially obvious when tight privacy control must be enforced.We show that ANGEL lends itself elegantly to the hard problem of marginal publication. Inparticular; unlike generalization that can release only restricted marginals; our techniquecan be easily used to publish any marginals with strong privacy guarantees.,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2009,55,11
DBSCAN revisited: mis-claim; un-fixability; and approximation,Junhao Gan; Yufei Tao,Abstract DBSCAN is a popular method for clustering multi-dimensional objects. Just asnotable as the method's vast success is the research community's quest for its efficientcomputation. The original KDD'96 paper claimed an algorithm with O (n log n) running time;where n is the number of objects. Unfortunately; this is a mis-claim; and that algorithmactually requires O (n 2) time. There has been a fix in 2D space; where a genuine O (n log n)-time algorithm has been found. Looking for a fix for dimensionality d≥ 3 is currently animportant open problem. In this paper; we prove that for d≥ 3; the DBSCAN problemrequires Ω (n4/3) time to solve; unless very significant breakthroughs---ones widely believedto be impossible---could be made in theoretical computer science. This (i) explains why thecommunity's search for fixing the aforementioned mis-claim has been futile for d≥ 3; and …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,51,20
Optimal random perturbation at multiple privacy levels,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao; Minghua Chen,Abstract Random perturbation is a popular method of computing anonymized data forprivacy preserving data mining. It is simple to apply; ensures strong privacy protection; andpermits effective mining of a large variety of data patterns. However; all the existing studieswith good privacy guarantees focus on perturbation at a single privacy level. Namely; a fixeddegree of privacy protection is imposed on all anonymized data released by the data holder.This drawback seriously limits the applicability of random perturbation in scenarios wherethe holder has numerous recipients to which different privacy levels apply. Motivated by this;we study the problem of multi-level perturbation; whose objective is to release multipleversions of a dataset anonymized at different privacy levels. The challenge is that variousrecipients may collude by sharing their data to infer privacy beyond their permitted levels …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,50,19
Dynamic anonymization: accurate statistical analysis with privacy preservation,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract A statistical database (StatDB) retrieves only aggregate results; as opposed toindividual tuples. This paper investigates the construction of a privacy preserving StatDB thatcan (i) accurately answer an infinite number of counting queries; and (ii) effectively protectprivacy against an adversary that may have acquired all the previous query results. The coreof our solutions is a novel technique called dynamic anonymization. Specifically; given aquery; we on the fly compute a tailor-made anonymized version of the microdata; whichmaximizes the precision of the query result. Privacy preservation is achieved by ensuringthat the combination of all the versions deployed to process the past queries does not allowaccurate inference of sensitive information. Extensive experiments with real data confirm thatour technique enables highly effective data analysis; while offering strong privacy …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,49,3
Efficient top-k processing in large-scaled distributed environments,Keping Zhao; Yufei Tao; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract The rapid development of networking technologies has made it possible toconstruct a distributed database that involves a huge number of sites. Query processing insuch a large-scaled system poses serious challenges beyond the scope of traditionaldistributed algorithms. In this paper; we propose a new algorithm BRANCA for performingtop-k retrieval in these environments. Integrating two orthogonal methodologies “semanticcaching” and “routing indexes”; BRANCA is able to solve a query by accessing only a smallnumber of servers. Our algorithmic findings are accompanied with a solid theoreticalanalysis; which rigorously proves the effectiveness of BRANCA. Extensive experimentsverify that our technique outperforms the existing methods significantly.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,49,10
On k-skip shortest paths,Yufei Tao; Cheng Sheng; Jian Pei,Abstract Given two vertices s; t in a graph; let P be the shortest path (SP) from s to t; and P* asubset of the vertices in P. P* is a k-skip shortest path from s to t; if it includes at least a vertexout of every k consecutive vertices in P. In general; P* succinctly describes P by samplingthe vertices in P with a rate of at least 1/k. This makes P* a natural substitute in scenarioswhere reporting every single vertex of P is unnecessary or even undesired. This paperstudies k-skip SP computation in the context of spatial network databases (SNDB). Ourtechnique has two properties crucial for real-time query processing in SNDB. First; oursolution is able to answer k-skip queries significantly faster than finding the original SPs intheir entirety. Second; the previous objective is achieved with a structure that occupies lessspace than storing the underlying road network. The proposed algorithms are the …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,40,20

Finding frequent co-occurring terms in relational keyword search,Yufei Tao; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Given a set Q of keywords; conventional keyword search (KS) returns a set oftuples; each of which (i) is obtained from a single relation; or by joining multiple relations;and (ii) contains all the keywords in Q. This paper proposes a relevant problem calledfrequent co-occurring term (FCT) retrieval. Specifically; given a keyword set Q and an integerk; a FCT query reports the k terms that are not in Q; but appear most frequently in the resultof a KS query with the same Q. FCT search is able to discover the concepts that are closelyrelated to Q. Furthermore; it is also an effective tool for refining the keyword set Q oftraditional keyword search. While a FCT query can be trivially supported by solving thecorresponding KS query; we provide a faster algorithm that extracts the correct resultswithout evaluating any KS query at all.

A scalable algorithm for maximizing range sum in spatial databases,Dong-Wan Choi; Chin-Wan Chung; Yufei Tao,Abstract This paper investigates the MaxRS problem in spatial databases. Given a set O ofweighted points and a rectangular region r of a given size; the goal of the MaxRS problem isto find a location of r such that the sum of the weights of all the points covered by r ismaximized. This problem is useful in many location-based applications such as finding thebest place for a new franchise store with a limited delivery range and finding the mostattractive place for a tourist with a limited reachable range. However; the problem has beenstudied mainly in theory; particularly; in computational geometry. The existing algorithmsfrom the computational geometry community are in-memory algorithms which do notguarantee the scalability. In this paper; we propose a scalable external-memory algorithm(ExactMaxRS) for the MaxRS problem; which is optimal in terms of the I/O complexity …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,36,20
Nearest keyword search in XML documents,Yufei Tao; Stavros Papadopoulos; Cheng Sheng; Kostas Stefanidis,Abstract This paper studies the nearest keyword (NK) problem on XML documents. Ingeneral; the dataset is a tree where each node is associated with one or more keywords.Given a node q and a keyword w; an NK query returns the node that is nearest to q amongall the nodes associated with w. NK search is not only useful as a stand-alone operator butalso as a building brick for important tasks such as XPath query evaluation and keywordsearch. We present an indexing scheme that answers NK queries efficiently; in terms of bothpractical and worst-case performance. The query cost is provably logarithmic to the numberof nodes carrying the query keyword. The proposed scheme occupies space linear to thedataset size; and can be constructed by a fast algorithm. Extensive experimentation confirmsour theoretical findings; and demonstrates the effectiveness of NK retrieval as a primitive …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,35,15
Output perturbation with query relaxation,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract Given a dataset containing sensitive personal information; a statistical databaseanswers aggregate queries in a manner that preserves individual privacy. We consider theproblem of constructing a statistical database using output perturbation; which protectsprivacy by injecting a small noise into each query result. We show that the state-of-the-artapproach; ε-differential privacy; suffers from two severe deficiencies: it (i) incurs prohibitivecomputation overhead; and (ii) can answer only a limited number of queries; after which thestatistical database has to be shut down. To remedy the problem; we develop a newtechnique that enforces ε-different privacy with economical cost. Our technique alsoincorporates a query relaxation mechanism; which removes the restriction on the number ofpermissible queries. The effectiveness and efficiency of our solution are verified through …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,34,20
Aggregate processing of planar points,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Jun Zhang,Abstract Aggregate window queries return summarized information about objects that fallinside a query rectangle (eg; the number of objects instead of their concrete ids). Traditionalapproaches for processing such queries usually retrieve considerable extra information;thus compromising the processing cost. The paper addresses this problem for planar pointsfrom both theoretical and practical points of view. We show that; an aggregate window querycan be answered in logarithmic worst-case time by an indexing structure called the aPtree.Next we study the practical behavior of the aP-tree and propose efficient cost models thatpredict the structure size and actual query cost. Extensive experiments show that the aP-tree; while involving more space consumption; accelerates query processing by up to anorder of magnitude compared to a specialized method based on R-trees. Furthermore …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,34,6
Finding the influence set through skylines,Xiaobing Wu; Yufei Tao; Raymong Chi-Wing Wong; Ling Ding; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Given a set P of products; a set O of customers; and a product p ε P; a bichromaticreverse skyline query retrieves all the customers in O that do not find any other product in Pto be absolutely better than p. More specifically; a customer o ε O is in the reverse skyline ofp ε P if and only no other product in P better matches the preference of o on all dimensions.The only existing bichromatic reverse skyline algorithm; which we refer to as basic; isdesigned for uncertain data. This paper focuses on traditional datasets; where each object isa precise point. Since a precise point can be regarded as a special uncertain object; basiccan still be applied. However; as precise data are inherently easier to handle than uncertaindata; one should expect that basic can be further improved by taking advantage of thereduced problem complexity. Indeed; we observe several non-trivial heuristics that can …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,31,10
Transparent anonymization: Thwarting adversaries who know the algorithm,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao; Nick Koudas,Abstract Numerous generalization techniques have been proposed for privacy-preservingdata publishing. Most existing techniques; however; implicitly assume that the adversaryknows little about the anonymization algorithm adopted by the data publisher.Consequently; they cannot guard against privacy attacks that exploit various characteristicsof the anonymization mechanism. This article provides a practical solution tothis problem.First; we propose an analytical model for evaluating disclosure risks; when an adversaryknows everything in the anonymization process; except the sensitive values. Based on thismodel; we develop a privacy principle; transparent l-diversity; which ensures privacyprotection against such powerful adversaries. We identify three algorithms that achievetransparent l-diversity; and verify their effectiveness and efficiency through extensive …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,30,0
On finding skylines in external memory,Cheng Sheng; Yufei Tao,Abstract We consider the skyline problem (aka the maxima problem); which has beenextensively studied in the database community. The input is a set P of d-dimensional points.A point dominates another if the former has a lower coordinate than the latter on everydimension. The goal is to find the skyline; which is the set of points p∈ P such that p is notdominated by any other data point. In the external-memory model; the 2-d version of theproblem is known to be solvable in O ((N/B) log M/B (N/B)) I/Os; where N is the cardinality ofP; B the size of a disk block; and M the capacity of main memory. For fixed d≥ 3; we presentan algorithm with I/O-complexity O ((N/B) logd-2/M/B (N/B)). Previously; the best solution wasadapted from an in-memory algorithm; and requires O ((N/B) logd-2/2 (N/M)) I/Os.,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,29,15
Approximate temporal aggregation,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Christos Faloutsos,Temporal aggregate queries retrieve summarized information about records with time-evolving attributes. Existing approaches have at least one of the following shortcomings:(i)they incur large space requirements;(ii) they have high processing cost and (iii) they arebased on complex structures; which are not available in commercial systems. We solvethese problems by approximation techniques with bounded error. We propose two methods:the first one is based on multiversion B-trees and has logarithmic worst-case query cost;while the second technique uses off-the-shelf B-and R-trees; and achieves the sameperformance in the expected case. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposedmethods consume an order of magnitude less space than their competitors and aresignificantly faster; even for cases that the permissible error bound is very small.,Data Engineering; 2004.

Approximate MaxRS in spatial databases,Yufei Tao; Xiaocheng Hu; Dong-Wan Choi; Chin-Wan Chung,Abstract In the maximizing range sum (MaxRS) problem; given (i) a set P of 2D points eachof which is associated with a positive weight; and (ii) a rectangle r of specific extents; weneed to decide where to place r in order to maximize the covered weight of r-that is; the totalweight of the data points covered by r. Algorithms solving the problem exactly entailexpensive CPU or I/O cost. In practice; exact answers are often not compulsory in a MaxRSapplication; where slight imprecision can often be comfortably tolerated; provided thatapproximate answers can be computed considerably faster. Motivated by this; the presentpaper studies the (1-ε)-approximate MaxRS problem; which admits the same inputs asMaxRS; but aims instead to return a rectangle whose covered weight is at least (1-ε) m*;where m* is the optimal covered weight; and ε can be an arbitrarily small constant …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,28,0
Venn sampling: A novel prediction technique for moving objects,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Jian Zhai; Qing Li,Given a region q/sub R/and a future timestamp q/sub T/; a" range aggregate" queryestimates the number of objects expected to appear in q/sub R/at time q/sub T/. Currently theonly methods for processing such queries are based on spatio-temporal histograms; whichhave several serious problems. First; they consume considerable space in order to provideaccurate estimation. Second; they incur high evaluation cost. Third; their efficiencycontinuously deteriorates with time. Fourth; their maintenance requires significant updateoverhead. Motivated by this; we develop Venn sampling (VS); a novel estimation methodoptimized for a set of" pivot queries" that reflect the distribution of actual ones. In particular;given m pivot queries; VS achieves perfect estimation with only O (m) samples; as opposedto O (2/sup m/) required by the current state of the art in workload-aware sampling …,Data Engineering; 2005.

Performance analysis of R*-trees with arbitrary node extents,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,Existing analysis for R-trees is inadequate for several traditional and emerging applicationsincluding; for example; temporal; spatio-temporal; and multimedia databases because it isbased on the assumption that the extents of a node are identical on all dimensions; which isnot satisfied in these domains. We propose analytical models that can accurately predict R*-tree performance without this assumption. Our derivation is based on the novel concept ofextent regression function; which computes the node extents as a function of the number ofnode splits. Detailed experimental evaluation reveals that the proposed models areaccurate; even in cases where previous methods fail completely.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,26,0
Spatio-temporal join selectivity,Jimeng Sun; Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,Abstract Given two sets S 1; S 2 of moving objects; a future timestamp tq; and a distancethreshold d; a spatio-temporal join retrieves all pairs of objects that are within distance d at tq. The selectivity of a join equals the number of retrieved pairs divided by the cardinality ofthe Cartesian product S 1× S 2. This paper develops a model for spatio-temporal joinselectivity estimation based on rigorous probabilistic analysis; and reveals the factors thataffect the selectivity. Initially; we solve the problem for 1D (point and rectangle) objectswhose location and velocities distribute uniformly; and then extend the results to multi-dimensional spaces. Finally; we deal with non-uniform distributions using a specializedspatio-temporal histogram. Extensive experiments confirm that the proposed formulae arehighly accurate (average error below 10%).,Information Systems,2006,25,1
Adaptive index structures,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,This chapter proposes a general framework for adaptive indexes that improve overall querycost. The performance gain is achieved by allowing index nodes to contain a variablenumber of disk pages. Update algorithms dynamically restructure adaptive indexesdepending on the data and query characteristics. Extensive experiments show that adaptiveB-and R-trees significantly outperform their conventional counterparts; while incurringminimal update overhead. Traditional indexes aim at optimizing the node accesses duringquery processing; which; however; does not necessarily minimize the total cost due to thepossibly large number of random accesses. A single disk access usually includes a seekoperation that positions the disk head at the requested sector (including cylinder seek androtation); and data transfer to/from the main memory. Thus; the total query cost is the sum …,*,2002,25,10
Indexing and retrieval of historical aggregate information about moving objects,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Jun Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis; Qiongmao Shen; Jimeng Sun,Spatio-temporal databases store information about the positions of individual objects overtime. In many applications however; such as traffic supervision or mobile communicationsystems; only summarized data; like the average number of cars in an area for a specificperiod; or phones serviced by a cell each day; is required. Although this information can beobtained from operational databases; its computation is expensive; rendering onlineprocessing inapplicable. A vital solution is the construction of a spatiotemporal datawarehouse. In this paper; we describe a framework for supporting OLAP operations overspatiotemporal data. We argue that the spatial and temporal dimensions should be modeledas a combined dimension on the data cube and present data structures; which integratespatiotemporal indexing with pre-aggregation. While the well-known materialization …,*,2002,25,20
Validity information retrieval for spatio-temporal queries: Theoretical performance bounds,Yufei Tao; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The results of traditional spatial queries (ie; range search; nearest neighbor; etc.)are usually meaningless in spatio-temporal applications; because they will be invalidated bythe movements of query and/or data objects. In practice; a query result R should beaccompanied with validity information specifying (i) the (future) time T that R will expire; and(ii) the change C of R at time T (so that R can be updated incrementally). Although severalalgorithms have been proposed for this problem; their worst-case performance is the sameas that of sequential scan. This paper presents the first theoretical study on validity queries;and develops indexes and algorithms with attractive I/O complexities. Our discussion coversnumerous important variations of the problem and different query/object mobilitycombinations. The solutions involve a set of non-trivial reductions that reveal the problem …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,21,17
Worst-case i/o-efficient skyline algorithms,Cheng Sheng; Yufei Tao,Abstract We consider the skyline problem (aka the maxima problem); which has beenextensively studied in the database community. The input is a set P of d-dimensional points.A point dominates another if the coordinate of the former is at most that of the latter on everydimension. The goal is to find the skyline; which is the set of points p∈ P such that p is notdominated by any other point in P. The main result of this article is that; for any fixeddimensionality d≥ 3; in external memory the skyline problem can be settled by performing O((N/B) log M/B d− 2 (N/B)) I/Os in the worst case; where N is the cardinality of P; B the size ofa disk block; and M the capacity of main memory. Similar bounds can also be achieved forcomputing several skyline variants; including the k-dominant skyline; k-skyband; and α-skyline. Furthermore; the performance can be improved if some dimensions of the data …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,20,17
I/O-efficient algorithms on triangle listing and counting,Xiaocheng Hu; Yufei Tao; Chin-Wan Chung,Abstract This article studies I/O-efficient algorithms for the triangle listing problem and thetriangle counting problem; whose solutions are basic operators in dealing with many othergraph problems. In the former problem; given an undirected graph G; the objective is to findall the cliques involving 3 vertices in G. In the latter problem; the objective is to report just thenumber of such cliques without having to enumerate them. Both problems have been wellstudied in internal memory; but still remain as difficult challenges when G does not fit inmemory; thus making it crucial to minimize the number of disk I/Os performed. Althoughprevious research has attempted to tackle these challenges; the state-of-the-art solutionsrely on a set of crippling assumptions to guarantee good performance. Motivated by this; wedevelop a new algorithm that is provably I/O and CPU efficient at the same time; without …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,19,0
On top-k selection in multi-armed bandits and hidden bipartite graphs,Wei Cao; Jian Li; Yufei Tao; Zhize Li,Abstract This paper discusses how to efficiently choose from $ n $ unknowndistributions the$ k $ ones whose means are the greatest by a certainmetric; up to a small relative error. Westudy the topic under twostandard settings---multi-armed bandits and hidden bipartitegraphs---which differ in the nature of the input distributions. In theformer setting; each distributioncan be sampled (in the iid manner) an arbitrary number of times; whereas in the latter;eachdistribution is defined on a population of a finite size $ m $(andhence; is fully revealedafter $ m $ samples). For both settings; weprove lower bounds on the total number ofsamples needed; and proposeoptimal algorithms whose sample complexities match thoselower bounds.,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2015,18,10
The power-method: a comprehensive estimation technique for multi-dimensional queries,Yufei Tao; Christos Faloutsos; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Existing estimation approaches for multi-dimensional databases often rely on theassumption that data distribution in a small region is uniform; which seldom holds inpractice. Moreover; their applicability is limited to specific estimation tasks under certaindistance metric. This paper develops the Power-method; a comprehensive techniqueapplicable to a wide range of query optimization problems under various metrics. The Power-method eliminates the local uniformity assumption and is accurate even in scenarios whereexisting approaches completely fail. Furthermore; it performs estimation by evaluating onlyone simple formula with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments confirmthat the Power-method outperforms previous techniques in terms of accuracy andapplicability to various optimization scenarios.,Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2003,18,1
New results on two-dimensional orthogonal range aggregation in external memory,Cheng Sheng; Yufei Tao,Abstract We consider the orthogonal range aggregation problem. The dataset S consists ofN axis-parallel rectangles in R 2; each of which is associated with an integer weight. Givenan axis-parallel rectangle Q and an aggregate function F; a query reports the aggregatedresult of the weights of the rectangles in S intersecting Q. The goal is to preprocess S into astructure such that all queries can be answered efficiently. We present indexing schemes tosolve the problem in external memory when F= max (hence; min) and F= sum (hence; countand average); respectively. Our schemes have linear or near-linear space; and answer aquery in O (log BN) or O (logB 2/BN) I/Os; where B is the disk block size.,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,17,8
Random sampling for continuous streams with arbitrary updates,Yufei Tao; Xiang Lian; Dimitris Papadias; Marios Hadjieleftheriou,The existing random sampling methods have at least one of the following disadvantages:they 1) are applicable only to certain update patterns; 2) entail large space overhead; or 3)incur prohibitive maintenance cost. These drawbacks prevent their effective application instream environments (where a relation is updated by a large volume of insertions anddeletions that may arrive in any order); despite the considerable success of randomsampling in conventional databases. Motivated by this; we develop several fully dynamicalgorithms for obtaining random samples from individual relations; and from the join result oftwo tables. Our solutions can handle any update pattern with small space and computationaloverhead. We also present an in-depth analysis that provides valuable insight into thecharacteristics of alternative sampling strategies and leads to precision guarantees …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,16,11
Maximizing range sum in external memory,Dong-Wan Choi; Chin-Wan Chung; Yufei Tao,Abstract This article studies the MaxRS problem in spatial databases. Given a set O ofweighted points and a rectangle r of a given size; the goal of the MaxRS problem is to find alocation of r such that the sum of the weights of all the points covered by r is maximized. Thisproblem is useful in many location-based services such as finding the best place for a newfranchise store with a limited delivery range and finding the hotspot with the largest numberof nearby attractions for a tourist with a limited reachable range. However; the problem hasbeen studied mainly in the theoretical perspective; particularly in computational geometry.The existing algorithms from the computational geometry community are in-memoryalgorithms that do not guarantee the scalability.

Correlation hiding by independence masking,Yufei Tao; Jian Pei; Jiexing Li; Xiaokui Xiao; Ke Yi; Zhengzheng Xing,Extracting useful correlation from a dataset has been extensively studied. In this paper; wedeal with the opposite; namely; a problem we call correlation hiding (CH); which isfundamental in numerous applications that need to disseminate data containing sensitiveinformation. In this problem; we are given a relational table T whose attributes can beclassified into three disjoint sets A; B; and C. The objective is to distort some values in T sothat A becomes independent from B; and yet; their correlation with C is preserved as muchas possible. CH is different from all the problems studied previously in the area of dataprivacy; in that CH demands complete elimination of the correlation between two sets ofattributes; whereas the previous research focuses on partial elimination up to a certain level.A new operator called independence masking is proposed to solve the CH problem …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,14,0
Primal or dual: which promises faster spatiotemporal search?,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract The existing predictive spatiotemporal indexes can be classified into twocategories; depending on whether they are based on the primal or dual methodology.Although we have gained considerable empirical knowledge about various access methods;currently there is only limited understanding on the theoretical characteristics of the twomethodologies. In fact; the experimental results in different papers even contradict eachother; regarding the relative superiority of the primal and dual techniques. This paperpresents a careful study on the query performance of general primal and dual indexes; andreveals important insight into the behavior of each technique. In particular; wemathematically establish the conditions that determine the superiority of each methodology;and provide rigorous justification for well-known observations that have not been properly …,The VLDB Journal,2008,14,22

Independent range sampling,Xiaocheng Hu; Miao Qiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract This paper studies the independent range sampling problem. The input is a set P ofn points in R. Given an interval q=[x; y] and an integer t≥ 1; a query returns t elementsuniformly sampled (with/without replacement) from P∩ q. The sampling result must beindependent from those returned by the previous queries. The objective is to store P in astructure for answering all queries efficiently. If P fits in memory; the problem is interestingwhen P is dynamic (ie; allowing insertions and deletions). The state of the art is a structure ofO (n) space that answers a query in O (t log n) time; and supports an update in O (log n)time. We describe a new structure of O (n) space that answers a query in O (log n+ t)expected time; and supports an update in O (log n) time.,Proceedings of the 33rd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2014,13,20

Shortest unique queries on strings,Xiaocheng Hu; Jian Pei; Yufei Tao,Abstract Let D be a long input string of n characters (from an alphabet of size up to 2 w;where w is the number of bits in a machine word). Given a substring q of D; a shortestunique query returns a shortest unique substring of D that contains q. We present an optimalstructure that consumes O (n) space; can be built in O (n) time; and answers a query in O (1)time.

Optimal splitters for temporal and multi-version databases,Wangchao Le; Feifei Li; Yufei Tao; Robert Christensen,Abstract Temporal and multi-version databases are ideal candidates for a distributed store;which offers large storage space; and parallel and distributed processing power from acluster of (commodity) machines. A key challenge is to achieve a good load balancingalgorithm for storage and processing of these data; which is done by partitioning thedatabase. We introduce the concept of optimal splitters for temporal and multi-versiondatabases; which induce a partition of the input data set; and guarantee that the size of themaximum bucket be minimized among all possible configurations; given a budget for thedesired number of buckets. We design efficient methods for memory-and disk resident datarespectively; and show that they significantly outperform competing baseline methods boththeoretically and empirically on large real data sets.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,12,15
Dynamic top-k range reporting in external memory,Cheng Sheng; Yufei Tao,Abstract In the top-K range reporting problem; the dataset contains N points in the realdomain ℜ; each of which is associated with a real-valued score. Given an interval x 1; x 2 inℜ and an integer K≤ N; a query returns the K points in x 1; x 2 having the smallest scores.We want to store the dataset in a structure so that queries can be answered efficiently. In theexternal memory model; the state of the art is a static structure that consumes O (N/B) space;answers a query in O (log B N+ K/B) time; and can be constructed in O (N+(N log N/B) logM/B (N/B)) time; where B is the size of a disk block; and M the size of memory. We present afully-dynamic structure that retains the same space and query bounds; and can be updatedin O (log 2 BN) amortized time per insertion and deletion. Our structure can be constructed inO ((N/B) log M/B (N/B)) time.,Proceedings of the 31st ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2012,12,10
Join dependency testing; Loomis-Whitney join; and triangle enumeration,Xiaocheng Hu; Miao Qiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract In this paper; we revisit two fundamental problems in database theory. The first oneis called join dependency (JD) testing; where we are given a relation r and a JD; and needto determine whether the JD holds on r. The second problem is called JD existence testing;where we need to determine if there exists any non-trivial JD that holds on r. We prove thatJD testing is NP-hard even if the JD is defined only on binary relations (ie; each with onlytwo attributes). Unless P= NP; this result puts a negative answer to the question whether it ispossible to efficiently test JDs defined exclusively on small (in terms of attribute number)relations. The question has been open since the classic NP-hard proof of Maier; Sagiv; andYannakakis in JACM'81 which requires the JD to involve a relation of Ω (d) attributes; whered is the number of attributes in r.,Proceedings of the 34th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2015,11,20
Efficient computation of range aggregates against uncertain location-based queries,Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Yufei Tao; Wenjie Zhang; Haixun Wang,In many applications; including location-based services; queries may not be precise. In thispaper; we study the problem of efficiently computing range aggregates in a multidimensionalspace when the query location is uncertain. Specifically; for a query point Q whose locationis uncertain and a set S of points in a multidimensional space; we want to calculate theaggregate (eg; count; average and sum) over the subset S'of S such that for each p ϵ S'; Qhas at least probability θ within the distance γ to p. We propose novel; efficient techniques tosolve the problem following the filtering-and-verification paradigm. In particular; two novelfiltering techniques are proposed to effectively and efficiently remove data points fromverification. Our comprehensive experiments based on both real and synthetic datademonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our techniques.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,10,0
Exact and approximate algorithms for the most connected vertex problem,Cheng Sheng; Yufei Tao; Jianzhong Li,Abstract An (edge) hidden graph is a graph whose edges are notexplicitly given. Detectingthe presence of an edge requires an expensive edge probing query. We consider the k MostConnected Vertex (k-MCV) problem on hidden bipartite graphs. Given a bipartite graph Gwith independent vertex sets B and W; the goal is to find the k vertices in B with the largestdegrees using the minimum number of queries. This problem can be regarded as a top-kextension of semi-join; and is encountered in several applications in practice. If B and Whave n and m vertices; respectively; the number of queries needed to solve the problem isnm in the worst case. This; however; is a pessimistic estimate on how many queries arenecessary on practical data. In fact; on some inputs; the problem may be settled with onlykm+ n queries; which is significantly lower than nm for k &Lt; n.

Efficient quantile retrieval on multi-dimensional data,Man Lung Yiu; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,Abstract Given a set of N multi-dimensional points; we study the computation of φ-quantilesaccording to a ranking function F; which is provided by the user at runtime. Specifically; Fcomputes a score based on the coordinates of each point; our objective is to report theobject whose score is the φN-th smallest in the dataset. φ-quantiles provide a succinctsummary about the F-distribution of the underlying data; which is useful for online decisionsupport; data mining; selectivity estimation; query optimization; etc. Assuming that thedataset is indexed by a spatial access method; we propose several algorithms for retrievinga quantile efficiently.

I/O-efficient planar range skyline and attrition priority queues,Casper Kejlberg-Rasmussen; Yufei Tao; Konstantinos Tsakalidis; Kostas Tsichlas; Jeonghun Yoon,Abstract We study the static and dynamic planar range skyline reporting problem in theexternal memory model with block size B; under a linear space budget. The problem asks foran O (n/B) space data structure that stores n points in the plane; and supports reporting the kmaximal input points (aka skyline) among the points that lie within a given query rectangleQ=[α 1 [α 2]×[β 1 β 2. When Q is 3-sided; ie one of its edges is grounded; two variants arise:top-open for β 2=∞ and left-open for α 1=-∞(symmetrically bottom-open and right-open)queries. We present optimal static data structures for top-open queries; for the cases wherethe universe is R 2; a U× U grid; and rank space [O (n)] 2. We also show that left-openqueries are harder; as they require Ω ((n/B) ε+ k/B) I/Os for ε> 0; when only linear space isallowed. We show that the lower bound is tight; by a structure that supports 4-sided …,Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI symposium on Principles of database systems,2013,9,20
Range aggregation with set selection,Yufei Tao; Cheng Sheng; Chin-Wan Chung; Jong-Ryul Lee,In the classic range aggregation problem; we have a set S of objects such that; given aninterval I; a query counts how many objects of S are covered by I. Besides COUNT; theproblem can also be defined with other aggregate functions; eg; SUM; MIN; MAX andAVERAGE. This paper studies a novel variant of range aggregation; where an object canbelong to multiple sets. A query (at runtime) picks any two sets; and aggregates on theirintersection. More formally; let S 1;...; S m be m sets of objects. Given distinct set ids i; j andan interval I; a query reports how many objects in S i∩ S j are covered by I. We call thisproblem range aggregation with set selection (RASS). Its hardness lies in that the pair (i; j)can have (2 m) choices; rendering effective indexing a non-trivial task. 2 The RASS problemcan also be defined with other aggregate functions; and generalized so that a query …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2014,8,10
Output-sensitive skyline algorithms in external memory,Xiaocheng Hu; Cheng Sheng; Yufei Tao; Yi Yang; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract This paper presents new results in external memory for finding the skyline (akamaxima) of N points in d-dimensional space. The state of the art uses O ((N/B) log d− 2 M/B(N/B)) I/Os for fixed d≥ 3; and O ((N/B) log M/B (N/B)) I/Os for d= 2; where M and B are thesizes (in words) of memory and a disk block; respectively. We give algorithms whoserunning time depends on the number K of points in the skyline. Specifically; we achieve O((N/B) log d− 2 M/B (K/B)) expected cost for fixed d≥ 3; and O ((N/B) log M/B (K/B)) worst-case cost for d= 2. As a side product; we solve two problems both of independent interest.The first one; the M-skyline problem; aims at reporting M arbitrary skyline points; or the entireskyline if its size is at most M. We settle this problem in O (N/B) expected time in any fixeddimensionality d. The second one; the M-pivot problem; is more fundamental: given a set …,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2013,8,10
On top-k range reporting in 2D space,Saladi Rahul; Yufei Tao,Abstract Orthogonal range reporting (ORR) is a classic problem in computational geometryand databases; where the objective is to preprocess a set P of points in R 2 such that; givenan axis-parallel rectangle q; all the points in P∩ Q can be reported efficiently. This paperstudies a natural variant of the problem called top-k ORR; where each point p∈ P carries aweight w (p)∈ R;. Besides q; a query also specifies an integer k∈[1;| P|]; and needs toreport the k points in q∩ P with the largest weights. We present optimal or near-optimalstructures for solving the top-k ORR problem in the pointer machine and external memorymodels. As a side product; our structures give new space-query tradeoff for the orthogonalrange max problem; which is a special case of top-k ORR with k= 1.,Proceedings of the 34th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2015,7,0
A dynamic I/O-efficient structure for one-dimensional top-k range reporting,Yufei Tao,Abstract We present a structure in external memory for top-k range reporting; which useslinear space; answers a query in O (lg B n+ k/B) I/Os; and supports an update in O (lg B n)amortized I/Os; where n is the input size; and B is the block size.

Reverse nearest neighbor query,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao,Many organizations; eg; government statistical offices and search engine companies; collectpotentially sensitive information regarding individuals either to publish this data for research;or in return for useful services. While some data collection organizations; like the census; arelegally required not to breach the privacy of the individuals; other data collectionorganizations may not be trusted to uphold privacy.

Efficient temporal counting with bounded error,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract This paper studies aggregate search in transaction time databases. Specifically;each object in such a database can be modeled as a horizontal segment; whose y-projection is its search key; and its x-projection represents the period when the key was validin history. Given a query timestamp qt and a key range $ $\vec {q_k} $ $; a count-queryretrieves the number of objects that are alive at qt; and their keys fall in $ $\vec {q_k} $ $. Weprovide a method that accurately answers such queries; with error less than $ $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\varepsilon\cdot N_ {\rm alive}(q_t) $ $; where N alive (qt) is the number ofobjects alive at time qt; and¿ is any constant in (0; 1].

Continuous constraint query evaluation for spatiotemporal streams,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Nikos Mamoulis; Yufei Tao,Abstract In this paper we study the evaluation of continuous constraint queries (CCQs) forspatiotemporal streams. A CCQ triggers an alert whenever a configuration of constraintsbetween streaming events in space and time are satisfied. Consider; for instance; a serverthat receives updates from GPS-enabled agents that report their positions and othermeasurements (eg; environmental readings). An example of CCQ is:“Alert whenever at least5 readings closer than 5km to each other and within a time difference of 5 minutes reporthigh pressures and low temperatures”. We model CCQs as Constraint Satisfaction Problems(CSPs) and develop solutions for their continuous evaluation. Our techniques (1) considerthe fast arrival rate of incoming events; and (2) minimize the memory requirements; withoutusing predefined window constraints; but by utilizing the structure of the queries.

Efficient top-k indexing via general reductions,Saladi Rahul; Yufei Tao,Abstract Let D be a set of n elements each associated with a real-valued weight; and Q bethe set of all possible predicates allowed on those elements. Given a predicate in Q andinteger k; a top-k query returns the k elements with the largest weights among the elementsof D satisfying q. The corresponding data structure problem aims to store D in small space toallow every query to be answered efficiently. It is already known that; before settling theproblem; one must be able to solve two degenerated accompanying problems:(i) prioritizedreporting: given a predicate q∈ Q and a real value τ; return all the elements of D satisfying qand having weights at least τ (ii) max reporting: top-k queries with k fixed to 1. In this paperwe prove general reductions in external memory that explore the opposite direction. Our firstreduction shows that;(under mild conditions) any prioritized reporting structure yields a …,Proceedings of the 35th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2016,5,10
Logging every footstep: Quantile summaries for the entire history,Yufei Tao; Ke Yi; Cheng Sheng; Jian Pei; Feifei Li,Abstract Quantiles are a crucial type of order statistics in databases. Extensive research hasbeen focused on maintaining a space-efficient structure for approximate quantilecomputation as the underlying dataset is updated. The existing solutions; however; aredesigned to support only the current; most-updated; snapshot of the dataset. Queries on thepast versions of the data cannot be answered. This paper studies the problem of historicalquantile search. The objective is to enable ε-approximate quantile retrieval on any snapshotof the dataset in history. The problem is very important in analyzing the evolution of adistribution; monitoring the quality of services; query optimization in temporal databases;and so on. We present the first formal results in the literature. First; we prove a noveltheoretical lower bound on the space cost of supporting ε-approximate historical quantile …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,5,15
Cost-based predictive spatiotemporal join,Wook-Shin Han; Jaehwa Kim; Byung Suk Lee; Yufei Tao; Ralf Rantzau; Volker Markl,A predictive spatiotemporal join finds all pairs of moving objects satisfying a join conditionon future time and space. In this paper; we present CoPST; the first and foremost algorithmfor such a join using two spatiotemporal indexes. In a predictive spatiotemporal join; thebounding boxes of the outer index are used to perform window searches on the inner index;and these bounding boxes enclose objects with increasing laxity over time. CoPSTconstructs globally tightened bounding boxes" on the fly" to perform window searches duringjoin processing; thus significantly minimizing overlap and improving the join performance.CoPST adapts gracefully to large-scale databases; by dynamically switching between main-memory buffering and disk-based buffering; through a novel probabilistic cost model.

Spatial query estimation without the local uniformity assumption,Yufei Tao; Christos Faloutsos; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Existing estimation approaches for spatial databases often rely on the assumptionthat data distribution in a small region is uniform; which seldom holds in practice. Moreover;their applicability is limited to specific estimation tasks under certain distance metric. Thispaper develops the Power-method; a comprehensive technique applicable to a wide rangeof query optimization problems under both L∞ and L 2 metrics. The Power-methodeliminates the local uniformity assumption and is; therefore; accurate even for datasetswhere existing approaches fail. Furthermore; it performs estimation by evaluating only onesimple formula with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments confirm thatthe Power-method outperforms previous techniques in terms of accuracy and applicability tovarious optimization scenarios.,Geoinformatica,2006,5,20
Distributed online tracking,Mingwang Tang; Feifei Li; Yufei Tao,Abstract In online tracking; an observer S receives a sequence of values; one per timeinstance; from a data source that is described by a function f. A tracker T wants tocontinuously maintain an approximation that is within an error threshold of the value f (t) atany time instance t; with small communication overhead. This problem was recentlyformalized and studied; and a principled approach with optimal competitive ratio wasproposed. This work extends the study of online tracking to a distributed setting; where atracker T wants to track a function f that is computed from a set of functions f1;...; fm from mdistributed observers and respective data sources. This formulation finds numerousimportant and natural applications; eg; sensor networks; distributed systems; measurementnetworks; and pub-sub systems.

Stabbing horizontal segments with vertical rays,Yufei Tao,Abstract We consider maintaining a dynamic set S of N horizontal segments in R 2 such that;given a vertical ray Q in R 2; the segments in S intersecting Q can be reported efficiently. Inthe external memory model; we give a structure that consumes O (N/B) space; answers aquery in O (log B N+ K/B) time (where K is the number of reported segments); and can beupdated in O (log BN) amortized time per insertion and deletion. With B set to a constant; thestructure also works in internal memory; consuming space O (N); answering a query in O(log N+ K) time; and supporting an update in O (log N) amortized time.,Proceedings of the twenty-eighth annual symposium on Computational geometry,2012,4,20
Indexability of 2d range search revisited: constant redundancy and weak indivisibility,Yufei Tao,Abstract In the 2D orthogonal range search problem; we want to preprocess a set of 2Dpoints so that; given any axis-parallel query rectangle; we can report all the data points inthe rectangle efficiently. This paper presents a lower bound on the query time that can beachieved by any external memory structure that stores a point at most r times; where r is aconstant integer. Previous research has resolved the bound at two extremes: r= 1; and rbeing arbitrarily large. We; on the other hand; derive the explicit tradeoff at every specific r. Apremise that lingers in existing studies is the so-called indivisibility assumption: all theinformation bits of a point are treated as an atom; ie; they are always stored together in thesame block. We partially remove this assumption by allowing a data structure to freely dividea point into individual bits stored in different blocks. The only assumption is that; those bits …,Proceedings of the 31st ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2012,4,10
Finding maximum degrees in hidden bipartite graphs,Yufei Tao; Cheng Sheng; Jianzhong Li,Abstract An (edge) hidden graph is a graph whose edges are not explicitly given. Detectingthe presence of an edge requires expensive edge-probing queries. We consider the k mostconnected vertex problem on hidden bipartite graphs. Specifically; given a bipartite graph Gwith independent vertex sets B and W; the goal is to find the k vertices in B with the largestdegrees using the minimum number of queries. This problem can be regarded as a top-kextension of a semi-join; and is encountered in many applications in practice (eg; top-kspatial join with arbitrarily complex join predicates). If B and W have n and m verticesrespectively; the number of queries needed to solve the problem is nm in the worst case.This; however; is a pessimistic estimate on how many queries are necessary on practicaldata. In fact; on some easy inputs; the problem can be efficiently settled with only km+ n …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,4,19
Dynamic Density Based Clustering,Junhao Gan; Yufei Tao,Abstract Dynamic clustering---how to efficiently maintain data clusters along with updates inthe underlying dataset---is a difficult topic. This is especially true for density-basedclustering; where objects are aggregated based on transitivity of proximity; under whichdeciding the cluster (s) of an object may require the inspection of numerous other objects.The phenomenon is unfortunate; given the popular usage of this clustering approach inmany applications demanding data updates. Motivated by the above; we investigate thealgorithmic principles for dynamic clustering by DBSCAN; a successful representative ofdensity-based clustering; and ρ-approximate DBSCAN; proposed to bring down thecomputational hardness of the former on static data. Surprisingly; we prove that the ρ-approximate version suffers from the very same hardness when the dataset is fully …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,3,15

Theinput is a set D of strings whose characters are drawn from a constant-size alphabet. Given astring q; a query reports the ids of all strings in D that are within 1 edit distance from q. Wegive a structure occupying O (n/B) blocks that answers a query in O(1+mwB+kB) I/Os; wheren is the total length of all strings in D; m is the length of q; k is the number of ids reported; w isthe size of a machine word; and B is the number of words in a block.,International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval,2014,3,10
FIFO indexes for decomposable problems,Cheng Sheng; Yufei Tao,Abstract This paper studies first-in-first-out (FIFO) indexes; each of which manages a datasetwhere objects are deleted in the same order as their insertions. We give a technique thatconverts a static data structure to a FIFO index for all decomposable problems; provided thatthe static structure can be constructed efficiently. We present FIFO access methods to solveseveral problems including half-plane search; nearest neighbor search; and extreme-pointsearch. All of our structures consume linear space; and have optimal or near-optimal querycost.,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,3,0
Diversity in Skylines.,Yufei Tao,Abstract Given an integer k; a diverse skyline contains the k skyline points that best describethe tradeoffs (among different dimensions) offered by the full skyline. This paper gives anoverview of the latest results on this topic. Specifically; we first describe the state-of-the-artformulation of diverse skylines. Then; we explain several algorithms for finding a diverseskyline; where the objective is to save cost by avoiding the computation of the entire skyline.In particular; we will discuss a polynomial-time algorithm in 2D space that returns the exactresult; the NP-hardness of the problem in dimensionality at least 3; and an approximatesolution with good quality guarantees.,IEEE Data Eng.

Output-optimal Parallel Algorithms for Similarity Joins,Xiao Hu; Yufei Tao; Ke Yi,Abstract Parallel join algorithms have received much attention in recent years; due to therapid development of massively parallel systems such as MapReduce and Spark. In thedatabase theory community; most efforts have been focused on studying worst-optimalalgorithms. However; the worst-case optimality of these join algorithms relies on the hardinstances having very large output sizes. In the case of a two-relation join; the hard instanceis just a Cartesian product; with an output size that is quadratic in the input size. In practice;however; the output size is usually much smaller. One recent parallel join algorithm byBeame et al.[8] has achieved output-optimality; ie; its cost is optimal in terms of both the inputsize and the output size; but their algorithm only works for a 2-relation equi-join; and hassome imperfections. In this paper; we first improve their algorithm to true optimality. Then …,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,2,20
I/O-efficient join dependency testing; Loomis–Whitney join; and triangle enumeration,Xiaocheng Hu; Miao Qiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract We revisit two fundamental problems in database theory. The join-dependency (JD)testing problem is to determine whether a given JD holds on a relation r. We prove that theproblem is NP-hard even if the JD involves only relations each of which has only twoattributes. The JD-existence testing problem is to determine if there exists any non-trivial JDsatisfied by r. We present an I/O-efficient algorithm in the external memory model; which infact settles the closely related Loomis–Whitney enumeration problem. As a side product; wesolve the triangle enumeration problem with the optimal I/O-complexity; improving a recentresult of Pagh and Silvestri in PODS'14.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2016,2,10
Exact and approximate flexible aggregate similarity search,Feifei Li; Ke Yi; Yufei Tao; Bin Yao; Yang Li; Dong Xie; Min Wang,Abstract Aggregate similarity search; also known as aggregate nearest-neighbor (Ann)query; finds many useful applications in spatial and multimedia databases. Given a group Qof M query objects; it retrieves from a database the objects most similar to Q; where thesimilarity is an aggregation (eg; sum sum;\max max) of the distances between each retrievedobject p and all the objects in Q. In this paper; we propose an added flexibility to the querydefinition; where the similarity is an aggregation over the distances between p and anysubset of ϕ M ϕ M objects in Q for some support 0< ϕ ≤ 1 0< ϕ≤ 1. We call this newdefinition flexible aggregate similarity search and accordingly refer to a query as a flexibleaggregate nearest-neighbor (Fann) query.

Spatio-Temporal Data Warehouses,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,Encyclopedia of Database Systems,2009,2,10
On the Hardness and Approximation of Euclidean DBSCAN,Junhao Gan; Yufei Tao,Abstract DBSCAN is a method proposed in 1996 for clustering multi-dimensional points; andhas received extensive applications.

External memory stream sampling,Xiaocheng Hu; Miao Qiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract This paper aims to understand the I/O-complexity of maintaining a big sample set---whose size exceeds the internal memory's capacity---on a data stream. We study this topic ina new computation model; named the external memory stream (EMS) model; that naturallyextends the standard external memory model to stream environments. A suite of EMS-indigenous techniques are presented to prove matching lower and upper bounds for with-replacement (WR) and without-replacement (WoR) sampling on append-only and time-based sliding window streams; respectively. Our results imply that; compared to RAM; theEMS model is perhaps a more suitable computation model for studying stream sampling;because the new model separates different problems by their hardness in ways that couldnot be observed in RAM.,Proceedings of the 34th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2015,1,0
I/O-Efficient Bundled Range Aggregation,Yufei Tao; Cheng Sheng,This paper studies bundled range aggregation; which is conceptually equivalent to runninga range aggregate query separately on multiple datasets; returning the query result on eachdataset. In particular; the queried datasets can be arbitrarily chosen from a large number(hundreds or even thousands) of candidate datasets. The challenge is to minimize the querycost no matter how many and which datasets are selected. We propose a fully-dynamic datastructure called aggregate bundled B-tree (aBB-tree) to settle bundled range aggregation.Specifically; the aBB-tree requires linear space; answers any query in O (log BN) I/Os; andcan be updated in O (log BN) I/Os (where N is the total size of all the candidate datasets; andB the disk page size); under the circumstances where the number of datasets is O (B). Thepractical efficiency of our technique is demonstrated with extensive experiments.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,1,10

The goal is to preprocess the sets into a structuresuch that; given a query range r and an arbitrary set Q⊆{1;…; L}; we can efficiently report allthe points in Si∩ r for each i∊ Q. The problem was studied as early as 1986 by Chazelleand Guibas [9] and has recently re-emerged when studying higher-dimensional complexityof orthogonal range reporting [2; 3]. We focus on the one-and two-dimensional cases of theproblem. We prove that in the pointer-machine model (as well as comparison models suchas the real RAM model); answering queries requires Ω (| Q| log (L/| Q|)+ log N+ K) time in theworst case; where K is the number of output points.

Privacy preserving publication: Anonymization frameworks and principles,Yufei Tao,Summary Given a microdata table T; the objective of privacy preserving publication is torelease a distorted version T′ of T such that T′ does not allow an adversary to confidentlyderive the sensitive data of any individual; and yet; T′ can be used to analyze the statisticalpatterns significant in T. The existing methods of privacy preserving publication is essentiallythe integration of an anonymization framework and an anonymization principle. Specifically;a framework describes how anonymization is performed; whereas a principle measureswhether a suficient amount of anonymization has been applied. In this chapter; we willdiscuss the characteristics of two existing frameworks: generalization and anatomy; and oftwo most popular principles: k-anonymity and l-diversity.,*,2008,1,15
Processing ranked queries with the minimum space,Yufei Tao; Marios Hadjieleftheriou,Abstract Practical applications often need to rank multi-variate records by assigning variouspriorities to different attributes. Consider a relation that stores students' grades on twocourses: database and algorithm. Student performance is evaluated by an “overall score”calculated as w 1· g db+ w 2· g alg; where w 1; w 2 are two input “weights”; and g db (g alg)is the student grade on database (algorithm). A “top-k ranked query” retrieves the k studentswith the best scores according to specific w 1 and w 2. We focus on top-k queries whose k isbounded by a constant c; and present solutions that guarantee low worst-case query cost byusing provably the minimum space. The core of our methods is a novel concept;“minimumcovering subset”; which contains only the necessary data for ensuring correct answers for allqueries.

Theoretically Optimal and Empirically Efficient R-trees with Strong Parallelizability,Jianzhong Qi; Yufei Tao; Yanchuan Chang; Rui Zhang,ABSTRACT The massive amount of data and large variety of data distributions in the bigdata era call for access methods that are efficient in both query processing and index bulk-loading; and over both practical and worst-case workloads. To address this need; we revisita classic multidimensional access method–the R-tree. We propose a novel R-tree packingstrategy that produces R-trees with an asymptotically optimal I/O complexity for windowqueries in the worst case. Our experiments show that the R-trees produced by the proposedstrategy are highly efficient on real and synthetic data of different distributions. The proposedstrategy is also simple to parallelize; since it relies only on sorting. We propose a parallelalgorithm for R-tree bulk-loading based on the proposed packing strategy; and analyze itsperformance under the massively parallel communication model.

Stream sampling over windows with worst-case optimality and $ $\ell $ $ ℓ-overlap independence,Yufei Tao; Xiaocheng Hu; Miao Qiao,Abstract Sampling provides fundamental support to numerous applications that cannotafford to materialize all the objects arriving at a rapid speed. Existing stream samplingalgorithms guarantee small space and query overhead; but all require worst-case updatetime proportional to the number of samples. This creates a performance issue when a largesample set is required. In this paper; we propose a new sampling algorithm that is optimalsimultaneously in all the three aspects: space; query time; and update time. In particular; thealgorithm handles an update in O (1) worst-case time with a very small hidden constant. Ouralgorithm also ensures a strong independence guarantee: the sample sets of all the queriesare mutually independent as long as the overlap between two query windows is small.,The VLDB Journal,2017,*,10
Semi-Group Range Sum Revisited: Query-Space Lower Bound Tightened,Xiaocheng Hu; Yufei Tao; Yi Yang; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Let DD be a set of n elements e_1; ...; e_n e 1;…; en drawn from a commutativesemigroup. Given two integers x; y satisfying 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ n 1≤ x≤ y≤ n; a range sumquery returns the sum of the y-x+ 1 y-x+ 1 elements e_x ex; e_ x+ 1 ex+ 1;...; e_y ey. Thegoal of indexing is to store DD in a data structure so that all such queries can be answeredefficiently in the worst case. This paper proves a new lower bound in the semigroup modelon the tradeoff between space and query time for the above problem. We show that; if thequery time needs to be at most an integer t; a structure must use space. The bound isasymptotically tight for every t ≥ 2 t≥ 2; and is matched by an existing structure. Previously;the best lower bounds either had a substantially smaller non-linear factor (Yao in Space-time tradeoff for answering range queries (extended abstract).

Range Thresholding on Streams,Miao Qiao; Junhao Gan; Yufei Tao,Abstract This paper studies a type of continuous queries called range thresholding onstreams (RTS). Imagine the stream as an unbounded sequence of elements each of which isa real value. A query registers an interval; and must be notified as soon as a certain numberof incoming elements fall into the interval. The system needs to support multiple queriessimultaneously; and aims to minimize the space consumption and computation time.Currently; all the solutions to this problem entail quadratic time O (nm) to process n streamelements and m queries; which severely limits their applicability to only a small number ofqueries. We propose the first algorithm that breaks the quadratic barrier; by reducing thecomputation cost dramatically to O (n+ m); subject only to a polylogarithmic factor. Thealgorithm is general enough to guarantee the same on weighted versions of the queries …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,*,6

I/O-Efficient Top-k Range Reporting with Logarithmic Update Cost,Cheng Sheng; Yufei Tao,Abstract In the top-k range reporting problem; the input set S consists of n points in the realdomain; each of which is associated with a distinct real-valued score. Given an intervalq=[x1; x2] and an integer k∈[1; n]; a query returns the k points in q having the largest scores.Specially; if q covers less than k points of S; all of them are returned. We want to store S in adynamic structure so that updates (both insertions and deletions) and queries can besupported efficiently. We present a structure in external memory that uses linear space;answers a query in O (lgB n+ k/B) I/Os; and supports an update in O (lgB n) amortized I/Os;where B is the block size.,*,2015,*,0
On The I/O Complexity of Dynamic Distinct Counting,Xiaocheng Hu; Yufei Tao; Yi Yang; Shengyu Zhang; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract In dynamic distinct counting; we want to maintain a multi-set S of integers underinsertions to answer efficiently the query: how many distinct elements are there in S? Inexternal memory; the problem admits two standard solutions. The first one maintains $ S $ ina hash structure; so that the distinct count can be incrementally updated after each insertionusing O (1) expected I/Os. A query is answered for free. The second one stores S in a linkedlist; and thus supports an insertion in O (1/B) amortized I/Os. A query can be answered in O(N/B log_ {M/B}(N/B)) I/Os by sorting; where N=| S|; B is the block size; and M is the memorysize. In this paper; we show that the above two naive solutions are already optimal within apolylog factor. Specifically; for any Las Vegas structure using N^{O (1)} blocks; if its expectedamortized insertion cost is o (1/log B}); then it must incur Omega (N/(B log B)) expected I …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2015,*,0
Indexability of 2D Range Search with Constant Redundancy,Yufei Tao,Abstract We consider the 2D orthogonal range search problem defined as follows. Let P bea set of 2D points where each point p∈ P carries an arbitrary information field. The goal is tostore P in a data structure so that; given any axis-parallel query rectangle q; we can reportthe information fields of all the points in P∩ q efficiently. For every constant integer r≥ 1; weprove a lower bound on the query cost of any external memory structure that stores aninformation field r times on average. Our lower bounds do not require that information fieldsbe stored as atoms. Instead; a structure is free to store the bits of an information field indifferent blocks; and/or store some bits more often than others. We also describe structureswhose query efficiency matches the lower bounds.,*,2014,*,0
Instance-level worst-case query bounds on R-trees,Yufei Tao; Yi Yang; Xiaocheng Hu; Cheng Sheng; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Even with its significant impacts on the database area; the R-tree is often criticizedby its lack of good worst-case guarantees. For example; in range search (where we want toreport all the data points in a query rectangle); it is known that on adversely designeddatasets and queries; an R-tree can be as slow as a sequential scan that simply reads allthe data points. Nevertheless; R-trees work so well on real data that they have been widelyimplemented in commercial systems. This stark contrast has caused long-term controversybetween practitioners and theoreticians as to whether this structure deserves its fame. Thispaper provides theoretical evidence that; somewhat surprisingly; R-trees are efficient in theworst case for range search on many real datasets.

Finding approximate partitions and splitters in external memory,Xiaocheng Hu; Yufei Tao; Yi Yang; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract This paper studies two fundamental problems both of which are defined on a set Sof elements drawn from an ordered domain.

We say that the former dominates the latter if x1≥ x2 andy1≥ y2 (note that the two equalities cannot hold simultaneously because these are twodifferent points). Let P be a set of n points in R2. A point p∈ P is a maximal point of P if p isnot dominated by any point in P. We want to design an algorithm to report all the maximalpoints of P efficiently. In the example of Figure 1; points 1; 2; 6; and 8 should be reported. Wewill assume that P is in general position (in particular; no two points have the same x-coordinate; or the same y-coordinate). It is not hard to observe that the maximal points mustform a “staircase”; namely; if we walk along them in ascending order of x-coordinate; their y-coordinates must be descending.,*,2014,*,0

On Top-k Search and Range Reporting,Yufei Tao,Abstract This paper considers top-k search of the following style. Let S be a set of elements;each associated with a real-valued score. Let Q be a (possibly infinite) set of predicates.Given a predicate q∈ Q and an integer k≥ 1; a top-k query reports the k elements in S (q)with the highest scores; where S (q) denotes the set of elements in S satisfying q. Theobjective is to store S in a structure so that queries can be answered efficiently. We present ageneral technique that reduces top-k search to three related problems:(i) counting: findingthe size of S (q);(ii)(essentially) max-search: finding the maximum score of the elements in S(q); and (iii) τ-reporting: finding all the elements in S (q) whose scores are at least a value τgiven at query time. For a number of fundamental top-k problems; their counting; max-search; and τ-reporting variants have already been settled previously. Our technique …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1208.4516,2012,*,20
Lecture Notes: Best-first Algorithm,Yufei Tao,The R-tree is one of the (very) few multi-dimensional indexes that have been incorporated ina commercial database system (eg; Oracle; DB2; Informix; etc.). Therefore; it is an importantresearch topic to design efficient algorithms for R-trees that can be easily implemented.Such algorithms enhance the power of a commercial system; thus having immediate impactsin practice. In this lecture; we will study a well-known method called best-first (BF) search;which has been applied extensively to solve a large number of problems with R-trees. Acrucial feature of the method is that it can be used to design optimal algorithms (we willclarify the notion of optimality later). We will discuss it in the context of nearest neighbor (NN)search.,*,2012,*,0
Lecture Notes: First-in-first-out Indexing,Yufei Tao,This lecture discusses a stream model called the first in first out (FIFO) model; whichgeneralizes the sliding window model we are familiar with. In the FIFO model; we arelooking at an unbounded stream of elements; and at any moment of time; are interested inonly a set S of most recently received elements. This sounds similar to the sequence-basedsliding window model; where S has a fixed size; because the arrival of a new elementalways implies the deletion of the oldest element in S. FIFO model; on the other hand; allowsan arbitrary interleaving of insertions and deletions (namely; there can be any number;including 0; of insertions between two consecutive deletions). The only constraint is thatelements must be deleted in the same order as they arrive; and hence the name FIFO. Thesize of S; which we denote as n; can therefore vary arbitrarily.

Tofacilitate analysis; let us assume that after drawing a ball; we put it back into the box; so thatit may be drawn again with the same chance of any other ball.

This chapter will first review these applications and explain whyuncertainty is inherent; sometimes even intended; in their underlying data. Then; we willaddress two classical spatial queries: range search and nearest neighbor retrieval. We willsee that the presence of uncertainty requires extending the traditional definitions of bothqueries; and thus; also invalidates the conventional algorithms designed for precisedatabases.

How can we generate one anonymizedversion of the data so that the privacy preservation requirement like k-anonymity is satisfiedfor all users? Moreover; how can we reduce the information loss as much as possible whilethe privacy preservation requirements are met?

Indexing; BDual Tree,Man Lung Yiu; Yufei Tao; Nikos Mamoulis,The iDistance is an indexing and query processing technique for k nearest neighbor (kNN)queries on point data in multi-dimensional metric spaces. The kNN query is one of thehardest problems on multi-dimensional data. It has been shown analytically andexperimentally that any algorithm using hierarchical index structure based on either space-or data-partitioning is less efficient than the naive method of sequentially checking everydata record (called the sequential scan) in high-dimensional spaces [4]. Some datadistributions including the uniform distribution are particularly hard cases [1]. The iDistanceis designed to process kNN queries in high-dimensional spaces efficiently and it isespecially good for skewed data distributions; which usually occur in real-life data sets.

Novel Forms of Nearest Neighbor Queries in Spatio-Temporal Applications,Dimitris Papadias; Yufei Tao; Jun Zhang; Qiongmao Shen; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Several types of nearest neighbor (NN) search have been proposed and studied inthe context of spatial databases. The most common type is the point NN query; whichretrieves the nearest neighbors of an input point. Such a query; however; is usuallymeaningless in highly dynamic environments where the query point or the database objectsmove/change over time. In this paper we study alternative forms of nearest neighbor queriessuitable for spatio-temporal applications. In particular; we first describe time-parameterizedqueries; where in addition to the current nearest neighbors of a query point; the resultcontains the expected validity period of the result (given the query and object movement); aswell as the change that will occur at the end of the validity period.

Massively Parallel Entity Matching with Linear Classification in Low Dimensional Space,Yufei Tao,Abstract In entity matching classification; we are given two sets R and S of objects wherewhether r and s form a match is known for each pair (r; s)∈ R× S. If R and S are subsets ofdomains D (R) and D (S) respectively; the goal is to discover a classifier function f: D (R)× D(S)→{0; 1} from a certain class satisfying the property that; for every (r; s)∈ R× S; f (r; s)= 1 ifand only if r and s are a match. Past research is accustomed to running a learning algorithmdirectly on all the labeled (ie; match or not) pairs in R× S. This; however; suffers from thedrawback that even reading through the input incurs a quadratic cost. We pursue a directiontowards removing the quadratic barrier. Denote by T the set of matching pairs in R× S.

The goal is to pre-process P into a data structure such that allqueries can be answered efficiently. Although we defined the problem by specifying q as a 4-sided rectangle; it is sufficient to focus on 2-sided q in the form of (−∞; x]×(−∞; y]. A momentof thinking will reveal that the result of a 4-sided query can be obtained from four 2-sidedqueries. We will assume that each (computer) word has at least log2 N bits; which is a …,*,*,*,11

Lecture Notes: External Range Tree,Yufei Tao,This lecture will discuss the range searching problem. Let P be a set of N points in R2. Givenan axis-parallel rectangle q; a range query reports all the points of P∩ q. We want tomaintain a dynamic structure on P to answer range queries efficiently. We will introduce theexternal range tree [1] which solves a query in O (logB N+ K/B) I/Os; where K is the numberof points reported. It uses O (N,*,*,*,10
Lecture Notes: Range Searching with Linear Space,Yufei Tao,In this lecture; we will continue our discussion on the range searching problem. Recall thatthe input set P consists of N points in R2. Given an axis-parallel rectangle q; a range queryreports all the points of P∩ q. We want to maintain a fully dynamic structure on P to answerrange queries efficiently. We will focus on non-replicating structures [2; 3]. Specifically;consider that each point in P has an information field (eg; the menu of a restaurant) of Lwords; where L= o (B). Given a query; an algorithm must report the information fields of allthe points that fall in the query window. A non-replicating structure is allowed to use O (N/B)+NL/B space. Note that the term NL/B is outside the big-O. In other words; the structure canstore each information field exactly once; and on top of that; consume O (N/B) extra space.The external range tree we discussed previous is not non-replicating (think: why?).,*,*,*,20
Lecture Notes: External Priority Search Tree,Yufei Tao,In this lecture; we will consider another fundamental problem in computer science: 3-sidedrange searching. Let P be a set of N points in R2. A rectangle is said to be 3-sided if it hasthe form [x1; x2]×[y;∞); namely; its bottom edge is grounded at the bottom of the data space.Given a 3-sided rectangle q; a 3-sided range query reports all the points of P covered by q;namely; P∩ q. This problem generalizes the stabbing problem we discussed previously(think: why?). Interestingly; the persistent B-tree can also be used to solve the static versionof the problem.,*,*,*,8
Lecture Notes: External Interval Tree,Yufei Tao,This lecture discusses the stabbing problem. Let I be a set of N intervals in R. We want tostore I in a structure so that; given a query value q∈ R; all the intervals in I containing q canbe reported efficiently. Such a query is called a stabbing query. This problem can actually besolved by the persistent B-tree:,*,*,*,0
Lecture Notes: Distribution Sweeping,Yufei Tao,In this lecture; we will study the distribution sweeping technique proposed by Goodrich etal.[2].

Next; we will discuss two representatives of such problems.,*,*,*,0
Lecture Notes: Comparison-Based Lower Bounds,Yufei Tao,We have proved in a previous lecture that the permutation problem on n elements requiresΩ(min{n; n B logM/B n B }) I/Os to solve in the indivisibility model. This immediately implies thesame lower bound for sorting—if we can sort n elements in x I/Os; then we can also permutethem in O(x) I/Os. This; in turn; means that no “indivisible” EM algorithm can always sort in o(n … I/Os; because this will violate the aforementioned lower bound when logM/B … How aboutlogM/B n B = ω(B)? Is it possible to sort in o( n B logM/B n B ) in this case?

Lecture Notes: External Memory Model and Sorting,Yufei Tao,You are perhaps familiar with the complexities of many algorithms in internal memory. Forexample; it is well-known that N numbers can be sorted with O (N log N) time in the RAMmodel. What this statement says exactly is that; there is an algorithm able to solve the sortingproblem by performing O (N log N)“basic operations”. In particular; each basic operationeither performs some “standard” CPU work (eg;+;−;∗;/; comparison; taking the AND/OR/XORof two words; etc.) or accesses a memory location. Many applications in practice need todeal with datasets that are too large to fit in memory. While it is true that the memory capacityof a computer has been increasing rapidly; dataset sizes have exploded at an even greaterpace; such that it is increasingly unrealistic to hope that someday we could run all theapplications entirely in memory. In reality; data still need to be stored in an external …,*,*,*,15

Lecture 4: The B-tree and its Variants (Part I),Yufei Tao,Time to review undergraduate materials again. The B-tree is probably the most importantdata structure in external memory; with its significance comparable to the binary tree in RAM.It is balanced; ie; all the leaf nodes are at the same level. Each leaf/internal node hasbetween B/2 and B elements; except the root which can have at least 2 and at most Belements. Each node is stored in O (1) blocks. Let S be a set of elements from a total order. AB-tree on S stores all the elements in S at the leaf level; with exactly one copy per element.Furthermore; the elements are sorted in ascending order if we enumerate them from theleftmost leaf node to the rightmost. An internal node contains routing elements; one for eachof its child nodes. A routing element is a copy of the smallest element in the subtree rooted atits child node.,*,*,*,11

Lecture 2: Distribution Sweep,Yufei Tao,In this lecture; we will discuss a powerful technique called distribution sweep whichunderlies the external memory solutions to many geometry problems. We start with theorthogonal segment intersection problem; where we are given a set R of horizontalsegments and a set S of vertical segments (all in the plane R2); and need to report all pairsof segments in R× S that intersect each other. Set N=| R| and T=| S|. It is easy to see that inthe extreme case there can be NT pairs in the result set; in which case the cost will have tobe Ω (NT/B). We want to do better by making the cost sensitive to the result size. As we willsee; if K pairs are to be output; the problem can be solved in O (N,*,*,*,0
1 A tree-dependent model,Yufei Tao,The R-tree does not have interesting worst-case guarantees on search performance. It is possibleto design a dataset and a query [1] such that the query cost of an R-tree is as expensive as abrute-force scan. However; it is well-known that the R-tree is fairly efficient for practical data andqueries. This phenomenon motivated people to look for a way to understand this structure ina more formal manner. An important outcome of the relevant studies is the so-called costmodel; which is an analytical formula that estimates the query cost; based on the parametersof the query and the underlying dataset. Besides revealing the characteristics of the R-tree; suchcost models are especially useful for query optimization in a database system (where the optimizerrelies on accurate estimates of query cost to decide a good execution plan) … Accurate costmodels are known for many types of queries including range searching; nearest neigh …,*,*,*,11

1 Leveraging the persistent B-tree,Yufei Tao,In the persistent B-tree we discussed; a key is a simple numeric value. This is reallyunnecessary. Just like a conventional B-tree; the keys can be any type of values on whichthere is a total order. In the point location problem; a key will be the equation of a linesegment. To see the total order here; imagine you put a vertical line l over G; the segmentsintersecting l naturally form an ordering; from bottom to top. See; for example; the boldsegments in Figure 2. If each segment is tagged with the polygon below it; we can answerthe query by using the relevant logical B-tree to retrieve the segment just above q. We canstill build the persistent tree using the planesweep approach. More specifically; wheneverthe sweeping line hits the beginning (ending) of a segment; we insert (delete) its equationinto (from) the version of the B-tree at the sweeping line.

1 Problem settings,Yufei Tao,Without loss of generality; we assume that each dimension has a range [0; t]; where t is aninteger. Following the LSH literature [1; 4; 5]; in analyzing the quality of query results; weassume that all coordinates are integers; so that we can put a lower bound of 1 on thedistance between two different points. In fact; this is not a harsh assumption because; withproper scaling; we can convert the real numbers in most applications to integers. Given apoint q; a c-approximate nearest neighbor query returns a point o in the dataset D; such thatthe distance o; q between o and q is at most c times the distance between q and its real NNo∗. We assume that q is not in D. Otherwise; the NN problem becomes a lookup query;which can be easily solved by standard hashing. As in the last lecture; we consider thatdistances are measured by l2 norm.,*,*,*,10
1 Distribution sweep,Yufei Tao,We will discuss the technique in the context of a concrete problem; called segment join.Assume that we have a set S of n horizontal segments; and another set R of m verticalsegments. The goal is to report all pairs of intersecting segments in S× R efficiently. Forexample; in Figure 1; the result has 3 pairs:(s1; r1);(s2; r2); and (s3; r2). ss¡ s¢ rr¡,*,*,*,20
Lecture 9: Range Searching (Part I),Yufei Tao,This lecture will give several data structures for solving the range searching problem. Let usreview its definition. P is a set of N points in R2. Given an axis-parallel rectangle q; a rangequery reports all the points of P∩ q. We want to maintain a fully dynamic structure on P toanswer range queries efficiently.,*,*,*,19
Lecture 6: External Interval Tree (Part II),Yufei Tao,Remember that it is not our purpose to design a static structure to solve the stabbingproblem–in fact; a persistent B-tree already fulfills that purpose. Our goal is to have a fullydynamic structure. In the sequel; we will discuss how the external interval tree can beupdated efficiently. For this purpose; we will make the tall cache assumption that M≥ B2;which allows us to avoid some complicated details; so that we can focus on learning severalmajor techniques to dynamize an external memory structure.,*,*,*,20
1 Ball cover,Yufei Tao,LSH does not solve c-approximate NN queries directly. Instead; it is designed [6] for adifferent problem called c-approximate ball cover (BC). Let D be a set of points in d-dimensional space. Denote by B (q; r) a ball that centers at the query point q and has radiusr. A c-approximate BC query returns the following result:,*,*,*,10
Lecture 5: The B-tree and its Variants (Part II-Persistent B-tree),Yufei Tao,Consider the following problem: given a set S of horizontal segments; we want to pre-process S into a data structure; such that given any vertical (query) segment q; the segmentsin S intersecting q can be reported efficiently. In Lecture 2; we have seen this problem (it wascalled “orthogonal segment intersection”) in its offline version; where all the query segmentswere given all at once; with the objective being (essentially) to share the computation ofprocessing different queries. Here; the problem at hand is online: we do not know whichquery to answer until it is given to us; and we have to report its result immediately (ie; we donot have the option of waiting until getting the next query). The insight we gained from theoffline version still helps. Let ℓ be the vertical line that coincides with q. Imagine we have a B-tree T indexing the y-coordinates of the segments in S intersecting ℓ; in which case the …,*,*,*,10

Lecture 8: External Priority Search Tree,Yufei Tao,This and the next few lectures will be devoted to range searching; which is another classicproblem in computer science. We will study the problem in 2d space. Let P be a set of Npoints in R2. Given an axis-parallel rectangle q; a range query reports all the points of Pcovered by q; namely; P∩ q. In the static version of the problem; we want to pre-process Pinto a structure so that a range query can be answered efficiently. In its dynamic version; wewant to maintain the structure along with the updates on P while still ensuring good queryperformance. This lecture will focus on a special version of the problem called 3-sided rangesearching; where the query rectangle q has the form [x1; x2]×[y;∞); ie; it is a 3-sidedrectangle with its top open. We will introduce the external priority search tree; which is adynamic structure that solves this problem optimally. Our real objective of discussing this …,*,*,*,20
