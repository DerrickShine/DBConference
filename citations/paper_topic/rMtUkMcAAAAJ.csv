Minimization of tree pattern queries,Sihem Amer-Yahia; SungRan Cho; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Tree patterns forms a natural basis to query tree-structured data such as XML andLDAP. Since the efficiency of tree pattern matching against a tree-structured databasedepends on the size of the pattern; it is essential to identify and eliminate redundant nodesin the pattern and do so as quickly as possible. In this paper; we study tree patternminimization both in the absence and in the presence of integrity constraints (ICs) on theunderlying tree-structured database. When no ICs are considered; we call the process ofminimizing a tree pattern; constraint-independent minimization. We develop a polynomialtime algorithm called CIM for this purpose. CIM's efficiency stems from two key properties:(i)a node cannot be redundant unless its children are; and (ii) the order of elimination ofredundant nodes is immaterial. When ICs are considered for minimization; we refer to it …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,317,16
FleXPath: flexible structure and full-text querying for XML,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Shashank Pandit,Abstract Querying XML data is a well-explored topic with powerful database-style querylanguages such as XPath and XQuery set to become W3C standards. An equally compellingparadigm for querying XML documents is full-text search on textual content. In this paper; westudy fundamental challenges that arise when we try to integrate these two queryingparadigms. While keyword search is based on approximate matching; XPath has exactmatch semantics. We address this mismatch by considering queries on structure as a"template"; and looking for answers that best match this template and the full-text search. Toachieve this; we provide an elegant definition of relaxation on structure and define primitiveoperators to span the space of relaxations. Query answering is now based on rankingpotential answers on structural and full-text search conditions. We set out certain …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,261,4
Group recommendation: Semantics and efficiency,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Senjuti Basu Roy; Ashish Chawlat; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract We study the problem of group recommendation. Recommendation is an importantinformation exploration paradigm that retrieves interesting items for users based on theirprofiles and past activities. Single user recommendation has received significant attention inthe past due to its extensive use in Amazon and Netflix. How to recommend to a group ofusers who may or may not share similar tastes; however; is still an open problem. The needfor group recommendation arises in many scenarios: a movie for friends to watch together; atravel destination for a family to spend a holiday break; and a good restaurant for colleaguesto have a working lunch. Intuitively; items that are ideal for recommendation to a group maybe quite different from those for individual members. In this paper; we analyze the desiderataof group recommendation and propose a formal semantics that accounts for both item …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,253,10
Tree pattern relaxation,Sihem Amer-Yahia; SungRan Cho; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Tree patterns are fundamental to querying tree-structured data like XML. Becauseof the heterogeneity of XML data; it is often more appropriate to permit approximate querymatching and return ranked answers; in the spirit of Information Retrieval; than to return onlyexact answers. In this paper; we study the problem of approximate XML query matching;based on tree pattern relaxations; and devise efficient algorithms to evaluate relaxed treepatterns. We consider weighted tree patterns; where exact and relaxed weights; associatedwith nodes and edges of the tree pattern; are used to compute the scores of query answers.We are interested in the problem of finding answers whose scores are at least as large as agiven threshold. We design data pruning algorithms where intermediate query results arefiltered dynamically during the evaluation process. We develop an optimization that …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,249,18
Automatic construction of travel itineraries using social breadcrumbs,Munmun De Choudhury; Moran Feldman; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Nadav Golbandi; Ronny Lempel; Cong Yu,Abstract Vacation planning is one of the frequent---but nonetheless laborious---tasks thatpeople engage themselves with online; requiring skilled interaction with a multitude ofresources. This paper constructs intra-city travel itineraries automatically by tapping a latentsource reflecting geo-temporal breadcrumbs left by millions of tourists. For example; thepopular rich media sharing site; Flickr; allows photos to be stamped by the time of when theywere taken and be mapped to Points Of Interests (POIs) by geographical (ie latitude-longitude) and semantic (eg; tags) metadata. Leveraging this information; we constructitineraries following a two-step approach. Given a city; we first extract photo streams ofindividual users. Each photo stream provides estimates on where the user was; how long hestayed at each place; and what was the transit time between places.

Finding frequent items in probabilistic data,Qin Zhang; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,Abstract Computing statistical information on probabilistic data has attracted a lot of attentionrecently; as the data generated from a wide range of data sources are inherently fuzzy oruncertain. In this paper; we study an important statistical query on probabilistic data: findingthe frequent items. One straightforward approach to identify the frequent items in aprobabilistic data set is to simply compute the expected frequency of an item and decide if itexceeds a certain fraction of the expected size of the whole data set. However; this simpledefinition misses important information about the internal structure of the probabilistic dataand the interplay among all the uncertain entities. Thus; we propose a new definition basedon the possible world semantics that has been widely adopted for many query types inuncertain data management; trying to find all the items that are likely to be frequent in a …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,218,4
Semantics of ranking queries for probabilistic data and expected ranks,Graham Cormode; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,When dealing with massive quantities of data; top-k queries are a powerful technique forreturning only the k most relevant tuples for inspection; based on a scoring function. Theproblem of efficiently answering such ranking queries has been studied and analyzedextensively within traditional database settings. The importance of the top-k is perhaps evengreater in probabilistic databases; where a relation can encode exponentially many possibleworlds. There have been several recent attempts to propose definitions and algorithms forranking queries over probabilistic data. However; these all lack many of the intuitiveproperties of a top-k over deterministic data. Specifically; we define a number of fundamentalproperties; including exact-k; containment; unique-rank; value-invariance; and stability;which are all satisfied by ranking queries on certain data. We argue that all these …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,212,13
Efficient computation of diverse query results,Erik Vee; Utkarsh Srivastava; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram; Prashant Bhat; Sihem Amer Yahia,We study the problem of efficiently computing diverse query results in online shoppingapplications; where users specify queries through a form interface that allows a mix ofstructured and content-based selection conditions. Intuitively; the goal of diverse queryanswering is to return a representative set of top-k answers from all the tuples that satisfy theuser selection condition. For example; if a user is searching for Honda cars and we can onlydisplay five results; we wish to return cars from five different Honda models; as opposed toreturning cars from only one or two Honda models. A key contribution of this paper is toformally define the notion of diversity; and to show that existing score based techniquescommonly used in web applications are not sufficient to guarantee diversity. Anothercontribution of this paper is to develop novel and efficient query processing techniques …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,185,22
Structure and content scoring for XML,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Nick Koudas; Amélie Marian; Divesh Srivastava; David Toman,Abstract XML repositories are usually queried both on structure and content. Due tostructural heterogeneity of XML; queries are often interpreted approximately and theiranswers are returned ranked by scores. Computing answer scores in XML is an active areaof research that oscillates between pure content scoring such as the well-known tf* idf andtaking structure into account. However; none of the existing proposals fully accounts forstructure and combines it with content to score query answers. We propose novel XMLscoring methods that are inspired by tf* idf and that account for both structure and contentwhile considering query relaxations. Twig scoring; accounts for the most structure andcontent and is thus used as our reference method. Path scoring is an approximation thatloosens correlations between query nodes hence reducing the amount of time required to …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,178,4
Texquery: a full-text search extension to xquery,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Chavdar Botev; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,Abstract One of the key benefits of XML is its ability to represent a mix of structured andunstructured (text) data. Although current XML query languages such as XPath and XQuerycan express rich queries over structured data; they can only express very rudimentaryqueries over text data. We thus propose TeXQuery; which is a powerful full-text searchextension to XQuery. TeXQuery provides a rich set of fully composable full-text searchprimitives; such as Boolean connectives; phrase matching; proximity distance; stemmingand thesauri. TeXQuery also enables users to seamlessly query over both structured andtext data by embedding TeXQuery primitives in XQuery; and vice versa. Finally; TeXQuerysupports a flexible scoring construct that can be used toscore query results based on full-textpredicates. TeXQuery is the precursor ofthe full-text language extensions to XPath 2.0 …,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on World Wide Web,2004,170,4
It takes variety to make a world: diversification in recommender systems,Cong Yu; Laks Lakshmanan; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract Recommendations in collaborative tagging sites such as del. icio. us and Yahoo!Movies; are becoming increasingly important; due to the proliferation of general queries onthose sites and the ineffectiveness of the traditional search paradigm to address thosequeries. Regardless of the underlying recommendation strategy; item-based or user-based;one of the key concerns in producing recommendations; is over-specialization; which resultsin returning items that are too homogeneous. Traditional solutions rely on post-processingreturned items to identify those which differ in their attribute values (eg; genre and actors formovies). Such approaches are not always applicable when intrinsic attributes are notavailable (eg; URLs in del. icio. us). In a recent paper [20]; we introduced the notion ofexplanation-based diversity and formalized the diversification problem as a compromise …,Proceedings of the 12th international conference on extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2009,167,7

In this paper; we study tree pattern minimizationboth in the absence and in the presence of integrity constraints (ICs) on the underlying tree-structured database.

Optimizing the secure evaluation of twig queries,SungRan Cho; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Divesh Srivastava,This chapter focuses on the problem of secure evaluation of eXtensible Markup Language(XML) twig queries; for the simple; but useful; multilevel security model. The rapidemergence of XML as a standard for data exchange over the Web has led to considerableinterest in the problem of securing XML documents. In this context; query evaluation enginesneed to ensure that user queries only use and return XML data that the user is allowed toaccess. These added access control checks can considerably increase query evaluationtime. Companies are using the Web as the main means of information dissemination;sparking interest in models; and efficient mechanisms for controlled access to informationcontent over the Web. In this respect; securing XML documents is an important step;because XML is rapidly emerging as the standard for data representation and exchange …,*,2002,135,22
Efficient network aware search in collaborative tagging sites,Sihem Amer Yahia; Michael Benedikt; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract The popularity of collaborative tagging sites presents a unique opportunity toexplore keyword search in a context where query results are determined by the opinion of anetwork of taggers related to a seeker. In this paper; we present the first in-depth study ofnetwork-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of ananswer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue thatobvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive; due to the dependence ofscores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintainingscore upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag; over the entire collection of users. The resulting boundsare very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,125,22
Optimizing queries on compressed bitmaps,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Theodore Johnson,Abstract Bitmap indices are used by DBMS's to accelerate decision support queries. A signicant advantage of bitmap indices is that complex logical selection operations can beperformed very quickly; by performing bit-wise AND; OR; and NOT operators. Althoughbitmap indices can be space ine cient for high cardinality attributes; the space use ofcompressed bitmaps compares well to other indexing methods. Oracle and Sybase IQ aretwo commercial products that make extensive use of compressed bitmap indices. Our recentresearch showed that there are several fast algorithms for evaluating Boolean operators oncompressed bitmaps. Depending on the nature of the operand bitmaps (their format; densityand clusterdness) and the operation to be performed (AND; NOT;...); these algorithms canhave execution times that are orders of magnitude di erent.

Adaptive processing of top-k queries in XML,Amelie Marian; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,The ability to compute top-k matches to XML queries is gaining importance due to theincreasing number of large XML repositories. The efficiency of top-k query evaluation relieson using scores to prune irrelevant answers as early as possible in the evaluation process.In this context; evaluating the same query plan for all answers might be too rigid because; atany time in the evaluation; answers have gone through the same number and sequence ofoperations; which limits the speed at which scores grow. Therefore; adaptive queryprocessing that permits different plans for different partial matches and maximizes the bestscores is more appropriate. In this paper; we propose an architecture and adaptivealgorithms for efficiently computing top-k matches to XML queries. Our techniques can beused to evaluate both exact and approximate matches where approximation is defined by …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

Distributed evalulation of directory queries using a topology cache,*,A technique for performing query evaluation on distributed directories utilizes the creation ofa “topology cache” defining the hierarchical relationship between the various directoryservers (ie; identifying “subordinate” and “superior” knowledge references associated witheach directory server in the system). The created topology cache is then stored at eachdirectory server; and forwarded to a client upon submitting a query to the system. Using thetopology cache information at the client; a distributed query evaluation plan can bedeveloped for use with complex queries; such as hierarchical and aggregate queries.,*,2005,99,22
XML search: languages; INEX and scoring,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Mounia Lalmas,Abstract The development of approaches to access XML content has generated a wealth ofissues in information retrieval (IR) and database (DB)(eg;[2; 15; 17; 20; 19; 47; 26; 32; 24]).While the IR community has traditionally focused on searching unstructured content; andhas developed various techniques for ranking query results and evaluating theireffectiveness; the DB community has focused on developing query languages and efficientevaluation algorithms for highly structured content. Recent trends in DB and IR researchdemonstrate a growing interest in merging IR and DB techniques for accessing XML content.Support for a combination of" structured" and full-text search for effectively querying XMLdocuments was unanimous in a recent panel at SIGMOD 2005 [3]; and is being widelystudied in the IR community [20].,ACM SIGMOD Record,2006,97,10
A comprehensive solution to the XML-to-relational mapping problem,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Fang Du; Juliana Freire,Abstract The use of relational database management systems (RDBMSs) to store and queryXML data has attracted considerable interest with a view to leveraging their powerful andreliable data management services. Due to the mismatch between the relational and XMLdata models; it is necessary to first shred and load the XML data into relational tables; andthen btranslate XML queries over the original data into equivalent SQL queries over themapped tables. Although there is a rich literature on XML-relational storage; none of theexisting solutions addresses all the storage problems in a single framework. Works onmapping strategies often have little or no details about query translation; and proposals forquery translation often target a specific mapping strategy. XML-storage solutions providedby RDBMS also have limitations. Notably; they are tied to a specific backend and use …,Proceedings of the 6th annual ACM international workshop on Web information and data management,2004,97,22

Flexible and efficient XML search with complex full-text predicates,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Emiran Curtmola; Alin Deutsch,Abstract Recently; there has been extensive research that generated a wealth of new XMLfull-text query languages; ranging from simple Boolean search to combining sophisticatedproximity and order predicates on keywords. While computing least common ancestors ofquery terms was proposed for efficient evaluation of conjunctive keyword queries byexploiting the document structure; no such solution was developed to evaluate complex full-text queries. We present efficient evaluation algorithms based on a formalization of XMLqueries in terms of keyword patterns and an algebra which manipulates pattern matches.Our algebra captures most existing languages and their varying semantics and ouralgorithms combine relational query evaluation techniques with the exploitation of documentstructure to process queries with complex full-text predicates.

Recommendation diversification using explanations,Cong Yu; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Sihem Amer-Yahia,We introduce the novel notion of {\em explanation-based diversification} to address the well-known problem of {\em over-specialization} in item recommendations. Over-specialization inrecommender systems leads to result sets with items that are too similar to one another; thusreducing the diversity of results and limiting user choices. Traditionally; the problem isaddressed through {\em attribute-based diversification}| grouping items in the result set thatshare many common attributes (eg; genre for movies) and selecting only a limited number ofitems from each group. It is; however; not always applicable; especially for social contentrecommendations. For example; attributes may not be available as in the case ofrecommending URLs for users of del. icio. us.

Interactive itinerary planning,Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Cong Yu,Planning an itinerary when traveling to a city involves substantial effort in choosing Points-of-Interest (POIs); deciding in which order to visit them; and accounting for the time it takes tovisit each POI and transit between them. Several online services address different aspects ofitinerary planning but none of them provides an interactive interface where users givefeedbacks and iteratively construct their itineraries based on personal interests and timebudget. In this paper; we formalize interactive itinerary planning as an iterative processwhere; at each step:(1) the user provides feedback on POIs selected by the system;(2) thesystem recommends the best itineraries based on all feedback so far; and (3) the systemfurther selects a new set of POIs; with optimal utility; to solicit feedback for; at the next step.This iterative process stops when the user is satisfied with the recommended itinerary.

A web-services architecture for efficient XML data exchange,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Yannis Kotidis,Business applications often exchange large amounts of enterprise data stored in legacysystems. The advent of XML as a standard specification format has improved applicationsinteroperability. However; optimizing the performance of XML data exchange; in particular;when data volumes are large; is still in its infancy. Quite often; the target system has to undosome of the work the source did to assemble documents in order to map XML elements intoits own data structures. This publish&map process is both resource and time consuming. Inthis paper; we develop a middle-tier Web services architecture to optimize the exchange oflarge XML data volumes. The key idea is to allow systems to negotiate the data exchangeprocess using an extension to WSDL. The source (target) can specify document fragmentsthat it is willing to produce (consume).

We proposeOutside-The-Box (otb) recommendation; which takes some risk to help users make freshdiscoveries; while maintaining high relevance. The proposed formalization relies on itemregions and attempts to identify regions that are under-exposed to the user. We develop arecommendation algorithm which achieves a compromise between relevance and risk tofind otb items.

Our system relies on extracting contentfeatures from each message. These features and the use of an incident-specific dictionaryallow us to determine the period type of an incident that each message belongs to. Theperiod types are: pre-incident (messages talking about prevention; mitigation; andpreparedness); during-incident (messages sent while the incident is taking place); and post-incident (messages related to the response; recovery; and reconstruction). We show that ourdetection method can effectively identify incident-related messages with high precision andrecall; and that our incident-period classification method outperforms standard machinelearning classification methods.,ISCRAM,2013,51,4
Local approximation of pagerank and reverse pagerank,Ziv Bar-Yossef; Li-Tal Mashiach,Abstract We consider the problem of approximating the PageRank of a target node usingonly local information provided by a link server. This problem was originally studied byChen; Gan; and Suel (CIKM 2004); who presented an algorithm for tackling it. We prove thatlocal approximation of PageRank; even to within modest approximation factors; is infeasiblein the worst-case; as it requires probing the link server for Ω (n) nodes; where n is the size ofthe graph. The difficulty emanates from nodes of high in-degree and/or from slowconvergence of the PageRank random walk. We show that when the graph has bounded in-degree and admits fast PageRank convergence; then local PageRank approximation can bedone using a small number of queries. Unfortunately; natural graphs; such as the webgraph; are abundant with high in-degree nodes; making this algorithm (or any other local …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,51,10

Constructing travel itineraries from tagged geo-temporal breadcrumbs,Munmun De Choudhury; Moran Feldman; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Nadav Golbandi; Ronny Lempel; Cong Yu,Abstract Vacation planning is a frequent laborious task which requires skilled interactionwith a multitude of resources. This paper develops an end-to-end approach for constructingintra-city travel itineraries automatically by tapping a latent source reflecting geo-temporalbreadcrumbs left by millions of tourists. In particular; the popular rich media sharing site;Flickr; allows photos to be stamped by the date and time of when they were taken; and bemapped to Points Of Interest (POIs) by latitude-longitude information as well as semanticmetadata (eg; tags) that describe them.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,42,4
Deriving user intent from a user query,*,A system and method for deriving user intent from a query. The system includes a queryengine; and an advertisement engine. The query engine receives a query from the user. Thequery engine analyzes the query to determine a query intent that is matched to a domain.The query may be further analyzed to derive predicate values based on the query and thedomain hierarchy. The domain and associated information may then be matched to a list ofadvertisements. The advertisement may be assigned an ad match score based on acorrelation between the query information and various listing information provided in theadvertisement.,*,2011,35,18
Mri: Meaningful interpretations of collaborative ratings,Mahashweta Das; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,ABSTRACT Collaborative rating sites have become essential resources that many usersconsult to make purchasing decisions on various items. Ideally; a user wants to quicklydecide whether an item is desirable; especially when many choices are available. Inpractice; however; a user either spends a lot of time examining reviews before making aninformed decision; or simply trusts overall rating aggregations associated with an item. Inthis paper; we argue that neither option is satisfactory and propose a novel and powerfulthird option; Meaningful Ratings Interpretation (MRI); that automatically provides ameaningful interpretation of ratings associated with the input items. As a simple example;given the movie “Usual Suspects;” instead of simply showing the average rating of 8.7 fromall reviewers; MRI produces a set of meaningful factoids such as “male reviewers under …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,35,10
GalaTex: a conformant implementation of the XQuery full-text language,Emiran Curtmola; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Philip Brown; Mary Fernández,Abstract We describe G ala T ex; the first complete implementation of XQuery Full-Text; aW3C specification that extends XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 with full-text search. XQuery Full-Text provides composable full-text search primitives such as keyword search; Booleanqueries; and keyword-distance predicates. G ala T ex is intended to serve as a referenceimplementation for XQuery Full-Text and as a platform for addressing new researchproblems such as scoring full-text query results; optimizing XML queries over both structureand text; and evaluating top-k queries on scored results. G ala T ex is an all-XQueryimplementation initially focused on completeness and conformance rather than onefficiency. We describe its implementation on top of Galax; a complete XQueryimplementation.,Special interest tracks and posters of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,34,22

XQuery full-text extensions explained,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Chavdar Botev; J Dorre; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,There has been recent interest in developing XML query languages; such as XPath andXQuery; to tap the vast amount of information represented and stored in Extensible MarkupLanguage (XML). These query languages; however; have focused mainly on querying thestructure of XML documents and provide only rudimentary support for querying text content.To fill this void; XQuery Full-Text has been developed as a full-text extension to XQuery (andalso XPath; which is a subset of XQuery). Consequently; XQuery Full-Text can be used toseamlessly query over both the structure and the text content of XML documents. This paperexplains the design principles behind XQuery Full-Text; describes its evolution; andillustrates its core features with examples. It is intended as a reference that is shorter andmore accessible than the current World Wide Web Consortium working draft.,IBM Systems Journal,2006,31,23
XML full-text search: Challenges and opportunities,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,Abstract An ever growing number of XML repositories are being made available for search.A lot of activity has been deployed in the past few years to query such repositories. Inparticular; full-text querying of text-rich XML documents has generated a wealth of issuesthat are being addressed by both the database (DB) and information retrieval (IR)communities. The DB community has traditionally focused on developing query languagesand efficient evaluation algorithms for highly structured data. In contrast; the IR communityhas focused on searching unstructured data; and has developed various techniques forranking query results and evaluating their effectiveness. Fortunately; recent trends in DB andIR research demonstrate a growing interest in adopting IR techniques in DBs and vice versa[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 9].,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,31,4
Composite retrieval of diverse and complementary bundles,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Esteban Feuerstein; Isabel Mendez-Diaz; Paula Zabala,Users are often faced with the problem of finding complementary items that together achievea single common goal (eg; a starter kit for a novice astronomer; a collection ofquestion/answers related to low-carb nutrition; a set of places to visit on holidays). In thispaper; we argue that for some application scenarios returning item bundles is moreappropriate than ranked lists. Thus we define composite retrieval as the problem of finding kbundles of complementary items. Beyond complementarity of items; the bundles must bevalid wrt a given budget; and the answer set of k bundles must exhibit diversity. We formallydefine the problem and show that in its general form is NP-hard and that also the specialcases in which each bundle is formed by only one item; or only one bundle is sought; arehard. Our characterization however suggests how to adopt a two-phase approach …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,30,13

DB&IR integration: report on the Dagstuhl seminar,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Djoerd Hiemstra; Thomas Roelleke; Divesh Srivastava; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract This paper is based on a five-day workshop on" Ranked XML Querying" that tookplace in Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany in March 2008 and was attended by 27 people fromthree different research communities: database systems (DB); information retrieval (IR); andWeb. The seminar title was interpreted in an IR-style" andish" sense (it covered also subsetsof {Ranking; XML; Querying}; with larger sets being favored) rather than the DB-style strictlyconjunctive manner. So in essence; the seminar really addressed the integration of DB andIR technologies with Web 2.0 being an important target area.,ACM SIGIR Forum,2008,30,10

Building community-centric information exploration applications on social content sites,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Jian Huang; Cong Yu,Abstract Social content sites [4]; which integrate traditional content sites with socialnetworking features; have recently emerged as an exciting new trend on the Web. Users onthose sites share content and form various communities based on explicit friendship; sharedinterest and common user properties. Recently; we proposed SOCIALSCOPE; a three-layered architecture to address the information management challenges in social contentsites. In this paper; we focus on the information discovery and the information presentationlayers; and describe how our previously proposed language; Jelly [3]; is supported inSOCIALSCOPE to build community-centric information exploration applications on socialcontent sites.,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,26,10
Expressiveness and performance of full-text search languages,Chavdar Botev; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,Abstract We study the expressiveness and performance of full-text search languages. Ourmotivation is to provide a formal basis for comparing full-text search languages and todevelop a model for full-text search that can be tightly integrated with structured search. Wedesign a model based on the positions of tokens (words) in the input text; and develop a full-text calculus (FTC) and a full-text algebra (FTA) with equivalent expressive power; thissuggests a notion of completeness for full-text search languages. We show that existing full-text languages are incomplete and identify a practical subset of the FTC and FTA that ismore powerful than existing languages; but which can still be evaluated efficiently.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,26,10
A TeXQuery-based XML full-text search engine,Chavdar Botev; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,Abstract We demonstrate an XML full-text search engine that implements the TeXQuerylanguage. TeXQuery is a powerful full-text search extension to XQuery that provides a richset of fully composable full-text primitives; such as phrase matching; proximity distance;stemming and thesauri. TeXQuery enables users to seamlessly query over both structuredata and text; by embedding full-text primitives in XQuery and vice versa. TeXQuery alsosupports a flexible scoring construct that scores query results based on full-text predicatesand permits top-k queries. TeXQuery is the precursor of the full-text language extension toXPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 currently being developed by W3C.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,26,10
Storage techniques and mapping schemas for XML,Sihem Amer-Yahia,ABSTRACT As an increasing amount of XML data is being exchanged between Webapplications; reliable XML storage systems that make this data persistent and process itefficiently are becoming necessary. The flexibility of representation offered by XML raiseschallenging issues when storing XML data in relational or object systems. Major databasevendors: IBM; Microsoft and Oracle provide a declarative mapping schema in whichdatabase administrators (DBAs) can express how to map XML data into their system. One ofthe main benefits of using a mapping schema is to make mappings transparent to DBAs andthus; help them modify and combine mappings when tuning an XML storage system.Unfortunately; existing mapping schemas for XML storage are proprietary and can be usedfor only one storage backend. We developed a new mapping schema that identifies …,SIGMOD Record,2003,26,4
A mapping schema and interface for XML stores,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Most XML storage efforts have focused on mapping documents to relationaldatabases. Mapping choices range from storing documents verbatim to shreddingdocuments into relations in various ways. These choices are usually hard-coded into eachstorage system which makes sharing loading and querying utilities and exchanginginformation between different XML storage systems hard. To address these issues; wedesigned MXM and IMXM; a mapping schema and an interface API to define and query XML-to-relational mappings. A mapping is expressed as an instance of MXM. MXM is declarative;concise and captures most existing XML-to-relational mappings. Mappings can beexpressed for documents for which no schema information is provided or documents thatconform to either a DTD or an XML Schema.

Diverse near neighbor problem,Sofiane Abbar; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Piotr Indyk; Sepideh Mahabadi; Kasturi R Varadarajan,Abstract Motivated by the recent research on diversity-aware search; we investigate the k-diverse near neighbor reporting problem. The problem is defined as follows: given a querypoint q; report the maximum diversity set S of k points in the ball of radius r around q. Thediversity of a set S is measured by the minimum distance between any pair of points in $ S$(the higher; the better). We present two approximation algorithms for the case where thepoints live in a d-dimensional Hamming space. Our algorithms guarantee query times thatare sub-linear in n and only polynomial in the diversity parameter k; as well as thedimension d. For low values of k; our algorithms achieve sub-linear query times even if thenumber of points within distance r from a query $ q $ is linear in $ n $. To the best of ourknowledge; these are the first known algorithms of this type that offer provable guarantees.,Proceedings of the twenty-ninth annual symposium on Computational geometry,2013,14,10

The framework consists of (i) a declarative language to specify the migrationprocess and (ii) an algebra-based program rewriting technique. The main originality of thelanguage resides in the fact that it does not only provide the means to specify the databasetransformations from relations to objects; but also physical properties we want to achieve onthe object side (such as clustering and sorting). The originality of the rewriting techniquerelies in its ability to optimize the migration processing time while taking into accountphysical properties and transaction decomposition.

System and method for finding unexpected; but relevant content in an information retrieval system,*,An improved method for information retrieval in web query and recommendation systems;where items that are likely unfamiliar to the users of the system; but potentially relevant; arerecommended. In a recommendation system having ratings by a plurality of users for aplurality of items; items are assigned to one or more data regions based on item attributes oruser activity. Source regions are identified for each of the data regions. For a given user;data regions with which both the user and the user's social network are unfamiliar areidentified. Within a given data region; the relevance of items to the user within such regionsis evaluated using ratings provided by other users who have entered ratings similar to theuser in source regions for the data region. Items receiving the highest relevance score arerecommended to the user.,*,2012,12,10
Overview of existing XML storage techniques,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Mary Fernandez,ABSTRACT XML is the standard format for exchanging data between applications on theWeb. Many such applications produce and consume large volumes of XML data and thusrequire efficient and reliable storage systems. Many solutions for storing XML have beenproposed; including the use of flat files; relational database management systems; objectoriented database systems; LDAP directories; and native XML database systems. To betterunderstand the requirements for XML storage systems; we classify XML documents into twobroad categories: documents that have regular structure and that contain small scalar valuesand documents that have irregular structure and that contain large blocks of annotated text.We derive the properties of data and queries in both categories and discuss their impact onstorage. We describe a variety of XML storage solutions from research and industry in …,submitted for publication,2002,12,10
On bounding-schemas for LDAP directories,Sihem Amer-Yahia; HV Jagadish; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract As our world gets more networked; ever increasing amounts of information arebeing stored in LDAP directories. While LDAP directories have considerable flexibility in themodeling and retrieval of information for network applications; the notion of schema theyprovide for enabling consistent and coherent representation of directory information is ratherweak. In this paper; we propose an expressive notion of bounding-schemas for LDAPdirectories; and illustrate their practical utility. Bounding-schemas are based on lower boundand upper bound specifications for the content and structure of an LDAP directory. Given abounding-schema specification; we present algorithms to efficiently determine:(i) if an LDAPdirectory is legal wrt the bounding-schema; and (ii) if directory insertions and deletionspreserve legality. Finally; we show that the notion of bounding-schemas has wider …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,12,13
An expressive framework and efficient algorithms for the analysis of collaborative tagging,Mahashweta Das; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr; del. icio. us; and YouTube;and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves threecomponents; user; item (eg; photos in Flickr); and tag s (ie; words or phrases). Analyzinghow tags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helpingusers search for desired information. In this paper; we develop a dual mining framework toexplore tagging behavior. This framework is centered around two opposing measures;similarity and diversity; applied to one or more tagging components; and therefore enables awide range of analysis scenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging diverse itemswith similar tags or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags. By adoptingdifferent concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the framework; we show that a …,The VLDB Journal,2014,10,13
Making interval-based clustering rank-aware,Julia Stoyanovich; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Tova Milo,Abstract In online applications; such as online dating; users often query and rank largecollections of structured items. Top results tend to be homogeneous; which hinders dataexploration. For example; a dating website user who is looking for a partner between 20 and40 years old; and who sorts the matches by income from higher to lower; will see a largenumber of matches in their late 30s who hold an MBA degree and work in the financialindustry; before seeing any matches in different age groups and walks of life. An alternativeto presenting results in a ranked list is to find clusters in the result space; identified by acombination of attributes that correlate with rank. Such clusters may describe matchesbetween 35 and 40 with an MBA; matches between 25 and 30 who work in the softwareindustry; etc.; allowing for data exploration of ranked results.

Profile diversity in search and recommendation,Maximilien Servajean; Esther Pacitti; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Pascal Neveu,Abstract We investigate profile diversity; a novel idea in searching scientic documents.Combining keyword relevance with popularity in a scoring function has been the subject ofdifferent forms of social relevance [2; 6; 9]. Content diversity has been thoroughly studied insearch and advertising [4; 11]; database queries [16; 5; 8]; and recommendations [17; 10;18]. We believe our work is the first to investigate profile diversity to address the problem ofreturning highly popular but too-focused documents. We show how to adapt Fagin'sthreshold-based algorithms to return the most relevant and most popular documents thatsatisfy content and profile diversities and run preliminary experiments on two benchmarks tovalidate our scoring function.,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web,2013,9,15
Motivation-aware task assignment in crowdsourcing,Julien Pilourdault; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Dongwon Lee; Senjuti Roy,We investigate how to leverage the notion of motivation in assigning tasks to workers andimproving the performance of a crowdsourcing system. In particular; we propose to modelmotivation as the balance between task diversity–ie; the difference in skills among the tasksto complete; and task payment–ie; the difference between how much a chosen task offers topay and how much other available tasks pay. We propose to test different task assignmentstrategies:(1) relevance; a strategy that assigns matching tasks; ie; those that fit a worker'sprofile;(2) diversity; a strategy that chooses matching and diverse tasks; and (3) div-pay; astrategy that selects matching tasks that offer the best compromise between diversity andpayment.

Maprat: Meaningful explanation; interactive exploration and geo-visualization of collaborative ratings,Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Mahashweta Das; Shrikant Desai; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract Collaborative rating sites such as IMDB and Yelp have become rich resources thatusers consult to form judgments about and choose from among competing items. Most ofthese sites either provide a plethora of information for users to interpret all by themselves ora simple overall aggregate information. Such aggregates (eg; average rating over all userswho have rated an item; aggregates along pre-defined dimensions; etc.) can not help a userquickly decide the desirability of an item.

Online non-preemptive scheduling to optimize max stretch on a single machine,Pierre-François Dutot; Erik Saule; Abhinav Srivastav; Denis Trystram,Abstract We consider in this work a classical online scheduling problem with release timeson a single machine. The quality of service of a job is measured by its stretch; which isdefined as the ratio of its response time over its processing time. Our objective is to schedulethe jobs non-preemptively in order to optimize the maximum stretch. We present bothpositive and negative theoretical results. First; we provide an online algorithm based on awaiting strategy which is (1+ 5-1 2\varDelta)-competitive where\varDelta is the upper boundon the ratio of processing times of any two jobs. Then; we show that no online algorithm hasa competitive ratio better than 5-1 2\varDelta. The proposed algorithm is asymptotically thebest algorithm for optimizing the maximum stretch on a single machine.,International Computing and Combinatorics Conference,2016,5,22

TopPI: An efficient algorithm for item-centric mining,Vincent Leroy; Martin Kirchgessner; Alexandre Termier; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract In this paper; we introduce item-centric mining; a new semantics for mining long-tailed datasets. Our algorithm; TopPI; finds for each item its top-k most frequent closeditemsets. While most mining algorithms focus on the globally most frequent itemsets; TopPIguarantees that each item is represented in the results; regardless of its frequency in thedatabase. TopPI allows users to efficiently explore Web data; answering questions such as“what are the k most common sets of songs downloaded together with the ones of myfavorite artist?”. When processing retail data consisting of 55 million supermarket receipts;TopPI finds the itemset “milk; puff pastry” that appears 10;315 times; but also “frangipane;puff pastry” and “nori seaweed; wasabi; sushi rice” that occur only 1120 and 163 times;respectively.

Testing interestingness measures in practice: A large-scale analysis of buying patterns,Martin Kirchgessner; Vincent Leroy; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Shashwat Mishra,Understanding customer buying patterns is of great interest to the retail industry. Associationrule mining is a common technique for extracting correlations such as people in the South ofFrance buy rosé wine or customers who buy paté also buy salted butter and sour bread.Unfortunately; sifting through a high number of buying patterns is not useful in practice;because of the predominance of popular products in the top rules. As a result; a number of"interestingness" measures (over 30) have been proposed to rank rules. However; there is noagreement on which measures are more appropriate for retail data. Moreover; since patternmining algorithms output thousands of association rules for each product; the ability for ananalyst to rely on ranking measures to identify the most interesting ones is crucial. In thispaper; we develop CAPA (Comparative Analysis of PAtterns); a framework that provides …,Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,4,10
Distributed evaluation of top-k temporal joins,Julien Pilourdault; Vincent Leroy; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract We study a particular kind of join; coined Ranked Temporal Join (RTJ); featuringpredicates that compare time intervals and a scoring function associated with each predicateto quantify how well it is satisfied. RTJ queries are prevalent in a variety of applications suchas network traffic monitoring; task scheduling; and tweet analysis. RTJ queries are often bestinterpreted as top-k queries where only the best matches are returned. We show how toexploit the nature of temporal predicates and the properties of their associated scoringsemantics to design TKIJ; an efficient query evaluation approach on a distributed Map-Reduce architecture. TKIJ relies on an offline statistics computation that; given a timepartitioning into granules; computes the distribution of intervals' endpoints in each granule;and an online computation that generates query-dependent score bounds.

Battling Predictability and Overconcentration in Recommender Systems.,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Sergei Vassilvitskii; Cong Yu,Today's recommendation systems have evolved far beyond the initial approaches from morethan a decade ago; and have seen a great deal of commercial success (cf; Amazon andNetflix). However; they are still far from perfect; and face tremendous challenges inincreasing the overall utility of the recommendations. These challenges are present in allstages of the recommendation process. They begin with the cold start problem: given a newuser how do we recommend items to the user without forcing her to give feedback on astarter set of items. Similarly; given a new item introduced into the system; how do we knowwhen (and to whom) we should recommend it. A different problem is that of data sparsity.Although every system has 'super'raters; that is people who rate thousands (and in somecases tens of thousands) of items; the number of such people is low. In fact; most people …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2009,4,10

Toward Worker-Centric Crowdsourcing.,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Senjuti Basu Roy,Abstract Today; crowdsourcing is used to “taskify” any job ranging from simple receipttranscription to collaborative editing; fan-subbing; and citizen science. Existing work hasmainly focused on improving the processes of task assignment and task completion in arequester-centric way by optimizing for outcome quality under budget constraints. In thispaper; we advocate that accounting for workers' characteristics; ie; human factors in taskassignment and task completion benefits both workers and requesters; and discuss newopportunities raised by worker-centric crowdsourcing. This survey is based on a tutorial thatwas given recently at PVLDB [2].,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2016,3,4
Task composition in crowdsourcing,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Eric Gaussier; Vincent Leroy; Julien Pilourdault; Ria Mae Borromeo; Motomichi Toyama,Crowdsourcing has gained popularity in a variety of domains as an increasing number ofjobs are" taskified" and completed independently by a set of workers. A central process incrowdsourcing is the mechanism through which workers find tasks. On popular platformssuch as Amazon Mechanical Turk; tasks can be sorted by dimensions such as creation dateor reward amount. Research efforts on task assignment have focused on adopting arequester-centric approach whereby tasks are proposed to workers in order to maximizeoverall task throughput; result quality and cost. In this paper; we advocate the need tocomplement that with a worker-centric approach to task assignment; and examine theproblem of producing; for each worker; a personalized summary of tasks that preservesoverall task throughput.

Human factors in crowdsourcing,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Senjuti Basu Roy,Abstract Today; crowdsourcing is used to" taskify" any job ranging from simple receipttranscription to collaborative editing; fan-subbing; citizen science; and citizen journalism.The crowd is typically volatile; its arrival and departure asynchronous; and its levels ofattention and accuracy diverse. Tasks vary in complexity and may necessitate theparticipation of workers with varying degrees of expertise. Sometimes; workers need tocollaborate explicitly and build on each other's contributions to complete a single task. Forexample; in disaster reporting; CrowdMap allows geographically closed people with diverseand complementary skills; to work together to report details about the course of a typhoon orthe aftermath of an earthquake. This uber-ization of human labor requires the understandingof workers motivation in completing a task; their ability to work together in collaborative …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,3,22
Collaborative crowdsourcing with crowd4U,Kosetsu Ikeda; Atsuyuki Morishima; Habibur Rahman; Senjuti Basu Roy; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das,Abstract Collaborative crowdsourcing is an emerging paradigm where a set of workers; oftenwith diverse and complementary skills; form groups and work together to complete complextasks. While crowdsourcing has been used successfully in many applications; collaborationis essential for achieving a high quality outcome for a number of emerging applications suchas text translation; citizen journalism and surveillance tasks. However; no crowdsourcingplatform today enables the end-to-end deployment of collaborative tasks. We demonstrateCrowd4U; a volunteer-based system that enables the deployment of diverse crowdsourcingtasks with complex data-flows; in a declarative manner. In addition to treating workers andtasks as rich entities; Crowd4U also provides an easy-to-use form-based task UI.

PGLCM: efficient parallel mining of closed frequent gradual itemsets,Trong Dinh Thac Do; Alexandre Termier; Anne Laurent; Benjamin Negrevergne; Behrooz Omidvar-Tehrani; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract Numerical data (eg; DNA micro-array data; sensor data) pose a challengingproblem to existing frequent pattern mining methods which hardly handle them. In thisframework; gradual patterns have been recently proposed to extract covariations ofattributes; such as:“When X increases; Y decreases”. There exist some algorithms for miningfrequent gradual patterns; but they cannot scale to real-world databases. We present in thispaper GLCM; the first algorithm for mining closed frequent gradual patterns; which proposesstrong complexity guarantees: the mining time is linear with the number of closed frequentgradual itemsets. Our experimental study shows that GLCM is two orders of magnitude fasterthan the state of the art; with a constant low memory usage.

Exploiting diversification in gossip-based recommendation,Maximilien Servajean; Esther Pacitti; Miguel Liroz-Gistau; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In the context of Web 2.0; the users become massive producers of diverse data thatcan be stored in a large variety of systems. The fact that the users' data spaces aredistributed in many different systems makes data sharing difficult. In this context of largescale distribution of users and data; a general solution to data sharing is offered bydistributed search and recommendation. In particular; gossip-based approaches providescalability; dynamicity; autonomy and decentralized control. Generally; in gossip-basedsearch and recommendation; each user constructs a cluster of “relevant” users that will beemployed in the processing of queries. However; considering only relevance introduces asignificant amount of redundancy among users. As a result; when a query is submitted; asthe user profiles in each user's cluster are quite similar; the probability of retrieving the …,International Conference on Data Management in Cloud; Grid and P2P Systems,2014,3,23
Crowd-Sourcing Literature Review in SUNFLOWER,Sihem Amer-Yahia,Reviewing literature is painful albeit intellectually rewarding. I will describe SUNFLOWER; asystem we developed in collaboration with Bloomsbury; a publisher of scienti? c material;member of Qatar Foundation. SUNFLOWER combines the power of search andcollaborative editing to review and summarize a large number of articles around a topic. Itworks in three steps. The? rst step performs a composite retrieval of related articles where kbundles of complementary articles are built using article metadata such as authors andcitations. The second step associates a summary to each bundle by extracting key phrasesfrom their constituent articles. The last step involves humans that collaboratively editextracted summaries into a coherent literature review on the topic.

Rank-aware clustering of structured datasets,Julia Stoyanovich; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract In online applications such as Yahoo! Personals and Yahoo! Real Estate usersdefine structured profiles in order to find potentially interesting matches. Typically; profilesare evaluated against large datasets and produce thousands of matches. In addition tofiltering; users also specify ranking in their profile; and matches are returned in a ranked list.Top results in a list are typically homogeneous; which hinders data exploration. Forexample; a user looking for 1-or 2-bedroom apartments sorted by price will see a largenumber of cheap 1-bedrooms in undesirable neighborhoods before seeing a differentapartment. An alternative to ranking is to group matches on common attribute values; eg;cheap 1-bedrooms in good neighborhoods; 2-bedrooms with 2 baths; and choose groups inrelationship with ranking.

XML publishing: Look at siblings too!,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Yannis Kotidis; Divesh Srivastava,In order to publish a nested XML document from flat relational data; multiple SQL queriesare often needed. The efficiency of publishing relies on how fast these queries can beevaluated and their results shipped to the client. We illustrate novel optimization techniquesthat enable computation sharing between queries that construct sibling elements in the XMLtree. Such queries typically share large common join expressions that can be exploitedthrough appropriate rewritings. These rewritings are fundamental to XML publishing andprovide considerable performance benefits without having to modify the relational engine.,Data Engineering; 2003.

Crowdsourcing Strategies for Text Creation Tasks.,Ria Mae Borromeo; Maha Alsaysneh; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Vincent Leroy,ABSTRACT We examine deployment strategies for text translation and text summarizationtasks. We formalize a deployment strategy along three dimensions: work structure; workforceorganization; and work style. Work structure can be either simultaneous or sequential;workforce organization independent or collaborative; and work style either crowd-only orhybrid. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate the cost; latency; and quality of variousdeployment strategies. We asses our strategies for different scenarios: short/long text;presence/absence of an outline; and popular/unpopular topics. Our findings serve as a basisto automate the deployment of text creation tasks.,EDBT,2017,2,23

Characterizing region for a product is a coherentgeographic region where the consumers actively consume the said product. We introduceDICE; a diffusion-based technique to uncover all such regions for a given product; whenthey exist. In contrast to current state of the art; DICE involves minimal usage of parametersand shows remarkable tolerance to noise.

In this paper; we adopt aquery-based approach to drift detection. Our approach relies on a drift index; a structure thatcaptures drift at different time granularities and enables flexible drift queries. We formalizedifferent drift queries that represent real-world scenarios and develop query evaluationalgorithms that use different materializations of the drift index as well as strategies for onlineindex maintenance.

Profile diversity for query processing using user recommendations,Maximilien Servajean; Reza Akbarinia; Esther Pacitti; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract More than 90% of the queries submitted to content sharing platforms; such as Flickr;are vague; ie only contain a few keywords; thus complicating the task of effectively returninginteresting results. To overcome this limitation; many platforms use recommendationstrategies to filter the results. But; recommendations usually tend to return highly redundantitems. Content diversification has been studied as a solution to overcome this problem.However; it may suffer from at least two limitations: poor content description and semanticambiguity. In this paper; we investigate profile diversity for searching web items. Profilediversification enables to address the problem of returning redundant items; and enhancesthe quality of diversification.

Method and system for generating an ordered list,*,A system for generating an ordered list. The system may include a query engine and anadvertisement engine. The query engine receives a query from the user and determinesparameters to match with the advertisement. The advertisement engine receives theparameters and generates a list of items based on the parameters. The system may functionin a precompute mode to calculate intervals for each available item to minimize the variableprocessing costs for each item. Further; the number of intervals a crossed item may beselected in a manner to satisfy a given space constraint. By characterizing each item by aminimum price within each interval; the system can quickly query the interval matching thedesired quantity for each item and determined if the minimum price for that interval is lessthan the top-k prices already included in the list.,*,2008,2,10
Efficient top-k processing over query-dependent functions,Lin Guo; Sihem Amer Yahia; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram; Utkarsh Srivastava; Erik Vee,Abstract We study the efficient evaluation of top-k queries over data items; where the scoreof each item is dynamically computed by applying an item-specific function whoseparameter value is specified in the query. For example; online retail stores rank items byprice; which may be a function of the quantity being queried:" Stay 3 nights; get a 15%discount on double-bed rooms." Similarly; while ranking possible routes in online maps bypredicted congestion level; the score (congestion) is a function of the time being queried;eg;" At 5PM on a Friday in Palo Alto; the congestion level on 101 North is high." Since theparameter---the number of nights or the time the online map is queried; in the aboveexamples---is only known at query time; and online applications have stringent response-time requirements; it is infeasible to evaluate every item-specific function to determine the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,2,12

Teaching relational optimizers about XML processing,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Yannis Kotidis; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Due to their numerous benefits; relational systems play a major role in storing XMLdocuments. XML also benefits relational systems by providing a means to publish legacyrelational data. Consequently; a large volume of XML data is stored in and produced fromrelations. However; relational systems are not well-tuned to produce XML data efficiently.This is mainly due to the flat nature of relational data as opposed to the tree structure of XMLdocuments. In this paper; we argue that relational query optimizers need to incorporate newoptimization techniques that are better suited for XML. In particular; we explore newoptimization techniques that enable computation sharing between queries that constructsibling elements in the XML tree. Such queries often have large common join expressionsthat can be shared through appropriate rewritings. We show experimentally that these …,International XML Database Symposium,2004,2,22

Fairness and Transparency in Crowdsourcing.,Ria Mae Borromeo; Thomas Laurent; Motomichi Toyama; Sihem Amer-Yahia,ABSTRACT Despite the success of crowdsourcing; the question of ethics has not yet beenaddressed in its entirety. Existing efforts have studied fairness in worker compensation andin helping requesters detect malevolent workers. In this paper; we propose fairness axiomsthat generalize existing work and pave the way to studying fairness for task assignment; taskcompletion; and worker compensation. Transparency on the other hand; has beenaddressed with the development of plug-ins and forums to track workers' performance andrate requesters. Similarly to fairness; we define transparency axioms and advocate the needto address it in a holistic manner by providing declarative specifications.

Reviewing the Reviewers: Characterizing Biases and Competencies using Socially Meaningful Attributes.,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Andrei Z Broder; Alban Galland,We propose augmenting collaborative reviewing systems with an automatic annotationcapability that helps users interpret reviews. Given an item and its review by a certain author;our approach is to find a reference set of similar items that is both easy to describe andmeaningful to users. Depending on the number of available same-author reviews of items inthe reference set; an annotation produced by our system may consist of similar items that theauthor has reviewed; the rank of the reviewed item among items in this set; a comparison ofthe author's scores to averages; and other similar information that indicate the biases andcompetencies of the reviewer. We validate our approach in the context of movie reviews anddescribe an algorithm that; for example; presented with a review of a Woody Allen comedy;is able to derive annotations of the form:" This reviewer rates this movie better than 4 out …,AAAI Spring Symposium: Social Information Processing,2008,1,13

On the completeness of full-text search languages for XML,Chavdar Botev; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,We study formal properties of full-text search languages for XML. Our main contribution isthe development of a formal model for full-text search based on the positions of tokens inXML nodes. Building on this model; we define a full-text calculus based on first-order logic;and a full-text algebra based on the relational algebra. We show that the full-text calculusand algebra are equivalent even in the presence of arbitrary position-based predicates;such as distance predicates and phrase matching. This suggests a notion of completenessfor full-text languages. None of the full-text search languages that we are aware of arecomplete under the above characterization. We propose a new full-text language that iscomplete and naturally generalizes existing full-text languages. Our formalization in terms ofthe relational model can also serve as the basis for (a) joint optimization of structured and …,*,2003,1,23
Eliciting Worker Preference for Task Completion,Mohammadreza Esfandiari; Senjuti Basu Roy; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract: Current crowdsourcing platforms provide little support for worker feedback.Workers are sometimes invited to post free text describing their experience and preferencesin completing tasks. They can also use forums such as Turker Nation1 to exchangepreferences on tasks and requesters. In fact; crowdsourcing platforms rely heavily onobserving workers and inferring their preferences implicitly. In this work; we believe thatasking workers to indicate their preferences explicitly improve their experience in taskcompletion and hence; the quality of their contributions. Explicit elicitation can indeed help tobuild more accurate worker models for task completion that captures the evolving nature ofworker preferences. We design a worker model whose accuracy is improved iteratively byrequesting preferences for task factors such as required skills; task payment; and task …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.03233,2018,*,14
Exploration of User Groups in VEXUS,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Behrooz Omidvar-Tehrani; Joao Comba; Viviane Moreira; Fabian Colque Zegarra,Abstract: We introduce VEXUS; an interactive visualization framework for exploring userdata to fulfill tasks such as finding a set of experts; forming discussion groups and analyzingcollective behaviors. User data is characterized by a combination of demographics like ageand occupation; and actions such as rating a movie; writing a paper; following a medicaltreatment or buying groceries. The ubiquity of user data requires tools that help explorers; bethey specialists or novice users; acquire new insights. VEXUS lets explorers interact withuser data via visual primitives and builds an exploration profile to recommend the nextexploration steps. VEXUS combines state-of-the-art visualization techniques withappropriate indexing of user data to provide fast and relevant exploration. Subjects:Databases (cs. DB) Cite as: arXiv: 1712.03529 [cs.

Customizing Travel Packages with Interactive Composite Items,Manish Singh; Ria Mae Borromeo; Anas Hosami; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Shady Elbassuoni,We examine the applicability of Composite Items (CIs) for generating customized travelpackages consisting of Points of Interest (POIs) in a given city. CIs have been shown toserve complex information needs such as selecting books for a reading club; identifying aset of products for a promotion; or planning a city tour. In the travel domain; a synthesizedview of travel options in a city can be provided with a set of cohesive CIs; each of which iscovering a different region in the city. In this paper; we attempt to understand the benefit ofletting users customize travel packages; and examine the relationship betweencustomization and personalization. For personalization; we gather user preferences on POIfeatures when available or on latent topics extracted from POI tags.

Online Lattice-Based Abstraction of User Groups,Behrooz Omidvar-Tehrani; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract User data is becoming increasingly available in various domains from the socialWeb to location check-ins and smartphone usage traces. Due to the sparsity and impurity ofuser data; we propose to analyze labeled groups of users instead of individuals;eg;“countryside teachers who watch Woody Allen movies.” When chosen appropriately;labeled groups provide quick and useful insights on user data. Analysis of user groups isoften non-trivial due its huge volume. In this paper; we introduce A ug M an; a framework forthe efficient summarization of user groups via abstraction. Our framework performs adynamic; data-driven and lossless abstraction which helps analysts obtain high qualityinsights on user data without being overwhelmed. Our experiments show that A ug M anoffers representative and informative abstractions in a scalable fashion.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2017,*,10
Colloquial region discovery for retail products: discovery and application,Shashwat Mishra; Vincent Leroy; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract Consumer behavior is of quintessential importance to the retail industry. Purchasetrends for retail products are often affected by consumer location. Region-specific purchasetrends; such as the French love wine; are typically supported by anecdotal evidence. Anautomated technique for the discovery of such trends from retail data has so far been absent.In this paper; we address the challenge of colloquial region discovery for retail products.More specifically; we target the problem of examining product sales across a chain of storesto extract the geographic regions that characterize a product. We introduce DICE; a diffusion-based technique to uncover all such regions for a given product; when they exist. In contrastto the current state of the art; DICE involves minimal usage of parameters and showsremarkable tolerance to noise that is often ubiquitous in retail data.

Toward Interactive User Data Analytics,Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract User data can be acquired from various domains. This data is characterized by acombination of demographics such as age and occupation and user actions such as rating amovie; reviewing a restaurant or buying groceries.

It is also appealing to novice users in their role asinformation consumers who use the social Web for routine tasks such as finding a book clubor choosing a restaurant. User data exploration has been formulated as identifying group-level behavior such as Asian women who publish regularly in databases.

From Complex Object Exploration to Complex Crowdsourcing.,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Senjuti Basu Roy,Abstract Forming and exploring complex objects is at the heart of a variety of emerging webapplications. Historically; existing work on complex objects has been developed in twoseparate areas: composite item retrieval and team formation. At the same time; emergingapplications that harness the wisdom of crowd workers; such as; document editing byworkers; sentence translation by fans (or fan-subbing); innovative design; citizen science orjournalism; represent complex crowdsourcing; in which an object may represent a complextask formed by a set of sub-tasks or a team of workers who work together to solve the task.The goal of this tutorial is to bridge the gap between composite item retrieval and teamformation and define new research directions for complex crowdsourcing applications,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,*,10

Crowds; not drones,Senjuti Basu Roy; Ioanna Lykourentzou; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das,Abstract In this vision paper; we propose SmartCrowd; an intelligent and adaptivecrowdsourcing framework. Contrary to existing crowdsourcing systems; where the process ofhiring workers (crowd); learning their skills; and evaluating the accuracy of tasks theyperform are fragmented; siloed; and often ad-hoc; SmartCrowd foresees a paradigm shift inthat process; considering unpredictability of human nature; namely human factors.SmartCrowd offers opportunities in making crowdsourcing intelligent through iterativeinteraction with the workers; and adaptively learning and improving the underlyingprocesses. Both existing (majority of which do not require longer engagement from volatileand mostly nonrecurrent workers) and next generation crowdsourcing applications (whichrequire longer engagement from the crowd) stand to benefit from SmartCrowd.

User activity analytics on the social web of news,Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract The proliferation of social media is undoubtedly changing the way people produceand consume news online. Editors and publishers in newsrooms need to understand userengagement and audience sentiment evolution on various news topics. News consumerswant to explore public reaction on articles relevant to a topic and refine their exploration viarelated entities; topics; articles and tweets. I will present MAQSA; a system for socialanalytics on news. MAQSA provides an interactive topic-centric dashboard that summarizessocial activity around news articles. The dashboard contains an annotated commenttimeline; a social graph of comments; and maps of comment sentiment and topics. Theanalysis of both content and user engagement in social media in MAQSA enables theexploration of new ways of immersing users in a news consumption experience.,Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Management of Data,2012,*,22

Décentralisation des applications sociales,Pascal FELBER; Maarten VAN STEEN; Peter TRIANTAFILLOU; Sihem AMER-YAHIA; Anne-Marie KERMARREC; Marin BERTIER,The so-called Web 2.0 revolution has fundamentally changed the way people interact withthe Internet. The Web has turned from a read-only infrastructure to a collaborative platform.The users are now active participants; and contribute to the content of the websites byexpressing their opinions and sharing information. Social networks Social network websites;such as Facebook; were originally created to keep track of friends; and share informationand pictures with them. On these platforms; users can publish information to explicitlydesignated friends. It is also possible; for example; to associate a friend with a picture onwhich she appears. Facebook has proved to be a very efficient mean to quickly reachthousands of people and organize events.,*,2010,*,10

Leveraging communities in social content sites,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Cong Yu,Abstract Social Content Sites; which integrate traditional content sites (eg; Yahoo! Travel)with social networks (eg; Facebook) have recently emerged as a popular Web destinationfor creating and sharing content and social links. We discuss new challenges in searchingcontent on those sites and expand the discussion to community-driven informationexploration. In particular; we present Social Scope; a new architecture which harnessesinformation from multiple social content sites and Jelly; a language to help developers buildscalable information exploration applications. At the core of our architecture and languageare user communities and topics which model users' interests. Finally; we examine how XMLtechnologies can help in modeling and processing social information.,Proceedings of the 2009 EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2009,*,22
Rank-Aware Subspace Clustering for Structured Datasets,Julia Stoyanovich; Sihem Amer-Yahia,ABSTRACT In online applications such as Match. com and Trulia. com users definestructured profiles in order to find potentially interesting matches. Typically; profiles areevaluated against large datasets and produce thousands of matches. In addition to filtering;users also specify ranking in their profile; and matches are returned in the form of a rankedlist. Top results in ranked lists are typically homogeneous; which hinders data exploration.For example; a user looking for 1-or 2-bedroom apartments sorted by price will see a largenumber of cheap 1-bedrooms in undesirable neighborhoods before seeing any apartmentwith different characteristics. An alternative to ranking is to group matches on commonattribute values (eg; cheap 1-bedrooms in good neighborhoods; 2-bedrooms with 2 baths).However; not all groups will be of interest to the user given the ranking criteria.

Personalizing XML Full Text Search in PIMENTO,Irini Fundulaki; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Lakshmanan Laks,Abstract In PIMENTO we advocate a novel approach to XML search that leverages userinformation to return more relevant query answers. This approach is based on formalizing{em user profiles} in terms of {em scoping rules} which are used to rewrite an input query;and of {em ordering rules} which are combined with query scoring to customize the rankingof query answers to specific users.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2008,*,4

Sound ranking algorithms for XML search in PF/Tijah,Djoerd Hiemstra; Stefan Klinger; Henning Rode; Jan Flokstra; Peter Apers,Abstract We argue that ranking algorithms for XML should reflect the actual combinedcontent and structure constraints of queries; while at the same time producing equalrankings for queries that are semantically equal. Ranking algorithms that produce differentrankings for queries that are semantically equal are easily detected by tests on largedatabases: We call such algorithms {em not sound}. We report the behaviour of differentapproaches to ranking content-and-structure que-ries on pairs of queries for which weexpect equal ranking results from the query semantics. We show that most of theseapproaches are not sound. Of the remaining approaches; only 3 adhere to the W3C XQueryFull-Text standard.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2008,*,4
08111 Report--Ranked XML Querying,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Djoerd Hiemstra; Thomas Roelleke; Divesh Srivastava; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract This paper is based on a five-day workshop on" Ranked XML Querying" that tookplace in Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany in March 2008 and was attended by 27 people fromthree different research communities: database systems (DB); information retrieval (IR); andWeb. The seminar title was interpreted in an IR-style" andish" sense (it covered also subsetsof {Ranking; XML; Querying}; with larger sets being favored) rather than the DB-style strictlyconjunctive manner. So in essence; the seminar really addressed the integration of DB andIR technologies with Web 2.0 being an important target area.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2008,*,10

The power of structured data on the web,Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract I will talk about two major roles that structured data is playing on the Web today. Thefirst one is the ability to capture users' intent and display more relevant advertisementsthereby reaching the long tail of users and advertisers. Nowadays; ads are treated as textand can only be searched in a limited way. The second one is related to enablingcommunity search on the Web 2.0. Nowadays; users of Flickr; YouTube and Yahoo! Groupssupply structured content; organize it; and search it. I will discuss how structure-awarenesswhen representing users; advertisements and communities offers a much better alternativeto existing search.,Proceedings of the 8th annual ACM international workshop on Web information and data management,2006,*,21

PIX: a system for phrase matching in XML documents: a demonstration,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Mary Fernández; Divesh Srivastava; Yu Xu,Abstract We present a system that enables flexible and efficient phrase matching in XMLdocuments. Since XML allows structured and unstructured information to be interleaved;phrase matching in XML raises new challenges. Our system; named PIX; permits phrasematching in XML documents that contain “mixed content”. A key feature of PIX is that userscan specify which element and content to ignore when matching a phrase. PIX uses invertedindices and an efficient evaluation algorithm to compute the set of matches and returnsanswers where phrases; ignored tags and content are highlighted. In addition; queryanswers are sorted using a ranking function. PIX is implemented as an extension of GALAX;a full-fledged XQuery engine. The functionality of PIX is fully integrated into XQuery andpermits a natural combination of XPath-based structure matching with phrase matching.,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING,2003,*,4

Personalizing XML Full Text Search in PIMENTO,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Irini Fundulaki; Laks Lakshmanan,XML search is increasing in popularity as more and larger XML repositories are becomingavailable. The accuracy of XML search varies across different systems and a lot of effort isput into designing scoring functions tailored to specific datasets. For example; the INEX effort[8] aims at improving the search relevance of IEEE XML data collections. To the best of ourknowledge none of the existing XML search solutions incorporates user information todetermine relevant query answers. In PIMENTO we argue that there is no scoring functionthat can meet all user-related information and advocate the idea of incorporating userprofiles into XML search in order to customize query answers and improve search quality.Personalization is used in a variety of applications: in telecommunications it is used to directuser calls based on the caller context; in Web search the ranking of query answers may …,*,*,*,12

Managing and Sharing Experiences on the Social Web,Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract Mobile phones have transformed the ways people interact. Last minute plans forphysically getting together are made possible by the ability to call each other; check eachothers' whereabouts and decide to meet up. A recent generation of mobile applications ishaving similar effects on virtual social networks. Those applications combine a user's socialnetwork and location to encourage socializing; provide recommendations in a givengeographic area; and engage users in online and offline activities. With that; instant;unplanned and useful socializing has become possible. The social breadcrumbs gatheredin that process can be used to build a rich repository of geo-tagged information and personalpreferences and leveraged to offer new online experiences that go beyond atomic contentconsumption.

Several works have focused on modeling user-generated tagssuch as the study of tag clouds [3]; cross-floksonomy analysis [7]; or the use of tag-drivencommunities for content search [4] or recommendation [6]. The huge and increasing amountof raw tags and annotations clearly contains valuable social information and is thus anessential asset for helping community members find information they are interested in. Forexample; the exploration of communities in del. icio. us; a well known social tagging website;can be enhanced through the use of tags; see eg;[1].
