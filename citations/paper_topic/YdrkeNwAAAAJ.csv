Clearing the clouds: a study of emerging scale-out workloads on modern hardware,Michael Ferdman; Almutaz Adileh; Onur Kocberber; Stavros Volos; Mohammad Alisafaee; Djordje Jevdjic; Cansu Kaynak; Adrian Daniel Popescu; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,Abstract Emerging scale-out workloads require extensive amounts of computationalresources. However; data centers using modern server hardware face physical constraintsin space and power; limiting further expansion and calling for improvements in thecomputational density per server and in the per-operation energy. Continuing to improve thecomputational resources of the cloud while staying within physical constraints mandatesoptimizing server efficiency to ensure that server hardware closely matches the needs ofscale-out workloads. In this work; we introduce CloudSuite; a benchmark suite of emergingscale-out workloads. We use performance counters on modern servers to study scale-outworkloads; finding that today's predominant processor micro-architecture is inefficient forrunning these workloads. We find that inefficiency comes from the mismatch between the …,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,2012,600,10
DBMSs on a modern processor: Where does time go?,Anastassia Ailamaki; David J DeWitt; Mark D Hill; David A Wood,Abstract Recent high-performance processors employ sophisticated techniques to overlapand simultaneously execute multiple computation and memory operations. Intuitively; thesetechniques should help database applications; which are becoming increasingly computeand memory bound. Unfortunately; recent studies report that faster processors do notimprove database system performance to the same extent as scientific workloads. Recentwork on database systems focusing on minimizing memory latencies; such as cache-conscious algorithms for sorting and data placement; is one step toward addressing thisproblem. However; to best design high performance DBMSs we must carefully evaluate andunderstand the processor and memory behavior of commercial DBMSs on today's hardwareplatforms.

Weaving Relations for Cache Performance.,Anastassia Ailamaki; David J DeWitt; Mark D Hill; Marios Skounakis,Abstract Relational database systems have traditionally optimzed for I/O performance andorganized records sequentially on disk pages using the N-ary Storage Model (NSM)(aka;slotted pages). Recent research; however; indicates that cache utilization and performanceis becoming increasingly important on modern platforms. In this paper; we first demonstratethat in-page data placement is the key to high cache performance and that NSM exhibits lowcache utilization on modern platforms. Next; we propose a new data organization modelcalled PAX (Partition Attributes Across); that significantly improves cache performance bygrouping together all values of each attribute within each page. Because PAX only affectslayout inside the pages; it incurs no storage penalty and does not affect I/O behavior.According to our experimental results; when compared to NSM (a) PAX exhibits superior …,VLDB,2001,501,0
Reactive NUCA: near-optimal block placement and replication in distributed caches,Nikos Hardavellas; Michael Ferdman; Babak Falsafi; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Increases in on-chip communication delay and the large working sets of server andscientific workloads complicate the design of the on-chip last-level cache for multicoreprocessors. The large working sets favor a shared cache design that maximizes theaggregate cache capacity and minimizes off-chip memory requests. At the same time; thegrowing on-chip communication delay favors core-private caches that replicate data tominimize delays on global wires. Recent hybrid proposals offer lower average latency thanconventional designs; but they address the placement requirements of only a subset of thedata accessed by the application; require complex lookup and coherence mechanisms thatincrease latency; or fail to scale to high core counts. In this work; we observe that the cacheaccess patterns of a range of server and scientific workloads can be classified into distinct …,ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News,2009,421,15

Shore-MT: a scalable storage manager for the multicore era,Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Nikos Hardavellas; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,Abstract Database storage managers have long been able to efficiently handle multipleconcurrent requests. Until recently; however; a computer contained only a few single-coreCPUs; and therefore only a few transactions could simultaneously access the storagemanager's internal structures. This allowed storage managers to use non-scalableapproaches without any penalty. With the arrival of multicore chips; however; this situation israpidly changing. More and more threads can run in parallel; stressing the internalscalability of the storage manager. Systems optimized for high performance at a limitednumber of cores are not assured similarly high performance at a higher core count; becauseunanticipated scalability obstacles arise.

Many multithreaded programs provide opportunities forconstructive cache sharing; in which concurrently scheduled threads share a largelyoverlapping working set. In this paper; we compare the performance of two state-of-the-artschedulers proposed for fine-grained multithreaded programs: Parallel Depth First (PDF);which is specifically designed for constructive cache sharing; and Work Stealing (WS); whichis a more traditional design. Our experimental results indicate that PDF scheduling yields a1.3--1.6 X performance improvement relative to WS for several fine-grain parallelbenchmarks on projected future CMP configurations; we also report several issues that maylimit the advantage of PDF in certain applications.

Spatial memory streaming,Stephen Somogyi; Thomas F Wenisch; Anastassia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi; Andreas Moshovos,Abstract Prior research indicates that there is much spatial variation in applications' memoryaccess patterns. Modern memory systems; however; use small fixed-size cache blocks andas such cannot exploit the variation. Increasing the block size would not only prohibitivelyincrease pin and interconnect bandwidth demands; but also increase the likelihood of falsesharing in shared-memory multiprocessors. In this paper; we show that memory accesses incommercial workloads often exhibit repetitive layouts that span large memory regions (eg;several kB); and these accesses recur in patterns that are predictable through codebasedcorrelation. We propose Spatial Memory Streaming; a practical on-chip hardware techniquethat identifies codecorrelated spatial access patterns and streams predicted blocks to theprimary cache ahead of demand misses.

Data-oriented transaction execution,Ippokratis Pandis; Ryan Johnson; Nikos Hardavellas; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract While hardware technology has undergone major advancements over the pastdecade; transaction processing systems have remained largely unchanged. The number ofcores on a chip grows exponentially; following Moore's Law; allowing for an ever-increasingnumber of transactions to execute in parallel. As the number of concurrently-executingtransactions increases; contended critical sections become scalability burdens. In typicaltransaction processing systems the centralized lock manager is often the first contendedcomponent and scalability bottleneck. In this paper; we identify the conventional thread-to-transaction assignment policy as the primary cause of contention. Then; we design DORA; asystem that decomposes each transaction to smaller actions and assigns actions to threadsbased on which data each action is about to access.

Storage device performance prediction with CART models,Mengzhi Wang; Kinman Au; Anastassia Ailamaki; Anthony Brockwell; Christos Faloutsos; Gregory R Ganger,Storage device performance prediction is a key element of self-managed storage systems.The paper explores the application of a machine learning tool; CART (classification andregression trees) models; to storage device modeling. Our approach predicts a device'sperformance as a function of input workloads; requiring no knowledge of the deviceinternals. We propose two uses of CART models: one that predicts per-request responsetimes (and then derives aggregate values); one that predicts aggregate values directly fromworkload characteristics. After being trained on the device in question; both provide accurateblack-box models across a range of test traces from real environments. Experiments showthat these models predict the average and 90th percentile response time with a relative erroras low as 19%; when the training workloads are similar to the testing workloads; and …,Modeling; Analysis; and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunications Systems; 2004.(MASCOTS 2004).

Improving hash join performance through prefetching,Shimin Chen; Anastassia Ailamaki; Phillip B Gibbons; Todd C Mowry,Abstract Hash join algorithms suffer from extensive CPU cache stalls. This article shows thatthe standard hash join algorithm for disk-oriented databases (ie GRACE) spends over80&percnt; of its user time stalled on CPU cache misses; and explores the use of CPU cacheprefetching to improve its cache performance. Applying prefetching to hash joins iscomplicated by the data dependencies; multiple code paths; and inherent randomness ofhashing. We present two techniques; group prefetching and software-pipelined prefetching;that overcome these complications. These schemes achieve 1.29--4.04 X speedups for thejoin phase and 1.37--3.49 X speedups for the partition phase over GRACE and simpleprefetching approaches. Moreover; compared with previous cache-aware approaches (iecache partitioning); the schemes are at least 36&percnt; faster on large relations and do …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,177,10
QPipe: a simultaneously pipelined relational query engine,Stavros Harizopoulos; Vladislav Shkapenyuk; Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract Relational DBMS typically execute concurrent queries independently by invoking aset of operator instances for each query. To exploit common data retrievals and computationin concurrent queries; researchers have proposed a wealth of techniques; ranging frombuffering disk pages to constructing materialized views and optimizing multiple queries. Theideas proposed; however; are inherently limited by the query-centric philosophy of modernengine designs. Ideally; the query engine should proactively coordinate same-operatorexecution among concurrent queries; thereby exploiting common accesses to memory anddisks as well as common intermediate result computation.

Database servers on chip multiprocessors: Limitations and opportunities,Nikos Hardavellas; Ippokratis Pandis; Ryan Johnson; Naju Mancheril; Anastassia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,ABSTRACT Prior research shows that database system performance is dominated by off-chip data stalls; resulting in a concerted effort to bring data into on-chip caches. At the sametime; high levels of integration have enabled the advent of chip multiprocessors andincreasingly large (and slow) on-chip caches. These two trends pose the imminent technicaland research challenge of adapting high-performance data management software to ashifting hardware landscape. In this paper we characterize the performance of a commercialdatabase server running on emerging chip multiprocessor technologies. We find that themajor bottleneck of current software is data cache stalls; with L2 hit stalls rising from oblivionto become the dominant execution time component in some cases.

Autopart: Automating schema design for large scientific databases using data partitioning,Stratos Papadomanolakis; Anastassia Ailamaki,Database applications that use multi-terabyte datasets are becoming increasingly importantfor scientific fields such as astronomy and biology. Scientific databases are particularlysuited for the application of automated physical design techniques; because of their datavolume and the complexity of the scientific workloads. Current automated physical designtools focus on the selection of indexes and materialized views. In large-scale scientificdatabases; however the data volume and the continuous insertion of new data allows foronly limited indexes and materialized views. By contrast; data partitioning does not replicatedata; thereby reducing space requirements and minimizing update overhead.

Diamond: A Storage Architecture for Early Discard in Interactive Search.,Larry Huston; Rahul Sukthankar; Rajiv Wickremesinghe; Mahadev Satyanarayanan; Gregory R Ganger; Erik Riedel; Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract This paper explores the concept of early discard for interactive search of unindexeddata. Processing data inside storage devices using downloaded searchlet code enablesDiamond to perform efficient; application-specific filtering of large data collections. Earlydiscard helps users who are looking for``needles in a haystack''by eliminating the bulk of theirrelevant items as early as possible. A searchlet consists of a set of application-generatedfilters that Diamond uses to determine whether an object may be of interest to the user. Thesystem optimizes the evaluation order of the filters based on run-time measurements of eachfilter's selectivity and computational cost. Diamond can also dynamically partitioncomputation between the storage devices and the host computer to adjust for changes inhardware and network conditions.

NoDB: efficient query execution on raw data files,Ioannis Alagiannis; Renata Borovica; Miguel Branco; Stratos Idreos; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract As data collections become larger and larger; data loading evolves to a majorbottleneck. Many applications already avoid using database systems; eg; scientific dataanalysis and social networks; due to the complexity and the increased data-to-query time.For such applications data collections keep growing fast; even on a daily basis; and we arealready in the era of data deluge where we have much more data than what we can move;store; let alone analyze.

Middleware-based database replication: the gaps between theory and practice,Emmanuel Cecchet; George Candea; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract The need for high availability and performance in data management systems hasbeen fueling a long running interest in database replication from both academia andindustry. However; academic groups often attack replication problems in isolation;overlooking the need for completeness in their solutions; while commercial teams take aholistic approach that often misses opportunities for fundamental innovation. This hascreated over time a gap between academic research and industrial practice. This paperaims to characterize the gap along three axes: performance; availability; and administration.We build on our own experience developing and deploying replication systems incommercial and academic settings; as well as on a large body of prior related work.

Priority mechanisms for OLTP and transactional web applications,David T McWherter; Bianca Schroeder; Anastassia Ailamaki; Mor Harchol-Balter,Transactional workloads are a hallmark of modern OLTP and Web applications; rangingfrom electronic commerce and banking to online shopping. Often; the database at the core ofthese applications is the performance bottleneck. Given the limited resources available tothe database; transaction execution times can vary wildly as they compete and wait forcritical resources. As the competitor is" only a click away"; valuable (high-priority) users mustbe ensured consistently good performance via QoS and transaction prioritization. This paperanalyzes and proposes prioritization for transactional workloads in traditional databasesystems (DBMS).

From a keyword query; we want todynamically select a small set of" interesting" attributes and present aggregates on them to auser. Similar to work in OLAP exploration; we define" interestingness" as how surprising anaggregated value is; based on a given expectation. We make two new contributions byproposing a novel" navigational" expectation that's particularly useful in the context offaceted search; and a novel interestingness measure through judicious application of p-values. Through a user survey; we find the new expectation and interestingness metric quiteeffective. We develop an efficient dynamic faceted search system by improving a popularopen source engine; Solr.

Aether: a scalable approach to logging,Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Radu Stoica; Manos Athanassoulis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract The shift to multi-core hardware brings new challenges to database systems; as thesoftware parallelism determines performance. Even though database systems traditionallyaccommodate simultaneous requests; a multitude of synchronization barriers serializeexecution. Write-ahead logging is a fundamental; omnipresent component in ARIES-styleconcurrency and recovery; and one of the most important yet-to-be addressed potentialbottlenecks; especially in OLTP workloads making frequent small changes to data. In thispaper; we identify four logging-related impediments to database system scalability.

Spatio-temporal memory streaming,Stephen Somogyi; Thomas F Wenisch; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,Abstract Recent research advocates memory streaming techniques to alleviate theperformance bottleneck caused by the high latencies of off-chip memory accesses.Temporal memory streaming replays previously observed miss sequences to eliminate longchains of dependent misses. Spatial memory streaming predicts repetitive data layoutpatterns within fixed-size memory regions. Because each technique targets a differentsubset of misses; their effectiveness varies across workloads and each leaves a significantfraction of misses unpredicted. In this paper; we propose Spatio-Temporal MemoryStreaming (STeMS) to exploit the synergy between spatial and temporal streaming. Weobserve that the order of spatial accesses repeats both within and across regions.

Mechanisms for store-wait-free multiprocessors,Thomas F Wenisch; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi; Andreas Moshovos,Abstract Store misses cause significant delays in shared-memory multiprocessors becauseof limited store buffering and ordering constraints required for proper synchronization.Today; programmers must choose from a spectrum of memory consistency models thatreduce store stalls at the cost of increased programming complexity. Prior research suggeststhat the performance gap among consistency models can be closed through speculation--enforcing order only when dynamically necessary. Unfortunately; past designs eitherprovide insufficient buffering; replace all stores with read-modify-write operations; and/orrecover from ordering violations via impractical fine-grained rollback mechanisms. Wepropose two mechanisms that; together; enable store-wait-free implementations of anymemory consistency model.

Optimal service pricing for a cloud cache,Verena Kantere; Debabrata Dash; Gregory Francois; Sofia Kyriakopoulou; Anastasia Ailamaki,Cloud applications that offer data management services are emerging. Such clouds supportcaching of data in order to provide quality query services. The users can query the clouddata; paying the price for the infrastructure they use. Cloud management necessitates aneconomy that manages the service of multiple users in an efficient; but also; resource-economic way that allows for cloud profit. Naturally; the maximization of cloud profit givensome guarantees for user satisfaction presumes an appropriate price-demand model thatenables optimal pricing of query services. The model should be plausible in that it reflectsthe correlation of cache structures involved in the queries. Optimal pricing is achieved basedon a dynamic pricing scheme that adapts to time changes.

Data page layouts for relational databases on deep memory hierarchies,Anastassia Ailamaki; David J DeWitt; Mark D Hill,Abstract Relational database systems have traditionally optimized for I/O performance andorganized records sequentially on disk pages using the N-ary Storage Model (NSM)(aka;slotted pages). Recent research; however; indicates that cache utilization and performanceis becoming increasingly important on modern platforms. In this paper; we first demonstratethat in-page data placement is the key to high cache performance and that NSM exhibits lowcache utilization on modern platforms. Next; we propose a new data organization modelcalled PAX (Partition Attributes Across); that significantly improves cache performance bygrouping together all values of each attribute within each page. Because PAX only affectslayout inside the pages; it incurs no storage penalty and does not affect I/O behavior.According to our experimental results (which were obtained without using any indices on …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2002,96,0
Capturing the spatio-temporal behavior of real traffic data,Mengzhi Wang; Anastassia Ailamaki; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Traffic data; such as disk and memory accesses; typically exhibits burstiness;temporal locality; and spatial locality. However; except for qualitative speculations; it is noteven known how to measure the spatio-temporal correlation; let alone how to re-produce itrealistically. In this paper; we propose the “entropy plots” to quantify the correlation anddevelop a new statistical model; the “PQRS” model; to capture the burstiness and correlationof the real spatio-temporal traffic.

An economic model for self-tuned cloud caching,Debabrata Dash; Verena Kantere; Anastasia Ailamaki,Cloud computing; the new trend for service infrastructures requires user multi-tenancy aswell as minimal capital expenditure. In a cloud that services large amounts of data that aremassively collected and queried; such as scientific data; users typically pay for queryservices. The cloud supports caching of data in order to provide quality query services. Userpayments cover query execution costs and maintenance of cloud infrastructure; and incurcloud profit. The challenge resides in providing efficient and resource-economic queryservices while maintaining a profitable cloud.

On Multidimensional Data and Modern Disks.,Steven W Schlosser; Jiri Schindler; Stratos Papadomanolakis; Minglong Shao; Anastassia Ailamaki; Christos Faloutsos; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract With the deeply-ingrained notion that disks can efficiently access only onedimensional data; current approaches for mapping multidimensional data to disk blockseither allow efficient accesses in only one dimension; trading off the efficiency of accesses inother dimensions; or equally penalize access to all dimensions. Yet; existing technology andfunctions readily available inside disk firmware can identify non-contiguous logical blocksthat preserve spatial locality of multidimensional datasets. These blocks; which span on theorder of a hundred adjacent tracks; can be accessed with minimal positioning cost. Thispaper details these technologies; analyzes their trends; and shows how they can beexposed to applications while maintaining existing abstractions. The described approachcan achieve the best possible access efficiency afforded by the disk technologies …,FAST,2005,84,15
PLP: page latch-free shared-everything OLTP,Ippokratis Pandis; Pinar Tözün; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Scaling the performance of shared-everything transaction processing systems tohighly-parallel multicore hardware remains a challenge for database system designers.Recent proposals alleviate locking and logging bottlenecks in the system; leaving pagelatching as the next potential problem. To tackle the page latching problem; we proposephysiological partitioning (PLP). The PLP design applies logical-only partitioning;maintaining the desired properties of shared-everything designs; and introduces a multi-rooted B+ Tree index structure (MRBTree) which enables the partitioning of the accesses atthe physical page level. Logical partitioning and MRBTrees together ensure that allaccesses to a given index page come from a single thread and; hence; can be entirely latch-free; an extended design makes heap page accesses thread-private as well.

Timestamp snooping: an approach for extending SMPs,Milo MK Martin; Daniel J Sorin; Anastassia Ailamaki; Alaa R Alameldeen; Ross M Dickson; Carl J Mauer; Kevin E Moore; Manoj Plakal; Mark D Hill; David H Wood,Abstract Symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) servers provide superior performance for thecommercial workloads that dominate the Internet. Our simulation results show that over one-third of cache misses by these applications result in cache-to-cache transfers; where thedata is found in another processor's cache rather than in memory. SMPs are optimized forthis case by using snooping protocols that broadcast address transactions to all processors.Conversely; directory-based shared-memory systems must indirectly locate the owner andsharers through a directory; resulting in larger average miss latencies. This paper proposestimestamp snooping; a technique that allows SMPs to i) utilize high-speed switchedinterconnection networks and ii) exploit physical locality by delivering address transactionsto processors and memories without regard to order. Traditional snooping requires …,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,2000,82,20
Here are my data files. here are my queries. where are my results?,Stratos Idreos; Ioannis Alagiannis; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Database management systems (DBMS) provide incredible flexibility andperformance when it comes to query processing; scalability and accuracy. To fully exploitDBMS features; however; the user must define a schema; load the data; tune the system forthe expected workload; and answer several questions. Should the database use a column-store; a row-store or some hybrid format? What indices should be created? All thesequestions make for a formidable and time-consuming hurdle; often deterring newapplications or imposing high cost to existing ones. A characteristic example is that ofscientific databases with huge data sets. The prohibitive initialization cost and complexitystill forces scientists to rely on “ancient” tools for their data management tasks; delayingscientific understanding and progress. Users and applications collect their data in flat files …,Proceedings of 5th Biennial Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research,2011,73,10
A case for staged database systems,Stavros Harizopoulos; Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract Traditional database system architectures face a rapidly evolving operatingenvironment; where millions of users store and access terabytes of data. In order to copewith increasing demands for performance; high-end DBMS employ parallel processingtechniques coupled with a plethora of sophisticated features. However; the widely adopted;work-centric; thread-parallel execution model entails several shortcomings that limit serverperformance when executing workloads with changing requirements. Moreover; themonolithic approach in DBMS software has lead to complex and difficult to extend designs.This paper introduces a staged design for high-performance; evolvable DBMS that are easyto tune and maintain. We propose to break the database system into modules and toencapsulate them into self-contained stages connected to each other through queues …,*,2003,71,20
Log-based architectures for general-purpose monitoring of deployed code,Shimin Chen; Babak Falsafi; Phillip B Gibbons; Michael Kozuch; Todd C Mowry; Radu Teodorescu; Anastassia Ailamaki; Limor Fix; Gregory R Ganger; Bin Lin; Steven W Schlosser,Abstract Runtime monitoring tools are invaluable for detecting various types of bugs; in bothsequential and multi-threaded programs. However; these tools often slow down themonitored program by an order of magnitude or more [4]; implying that the tools are ill-suitedfor always-on monitoring of deployed code. Fortunately; the emergence of chipmultiprocessors as a dominant computing platform means that resources are available on-chip to assist in monitoring tasks. In this brief note; we advocate Log-Based Architectures(LBA) that exploit such on-chip resources in order to dramatically reduce the overhead ofruntime program monitoring. Specifically; we propose adding hardware support for logging amain program's trace and delivering it to another (otherwise idle) processing core forinspection. A life-guard program running on this other core executes the desired …,Proceedings of the 1st workshop on Architectural and system support for improving software dependability,2006,69,12
Atropos: A Disk Array Volume Manager for Orchestrated Use of Disks.,Jiri Schindler; Steven W Schlosser; Minglong Shao; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract: The Atropos logical volume manager allows applications to exploit characteristicsof its underlying collection of disks. It stripes data in track-sized units and explicitly exposesthe boundaries; allowing applications to maximize efficiency for sequential access patternseven when they share the array. Further; it supports efficient diagonal access to blocks onadjacent tracks; allowing applications to orchestrate the layout and access to two-dimensional data structures; such as relational database tables; to maximize performancefor both row-based and column-based accesses.,FAST,2004,61,20
Evaluating and repairing write performance on flash devices,Radu Stoica; Manos Athanassoulis; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract In the last few years NAND flash storage has become more and more popular asprice per GB and capacity both improve at exponential rates. Flash memory offers significantbenefits compared to magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs) and DBMSs are highly likely to useflash as a general storage backend; either alone or in heterogeneous storage solutions withHDDs. Flash devices; however; respond quite differently than HDDs for common accesspatterns; and recent research shows a strong asymmetry between read and writeperformance. Moreover; flash storage devices behave unpredictably; showing a highdependence on previous IO history and usage patterns. In this paper we investigate how aDBMS can overcome these issues to take full advantage of flash memory as persistentstorage. We propose new a flash aware data layout---append and pack---which stabilizes …,Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2009,59,20
Decoupling contention management from scheduling,F Ryan Johnson; Radu Stoica; Anastasia Ailamaki; Todd C Mowry,Abstract Many parallel applications exhibit unpredictable communication between threads;leading to contention for shared objects. The choice of contention management strategyimpacts strongly the performance and scalability of these applications: spinning providesmaximum performance but wastes significant processor resources; while blocking-basedapproaches conserve processor resources but introduce high overheads on the critical pathof computation. Under situations of high or changing load; the operating system complicatesmatters further with arbitrary scheduling decisions which often preempt lock holders; leadingto long serialization delays until the preempted thread resumes execution. We observe thatcontention management is orthogonal to the problems of scheduling and load managementand propose to decouple them so each may be solved independently and effectively.

DBmbench: Fast and accurate database workload representation on modern microarchitecture,Minglong Shao; Anastassia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,Abstract With the proliferation of database workloads on servers; much recent research onserver architecture has focused on database system benchmarks. The TPC benchmarks forthe two most common server workloads; OLTP and DSS; have been used extensively in thedatabase community to evaluate the database system functionality and performance.Unfortunately; these benchmarks fall short of being effective in microarchitecture andmemory system research due to several key shortcomings. First; setting up the experimentalenvironment and tuning these benchmarks to match the workload behavior of interestinvolves extremely complex procedures. Second; the benchmarks themselves are complexand preclude accurate correlation of microarchitecture-and memory-level bottlenecks todominant workload characteristics. Finally; industrial-grade configurations of such …,Proceedings of the 2005 conference of the Centre for Advanced Studies on Collaborative research,2005,58,23
H2O: a hands-free adaptive store,Ioannis Alagiannis; Stratos Idreos; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Modern state-of-the-art database systems are designed around a single datastorage layout. This is a fixed decision that drives the whole architectural design of adatabase system; ie; row-stores; column-stores. However; none of those choices is auniversally good solution; different workloads require different storage layouts and dataaccess methods in order to achieve good performance. In this paper; we present the H2Osystem which introduces two novel concepts. First; it is flexible to support multiple storagelayouts and data access patterns in a single engine. Second; and most importantly; itdecides on-the-fly; ie; during query processing; which design is best for classes of queriesand the respective data parts. At any given point in time; parts of the data might bematerialized in various patterns purely depending on the query workload; as the workload …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,57,10
Improving OLTP scalability using speculative lock inheritance,Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Transaction processing workloads provide ample request level concurrency whichhighly parallel architectures can exploit. However; the resulting heavy utilization of coredatabase services also causes resource contention within the database engine itself andlimits scalability. Meanwhile; many database workloads consist of short transactions whichaccess only a few database records each; often with stringent response time requirements.Performance of these short transactions is determined largely by the amount of overhead thedatabase engine imposes for services such as logging; locking; and transactionmanagement. This paper highlights the negative scalability impact of database locking; aneffect which is especially severe for short transactions running on highly concurrentmulticore hardware. We propose and evaluate Speculative Lock Inheritance; a technique …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,53,15
Accelerating database operators using a network processor,Brian Gold; Anastassia Ailamaki; Larry Huston; Babak Falsafi,ABSTRACT Database management systems (DBMSs) do not take full advantage of modernmicroarchitectural resources; such as wide-issue out-of-order processor pipelines. Increasesin processor clock rate and instruction-level parallelism have left memory accesses as thedominant bottleneck in DBMS execution. Prior research indicates that simultaneousmultithreading (SMT) can hide memory access latency from a single thread and improvethroughput by increasing the number of outstanding memory accesses. Rather than expendchip area and power on out-of-order execution; as in current SMT processors; wedemonstrate the effectiveness of using many simple processor cores; each with hardwaresupport for multiple thread contexts.

StagedDB: Designing Database Servers for Modern Hardware.,Stavros Harizopoulos; Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract Advances in computer architecture research yield increasingly powerful processorswhich can execute code at a much faster pace than they can access data in the memoryhierarchy. Database management systems (DBMS); due to their intensive data processingnature; are in the front line of commercial applications which cannot harness the availablecomputing power. To prevent the CPU from idling; a multitude of hardware mechanisms andsoftware optimizations have been proposed. Their effectiveness; however; is limited by thesheer volume of data accessed and by the unpredictable sequence of memory requests. Inthis article we describe StagedDB; a new DBMS software architecture for optimizing dataand instruction locality at all levels of the memory hierarchy. The key idea is to breakdatabase request execution in stages and process a group of sub-requests at each stage …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2005,52,20
OLTP on hardware islands,Danica Porobic; Ippokratis Pandis; Miguel Branco; Pınar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Modern hardware is abundantly parallel and increasingly heterogeneous. Thenumerous processing cores have nonuniform access latencies to the main memory and tothe processor caches; which causes variability in the communication costs. Unfortunately;database systems mostly assume that all processing cores are the same and thatmicroarchitecture differences are not significant enough to appear in critical databaseexecution paths. As we demonstrate in this paper; however; hardware heterogeneity doesappear in the critical path and conventional database architectures achieve suboptimal andeven worse; unpredictable performance. We perform a detailed performance analysis ofOLTP deployments in servers with multiple cores per CPU (multicore) and multiple CPUsper server (multisocket). We compare different database deployment strategies where we …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,51,0
TPC-E vs. TPC-C: characterizing the new TPC-E benchmark via an I/O comparison study,Shimin Chen; Anastasia Ailamaki; Manos Athanassoulis; Phillip B Gibbons; Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Radu Stoica,Abstract TPC-E is a new OLTP benchmark recently approved by the Transaction ProcessingPerformance Council (TPC). In this paper; we compare TPC-E with the familiar TPCCbenchmark in order to understand the behavior of the new TPC-E benchmark. In particular;we compare the I/O access patterns of the two benchmarks by analyzing two OLTP disktraces. We find that (i) TPC-E is more read intensive with a 9.7: 1 I/O read to write ratio; whileTPC-C sees a 1.9: 1 read-to-write ratio; and (ii) although TPC-E uses pseudo-realistic data;TPC-E's I/O access pattern is as random as TPC-C. The latter suggests that like TPC-C; TPC-E can benefit from SSDs; which have superior random I/O support. To verify this; we replayboth disk traces on an Intel X25-E SSD and see dramatic improvements for both TPC-C andTPC-E.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2011,51,20
Efficient use of the query optimizer for automated physical design,Stratos Papadomanolakis; Debabrata Dash; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract State-of-the-art database design tools rely on the query optimizer for comparingbetween physical design alternatives. Although it provides an appropriate cost model forphysical design; query optimization is a computationally expensive process. The significanttime consumed by optimizer invocations poses serious performance limitations for physicaldesign tools; causing long running times; especially for large problem instances. So far ithas been impossible to remove query optimization overhead without sacrificing costestimation precision. Inaccuracies in query cost estimation are detrimental to the quality ofphysical design algorithms; as they increase the chances of" missing" good designs andconsequently selecting sub-optimal ones. Precision loss and the resulting reduction insolution quality is particularly undesirable and it is the reason the query optimizer is used …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,51,20
Continuous resource monitoring for self-predicting DBMS,Dushyanth Narayanan; Eno Thereska; Anastassia Ailamaki,Administration tasks increasingly dominate the total cost of ownership of databasemanagement systems. A key task; and a very difficult one for an administrator; is to justifyupgrades of CPU; memory and storage resources with quantitative predictions of theexpected improvement in workload performance. Current database systems are notdesigned with such prediction in mind and hence offer only limited help to the administrator.This paper proposes changes to database system design that enable a Resource Advisor toanswer" what-if" questions about resource upgrades. A prototype Resource Advisor built towork with a commercial DBMS shows the efficacy of our approach in predicting the effect ofupgrading a key resource-buffer pool size-on OLTP workloads in a highly concurrentsystem.,Modeling; Analysis; and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems; 2005. 13th IEEE International Symposium on,2005,51,15
To share or not to share?,Ryan Johnson; Stavros Harizopoulos; Nikos Hardavellas; Kivanc Sabirli; Ippokratis Pandis; Anastasia Ailamaki; Naju G Mancheril; Babak Falsafi,Abstract Intuitively; aggressive work sharing among concurrent queries in a databasesystem should always improve performance by eliminating redundant computation or dataaccesses. We show that; contrary to common intuition; this is not always the case in practice;especially in the highly parallel world of chip multiprocessors. As the number of cores in thesystem increases; a trade-off appears between exploiting work sharing opportunities and theavailable parallelism. To resolve the trade-off; we develop an analytical approach thatpredicts the effect of work sharing in multi-core systems. Database systems can use themodel to determine; statically or at runtime; whether work sharing is beneficial and apply itonly when appropriate. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First; we introduce andanalyze the effects of the trade-off between work sharing and parallelism on database …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,50,20
A scalability service for dynamic web applications,Christopher Olston; Amit Manjhi; Charles Garrod; Anastassia Ailamaki; Bruce M Maggs; Todd C Mowry,Abstract Providers of dynamic Web applications are currently unable to accommodate heavyusage without significant investment in infrastructure and in-house management capability.Our goal is to develop technology to enable a third party to offer scalability as a subscriptionservice with “per-click” pricing to application providers. To this end we have developed aprototype proxy caching system able to scale delivery of dynamic Web content to a largenumber of users. In this paper we report initial positive results obtained from our prototypethat point to the feasibility of our goal. We also report the shortcomings of our currentprototype; the chief one being the lack of a scalable method of managing data consistency.We then present our initial work on a novel approach to scalable consistency management.Our approach is based on a fully distributed mechanism that does not require content …,*,2005,50,10
Scalable query result caching for web applications,Charles Garrod; Amit Manjhi; Anastasia Ailamaki; Bruce Maggs; Todd Mowry; Christopher Olston; Anthony Tomasic,Abstract The backend database system is often the performance bottleneck when runningweb applications. A common approach to scale the database component is query resultcaching; but it faces the challenge of maintaining a high cache hit rate while efficientlyensuring cache consistency as the database is updated. In this paper we introduceFerdinand; the first proxy-based cooperative query result cache with fully distributedconsistency management. To maintain a high cache hit rate; Ferdinand uses both a localquery result cache on each proxy server and a distributed cache. Consistency managementis implemented with a highly scalable publish/subscribe system. We implement a fullyfunctioning Ferdinand prototype and evaluate its performance compared to severalalternative query-caching approaches; showing that our high cache hit rate and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,48,4
STEPS towards cache-resident transaction processing,Stavros Harizopoulos; Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract Online transaction processing (OLTP) is a multibillion dollar industry with high-enddatabase servers employing state-of-the-art processors to maximize performance.Unfortunately; recent studies show that CPUs are far from realizing their maximum intendedthroughput because of delays in the processor caches. When running OLTP; instruction-related delays in the memory subsystem account for 25 to 40% of the total execution time. Incontrast to data; instruction misses cannot be overlapped with out-of-order execution; andinstruction caches cannot grow as the slower access time directly affects the processorspeed. The challenge is to alleviate the instruction-related delays without increasing thecache size. We propose Steps; a technique that minimizes instruction cache misses in OLTPworkloads by multiplexing concurrent transactions and exploiting common code paths …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,48,19

Temporal instruction fetch streaming,Michael Ferdman; Thomas F Wenisch; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi; Andreas Moshovos,L1 instruction-cache misses pose a critical performance bottleneck in commercial serverworkloads. Cache access latency constraints preclude L1 instruction caches large enoughto capture the application; library; and OS instruction working sets of these workloads. Tocope with capacity constraints; researchers have proposed instruction prefetchers that usebranch predictors to explore future control flow. However; such prefetchers suffer fromseveral fundamental flaws: their lookahead is limited by branch prediction bandwidth; theiraccuracy suffers from geometrically-compounding branch misprediction probability; and theyare ignorant of the cache contents; frequently predicting blocks already present in L1.Hence; L1 instruction misses remain a bottleneck. We propose temporal instruction fetchstreaming (TIFS)-a mechanism for prefetching temporally-correlated instruction streams …,Microarchitecture; 2008.

Efficient query processing on unstructured tetrahedral meshes,Stratos Papadomanolakis; Anastassia Ailamaki; Julio C Lopez; Tiankai Tu; David R O'Hallaron; Gerd Heber,Abstract Modern scientific applications such as fluid dynamics and earthquake modelingheavily depend on massive volumes of data produced by computer simulations. Suchapplications require new data management capabilities in order to scale to terabyte-scaledata volumes. The most common way to discretize the application domain is to decompose itinto pyramids; forming an unstructured tetrahedral mesh. Modern simulations generatemeshes of high resolution and precision; to be queried by a visualization or analysis tool.Tetrahedral meshes are extremely flexible and therefore vital to accurately model complexgeometries; but also are difficult to index. To reduce query execution time; applicationseither use only subsets of the data or rely on different (less flexible) structures; therebytrading accuracy for speed.

Memory coherence activity prediction in commercial workloads,Stephen Somogyi; Thomas F Wenisch; Nikolaos Hardavellas; Jangwoo Kim; Anastassia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,Abstract Recent research indicates that prediction-based coherence optimizations offersubstantial performance improvements for scientific applications in distributed sharedmemory multiprocessors. Important commercial applications also show sensitivity tocoherence latency; which will become more acute in the future as technology scales.Therefore it is important to investigate prediction of memory coherence activity in the contextof commercial workloads. This paper studies a trace-based Downgrade Predictor (DGP) forpredicting last stores to shared cache blocks; and a pattern-based Consumer Set Predictor(CSP) for predicting subsequent readers. We evaluate this class of predictors for the firsttime on commercial applications and demonstrate that our DGP correctly predicts 47%-76%of last stores.

An integer linear programming approach to database design,Stratos Papadomanolakis; Anastassia Ailamaki,Existing index selection tools rely on heuristics to efficiently search within the large space ofalternative solutions and to minimize the overhead of using the query optimizer for costestimation. Index selection heuristics; despite being practical; are hard to analyze andformally compute how close they get to the optimal solution. In this paper we propose amodel for index selection based on integer linear programming (ILP). The ILP formulationenables a wealth of combinatorial optimization techniques for providing quality guarantees;approximate solutions and even for computing optimal solutions. We present a systemarchitecture for ILP-based index selection; in the context of commercial database systems.Our ILP-based approach offers higher solution quality; efficiency and scalability withoutsacrificing any of the precision offered by existing index selection tools.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,44,14
Scalability of write-ahead logging on multicore and multisocket hardware,Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Radu Stoica; Manos Athanassoulis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract The shift to multi-core and multi-socket hardware brings new challenges todatabase systems; as the software parallelism determines performance. Even thoughdatabase systems traditionally accommodate simultaneous requests; a multitude ofsynchronization barriers serialize execution. Write-ahead logging is a fundamental;omnipresent component in ARIES-style concurrency and recovery; and one of the mostimportant yet-to-be addressed potential bottlenecks; especially in OLTP workloads makingfrequent small changes to data. In this paper; we identify four logging-related impediments todatabase system scalability.

From A to E: analyzing TPC's OLTP benchmarks: the obsolete; the ubiquitous; the unexplored,Pınar Tözün; Ippokratis Pandis; Cansu Kaynak; Djordje Jevdjic; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Introduced in 2007; TPC-E is the most recently standardized OLTP benchmark byTPC. Even though TPC-E has already been around for six years; it has not gained thepopularity of its predecessor TPC-C: all the published results for TPC-E use a singledatabase vendor's product. TPC-E is significantly different than its predecessors. Some of itsdistinguishing characteristics are the non-uniform input creation; longer-running and morecomplicated transactions; more difficult partitioning etc. These factors slow down theadoption of TPC-E. In turn; there is little knowledge in the community about how TPC-Ebehaves micro-architecturally and within the database engine. To shed light on TPC-E; weimplement it on top of a scalable open-source database engine; Shore-MT; and perform aworkload characterization study; comparing it with the previous; much better known OLTP …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,41,19
Lachesis: robust database storage management based on device-specific performance characteristics,Jiri Schindler; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract Database systems work hard to tune I/O performance; but do not always achievethe full performance potential of modern disk systems. Their abstracted view of storagecomponents hides useful device-specific characteristics; such as disk track boundaries andadvanced built-in firmware algorithms. This paper presents a new storage managerarchitecture; called Lachesis; that exploits and adapts to observable device-specificcharacteristics in order to achieve and sustain high performance. For DSS queries; Lachesisachieves I/O efficiency nearly equivalent to sequential streaming even in the presence ofcompeting random I/O traffic. In addition; Lachesis simplifies manual configuration andrestores the optimizer's assumptions about the relative costs of different access patternsexpressed in query plans.

ATraPos: Adaptive transaction processing on hardware Islands,Danica Porobic; Erietta Liarou; Pinar Tozun; Anastasia Ailamaki,Nowadays; high-performance transaction processing applications increasingly run onmultisocket multicore servers. Such architectures exhibit non-uniform memory accesslatency as well as non-uniform thread communication costs. Unfortunately; traditional shared-everything database management systems are designed for uniform inter-corecommunication speeds. This causes unpredictable access latencies in the critical path.While lack of data locality may be a minor nuisance on systems with fewer than 4processors; it becomes a serious scalability limitation on larger systems due to accesses tocentralized data structures. In this paper; we propose ATraPos; a storage manager designthat is aware of the non-uniform access latencies of multisocket systems.

TOUCH: in-memory spatial join by hierarchical data-oriented partitioning,Sadegh Nobari; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Panagiotis Karras; Stéphane Bressan; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Efficient spatial joins are pivotal for many applications and particularly important forgeographical information systems or for the simulation sciences where scientists work withspatial models. Past research has primarily focused on disk-based spatial joins; efficient in-memory approaches; however; are important for two reasons: a) main memory has grown solarge that many datasets fit in it and b) the in-memory join is a very time-consuming part of alldisk-based spatial joins. In this paper we develop TOUCH; a novel in-memory spatial joinalgorithm that uses hierarchical data-oriented space partitioning; thereby keeping both itsmemory footprint and the number of comparisons low. Our results show that TOUCHoutperforms known in-memory spatial-join algorithms as well as in-memory implementationsof disk-based join approaches.

Tolerating dependences between large speculative threads via sub-threads,Christopher B Colohan; Anastassia Ailamaki; J Gregory Steffan; Todd C Mowry,Abstract Thread-level speculation (TLS) has proven to be a promising method of extractingparallelism from both integer and scientific workloads; targeting speculative threads thatrange in size from hundreds to several thousand dynamic instructions and have minimaldependences between them. Recent work has shown that TLS can offer compellingperformance improvements for database workloads; but only when targeting much largerspeculative threads of more than 50;000 dynamic instructions per thread; with many frequentdata dependences between them. To support such large and dependent speculativethreads; hardware must be able to buffer the additional speculative state; and must alsoaddress the more challenging problem of tolerating the resulting cross-thread datadependences In this paper we present hardware support for large speculative threads …,ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News,2006,34,15
Adaptive query processing on RAW data,Manos Karpathiotakis; Miguel Branco; Ioannis Alagiannis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Database systems deliver impressive performance for large classes of workloadsas the result of decades of research into optimizing database engines. High performance;however; is achieved at the cost of versatility. In particular; database systems only operateefficiently over loaded data; ie; data converted from its original raw format into the system'sinternal data format. At the same time; data volume continues to increase exponentially anddata varies increasingly; with an escalating number of new formats. The consequence is agrowing impedance mismatch between the original structures holding the data in the rawfiles and the structures used by query engines for efficient processing. In an ideal scenario;the query engine would seamlessly adapt itself to the data and ensure efficient queryprocessing regardless of the input data formats; optimizing itself to each instance of a file …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,33,0
Improving instruction cache performance in OLTP,Stavros Harizopoulos; Anastassia Ailamaki,Instruction-cache misses account for up to 40% of execution time in Online TransactionProcessing (OLTP) database workloads. In contrast to data cache misses; instruction missescannot be overlapped with out-of-order execution. Chip design limitations do not allowincreases in the size or associativity of instruction caches that would help reduce misses. Onthe contrary; the effective instruction cache size is expected to further decrease with theadoption of Multicore and Multithreading chip designs (multiple onchip processor cores andmultiple simultaneous threads per core). Different concurrent database threads; however;execute similar instruction sequences over their lifetime; too long to be captured andexploited in hardware. The challenge; from a software designer's point of view; is to identifyand exploit common code paths across threads executing arbitrary operations; thereby …,ACM transactions on database systems,2006,33,11
Enabling efficient OS paging for main-memory OLTP databases,Radu Stoica; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Even though main memory is becoming large enough to fit most OLTP databases; itmay not always be the best option. OLTP workloads typically exhibit skewed access patternswhere some records are hot (frequently accessed) but many records are cold (infrequentlyor never accessed). Therefore; it is more economical to store the coldest records on a fastsecondary storage device such as a solid-state disk. However; main-memory DBMS have noknowledge of secondary storage; while traditional disk-based databases; designed forworkloads where data resides on HDD; introduce too much overhead for the common casewhere the working set is memory resident. In this paper; we propose a simple and low-overhead technique that enables main-memory databases to efficiently migrate cold data tosecondary storage by relying on the OS's virtual memory paging mechanism. We propose …,Proceedings of the Ninth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2013,32,10
A new look at the roles of spinning and blocking,Ryan Johnson; Manos Athanassoulis; Radu Stoica; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Database engines face growing scalability challenges as core counts exponentiallyincrease each processor generation; and the efficiency of synchronization primitives used toprotect internal data structures is a crucial factor in overall database performance. The trade-offs between different implementation approaches for these primitives shift significantly withincreasing degrees of available hardware parallelism. Blocking synchronization; which haslong been the favored approach in database systems; becomes increasingly unattractive asgrowing core counts expose its bottlenecks. Spinning implementations improve peak systemthroughput by a factor of 2x or more for 64 hardware contexts; but suffer from poorperformance under load. In this paper we analyze the shifting trade-off between spinningand blocking synchronization; and observe that the trade-off can be simplified by isolating …,Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2009,32,10

Clotho: Decoupling memory page layout from storage organization,Minglong Shao; Jiri Schindler; Steven W Schlosser; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract As database application performance depends on the utilization of the memoryhierarchy; smart data placement plays a central role in increasing locality and in improvingmemory utilization. Existing techniques; however; do not optimize accesses to all levels ofthe memory hierarchy and for all the different workloads; because each storage level usesdifferent technology (cache; memory; disks) and each application accesses data usingdifferent patterns. Clotho is a new buffer pool and storage management architecture thatdecouples in-memory page layout from data organization on non-volatile storage devices toenable independent data layout design at each level of the storage hierarchy. Clotho canmaximize cache and memory utilization by (a) transparently using appropriate data layoutsin memory and non-volatile storage; and (b) dynamically synthesizing data pages to …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,32,17
Improving flash write performance by using update frequency,Radu Stoica; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Solid-state drives (SSDs) are quickly becoming the default storage medium as thecost of NAND flash memory continues to drop. However; flash memory introduces newchallenges; as data cannot be eciently updated in-place. To overcome the technology'slimitations; SSDs incorporate a software Flash Translation Layer (FTL) that implements out-of-place updates; typically by storing data in a log-structured fashion. Despite a largenumber of existing FTL algorithms; SSD performance; predictability; and lifetime remain anissue; especially for the write-intensive workloads specific to database applications. In thispaper; we show how to design FTLs that are more efficient by using the I/O write skew toguide data placement on flash memory. We model the relationship between data placementand write performance for basic I/O write patterns and detail the most important concepts …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,30,20
Same queries; different data: Can we predict runtime performance?,Adrian Daniel Popescu; Vuk Ercegovac; Andrey Balmin; Miguel Branco; Anastasia Ailamaki,We consider MapReduce workloads that are produced by analytics applications. In contrastto ad hoc query workloads; analytics applications are comprised of fixed data flows that arerun over newly arriving data sets or on different portions of an existing data set. Examples ofsuch workloads include document analysis/indexing; social media analytics; and ETL(Extract Transform Load). Motivated by these workloads; we propose a technique thatpredicts the runtime performance for a fixed set of queries running over varying input datasets. Our prediction technique splits each query into several segments where eachsegment's performance is estimated using machine learning models. These per-segmentestimates are plugged into a global analytical model to predict the overall query runtime.

Practical off-chip meta-data for temporal memory streaming,Thomas F Wenisch; Michael Ferdman; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi; Andreas Moshovos,Prior research demonstrates that temporal memory streaming and related address-correlating prefetchers improve performance of commercial server workloads thoughincreased memory level parallelism. Unfortunately; these prefetchers require large on-chipmeta-data storage; making previously-proposed designs impractical. Hence; to improvepracticality; researchers have sought ways to enable timely prefetch while locating meta-data entirely off-chip. Unfortunately; current solutions for off-chip meta-data increase memorytraffic by over a factor of three. We observe three requirements to store meta-data off chip:minimal off-chip lookup latency; bandwidth-efficient meta-data updates; and off-chip lookupamortized over many prefetches. In this work; we show:(1) minimal off-chip meta-data lookuplatency can be achieved through a hardware-managed main memory hash table;(2) …,High Performance Computer Architecture; 2009. HPCA 2009.

Improving preemptive prioritization via statistical characterization of OLTP locking,David T McWherter; Bianca Schroeder; Anastassia Ailamaki; Mor Harchol-Balter,OLTP and transactional workloads are increasingly common in computer systems; rangingfrom e-commerce to warehousing to inventory management. It is valuable to provide priorityscheduling in these systems; to reduce the response time for the most important clients; egthe" big spenders". Two-phase locking; commonly used in DBMS; makes prioritizationdifficult; as transactions wait for locks held by others regardless of priority. Common lockscheduling solutions; including non-preemptive priority inheritance and preemptive abort;have performance drawbacks for TPC-C type workloads. The contributions of this paper aretwo-fold:(i) We provide a detailed statistical analysis of locking in TPC-C workloads withpriorities under several common preemptive and non-preemptive lock prioritization policies.We determine why non-preemptive policies fail to sufficiently help high-priority …,Data Engineering; 2005.

Exposing and exploiting internal parallelism in MEMS-based storage,Steven W Schlosser; Jiri Schindler; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract: MEMS-based storage has interesting access parallelism features. Specifically;subsets of a MEMStore's thousands of tips can be used in parallel; and the particular subsetcan be dynamically chosen. This paper describes how such access parallelism can beexposed to system software--with minimal changes to system interfaces--and utilized cleanlyfor two classes of applications. First; background tasks can utilize unused parallelism toaccess media locations with no impact on foreground activity. Second; two-dimensional datastructures; such as dense matrices and relational database tables; can be accessed in bothrow order and column order with maximum efficiency. With proper table layout; unwantedportions of a table can be skipped while scanning at full speed.

Flash in a DBMS: Where and How?,Manos Athanassoulis; Anastasia Ailamaki; Shimin Chen; Phillip Gibbons; Radu Stoica,Abstract Over the past decade; new solid state storage technologies; with flash being themost mature one; have become increasingly popular. Such technologies store data durably;and can alleviate many handicaps of hard disk drives (HDDs). Nonetheless; they have verydifferent characteristics compared to HDDs; making it challenging to integrate suchtechnologies into data intensive systems; such as database management systems (DBMS);that rely heavily on underlying storage behaviors. In this paper; we ask the question: Whereand how will flash be exploited in a DBMS? We describe techniques for making effective useof flash in three contexts:(i) as a log device for transaction processing on memory-residentdata;(ii) as the main data store for transaction processing; and (iii) as an update cache forHDD-resident data warehouses.,IEEE Data Eng.

Just-in-time data virtualization: Lightweight data management with ViDa,Manos Karpathiotakis; Ioannis Alagiannis; Thomas Heinis; Miguel Branco; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT As the size of data and its heterogeneity increase; traditional database systemarchitecture becomes an obstacle to data analysis. Integrating and ingesting (loading) datainto databases is quickly becoming a bottleneck in face of massive data as well asincreasingly heterogeneous data formats. Still; state-of-the-art approaches typically rely oncopying and transforming data into one (or few) repositories. Queries; on the other hand; areoften ad-hoc and supported by pre-cooked operators which are not adaptive enough tooptimize access to data. As data formats and queries increasingly vary; there is a need todepart from the current status quo of static query processing primitives and build dynamic;fully adaptive architectures. We build ViDa; a system which reads data in its raw format andprocesses queries using adaptive; just-in-time operators.

Predicting cost amortization for query services,Debabrata Dash; Georgios Gratsias; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Emerging providers of online services offer access to data collections. Such dataservice providers need to build data structures; eg materialized views and indexes; in orderto offer better performance for user query execution. The cost of such structures is charged tothe user as part of the overall query service cost. In order to ensure the economic viability ofthe provider; the building and maintenance cost of new structures has to be amortized to aset of prospective query services that will use them. This work proposes a novel stochasticmodel that predicts the extent of cost amortization in time and number of services. The modelis completed with a novel method that regresses query traffic statistics and provides input tothe prediction model. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the prediction model; westudy its application on an extension of an existing economy model for the management …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,27,10
MaSM: efficient online updates in data warehouses,Manos Athanassoulis; Shimin Chen; Anastasia Ailamaki; Phillip B Gibbons; Radu Stoica,Abstract Data warehouses have been traditionally optimized for read-only queryperformance; allowing only offline updates at night; essentially trading off data freshness forperformance. The need for 24x7 operations in global markets and the rise of online andother quickly-reacting businesses make concurrent online updates increasingly desirable.Unfortunately; state-of-the-art approaches fall short of supporting fast analysis queries overfresh data. The conventional approach of performing updates in place can dramatically slowdown query performance; while prior proposals using differential updates either requirelarge in-memory buffers or may incur significant update migration cost. This paper presentsa novel approach for supporting online updates in data warehouses that overcomes thelimitations of prior approaches; by making judicious use of available SSDs to cache …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,27,3
Temporal streams in commercial server applications,Thomas F Wenisch; Michael Ferdman; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi; Andreas Moshovos,Commercial server applications remain memory bound on modern multiprocessor systemsbecause of their large data footprints; frequent sharing; complex non-strided accesspatterns; and long chains of dependant misses. To improve memory system performancedespite these challenging access patterns; researchers have proposed prefetchers thatexploit temporal streams—recurring sequences of memory accesses. Although prior studiesshow substantial performance improvement from such schemes; they fail to explain whytemporal streams arise; that is; they treat commercial applications as a black box and do notidentify the specific behaviors that lead to recurring miss sequences. In this paper; weperform an information-theoretic analysis of miss traces from single-chip and multi-chipmultiprocessors to identify recurring temporal streams in web serving; online transaction …,Workload Characterization; 2008.

Critical sections: re-emerging scalability concerns for database storage engines,Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Critical sections in database storage engines impact performance and scalabilitymore as the number of hardware contexts per chip continues to grow exponentially. Withenough threads in the system; some critical section will eventually become a bottleneck.While algorithmic changes are the only long-term solution; they tend to be complex andcostly to develop. Meanwhile; changes in enforcement of critical sections require much lesseffort. We observe that; in practice; many critical sections are so short that enforcing themcontributes a significant or even dominating fraction of their total cost and tuning themdirectly improves database system performance. The contribution of this paper is two-fold:we (a) make a thorough performance comparison of the various synchronization primitivesin the database system developer's toolbox and highlight the best ones for practical use …,Proceedings of the 4th international workshop on Data management on new hardware,2008,26,20
Inspector joins,Shimin Chen; Anastassia Ailamaki; Phillip B Gibbons; Todd C Mowry,Abstract The key idea behind Inspector Joins is that during the I/O partitioning phase of ahash-based join; we have the opportunity to look at the actual data itself and then use thisknowledge in two ways:(1) to create specialized indexes; specific to the given query on thegiven data; for optimizing the CPU cache performance of the subsequent join phase of thealgorithm; and (2) to decide which join phase algorithm best suits this specific query. Weshow how inspector joins; employing novel statistics and specialized indexes; match orexceed the performance of state-of-the-art cache-friendly hash join algorithms. For example;when run on eight or more processors; our experiments show that inspector joins offer 1.1-1.4 X speedups over these previous algorithms; with the speedup increasing as the numberof processors increases.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,26,0
Accelerating range queries for brain simulations,Farhan Tauheed; Laurynas Biveinis; Thomas Heinis; Felix Schurmann; Henry Markram; Anastasia Ailamaki,Neuroscientists increasingly use computational tools in building and simulating models ofthe brain. The amounts of data involved in these simulations are immense and efficientlymanaging this data is key. One particular problem in analyzing this data is the scalableexecution of range queries on spatial models of the brain. Known indexing approaches donot perform well even on today's small models which represent a small fraction of the brain;containing only few millions of densely packed spatial elements. The problem of currentapproaches is that with the increasing level of detail in the models; also the overlap in thetree structure increases; ultimately slowing down query execution. The neuroscientists' needto work with bigger and more detailed (denser) models thus motivates us to develop a newindexing approach. To this end we develop FLAT; a scalable indexing approach for …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,25,20
CoPhy: a scalable; portable; and interactive index advisor for large workloads,Debabrata Dash; Neoklis Polyzotis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Index tuning; ie; selecting the indexes appropriate for a workload; is a crucialproblem in database system tuning. In this paper; we solve index tuning for large probleminstances that are common in practice; eg; thousands of queries in the workload; thousandsof candidate indexes and several hard and soft constraints. Our work is the first to reveal thatthe index tuning problem has a well structured space of solutions; and this space can beexplored efficiently with well known techniques from linear optimization. Experimentalresults demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and researchtechniques by a significant margin (up to an order of magnitude).,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,25,10
Automated physical design in database caches,Tanu Malik; Xiaodan Wang; Randal Burns; Debabrata Dash; Anastasia Ailamaki,Performance of proxy caches for database federations that serve a large number of users iscrucially dependent on its physical design. Current techniques; automated or otherwise; forphysical design depend on the identification of a representative workload. In proxy caches;however; such techniques are inadequate since workload characteristics change rapidly.This is remarkably shown at the proxy cache of SkyQuery; an Astronomy federation; whichreceives a continuously evolving workload. We present novel techniques for automatedphysical design that adapt with the workload and balance the performance benefits ofphysical design decisions with the cost of implementing these decisions. These include bothcompetitive and incremental algorithms that optimize the combined cost of query evaluationand making physical design changes.

A workload-driven unit of cache replacement for mid-tier database caching,Xiaodan Wang; Tanu Malik; Randal Burns; Stratos Papadomanolakis; Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract Making multi-terabyte scientific databases publicly accessible over the Internet isincreasingly important in disciplines such as Biology and Astronomy. However; contention ata centralized; backend database is a major performance bottleneck; limiting the scalability ofInternet-based; database applications. Mid-tier caching reduces contention at the backenddatabase by distributing database operations to the cache. To improve the performance ofmid-tier caches; we propose the caching of query prototypes; a workload-driven unit ofcache replacement in which the cache object is chosen from various classes of queries inthe workload. In existing mid-tier caching systems; the storage organization in the cache isstatically defined. Our approach adapts cache storage to workload changes; requires noprior knowledge about the workload; and is transparent to the application.

Optimistic intra-transaction parallelism on chip multiprocessors,Christopher B Colohan; Anastassia Ailamaki; J Gregory Steffan; Todd C Mowry,Abstract With the advent of chip multiprocessors; exploiting intra-transaction parallelism isan attractive way of improving transaction performance. However; exploiting intra-transaction parallelism in existing database systems is difficult; for two reasons: first;significant changes are required to avoid races or conflicts within the DBMS; and second;adding threads to transactions requires a high level of sophistication from transactionprogrammers. In this paper we show how dividing a transaction into speculative threadssolves both problems---it minimizes the changes required to the DBMS; and the details ofparallelization are hidden from the transaction programmer. Our technique requires a limitednumber of small; localized changes to a subset of the low-level data structures in the DBMS.Through this method of parallelizing transactions we can dramatically improve …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,25,20
Parinda: an interactive physical designer for postgresql,Cristina Maier; Debabrata Dash; Ioannis Alagiannis; Anastasia Ailamaki; Thomas Heinis,Abstract One of the most challenging tasks for the database administrator is to physicallydesign the database to attain optimal performance for a given workload. Physical design ishard because it requires the selection of an optimal set of design features from a vast searchspace. There have been many commercial tools available to automatically suggest thephysical design; for a given a set of queries. These tools are; however; based on greedyheuristic pruning; which reduces their usefulness. Furthermore; they are not interactive; asthe APIs to simulate the indexes and tables are product specific and hidden from thedatabase administrators. Finally; all these tools are built specifically for commercial systemsand there is lack of automated physical designers for open source DBMSs.

Affinity scheduling in staged server architectures,Stavros Harizopoulos; Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract Modern servers typically process request streams by assigning a worker thread to arequest; and rely on a round robin policy for context-switching. Although this programmingparadigm is intuitive; it is oblivious to the execution state and ignores each softwaremodule's affinity to the processor caches. As a result; resumed threads of execution sufferadditional delays due to conflict and compulsory misses while populating the caches withtheir evicted working sets. Alternatively; the staged programming paradigm dividescomputation into stages and allows for stage-based (rather than request thread-based)cohort scheduling that improves module affinity. This technical report introduces (a) fournovel cohort scheduling techniques for staged software servers that follow a “production-line” model of operation; and (b) a mathematical framework to methodically quantify the …,*,2002,24,10
PREDIcT: towards predicting the runtime of large scale iterative analytics,Adrian Daniel Popescu; Andrey Balmin; Vuk Ercegovac; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Machine learning algorithms are widely used today for analytical tasks such as datacleaning; data categorization; or data filtering. At the same time; the rise of social mediamotivates recent uptake in large scale graph processing. Both categories of algorithms aredominated by iterative subtasks; ie; processing steps which are executed repetitively until aconvergence condition is met. Optimizing cluster resource allocations among multipleworkloads of iterative algorithms motivates the need for estimating their runtime; which inturn requires: i) predicting the number of iterations; and ii) predicting the processing time ofeach iteration. As both parameters depend on the characteristics of the dataset and on theconvergence function; estimating their values before execution is difficult.

BF-tree: approximate tree indexing,Manos Athanassoulis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract The increasing volume of time-based generated data and the shift in storagetechnologies suggest that we might need to reconsider indexing. Several workloads-likesocial and service monitoring-often include attributes with implicit clustering because of theirtime-dependent nature. In addition; solid state disks (SSD)(using flash or other low-leveltechnologies) emerge as viable competitors of hard disk drives (HDD). Capacity and accesstimes of storage devices create a trade-off between SSD and HDD. Slow random accessesin HDD have been replaced by efficient random accesses in SSD; but their availablecapacity is one or more orders of magnitude more expensive than the one of HDD. Indexing;however; is designed assuming HDD as secondary storage; thus minimizing randomaccesses at the expense of capacity.

Eliminating unscalable communication in transaction processing,Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Multicore hardware demands software parallelism. Transaction processingworkloads typically exhibit high concurrency; and; thus; provide ample opportunities forparallel execution. Unfortunately; because of the characteristics of the application;transaction processing systems must moderate and coordinate communication betweenindependent agents; since it is notoriously difficult to implement high performing transactionprocessing systems that incur no communication whatsoever. As a result; transactionprocessing systems cannot always convert abundant; even embarrassing; request-levelparallelism into execution parallelism due to communication bottlenecks. Transactionprocessing system designers must therefore find ways to achieve scalability while stillallowing communication to occur. To this end; we identify three forms of communication in …,The VLDB Journal,2014,22,11
Slicc: Self-assembly of instruction cache collectives for oltp workloads,Islam Atta; Pinar Tozun; Anastasia Ailamaki; Andreas Moshovos,Abstract Online transaction processing (OLTP) is at the core of many data centerapplications. OLTP workloads are known to have large instruction footprints that foil existingL1 instruction caches resulting in poor overall performance. Prefetching can reduce theimpact of such instruction cache miss stalls; however; state-of-the-art solutions require largededicated hardware tables on the order of 40KB in size. SLICC is a programmer transparent;low cost technique to minimize instruction cache misses when executing OLTP workloads.SLICC migrates threads; spreading their instruction footprint over several L1 caches.

Sharing data and work across concurrent analytical queries,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Manos Athanassoulis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Today's data deluge enables organizations to collect massive data; and analyze itwith an ever-increasing number of concurrent queries. Traditional data warehouses (DW)face a challenging problem in executing this task; due to their query-centric model: eachquery is optimized and executed independently. This model results in high contention forresources. Thus; modern DW depart from the query-centric model to execution modelsinvolving sharing of common data and work. Our goal is to show when and how a DWshould employ sharing. We evaluate experimentally two sharing methodologies; based ontheir original prototype systems; that exploit work sharing opportunities among concurrentqueries at run-time: Simultaneous Pipelining (SP); which shares intermediate results ofcommon sub-plans; and Global Query Plans (GQP); which build and evaluate a single …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,21,1
Task scheduling for highly concurrent analytical and transactional main-memory workloads,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Tobias Scheuer; Norman May; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Task scheduling typically employs a worker thread per hardware context toprocess a dynamically changing set of tasks. It is an appealing solution to exploit modernmulti-core processors; as it eases parallelization and avoids unnecessary context switchesand their associated costs. Naıvely bundling DBMS operations into tasks; however; canresult in sub-optimal usage of CPU resources: highly contending transactional workloadsinvolve blocking tasks. Moreover; analytical queries assume they can use all availableresources while issuing tasks; resulting in an excessive number of tasks and anunnecessary associated scheduling overhead. In this paper; we show how to overcomethese problems and exploit the performance benefits of task scheduling for main-memoryDBMS. Firstly; we use application knowledge about blocking tasks to dynamically adapt …,Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Accelerating Data Management Systems Using Modern Processor and Storage Architectures (ADMS 2013),2013,21,0
Database architectures for new hardware,Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract Thirty years ago; DBMS stored data on disks and cached recently used data in mainmemory buffer pools; while designers worried about improving I/O performance andmaximizing main memory utilization. Today; however; databases live in multi-level memoryhierarchies that include disks; main memories; and several levels of processor caches. Four(often correlated) factors have shifted the performance bottleneck of data-intensivecommercial workloads from I/O to the processor and memory subsystem. First; storagesystems are becoming faster and more intelligent (now disks come complete with their ownprocessors and caches). Second; modern database storage managers aggressivelyimprove locality through clustering; hide I/O latencies using prefetching; and parallelize diskaccesses using data striping. Third; main memories have become much larger and often …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,21,20
Scaling up concurrent main-memory column-store scans: towards adaptive NUMA-aware data and task placement,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Tobias Scheuer; Norman May; Abdelkader Sellami; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Main-memory column-stores are called to efficiently use modern non-uniformmemory access (NUMA) architectures to service concurrent clients on big data. The efficientusage of NUMA architectures depends on the data placement and scheduling strategy of thecolumn-store. Most column-stores choose a static strategy that involves partitioning all dataacross the NUMA architecture; and employing a stealing-based task scheduler. In thispaper; we implement different strategies for data placement and task scheduling for the caseof concurrent scans. We compare these strategies with an extensive sensitivity analysis. Ourmost significant findings include that unnecessary partitioning can hurt throughput by up to70%; and that stealing memory-intensive tasks can hurt throughput by up to 58%. Based onour analysis; we envision a design that adapts the data placement and task scheduling …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,20,3
Scalable and dynamically balanced shared-everything OLTP with physiological partitioning,Pınar Tözün; Ippokratis Pandis; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Scaling the performance of shared-everything transaction processing systems tohighly parallel multicore hardware remains a challenge for database system designers.Recent proposals alleviate locking and logging bottlenecks in the system; leaving pagelatching as the next potential problem. To tackle the page latching problem; we proposephysiological partitioning (PLP). PLP applies logical-only partitioning; maintaining thedesired properties of sharedeverything designs; and introduces a multi-rooted B+ Tree indexstructure (MRBTree) that enables the partitioning of the accesses at the physical page level.Logical partitioning and MRBTrees together ensure that all accesses to a given index pagecome from a single thread and; hence; can be entirely latch free; an extended design makesheap page accesses thread private as well. Moreover; MRBTrees offer an infrastructure …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2013,20,20
Store-ordered streaming of shared memory,Thomas F Wenisch; Stephen Somogyi; Nikolaos Hardavellas; Jangwoo Kim; Chris Gniady; Anastassia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,Coherence misses in shared-memory multiprocessors account for a substantial fraction ofexecution time in many important scientific and commercial workloads. Memory streamingprovides a promising solution to the coherence miss bottleneck because it improves memorylevel parallelism and lookahead while using on-chip resources efficiently. We observe thatthe order in which shared data are consumed by one processor is correlated to the order inwhich they were produced by another. We investigate this phenomenon and demonstratethat it can be exploited to send store-ordered streams (SORDS) of shared data fromproducers to consumers; thereby eliminating coherent read misses. Using a trace-drivenanalysis of all user and OS memory references in a cache-coherent distributed shared-memory multiprocessor; we show that SORDS-based memory streaming can eliminate …,Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques; 2005.

A case for specialized processors for scale-out workloads,Michael Ferdman; Almutaz Adileh; Onur Kocberber; Stavros Volos; Mohammad Alisafaee; Djordje Jevdjic; Cansu Kaynak; Adrian Daniel Popescu; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,Emerging scale-out workloads need extensive amounts of computational resources.However; datacenters using modern server hardware face physical constraints in space andpower; limiting further expansion and requiring improvements in the computational densityper server and in the per-operation energy. Continuing to improve the computationalresources of the cloud while staying within physical constraints mandates optimizing serverefficiency. In this work; we demonstrate that modern server processors are highly inefficientfor running cloud workloads. To address this problem; we investigate the microarchitecturalbehavior of scale-out workloads and present opportunities to enable specialized processordesigns that closely match the needs of the cloud.,IEEE Micro,2014,18,21
Near-optimal cache block placement with reactive nonuniform cache architectures,Nikos Hardavellas; Michael Ferdman; Babak Falsafi; Anastasia Ailamaki,The growing core counts and caches of modern processors result in data access latencybecoming a function of the data's physical location in the cache. Thus; the placement ofcache blocks determines the cache's performance. Reactive nonuniform cache architectures(R-NUCA) achieve near-optimal cache block placement by classifying blocks online andplacing data close to the cores that use them.,IEEE micro,2010,18,10
Invalidation clues for database scalability services,Amit Manjhi; Phillip B Gibbons; Anastassia Ailamaki; Charles Garrod; Bruce M Maggs; Todd C Mowry; Christopher Olston; Anthony Tomasic; Haifeng Yu,For their scalability needs; data-intensive Web applications can use a database scalabilityservice (DBSS); which caches applications' query results and answers queries on theirbehalf. One way for applications to address their security/privacy concerns when using aDBSS is to encrypt all data that passes through the DBSS. Doing so; however; causes theDBSS to invalidate large regions of its cache when data updates occur. To invalidate moreprecisely; the DBSS needs help in order to know which results to invalidate; such helpinevitably reveals some properties about the data. In this paper; we present invalidationclues; a general technique that enables applications to reveal little data to the DBSS; yetlimit the number of unnecessary invalidations. Compared with previous approaches;invalidation clues provide applications significantly improved tradeoffs between security …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Simultaneous scalability and security for data-intensive web applications,Amit Manjhi; Anastassia Ailamaki; Bruce M Maggs; Todd C Mowry; Christopher Olston; Anthony Tomasic,Abstract For Web applications in which the database component is the bottleneck; scalabilitycan be provided by a third-party Database Scalability Service Provider (DSSP) that cachesapplication data and supplies query answers on behalf of the application. Cost-effectiveDSSPs will need to cache data from many applications; inevitably raising concerns aboutsecurity. However; if all data passing through a DSSP is encrypted to enhance security; thendata updates trigger invalidation of large regions of cache. Consequently; achieving goodscalability becomes virtually impossible. There is a tradeoff between security and scalability;which requires careful consideration. In this paper we study the security-scalability tradeoff;both formally and empirically. We begin by providing a method for statically identifyingsegments of the database that can be encrypted without impacting scalability …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,18,14
STREX: boosting instruction cache reuse in OLTP workloads through stratified transaction execution,Islam Atta; Pinar Tözün; Xin Tong; Anastasia Ailamaki; Andreas Moshovos,Abstract Online transaction processing (OLTP) workload performance suffers frominstruction stalls; the instruction footprint of a typical transaction exceeds by far the capacityof an L1 cache; leading to ongoing cache thrashing. Several proposed techniques removesome instruction stalls in exchange for error-prone instrumentation to the code base; or asharp increase in the L1-I cache unit area and power. Others reduce instruction miss latencyby better utilizing a shared L2 cache. SLICC [2]; a recently proposed thread migrationtechnique that exploits transaction instruction locality; is promising for high core counts butperforms sub-optimally or may hurt performance when running on few cores. This papercorroborates that OLTP transactions exhibit significant intra-and inter-thread overlap in theirinstruction footprint; and analyzes the instruction stall reduction benefits.

Scaling up mixed workloads: a battle of data freshness; flexibility; and scheduling,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Florian Wolf; Norman May; Thomas Neumann; Alexander Böhm; Anastasia Ailamaki; Kai-Uwe Sattler,Abstract The common “one size does not fit all” paradigm isolates transactional andanalytical workloads into separate; specialized database systems. Operational data isperiodically replicated to a data warehouse for analytics. Competitiveness of enterprisestoday; however; depends on real-time reporting on operational data; necessitating anintegration of transactional and analytical processing in a single database system. Themixed workload should be able to query and modify common data in a shared schema. Thedatabase needs to provide performance guarantees for transactional workloads; and; at thesame time; efficiently evaluate complex analytical queries.

CMP support for large and dependent speculative threads,Christopher B Colohan; Anastasia Ailamaki; Gregory Steffan; Todd C Mowry,Thread-level speculation (TLS) has proven to be a promising method of extractingparallelism from both integer and scientific workloads; targeting speculative threads thatrange in size from hundreds to several thousand dynamic instructions and which haveminimal dependences between them. However; recent work has shown that TLS can offercompelling performance improvements when targeting much larger speculative threads ofmore than 50;000 dynamic instructions per thread with many frequent data dependencesbetween them. To support such large and dependent speculative threads; the hardwaremust be able to buffer the additional speculative state and must also address the morechallenging problem of tolerating the resulting cross-thread data dependences.

Fast queries over heterogeneous data through engine customization,Manos Karpathiotakis; Ioannis Alagiannis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Industry and academia are continuously becoming more data-driven and data-intensive; relying on the analysis of a wide variety of heterogeneous datasets to gaininsights. The different data models and formats pose a significant challenge on performinganalysis over a combination of diverse datasets. Serving all queries using a single; general-purpose query engine is slow. On the other hand; using a specialized engine for eachheterogeneous dataset increases complexity: queries touching a combination of datasetsrequire an integration layer over the different engines. This paper presents a system designthat natively supports heterogeneous data formats and also minimizes query executiontimes. For multi-format support; the design uses an expressive query algebra which enablesoperations over various data models. For minimal execution times; it uses a code …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,15,0

Throughout the evolution of the structures andtechniques used to access data; access methods adapt to the ever changing hardware andworkload requirements. Today; even small changes in the workload or the hardware lead toa redesign of access methods. The need for new designs has been increasing as datageneration and workload diversification grow exponentially; and hardware advancesintroduce increased complexity. New workload requirements are introduced by theemergence of new applications; and data is managed by large systems composed of moreand more complex and heterogeneous hardware. As a result; it is increasingly important todevelop application-aware and hardware-aware access methods. The fundamental …,EDBT,2016,15,0

NoDB in action: adaptive query processing on raw data,Ioannis Alagiannis; Renata Borovica; Miguel Branco; Stratos Idreos; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract As data collections become larger and larger; users are faced with increasingbottlenecks in their data analysis. More data means more time to prepare the data; to loadthe data into the database and to execute the desired queries. Many applications alreadyavoid using traditional database systems; eg; scientific data analysis and social networks;due to their complexity and the increased data-to-query time; ie the time between getting thedata and retrieving its first useful results. For many applications data collections keepgrowing fast; even on a daily basis; and this data deluge will only increase in the future;where it is expected to have much more data than what we can move or store; let aloneanalyze.

SCOUT: prefetching for latent structure following queries,Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Felix Schürmann; Henry Markram; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Today's scientists are quickly moving from in vitro to in silico experimentation: theyno longer analyze natural phenomena in a petri dish; but instead they build models andsimulate them. Managing and analyzing the massive amounts of data involved insimulations is a major task. Yet; they lack the tools to efficiently work with data of this size.One problem many scientists share is the analysis of the massive spatial models they build.For several types of analysis they need to interactively follow the structures in the spatialmodel; eg; the arterial tree; neuron fibers; etc.; and issue range queries along the way. Eachquery takes long to execute; and the total time for executing a sequence of queriessignificantly delays data analysis. Prefetching the spatial data reduces the response timeconsiderably; but known approaches do not prefetch with high accuracy.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,14,20

An automated; yet interactive and portable DB designer,Ioannis Alagiannis; Debabrata Dash; Karl Schnaitter; Anastasia Ailamaki; Neoklis Polyzotis,Abstract Tuning tools attempt to configure a database to achieve optimal performance for agiven workload. Selecting an optimal set of physical structures is computationally hard sinceit involves searching a vast space of possible configurations. Commercial DBMSs offer toolsthat can address this problem. The usefulness of such tools; however; is limited by theirdependence on greedy heuristics; the need for a-priori (offline) knowledge of the workload;and lack of an optimal materialization schedule to get the best out of suggested designfeatures. Moreover; the open source DBMSs do not provide any automated tuning tools. Thisdemonstration introduces a comprehensive physical designer for the PostgreSQL opensource DBMS.

MultiMap: Preserving disk locality for multidimensional datasets,Minglong Shao; Steven W Schlosser; Stratos Papadomanolakis; Jiri Schindler; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory R Ganger,MultiMap is an algorithm for mapping multidimensional datasets so as to preserve the data'sspatial locality on disks. Without revealing disk-specific details to applications; MultiMapexploits modern disk characteristics to provide full streaming bandwidth for one (primary)dimension and maximally efficient non-sequential access (ie; minimal seek and no rotationallatency) for the other dimensions. This is in contrast to existing approaches; which eitherseverely penalize non-primary dimensions or fail to provide full streaming bandwidth for anydimension. Experimental evaluation of a prototype implementation demonstrates MultiMap'ssuperior performance for range and beam queries. On average; MultiMap reduces total I/Otime by over 50% when compared to traditional linearized layouts and by over 30% whencompared to space-filling curve approaches such as Z-ordering and Hilbert curves.

Concurrentqueries often exhibit high data and computation overlap; eg; they access the same relationson disk; compute similar aggregates; or share intermediate results. Unfortunately; run-timesharing in modern database engines is limited by the paradigm of invoking an independentset of operator instances per query; potentially missing sharing opportunities if the bufferpool evicts data early.,Data Engineering; 2006.

Smooth scan: Statistics-oblivious access paths,Renata Borovica-Gajic; Stratos Idreos; Anastasia Ailamaki; Marcin Zukowski; Campbell Fraser,Query optimizers depend heavily on statistics representing column distributions to createefficient query plans. In many cases; though; statistics are outdated or non-existent; and theprocess of refreshing statistics is very expensive; especially for ad-hoc workloads on everbigger data. This results in suboptimal plans that severely hurt performance. The mainproblem is that any decision; once made by the optimizer; is fixed throughout the executionof a query. In particular; each logical operator translates into a fixed choice of a physicaloperator at run-time. In this paper; we advocate for continuous adaptation and morphing ofphysical operators throughout their lifetime; by adjusting their behavior in accordance withthe statistical properties of the data. We demonstrate the benefits of the new paradigm bydesigning and implementing an adaptive access path operator called Smooth Scan …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,11,20
Dynamic fine-grained scheduling for energy-efficient main-memory queries,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Thomas Kissinger; Danica Porobic; Thomas Ilsche; Erietta Liarou; Pınar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki; Wolfgang Lehner,Abstract Power and cooling costs are some of the highest costs in data centers today; whichmake improvement in energy efficiency crucial. Energy efficiency is also a major designpoint for chips that power whole ranges of computing devices. One important goal in thisarea is energy proportionality; arguing that the system's power consumption should beproportional to its performance. Currently; a major trend among server processors; whichstems from the design of chips for mobile devices; is the inclusion of advanced powermanagement techniques; such as dynamic voltage-frequency scaling; clock gating; andturbo modes. A lot of recent work on energy efficiency of database management systems isfocused on coarse-grained power management at the granularity of multiple machines andwhole queries.

To betterintegrate OLTP and hardware in future systems; we perform a detailed analysis of instructionand data misses; the main causes of memory stalls.

Scalable consistency management for web database caches,Charles Garrod; Amit Manjhi; Anastassia Ailamaki; Phil Gibbons; Bruce M Maggs; Todd Mowry; Christopher Olston; Anthony Tomasic,Abstract We have built a prototype of a scalable dynamic web-content delivery system;which we call S3. Initial experiments with S3 led us to conclude that the key to achievingscalability lay in reducing the workload on back-end databases. S3 utilizes proxy servers togenerate dynamic content and cache the results of queries forwarded to the back-enddatabase. This approach introduces the challenge of maintaining cache consistency whenthe database is updated. In this paper we introduce a fully-distributed consistencymanagement infrastructure that uses a scalable publish/subscribe substrate to propagateupdate notifications. We use static analysis of the database workload to introduce severaldesign alternatives for how to map database requests to publish/subscribe groups.

Extending database task schedulers for multi-threaded application code,Florian Wolf; Iraklis Psaroudakis; Norman May; Anastasia Ailamaki; Kai-Uwe Sattler,Abstract Modern databases can run application logic defined in stored procedures inside thedatabase server to improve application speed. The SQL standard specifies how to callexternal stored routines implemented in programming languages; such as C; C++; or JAVA;to complement declarative SQL-based application logic. This is beneficial for scientific andanalytical algorithms because they are usually too complex to be implemented entirely inSQL. At the same time; database applications like matrix calculations or data miningalgorithms benefit from multi-threading to parallelize compute-intensive operations.

Today scientistsstudy natural phenomena by first building massive three-dimensional spatial models andthen by simulating the models at discrete intervals of time to mimic the behavior of naturalphenomena. One frequently occurring challenge during simulations is the repeatedcomputation of spatial self-joins of the model at each simulation time step. The join isperformed to access a group of neighboring spatial objects (groups of particles; moleculesor cosmological objects) so that scientists can calculate the cumulative effect (likegravitational force) on an object.

A data-oriented transaction execution engine and supporting tools,Ippokratis Pandis; Pinar Tözün; Miguel Branco; Dimitris Karampinas; Danica Porobic; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Conventional OLTP systems assign each transaction to a worker thread and thatthread accesses data; depending on what the transaction dictates. This thread-to-transactionwork assignment policy leads to unpredictable accesses. The unpredictability forces eachthread to enter a large number of critical sections for the completion of even the simplest ofthe transactions; leading to poor performance and scalability on modern manycorehardware. This demonstration highlights the chaotic access patterns of conventional OLTPdesigns which are the source of scalability problems. Then; it presents a working prototypeof a transaction processing engine that follows a non-conventional architecture; called data-oriented or DORA.

Adaptive query execution for data management in the cloud,Adrian Daniel Popescu; Debabrata Dash; Verena Kantere; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract A major component of many cloud services is query processing on data stored inthe underlying cloud cluster.

These techniques however; cannot guarantee highperformance for cloud; parallel DBMS lack adequate fault tolerance mechanisms in order todeal with non-negligible software and hardware failures. MapReduce; on the other hand;allows query processing solutions that are fault tolerant; but imposes substantial overheads.In this paper; we propose an adaptive software architecture which can effortlessly switchbetween MapReduce and parallel DBMS in order to efficiently process queries regardless oftheir response times.

ADDICT: advanced instruction chasing for transactions,Pinar Tözün; Islam Atta; Anastasia Ailamaki; Andreas Moshovos,Abstract Recent studies highlight that traditional transaction processing systems utilize themicro-architectural features of modern processors very poorly. L1 instruction cache and long-latency data misses dominate execution time. As a result; more than half of the executioncycles are wasted on memory stalls. Previous works on reducing stall time aim at improvinglocality through either hardware or software techniques. However; exploiting hardwareresources based on the hints given by the software-side has not been widely studied fordata management systems.

Challenges and opportunities in self-managing scientific databases,Thomas Heinis; Miguel Branco; Ioannis Alagiannis; Renata Borovica; Farhan Tauheed; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Advances in observation instruments and abundance of computational power forsimulations encourage scientists to gather and produce unprecedented amounts ofincreasingly complex data. Organizing data automatically to enable efficient andunobstructed access is pivotal for the scientists. Organizing these vast amounts of complexdata; however; is particularly difficult for scientists who have little experience in datamanagement; hence they spend considerable amounts of time dealing with data analysisand computing problems rather than answering scientific questions or developing newhypotheses. Therefore scientific experiments are in many ways ideal targets for research inself-managing database systems.

Incrementally parallelizing database transactions with thread-level speculation,Christopher B Colohan; Anastassia Ailamaki; J Gregory Steffan; Todd C Mowry,Abstract With the advent of chip multiprocessors; exploiting intratransaction parallelism indatabase systems is an attractive way of improving transaction performance. However;exploiting intratransaction parallelism is difficult for two reasons: first; significant changes arerequired to avoid races or conflicts within the DBMS; and second; adding threads totransactions requires a high level of sophistication from transaction programmers. In thisarticle we show how dividing a transaction into speculative threads solves both problems—itminimizes the changes required to the DBMS; and the details of parallelization are hiddenfrom the transaction programmer.

Observer: keeping system models from becoming obsolete,Eno Thereska; Dushyanth Narayanan; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract To be effective for automation; in practice; system models used for performanceprediction and behavior checking must be robust. They must be able to cope withcomponent upgrades; misconfigurations; and workload-system interactions that were notanticipated. This paper promotes making models self-evolving; such that they continuouslyevaluate their accuracy and adjust their predictions accordingly. Such self-evaluation alsoenables confidence values to be provided with predictions; including identification ofsituations where no trustworthy prediction can be produced. With a combination ofexpectation-based and observationbased techniques; we believe that such self-evolvingmodels can be achieved and used as a robust foundation for tuning; problem diagnosis;capacity planning; and administration tasks.,Workshop on hot topics in autonomic computing (HotAC),2007,7,0
Adaptive NUMA-aware data placement and task scheduling for analytical workloads in main-memory column-stores,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Tobias Scheuer; Norman May; Abdelkader Sellami; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures pose numerous performancechallenges for main-memory column-stores in scaling up analytics on modern multi-socketmulti-core servers. A NUMA-aware execution engine needs a strategy for data placementand task scheduling that prefers fast local memory accesses over remote memory accesses;and avoids an imbalance of resource utilization; both CPU and memory bandwidth; acrosssockets. State-of-the-art systems typically use a static strategy that always partitions dataacross sockets; and always allows inter-socket task stealing. In this paper; we show thatadapting data placement and task stealing to the workload can improve throughput by up toa factor of 4 compared to a static approach. We focus on highly concurrent workloadsdominated by operators working on a single table or table group (copartitioned tables) …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,6,10
How to stop under-utilization and love multicores,Anastasia Ailamaki; Erietta Liarou; Pınar Tözün; Danica Porobic; Iraklis Psaroudakis,Hardware trends oblige software to overcome three major challenges against systemsscalability:(1) taking advantage of the implicit/vertical parallelism within a core that isenabled through the aggressive micro-architectural features;(2) exploiting theexplicit/horizontal parallelism provided by multicores; and (3) achieving predictively efficientexecution despite the variability in communication latencies among cores on multisocketmulticores. In this three hour tutorial; we shed light on the above three challenges andsurvey recent proposals to alleviate them. The first part of the tutorial describes theinstruction-and data-level parallelism opportunities in a core coming from the hardware andsoftware side.

Scaling the memory power wall with dram-aware data management,Raja Appuswamy; Matthaios Olma; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Improving the energy efficiency of database systems has emerged as an importanttopic of research over the past few years. While significant attention has been paid tooptimizing the power consumption of tradition disk-based databases; little attention hasbeen paid to the growing cost of DRAM power consumption in main-memory databases(MMDB). In this paper; we bridge this divide by examining power--performance tradeoffsinvolved in designing MMDBs. In doing so; we first show how DRAM will soon emerge asthe dominating source of power consumption in emerging MMDB servers unlike traditionaldatabase servers; where CPU power consumption overshadows that of DRAM. Second; weshow that using DRAM frequency scaling and power-down modes can provide substantialimprovement in performance/Watt under both transactional and analytical workloads.

OCTOPUS: Efficient query execution on dynamic mesh datasets,Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Felix Schurmann; Henry Markram; Anastasia Ailamaki,Scientists in many disciplines use spatial mesh models to study physical phenomena.Simulating natural phenomena by changing meshes over time helps to better understandthe phenomena. The higher the precision of the mesh models; the more insight do thescientists gain and they thus continuously increase the detail of the meshes and build themas detailed as their instruments and the simulation hardware allow. In the process; the datavolume also increases; slowing down the execution of spatial range queries needed tomonitor the simulation considerably. Indexing speeds up range query execution; but theoverhead to maintain the indexes is considerable because almost the entire mesh changesunpredictably at every simulation step. Using a simple linear scan; on the other hand;requires accessing the entire mesh and the performance deteriorates as the size of the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,5,20
Scaling up analytical queries with column-stores,Ioannis Alagiannis; Manos Athanassoulis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract As data analytics is used by an increasing number of applications; data analyticsengines are required to execute workloads with increased concurrency; ie; an increasingnumber of clients submitting queries. Data management systems designed for data analytics-a market dominated by column-stores-however; were initially optimized for single queryexecution; minimizing its response time. Hence; they do not treat concurrency as a first classcitizen. In this paper; we experiment with one open-source and two commercial column-stores using the TPC-H and SSB benchmarks in a setup with an increasing number ofconcurrent clients submitting queries; focusing on whether the tested systems can scale upin a single node instance. The tested systems for in-memory workloads scale up; to somedegree; however; when the server is saturated they fail to fully exploit the available …,Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Testing Database Systems,2013,5,19
Automated physical designers: what you see is (not) what you get,Renata Borovica; Ioannis Alagiannis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract The explosion of available data in the last few years has increased the importanceof physical database design; since the selection of proper physical structures (eg indices;partitions and materialized views) may improve query execution performance by severalorders of magnitude. Commercial DBMS vendors have recognized this need and offeredautomated physical design tools as part of their products. These tools use what-if interfacesto simulate the presence of different physical structures and recommend physical designsthat minimize the estimated execution time of a given workload. Along with therecommended design; they deliver an estimation of the expected improvement the newdesign brings. In this paper; we examine the output of physical designers; ie; whether whatwe see as a result of the tuning (the estimation of the improvement) is indeed what we …,Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Testing Database Systems,2012,5,10
Information management in the cloud (dagstuhl seminar 11321),Anastasia Ailamaki; Michael J Carey; Donald Kossman; Steve Loughran; Volker Markl,Abstract Cloud computing is emerging as a new paradigm for highly scalable; fault-tolerant;and adaptable computing on large clusters of off-the-shelf computers. Cloud architecturesstrive to massively parallelize complex processing tasks through a computational modelmotivated by functional programming. They provide highly available storage and computecapacity through distribution and redundancy. Most importantly; Cloud architectures adapt tochanging requirements by dynamically provisioning new (virtualized) compute or storagenodes. Economies of scale enable cloud providers to provide compute and storage powersto a multitude of users.

Time for our field to grow up,Anastassia Ailamaki; Laura Haas; HV Jagadish; David Maier; Tamer Özsu; Marianne Winslett,Abstract Compared to centuries of physics and millennia of mathematics; the 50-year-historyof computer science and information management research makes us the toddlers of thescientific community. Yet during our brief existence; we've revolutionized the world and; notcontent with that; gone on to build and study virtual worlds. We have justly taken pride in ouraccomplishments; and developed our own unique way of conducting research; unlike otherscientific and engineering fields. But cracks have appeared in this edifice we have built. Theconference system that served us so well for our first 50 years is falling apart. Our ever-increasing population competes ever more energetically for a finite set of resources.

Parallel depth first vs. work stealing schedulers on CMP architectures,Vasileios Liaskovitis; Shimin Chen; Phillip B Gibbons; Anastassia Ailamaki; Guy E Blelloch; Babak Falsafi; Limor Fix; Nikos Hardavellas; Michael Kozuch; Todd C Mowry; Chris Wilkerson,Abstract In chip multiprocessors (CMPs); limiting the number of off-chip cache misses iscrucial for good performance. Many multithreaded programs provide opportunities forconstructive cache sharing; in which concurrently scheduled threads share a largelyoverlapping working set. In this brief announcement; we highlight our ongoing study [4]comparing the performance of two schedulers designed for fine-grained multithreadedprograms: Parallel Depth First (PDF)[2]; which is designed for constructive sharing; andWork Stealing (WS)[3]; which takes a more traditional approach.

Logs and lifeguards: Accelerating dynamic program monitoring,Shimin Chen; Babak Falsafi; PB Gibbons; M Kozuch; TC Mowry; R Teodorescu; A Ailamaki; L Fix; GR Ganger; SW Schlosser,Abstract Runtime monitoring tools are invaluable for detecting various types of bugs; in bothsequential and multi-threaded programs. However; running one of these tools slows downthe monitored program by an order of magnitude or more; thereby limiting the tool'susefulness. Fortunately; the emergence of chip multiprocessors as a dominant computingplatform means that resources are available on-chip to assist in monitoring tasks. This paperpresents an architecture for exploiting such resources in order to dramatically reduce theoverheads for runtime program monitoring. Specifically; we propose adding hardwaresupport for logging a main program's trace and delivering it to another (otherwise idle)processor for inspection. A lifeguard program running on this other processor executes thedesired monitoring task. Simulation results using three diverse lifeguards (for address …,*,2006,5,20
The Case For Heterogeneous HTAP,Raja Appuswamy; Manos Karpathiotakis; Danica Porobic; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Modern database engines balance the demanding requirements of mixed;hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) workloads by relying on i) globalshared memory; ii) system-wide cache coherence; and iii) massive parallelism. Thus;database engines are typically deployed on multi-socket multi-cores; which have been theonly platform to support all three aspects. Two recent trends; however; indicate that thesehardware assumptions will be invalidated in the near future. First; hardware vendors havestarted exploring alternate non-cache-coherent shared-memory multi-core designs due toescalating complexity in maintaining coherence across hundreds of cores. Second; asGPGPUs overcome programmability; performance; and interfacing limitations; they arebeing increasingly adopted by emerging servers to expose heterogeneous parallelism.

BLOCK: Efficient Execution of Spatial Range Queries in Main-Memory,Matthaios Alexandros Olma; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT The execution of spatial range queries is at the core of many applications;particularly in the simulation sciences but also in many other domains. Although mainmemory in desktop and supercomputers alike has grown considerably in recent years; mostspatial indexes supporting the efficient execution of range queries are still only optimized fordisk access (minimizing disk page reads). Recent research has primarily focused on theoptimization of known disk-based approaches for memory (through cache alignment etc.)but has not fundamentally revisited index structures for memory. In this paper we developBLOCK; a novel approach to execute range queries on spatial data featuring volumetricobjects in main memory. Our approach is built on the key insight that in-memory approachesneed to be optimized to reduce the number of intersection tests (between objects and …,*,2017,4,19
Databases and hardware: The beginning and sequel of a beautiful friendship,Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Fast query and transaction processing is the goal of 40 years of database researchand the reason of existence for many new database system architectures. In datamanagement; system performance means acceptable response time and throughput oncritical-path operations; ideally with scalability guarantees. Performance is improved with top-of-the line research on data processing algorithms; efficiency; however; is contingent onseamless collaboration between the database software and hardware and storage devices.In 1980; the goal was to minimize disk accesses; in 2000; memory replaced disks in terms ofaccess costs. Nowadays performance is synonymous to scalability; scalability; in turn;translates into sustainable and predictable use of hardware resources in the face ofembarrassing parallelism and deep storage hierarchies while minimizing energy needs-a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,4,17
Toward scalable transaction processing: evolution of shore-MT,Anastasia Ailamaki; Ryan Johnson; Ippokratis Pandis; Pínar Tözün,Abstract Designing scalable transaction processing systems on modern multicore hardwarehas been a challenge for almost a decade. The typical characteristics of transactionprocessing workloads lead to a high degree of unbounded communication on multicores forconventional system designs. In this tutorial; we initially present a systematic way ofeliminating scalability bottlenecks of a transaction processing system; which is based onminimizing the unbounded communication. Then; we show several techniques that applythe presented methodology to minimize logging; locking; latching etc. related bottlenecks oftransaction processing systems. In parallel; we demonstrate the internals of the Shore-MTstorage manager and how they have evolved over the years in terms of scalability onmulticore hardware through such techniques.

GIPSY: joining spatial datasets with contrasting density,Mirjana Pavlovic; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamakit,Abstract Many scientific and geographical applications rely on the efficient execution ofspatial joins. Past research has produced several efficient spatial join approaches and whileeach of them can join two datasets; the problem of efficiently joining two datasets withcontrasting density; ie; with the same spatial extent but with a wildly different number ofspatial elements; has so far been overlooked. State-of-the-art data-oriented spatial joinapproaches (eg; based on the R-Tree) suffer from degraded performance due to overlap;whereas space-oriented approaches excessively read data from disk. In this paper wedevelop GIPSY; a novel approach for the spatial join of two datasets with contrasting density.GIPSY uses fine-grained data-oriented partitioning and thus only retrieves the data neededfor the join.

Data-driven neuroscience: enabling breakthroughs via innovative data management,Alexandros Stougiannis; Mirjana Pavlovic; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Scientists in all disciplines increasingly rely on simulations to develop a betterunderstanding of the subject they are studying. For example the neuroscientists wecollaborate with in the Blue Brain project have started to simulate the brain on asupercomputer. The level of detail of their models is unprecedented as they model details onthe subcellular level (eg; the neurotransmitter). This level of detail; however; also leads to atrue data deluge and the neuroscientists have only few tools to efficiently analyze the data.This demonstration showcases three innovative spatial management techniques that havesubstantial impact on computational neuroscience and other disciplines in that they allow tobuild; analyze and simulate bigger and more detailed models.

Towards predicting the runtime of iterative analytics with predict,Adrian Daniel Popescu; Andrey Balmin; Vuk Ercegovac; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Machine learning algorithms are widely used today for analytical tasks such asdata cleaning; data categorization; or data filtering. At the same time; the rise of social mediamotivates recent uptake in large scale graph processing. Both categories of algorithms aredominated by iterative subtasks; ie; processing steps which are executed repetitively until aconvergence condition is met. Optimizing cluster resource allocations among multipleworkloads of iterative algorithms motivates the need for estimating their runtime; which inturn requires: i) predicting the number of iterations; and ii) predicting the processing time ofeach iteration. As both parameters depend on the characteristics of the dataset and on theconvergence function; estimating their values before execution is difficult.

Reducing OLTP instruction misses with thread migration,Islam Atta; Pinar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki; Andreas Moshovos,Abstract During an instruction miss a processor is unable to fetch instructions. The morefrequent instruction misses are the less able a modern processor is to find useful work to doand thus performance suffers. Online transaction processing (OLTP) suffers from highinstruction miss rates since the instruction footprint of OLTP transactions does not fit intoday's L1-I caches. However; modern many-core chips have ample aggregate L1 cachecapacity across multiple cores. Looking at the code paths concurrently executingtransactions follow; we observe a high degree of repetition both within and acrosstransactions. This work presents TMi a technique that uses thread migration to reduceinstruction misses by spreading the footprint of a transaction over multiple L1 caches.

Workload-Driven Schema Design for Large Scientific Databases.,Stratos Papadomanolakis; Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract Database applications that use multi-terabyte datasets are becoming increasinglyimportant for scientific fields such as astronomy and biology. Scientific databases areparticularly suited for the application of automated physical design techniques; because oftheir data volume and the complexity of their workloads. Current automated physical designtools focus on the selection of indexes and materialized views. In large-scale scientificdatabases; however; the data volume and the continuous insertion of new data allows foronly limited use of such redundant structures. In this paper we propose schema designtechniques to improve query performance without redundancy. We present AutoPart; analgorithm that automatically partitions database tables utilizing knowledge of arepresentative workload. To evaluate AutoPart we built an automated schema design tool …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2004,4,10
DBMS Data Loading: An Analysis on Modern Hardware,Adam Dziedzic; Manos Karpathiotakis; Ioannis Alagiannis; Raja Appuswamy; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Data loading has traditionally been considered a “one-time deal”–an offline processout of the critical path of query execution. The architecture of DBMS is aligned with thisassumption. Nevertheless; the rate in which data is produced and gathered nowadays hasnullified the “one-off” assumption; and has turned data loading into a major bottleneck of thedata analysis pipeline. This paper analyzes the behavior of modern DBMS in order toquantify their ability to fully exploit multicore processors and modern storage hardwareduring data loading. We examine multiple state-of-the-art DBMS; a variety of hardwareconfigurations; and a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets to identify bottlenecksin the data loading process and to provide guidelines on how to accelerate data loading.Our findings show that modern DBMS are unable to saturate the available hardware …,*,2016,3,10

RITA: An index-tuning advisor for replicated databases,Quoc Trung Tran; Ivo Jimenez; Rui Wang; Neoklis Polyzotis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Given a replicated database; a divergent design tunes the indexes in each replicadifferently in order to specialize it for a specific subset of the workload. Empirical studieshave shown that this specialization brings significant performance gains compared to thecommon practice of having the same indexes in all replicas. However; reaping the benefitsof divergent designs requires the development of new tuning tools for databaseadministrators; and the existing tools unfortunately suffer from severe shortcomings: theyassume a fixed number of replicas and a known workload distribution; and ignore thepossibility of replica failures and the subsequent effect on load imbalance. To address theseshortcomings; we analyze the theory and practice of tuning the divergent design of areplicated database.

Online Updates on Data Warehouses via Judicious Use of Solid-State Storage,Manos Athanassoulis; Shimin Chen; Anastasia Ailamaki; Philip B Gibbons; Radu Stoica,Abstract Data warehouses have been traditionally optimized for read-only queryperformance; allowing only offline updates at night; essentially trading off data freshness forperformance. The need for 24x7 operations in global markets and the rise of online andother quickly reacting businesses make concurrent online updates increasingly desirable.Unfortunately; state-of-the-art approaches fall short of supporting fast analysis queries overfresh data. The conventional approach of performing updates in place can dramatically slowdown query performance; while prior proposals using differential updates either requirelarge in-memory buffers or may incur significant update migration cost.

Spatial data management challenges in the simulation sciences,Thomas Heinis; Farhan Tauheed; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Scientists in many disciplines have progressively been using simulations tobetter understand the natural systems they study. Faster hardware; as well as increasinglyprecise instruments; allow the construction and simulation of progressively advancedmodels of various systems. Governed by algorithms and equations; the spatial models at thecore of simulations are changed and updated at every simulation step through spatialqueries; implementing massive updates. Therefore; the efficient execution of thesenumerous spatial queries is essential. Two reasons render current spatial indexesinadequate for simulation applications. First; to ensure quick access to data; most of thespatial models in simulations are stored in memory.

CoPhy: Automated Physical Design with Quality Guarantees,Debabrata Dash; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Physical design requires the selection of an optimal set of design features from avast search space. The existing tool landscape is dominated by application specific heuristicalgorithms; which prune the search space heavily to arrive at a “locally” optimum solution;which may be far from the “globally” optimum. As a result; although the tool runtime is kept atmanageable levels; there is no guarantee of the distance of the proposed solution from theoptimal. Mature combinatorial optimization tools; on the other hand; provide close to“globally” optimal solutions without pruning the search space; provided that the problem isconvex. Inspired from the potential of such tools; we develop a combinatorial optimizationformulation for the physical design problem; showing that there exists a convex formulationwhich does not require heuristic pruning of the problem space. Using this formulation; we …,*,2010,3,19
Caching all plans with just one optimizer call,Debabrata Dash; Ioannis Alagiannis; Cristina Maier; Anastasia Ailamaki,Modern database management systems (DBMS) answer a multitude of complex queries onincreasingly larger datasets. Given the complexities of the queries and the numerous designfeatures; manual design is no longer an option. Instead; automatically designing thedatabase is vital to maximize its performance and to reduce the total cost of ownership. Forthis purpose; commercial DBMS feature automated physical designers suggesting anefficient DB design by using the optimizer as a cost model. Unfortunately; consulting theoptimizer is time-consuming; an effect which is typically counter-acted by drastically pruningthe search space; thereby potentially missing the optimal solution. Recently techniquescache the optimizer's output and evaluate some plans with the cached results; reducing thenumber of calls to the optimizer.

A storage model to bridge the processor/memory speed gap,Anastassia Ailamaki,Memory speeds in today's computers have fundamentally lagged behind processor speeds[7]. Today's memory systems incur access latencies that are up to three orders of magnitudelarger than the latency of a single arithmetic operation. To alleviate the processor/memoryperformance gap; computer designers employ a hierarchy of cache memories (eg; threelevels in the recently announced IBM Power 4 processors); in which each level trades offhigher capacity for faster access times. As database applications become increasinglymemory-intensive; high performance database systems must maximize cache utilization bykeeping data that are likely to be referenced in the cache hierarchy. Ideally; the databaseapplication should run under the illusion that the database is cache-resident; ie; theprocessor should never be idle due to main memory latency.

Slalom: Coasting through raw data via adaptive partitioning and indexing,Matthaios Olma; Manos Karpathiotakis; Ioannis Alagiannis; Manos Athanassoulis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract The constant flux of data and queries alike has been pushing the boundaries ofdata analysis systems. The increasing size of raw data files has made data loading anexpensive operation that delays the data-to-insight time. Hence; recent in-situ queryprocessing systems operate directly over raw data; alleviating the loading cost. At the sametime; analytical workloads have increasing number of queries. Typically; each query focuseson a constantly shifting--yet small--range. Minimizing the workload latency; now; requires thebenefits of indexing in in-situ query processing. In this paper; we present Slalom; an in-situquery engine that accommodates workload shifts by monitoring user access patterns.Slalom makes on-the-fly partitioning and indexing decisions; based on information collectedby lightweight monitoring.

Characterization of the Impact of Hardware Islands on OLTP,Danica Porobic; Ippokratis Pandis; Miguel Branco; Pınar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Modern hardware is abundantly parallel and increasingly heterogeneous. Thenumerous processing cores have non-uniform access latencies to the main memory andprocessor caches; which causes variability in the communication costs. Unfortunately;database systems mostly assume that all processing cores are the same and thatmicroarchitecture differences are not significant enough to appear in critical databaseexecution paths. As we demonstrate in this paper; however; non-uniform core topology doesappear in the critical path and conventional database architectures achieve suboptimal andeven worse; unpredictable performance. We perform a detailed performance analysis ofOLTP deployments in servers with multiple cores per CPU (multicore) and multiple CPUsper server (multisocket).

OLTP on a server-grade ARM: power; throughput and latency comparison,Utku Sirin; Raja Appuswamy; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Although scaling out of low-power cores is an alternative to power-hungry IntelXeon processors for reducing the power overheads; they have proven inadequate forcomplex; non-parallelizable workloads. On the other hand; by the introduction of the 64-bitARMv8 architecture; traditionally low power ARM processors have become powerful enoughto run computationally intensive server-class applications. In this study; we compare a high-performance Intel x86 processor with a commercial implementation of the ARM Cortex-A57.We measure the power used; throughput delivered and latency quantified when runningOLTP workloads. Our results show that the ARM processor consumes 3 to 15 times lesspower than the x86; while penalizing OLTP throughput by a much lower factor (1.7 to 3). Asa result; the significant power savings deliver up to 9 times higher energy efficiency. The …,Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2016,2,10
TRANSFORMERS: Robust spatial joins on non-uniform data distributions,Mirjana Pavlovic; Thomas Heinis; Farhan Tauheed; Panagiotis Karras; Anastasia Ailamaki,Spatial joins are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in many applications; particularly in thescientific domain. While several approaches have been proposed for joining spatialdatasets; each of them has a strength for a particular type of density ratio among the joineddatasets. More generally; no single proposed method can efficiently join two spatial datasetsin a robust manner with respect to their data distributions. Some approaches do well fordatasets with contrasting densities while others do better with similar densities. None ofthem does well when the datasets have locally divergent data distributions. In this paper wedevelop TRANSFORMERS; an efficient and robust spatial join approach that is indifferent tosuch variations of distribution among the joined data.

Several approaches have been proposedfor joining spatial datasets on disk and few in main memory. Recent results show that inmain memory; grids are more efficient than the traditional tree based methods primarilydeveloped for disk. The question how to configure the grid; however; has so far not beendiscussed. In this paper we study how to configure a spatial grid for joining spatial data inmain memory. We discuss the trade-offs involved; develop an analytical model predictingthe performance of a configuration and finally validate the model with experiments.,British International Conference on Databases,2015,2,1
Applying HTM to an OLTP system: No free lunch,David Cervini; Danica Porobic; Pınar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Transactional memory is a promising way for implementing efficient synchronizationmechanisms for multicore processors. Intel's introduction of hardware transactional memory(HTM) into their Haswell line of processors marks an important step toward mainstreamavailability of transactional memory. Transaction processing systems require execution ofdozens of critical sections to insure isolation among threads; which makes them one of thetarget applications for exploiting HTM. In this study; we quantify the opportunities andlimitations of directly applying HTM to an existing OLTP system that uses fine-grainedsynchronization. Our target is Shore-MT; a modern multithreaded transactional storagemanager that uses a variety of fine-grained synchronization mechanisms to providescalability on multicore processors. We find that HTM can improve performance of the …,Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2015,2,22
Embarrassingly scalable database systems,Anastasia Ailamaki,Summary form only given. Database systems have long optimized for parallel execution; theresearch community has pursued parallel database machines since the early'80s; andseveral key ideas from that era underlie the design and success of commercial databaseengines today. Computer microarchitecture; however; has shifted drastically during theintervening decades. Until the end of the 20th century Moore's Law translated into single-processor performance gains; today's constraints in semiconductor technology causetransistor integration to increase the number of processors per chip roughly every two years.Chip multiprocessor; or multicore; platforms are commodity; harvesting scalableperformance from the available raw parallelism; however; is increasingly challenging forconventional database servers running business intelligence and transaction processing …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,2,20
Paradigm Shift to New DBMS Architectures: Research Issues and Market Needs,Sang Kyun Cha; Anastassia Ailamaki; Yoshinori Hara; Vishal Sikka,Abstract Moore's law has driven CPU power and memory capacity to grow million timessince the system R and Ingres projects started thirty years ago. The underlying softwaretechnology has also changed substantially. Today; operating systems support POSIXlightweight multithread library and virtually infinite address for efficient utilization ofmultiprocessor systems with very large memory. Despite these dramatic advances inunderlying hardware and software; the initial RDBMS architecture of managing data andindexes as disk-resident block structures remains the same.

Deadlock resolution in pipelined query graphs,Vladislav Shkapenyuk,Abstract:" Pipelining is a widely used technique that query execution engines employ toimprove individual query execution times. In recently proposed settings; pipelining is usedas an alternative to materialization to evaluate query plan graphs; where nodes in a queryplan can have multiple parents. Such scenarios include shared table scans; runtimeoperator sharing; parallel sorting; and pipelined Multi-Query Optimization (MQO) plans.While pipelining in query graphs can increase performance; it can also lead to runtimedeadlocks. The existing deadlock solutions focus on total deadlock prevention by staticallydeciding between pipelining and materialization; and apply only to MQO. The lack of runtimeinformation leads to highly conservative decisions. Formally; this conservatism makes it NP-hard to find an optimal pipelining strategy that materializes a minimum cost set of nodes …,*,2005,2,1
Clotho: Decoupling page layout from storage organization,Minglong Shao; Jiri Schindler; Steven W Schlosser; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract As database application performance depends on the utilization of the disk andmemory hierarchy; and the speed gap between the processor and memory componentswidens; smart data placement plays a central role in increasing locality and in improvingmemory utilization. Existing techniques; however; do not optimize accesses to all levels ofmemory hierarchy and for all the different workloads; because each storage level usesdifferent technology (cache; memory; disks) and each application accesses data usingdifferent (often conflicting) patterns. This paper introduces Clotho; a new buffer pool andstorage management architecture. Clotho decouples in-memory page layout from dataorganization on non-volatile storage devices; enabling independent data layout design ateach level of the storage hierarchy.

Matching Database Access Patterns to Storage Characteristics.,Jiri Schindler; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory Ganger,Abstract Today's storage interfaces hide device-specific details; simplifying systemdevelopment and device interoperability. However; they prevent database systems fromexploiting devices' unique performance characteristics. Abstract and device-independentannotations to existing storage interfaces can cleanly expose key device characteristics thatimprove performance and simplify manual tuning. By automatically matching accesspatterns to device strengths; a database storage manager can achieve robust performanceeven with workloads competing for the same storage resource. For example; disk-optimizedaccesses result in simultaneous improvement of up to 3x for DSS workloads and 7% for acompeting OLTP workload. As another example; accesses to relational tables can takeadvantage of MEMS-based storage parallelism to achieve order of magnitude …,VLDB PhD Workshop,2003,2,10
DiNoDB: An Interactive-Speed Query Engine for Ad-Hoc Queries on Temporary Data,Yongchao Tian; Ioannis Alagiannis; Erietta Liarou; Anastasia Ailamaki; Pietro Michiardi; Marko Vukolić,As data sets grow in size; analytics applications struggle to get instant insight into largedatasets. Modern applications involve heavy batch processing jobs over large volumes ofdata and at the same time require efficient ad-hoc interactive analytics on temporary data.Existing solutions; however; typically focus on one of these two aspects; largely ignoring theneed for synergy between the two. Consequently; interactive queries need to re-iteratecostly passes through the entire dataset (eg; data loading) that may provide meaningfulreturn on investment only when data is queried over a long period of time.

Alpine: Efficient in-situ data exploration in the presence of updates,Antonios Anagnostou; Matthaios Olma; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract The ever growing data collections create the need for brief explorations of theavailable data to extract relevant information before decision making becomes necessary. Inthis context of data exploration; current data analysis solutions struggle to quickly pinpointuseful information in data collections. One major reason is that loading data in a DBMSwithout knowing which part of it will actually be useful is a major bottleneck. To remove thisbottleneck; state-of-the art approaches perform queries in situ; thus avoiding the loadingoverhead. In situ query engines; however; are index-oblivious; and lack sophisticatedtechniques to reduce the amount of data to be accessed. Furthermore; applicationsconstantly generate fresh data and update the existing raw data files whereas state-of-the artin situ approaches support only append-like workloads.

To address the unprecedented growth in the amount ofcold data; hardware vendors introduced new devices named Cold Storage Devices (CSD)explicitly targeted at cold data workloads. With access latencies in tens of seconds andcost/GB as low as $0.01/GB/month; CSD provide a middle ground between the low-latency(ms); high-cost; HDD-based capacity tier; and high-latency (min to h); low-cost; tape-based;archival tier.

More than a network: distributed OLTP on clusters of hardware islands,Danica Porobic; Pınar Tözün; Raja Appuswamy; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Multisocket multicores feature hardware islands-groups of cores that communicatefast among themselves and slower with other groups. With high speed networking becominga commodity; clusters of hardware islands with fast networks are becoming a preferredplatform for high end OLTP workloads. While behavior of OLTP on multisockets is wellunderstood; multi-machine OLTP deployments have been studied only in the geo-distributedcontext where network is much slower. In this paper; we analyze the behavior of differentOLTP designs when deployed on clusters of multisockets with fast networks. Wedemonstrate that choosing the optimal deployment configuration within a multisocket nodecan improve performance by 2 to 4 times.

Theproblem is to (a) find a partitioning where each partition has the same number of elementsand (b) the communication between partitions (duplicate members) is minimized. Wepresent a novel parallel load-balancing framework—Sort Balance Split (SBS)—the first toour knowledge to perform accurate parallel partitioning of multidimensional data; whilerequiring a fixed number of communication steps independent of network size or input datadistribution. When compared to the state of the art sampling and parallel partitioningmethods adopted by HPC problems; it delivers better load balancing on a shorter time tosolution.

Reconsolidating data structures,Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT For decades forgetting has been treated as an abnormality; a malfunction of thebrain that leads humans to lose stored information. Recent results; however; suggest thatforgetting is not only a malfunction of the human storage system; but also a useful feature. Inorder to guarantee a quick response in the face of the limited processing power of the brain;acting quickly on less or reduced information is key. With storage becoming ever cheaperand continually growing it has become standard practice today to store each and everysingle data item. However; even increasingly powerful processors cannot deal with this datadeluge. In this paper we consequently argue that forgetting and its mechanisms should be apart of today's data management; particularly for techniques requiring fast and/orapproximate query answers.

Reactive and proactive sharing across concurrent analytical queries,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Manos Athanassoulis; Matthaios Olma; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Today an ever increasing amount of data is collected and analyzed by researchers;businesses; and scientists in data warehouses (DW). In addition to the data size; the numberof users and applications querying data grows exponentially. The increasing concurrency isitself a challenge in query execution; but also introduces an opportunity favoring synergybetween concurrent queries. Traditional execution engines of DW follows a query-centricapproach; where each query is optimized and executed independently. On the other hand;workloads with increased concurrency have several queries with common parts of data andwork; creating the opportunity for sharing among concurrent queries. Sharing can bereactive to the inherently existing sharing opportunities; or proactive by redesigning queryoperators to maximize the sharing opportunities.

An analysis of database system performance on chip multiprocessors,Nikos Hardavellas; Ippokratis Pandis; Ryan Johnson; Naju Mancheril; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,ABSTRACT Prior research shows that database system performance is dominated by off-chip data stalls; resulting in a concerted effort to bring data into on-chip caches. At the sametime; high levels of integration have enabled the advent of chip multiprocessors andincreasingly large (and slow) on-chip caches. These two trends pose the imminent technicaland research challenge of adapting high-performance data management software to ashifting hardware landscape. In this paper we characterize the performance of a commercialdatabase server running on emerging chip multiprocessor technologies. We find that themajor bottleneck of current software is data cache stalls; with L2 hit stalls rising from oblivionto become the dominant execution time component in some cases.

Analyzing the impact of system architecture on the scalability of OLTP engines for high-contention workloads,Raja Appuswamy; Angelos C Anadiotis; Danica Porobic; Mustafa K Iman; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Main-memory OLTP engines are being increasingly deployed on multicore serversthat provide abundant thread-level parallelism. However; recent research has shown thateven the state-of-the-art OLTP engines are unable to exploit available parallelism for highcontention workloads. While previous studies have shown the lack of scalability of allpopular concurrency control protocols; they consider only one system architecture---a non-partitioned; shared everything one where transactions can be scheduled to run on any coreand can access any data or metadata stored in shared memory.

Interleaving with coroutines: a practical approach for robust index joins,Georgios Psaropoulos; Thomas Legler; Norman May; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Index join performance is determined by the efficiency of the lookup operationon the involved index. Although database indexes are highly optimized to leverageprocessor caches; main memory accesses inevitably increase lookup runtime when theindex outsizes the last-level cache; hence; index join performance drops. Still; robust indexjoin performance becomes possible with instruction stream interleaving: given a group oflookups; we can hide cache misses in one lookup with instructions from other lookups byswitching among their respective instruction streams upon a cache miss. In this paper; wepropose interleaving with coroutines for any type of index join.

No data left behind: real-time insights from a complex data ecosystem,Manos Karpathiotakis; Avrilia Floratou; Fatma Özcan; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract The typical enterprise data architecture consists of several actively updated datasources (eg; NoSQL systems; data warehouses); and a central data lake such as HDFS; inwhich all the data is periodically loaded through ETL processes. To simplify queryprocessing; state-of-the-art data analysis approaches solely operate on top of the local;historical data in the data lake; and ignore the fresh tail end of data that resides in theoriginal remote sources. However; as many business operations depend on real-timeanalytics; this approach is no longer viable. The alternative is hand-crafting the analysis taskto explicitly consider the characteristics of the various data sources and identify optimizationopportunities; rendering the overall analysis non-declarative and convoluted.

CleanM: an optimizable query language for unified scale-out data cleaning,Stella Giannakopoulou; Manos Karpathiotakis; Benjamin Gaidioz; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Data cleaning has become an indispensable part of data analysis due to theincreasing amount of dirty data. Data scientists spend most of their time preparing dirty databefore it can be used for data analysis. At the same time; the existing tools that attempt toautomate the data cleaning procedure typically focus on a specific use case and operation.Still; even such specialized tools exhibit long running times or fail to process large datasets.Therefore; from a user's perspective; one is forced to use a different; potentially inefficienttool for each category of errors.

A methodology for OLTP micro-architectural analysis,Utku Sirin; Ahmad Yasin; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Micro-architectural analysis is critical to investigate the interaction betweenworkloads and processors. While today's aggressive out-of-order processors provide a richset of performance events for deep execution cycle analysis; OLTP characterization studiesusually use a cache-miss-based method (CMBM). In this work; we investigate the validityand the functionality of CMBM by comparing it with Intel's state-of-the-art Top-down Micro-architecture Analysis Method (TMAM) for OLTP workloads. We show that; while CMBM andTMAM provide a similar high-level micro-architectural behavior; it is inadequate for a fine-grained micro-architectural analysis. We further show that TMAM underestimates memorystalls. We optimize TMAM's execution cycle breakdown; and improve its estimation ofmemory stalls up to 50%.,Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2017,*,10
DBMS Data Loading: An Analysis on Modern Hardware,Raja Appuswamy; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract. Data loading has traditionally been considered a “one-time deal”–an offlineprocess out of the critical path of query execution. The architecture of DBMS is aligned withthis assumption. Nevertheless; the rate in which data is produced and gathered nowadayshas nullified the “one-off” assumption; and has turned data loading into a major bottleneck ofthe data analysis pipeline. This paper analyzes the behavior of modern DBMS in order toquantify their ability to fully exploit multicore processors and modern storage hardwareduring data loading.

GPU Rasterization for Real-Time Spatial Aggregation over Arbitrary Polygons,Eleni Tzirita Zacharatou; Harish Doraiswamy; Anastasia Ailamaki; Claudio Silva; Juliana Freire,ABSTRACT Visual exploration of spatial data relies heavily on spatial aggregation queriesthat slice and summarize the data over different regions. These queries comprisecomputationally-intensive point-inpolygon tests that associate data points to polygonalregions; challenging the responsiveness of visualization tools. This challenge iscompounded by the sheer amounts of data; requiring a large number of such tests to beperformed. Traditional pre-aggregation approaches are unsuitable in this setting since theyfix the query constraints and support only rectangular regions. On the other hand; queryconstraints are defined interactively in visual analytics systems; and polygons can be ofarbitrary shapes.

Space odyssey: efficient exploration of scientific data,Mirjana Pavlovic; Eleni Tzirita Zacharatou; Darius Sidlauskas; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Advances in data acquisition---through more powerful supercomputers forsimulation or sensors with better resolution---help scientists tremendously to understandnatural phenomena. At the same time; however; it leaves them with a plethora of data andthe challenge of analysing it. Ingesting all the data in a database or indexing it for an efficientanalysis is unlikely to pay off because scientists rarely need to analyse all data.

Vectorizing an In Situ Query Engine,Panagiotis Sioulas; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Database systems serve a wide range of use cases efficiently; but require data tobe loaded and adapted to the system's execution engine. This pre-processing step is abottleneck to the analysis of the increasingly large and heterogeneous datasets. Therefore;numerous research efforts advocate for querying each dataset in situ; ie; without pre-loadingit in a DBMS. On the other hand; performing analysis over raw data entails numerousoverheads because of the potentially inefficient data representations. In this paper; weinvestigate the effect of vector processing on raw data querying. We enhance the operatorsof a query engine to use SIMD operations. Specifically; we examine the effect of SIMD ontwo different cases: the scan operators that perform the CPU-intensive task of input parsing;and the part of the query pipeline that performs a selection and computes an aggregate …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,*,0

RUBIK: efficient threshold queries on massive time series,Eleni Tzirita Zacharatou; Farhan Tauheedz; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract An increasing number of applications from finance; meteorology; science andothers are producing time series as output. The analysis of the vast amount of time series iskey to understand the phenomena studied; particularly in the simulation sciences; where theanalysis of time series resulting from simulation allows scientists to refine the modelsimulated. Existing approaches to query time series typically keep a compact representationin main memory; use it to answer queries approximately and then access the exact timeseries data on disk to validate the result. The more precise the in-memory representation;the fewer disk accesses are needed to validate the result. With the massive sizes of today'sdatasets; however; current in-memory representations oftentimes no longer fit into mainmemory. To make them fit; their precision has to be reduced considerably resulting in …,Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2015,*,14
Running with scissors: Fast queries on just-in-time databases,Anastasia Ailamaki,The amount of data collected in the last two years is higher than the amount of data collectedsince the dawn of time. Businesses are drowning in data; and need several months of ETLprocessing to barely prepare them for querying. Domain scientists collect data much fasterthan they can be transformed into valuable information and are often forced into hastydecisions on which parts to discard; potentially throwing away valuable data before it hasbeen exploited fully. The reason is that query processing; which is the mechanism tosqueeze information out of data; becomes slower as datasets grow larger. At the same time;the continuously increased number of hardware contexts ends up slowing processing downfurther; as keeping all cores busy with doing useful computation is difficult. Today's queryengines cannot harness but a fraction of the potential of new hardware platforms.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,*,19

Accelerating spatial range queries,Alexandros Stougiannis; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract It is increasingly common for domain scientists to use computational tools to buildand simulate spatial models of the phenomena they are studying. The spatial models theybuild are more and more detailed as well as dense and are consequently difficult to managewith today's tools. A crucial problem when analyzing spatial models of increasing detail isthe scalable execution of range queries. State-of-the-art approaches like the R-Tree performsuboptimally on today's models and do not scale for more dense; future models. Theproblem is that the amount of overlap in the tree structure increases as a function of the levelof detail/density in the model. In this demonstration we showcase ZOOM; a new tool toefficiently execute spatial range queries on increasingly detailed (denser) models. ZOOM isbased on FLAT; a novel range query execution approach that effectively decouples the …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,*,11
Enabling Scientific Discovery Via Innovative Spatial Data Management,Thomas Heinis; Farhan Tauheed; Mirjana Pavlovic; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Researchers in several scientific disciplines are struggling to cope with the massesof data resulting from either increasingly precise instruments or from simulation runs on evermore powerful supercomputers.

Approximate Probabilistic Tree Indexing for Partitionable Data,Manos Athanassoulis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Today we experience a shift both in storage technologies and in workloads characteristics.Firstly; solid state disks (SSD)(using flash; PCM or other low-level technologies) emerge asviable competitors of hard disk drives (HDD). Secondly; the increasing number of time-based generated workloads change the characteristics of the stored and analyzed data.Capacity and access times of storage devices create a storage tradeoff where SSD arepositioned diametrically opposite to HDD: slow random accesses in HDD have beenreplaced by efficient random accesses-particularly reads-in SSD; but the capacity per dollaroffered by HDD is still one or more orders of magnitude higher than the one offered by SSD.As the aggregated SSD capacity increases exponentially; an increasing part of our dataresides on SSD.

Non-intrusive quality analysis of monitoring data,Mark Brightwell; Anastasia Ailamaki; Anna Suwalska,Abstract Any large-scale operational system running over a variety of devices requires amonitoring mechanism to assess the health of the overall system. The TechnicalInfrastructure Monitoring System (TIM) at CERN is one such system; and monitors a widevariety of devices and their properties; such as electricity supplies; device temperatures;liquid flows etc. Without adequate quality assurance; the data collected from such devicesleads to false-positives and false-negatives; reducing the effectiveness of the monitoringsystem. The quality must; however; be measured in a non-intrusive way; so that the criticalpath of the data flow is not affected by the quality computation. The quality computationshould also scale to large volumes of incoming data. To address these challenges; wedevelop a new statistical module; which monitors the data collected by TIM and reports its …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2010,*,10
Database systems in the multicore era,Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Database systems have long optimized for parallel execution; the researchcommunity has pursued parallel database machines since the early80s; and several the keyideas from that era underlie the design and success of commercial database engines today.Computer architectures have shifted drastically during the intervening decades; however;and today the constraints of semiconductor technology combine with Moore's Law to doublethe number of processors per chip every 18 months. Converting this available rawparallelism into scalable performance is increasingly difficult with conventional servers; forboth business intelligence and transaction processing workloads.

NWU-EECS-10-05 March 4; 2010 Power Scaling: the Ultimate Obstacle to 1K-Core Chips,Nikos Hardavellas; Michael Ferdman; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,ABSTRACT As Moore's Law continues for at least another decade; the number of cores onchip and the on-chip cache size will continue to grow at an exponential rate. Whileworkloads with limited parallelism pose performance challenges with multicore processors;server workloads with abundant parallelism are believed to be immune; capable of scalingto the parallelism available in the hardware. However; despite the inherent scalability inthreaded server workloads; increasing core counts cannot directly translate intoperformance improvements because chips are physically constrained in power and off-chipbandwidth. In this work; we explore the design space of physically-constrained multicorechips across technologies and show that; even with conservative estimates; chips will notscale beyond a few tens of cores due to physical power and off-chip bandwidth …,*,2010,*,19
The Path Forward: Specialized Computing in the Datacenter,Nikos Hardavellas; Michael Ferdman; Anastasia Ailamaki; Babak Falsafi,ABSTRACT Popular belief holds that the cores on chip will grow at an exponential rate;following Moore's Law; with a commensurate increase in performance. However; byexploring the design space of multicore chips across technologies under a large array ofdesign parameters; we observe that physical constraints in power and off-chip bandwidthprohibit such performance increase. This leads us to conclude that server chips will notscale beyond a few tens of cores; potentially leaving the die real-estate underutilized infuture technology generations. We observe that heterogeneous multicores can leverage thedie area to overcome the initial power barrier; delivering significantly higher performance forthe same offchip bandwidth and power envelopes. Thus; specialized computing; especiallywhen coupled with emerging memory technologies; promises significant increases in …,2nd Workshop on Architectural Considerations for Large Datacenters (ACLD),2010,*,15

Efficient Model-Driven Query Processing Based on Data Regeneration,Petre Alexandru Arion; Saket Sathe,Nowadays; sensor data is generated in large amounts. Storing or transmitting all thesensor's measurements might not be the ideal choice because of the volume (and rate) atwhich it is generated. But we also cannot easily discard it; since every data might containrelevant information and be required while processing queries. One approach to avoidstoring and transmitting large amounts of data is to create a sufficiently accurate model overthe data and then store or transmit that model. Later; at the time of query processing; thestraight forward approach is to regenerate the required data from the model (s) and proceedwith query processing; or answer the queries directly on the model (s). We ask the questionof how computationally expensive are various query processing techniques; given theavailability of the models only.,*,2009,*,20
Improving OLTP concurrency through Early Lock Release,Manos Athanassoulis; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki; Radu Stoica,ABSTRACT Since the beginning of the multi-core era; database systems research hasrestarted focusing on increasing concurrency. Even though database systems have beenable to accommodate concurrent requests; the exploding number of available cores per chiphas surfaced new difficulties. More and more transactions can be served in parallel (sincemore threads can run simultaneously) and; thus; concurrency in a database system is moreimportant than ever in order to exploit the available resources. In this paper; we evaluateEarly Lock Release (ELR); a technique that allows early release of locks to improveconcurrency level and overall throughput in OLTP. This technique has been proven to leadto a database system that can produce correct and recoverable histories but it has neverbeen implemented in a full scale DBMS.

Observer: Keeping System Models from Becoming Obsolete (CMU-PDL-07-101),Eno Thereska; Dushyanth Narayanan; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract To be effective for automation; in practice; system models used for performanceprediction and behavior checking must be robust. They must be able to cope withcomponent upgrades; misconfigurations; and workload-system interactions that were notanticipated. This paper promotes making models self-evolving; such that they continuouslyevaluate their accuracy and adjust their predictions accordingly. Such self-evaluation alsoenables confidence values to be provided with predictions; including identification ofsituations where no trustworthy prediction can be produced. With a combination ofexpectation-based and observationbased techniques; we believe that such self-evolvingmodels can be achieved and used as a robust foundation for tuning; problem diagnosis;capacity planning; and administration tasks.,*,2007,*,1

Supporting Large Speculative Threads for Databases and Beyond,Christopher B Colohan; Anastassia Ailamaki; J Gregory Steffan; Todd C Mowry,Abstract Thread level speculation (TLS) has proven to be a promising method of extractingparallelism from both integer and scientific workloads. In this paper we use TLS to exploitintra-transaction parallelism in database workloads; and demonstrate that previoushardware support for TLS is insufficient for the resulting large speculative threads (orepochs) and the complexity of the dependences between them. In this paper we extendprevious TLS support in three ways to facilitate large epochs:(i) we propose a method forbuffering speculative state in the L2 cache; instead of solely using an extended store buffer;L1 data cache; or specialized table to track speculative changes;(ii) we tolerate cross-epochdata dependences through the use of sub-epochs; significantly reducing the cost of mis-speculation; and (iii) with programmer assistance we escape speculation for database …,*,2005,*,0

MultiMap: Preserving Disk Locality for Multidimensional Datasets (CMU-PDL-05-102),Minglong Shao; Steven W Schlosser; Stratos Papadomanolakis; Jiri Schindler; Anastassia Ailamaki; Christos Faloutsos; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract MultiMap is a new approach to mapping multidimensional datasets to the linearaddress space of storage systems. MultiMap exploits modern disk characteristics to providefull streaming bandwidth for one (primary) dimension and maximally efficient non-sequentialaccess (ie; minimal seek and no rotational latency) for the other dimensions. This is incontrast to existing approaches; which either severely penalize non-primary dimensions orfail to provide full streaming bandwidth for any dimension. Experimental evaluation of aprototype implementation demonstrates MultiMap's superior performance for range andbeam queries. On average; MultiMap reduces overall I/O time by over 50% when comparedto traditional naive layouts and by over 30% when compared to a Hilbert curve approach.For scans of the primary dimension; MultiMap and naive both provide almost two orders …,Parallel Data Laboratory,2005,*,0

Whilestore miss latency can be effectively tolerated using relaxed memory ordering; load latencyto shared data remains a bottleneck. Current proposals for mitigating coherence misseseither reduce the latency by optimizing the coherence activity (eg; selfinvalidation) orprefetch specific memory access patterns (eg; strides) but fall short of eliminating the misslatency for generalized memory access patterns. This paper presents the novel observationthat the order in which shared data is consumed by one processor is correlated to the orderit was produced by another. We investigate this phenomenon; called temporal correlation;and demonstrate that it can be exploited to send Store-ORDered Streams (SORDS) of …,*,2004,*,1
Computational Database Systems for Massive Scientific Datasets,David O’Hallaron; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory Ganger,We propose to push the frontiers of scientists' ability to explore and understand massivescientific datasets by developing a new approach called computational database systems.The idea is to integrate scientific datasets stored as spatial databases with specialized;tightly-coupled; and highly-optimized functions that query and manipulate these databases.Doing so will simultaneously simplify domain-specific programming (since datasets are nowin a form that can be queried generally) and greatly increase the scale of problems that canbe studied efficiently (since the complete dataset no longer needs to fit into memory). Manyscientific problems are constrained by the complexity of manipulating massive datasets.Recently; for example; a group of us at Carnegie Mellon received the Gordon Bell Prize forproducing and simulating the largest unstructured finite element model ever.

Clotho: Decoupling Page Layout from Storage Organization (CMU-PDL-04-102),Minglong Shou; Jiri Schindler; Steven W Schlosser; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregoru R Ganger,As database application performance depends on the utilization of the disk and memoryhierarchy; and the speed gap between the processor and memory components widens;smart data placement plays a central role in increasing locality and in improving memoryutilization. Existing techniques; however; do not optimize accesses to all levels of memoryhierarchy and for all the different workloads; because each storage level uses differenttechnology (cache; memory; disks) and each application accesses data using different (oftenconflicting) patterns. This paper introduces Clotho; a new buffer pool and storagemanagement architecture. Clotho decouples in-memory page layout from data organizationon non-volatile storage devices; enabling independent data layout design at each level ofthe storage hierarchy.

Storage Device Performance Prediction with CART Models (CMU-PDL-04-103),Mengzhi Wang; Kinman Au; Anastassia Ailamaki; Anthony Brockwell; Christos Faloutsos; Gregory R Ganger,Storage device performance prediction is a key element of self-managed storage systems.This work explores the application of a machine learning tool; CART models; to storagedevice modeling. Our approach predicts a device's performance as a function of inputworkloads; requiring no knowledge of the device internals. We propose two uses of CARTmodels: one that predicts per-request response times (and then derives aggregate values)and one that predicts aggregate values directly from workload characteristics. After beingtrained on the device in question; both provide accurate black-box models across a range oftest traces from real environments. Experiments show that these models predict the averageand 90th percentile response time with an relative error as low as 19% when the trainingworkloads are similar to the testing workloads and a good interpolation across different …,*,2004,*,0

Exposing and Exploiting Internal Parallelism in MEMS-based Storage (CMU-CS-03-125),Steven W Schlosser; Jiri Schindler; Anastassia Ailamaki; Gregory R Ganger,Abstract MEMS-based storage has interesting access parallelism features. Specifically;subsets of a MEMStore's thousands of tips can be used in parallel; and the particular subsetcan be dynamically chosen. This paper describes how such access parallelism can beexposed to system software; with minimal changes to system interfaces; and utilized cleanlyfor two classes of applications. First; background tasks can utilize unused parallelism toaccess media locations with no impact on foreground activity. Second; two-dimensional datastructures; such as dense matrices and relational database tables; can be accessed in bothrow order and column order with maximum efficiency. With proper table layout; unwantedportions of a table can be skipped while scanning at full speed.

Reminiscences on influential papers,Kenneth A Ross,Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best. Hellerstein et al. introduced the idea ofextending the relational database engine to compute basic SQL aggregates in an onlinefashion; recognizing that OLAP queries are often posed to get rough estimates (eg; decisionsupport) and thus do not require" painstaking precision". While there had been previouswork on approximate query answering as well as so-called" fast-first" query processing; thisis the first paper to consider online; interactive query processing in an RDB. The keyimplementation ideas include random access to data; non-blocking strategies; and round-robin fetching; all based on leveraging standard database tools. However; more importantthan these specifics is the paradigm shift away from traditional batch processing.

Affinity Scheduling in Staged Server Architectures (CMU-CS-02-113),Stavros Harizopoulos; Anastassia Ailamaki,Abstract Modern servers typically process request streams by assigning a worker thread to arequest; and rely on a round robin policy for context-switching. Although this programmingparadigm is intuitive; it is oblivious to the execution state and ignores each softwaremodule's affinity to the processor caches. As a result; resumed threads of execution sufferadditional delays due to conflict and compulsory misses while populating the caches withtheir evicted working sets. Alternatively; the staged programming paradigm dividescomputation into stages and allows for stage-based (rather than request thread-based)cohort scheduling that improves module affinity. This technical report introduces (a) fournovel cohort scheduling techniques for staged software servers that follow a “production-line” model of operation; and (b) a mathematical framework to methodically quantify the …,Parallel Data Laboratory,2002,*,19

THERMAL-JOIN: A Scalable Spatial Join for Dynamic Workloads,T Heinis; A Ailamaki; F Tauheed,Simulations have become ubiquitous in many domains of science. Today scientists studynatural phenomena by first building massive three-dimensional spatial models and then bysimulating the models at discrete intervals of time to mimic the behavior of naturalphenomena. One frequently occurring challenge during simulations is the repeatedcomputation of spatial self-joins of the model at each simulation time step. The join isperformed to access a group of neighboring spatial objects (groups of particles; moleculesor cosmological objects) so that scientists can calculate the cumulative effect (likegravitational force) on an object. Computing a self-join even in memory; soon becomes aperformance bottleneck in simulation applications.

Adaptive NUMA-aware data placement and task scheduling for main-memory column-store scans and aggregations,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Tobias Scheuer; Norman May; Abdelkader Sellami; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures pose numerousperformance challenges for main-memory column-stores in scaling up analytics on modernmulti-socket multi-core servers. A NUMA-aware execution engine needs a strategy for dataplacement and task scheduling that prefers fast local memory accesses over remote memoryaccesses; and avoids an imbalance of resource utilization; both CPU and memorybandwidth; across sockets. State-of-the-art systems typically use a static strategy that alwayspartitions data across sockets; and always allows inter-socket task stealing. In this paper; weshow that adapting data placement and task stealing to the workload can improvethroughput by up to 4x compared to a static approach.
