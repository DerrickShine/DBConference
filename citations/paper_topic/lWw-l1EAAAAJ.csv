Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α-mediated transcription of miR-199a2 attenuates endothelin-1 expression via hypoxia-inducible factor-1α,Chen Li; Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo; Caryn S Gonsalves; Stanley M Tahara; Punam Malik; Vijay K Kalra,Background: Elevated plasma levels of PlGF are associated with increased endothelin-1and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in SCD. Results: miR-199a2; which targets HIF-1α mRNA;located in host gene DNM3os is co-transcriptionally regulated by PPARα. Conclusion:PPARα agonist induction of miR-199a2 reduced ET-1 levels. Significance: PPARα agonistreduction of ET-1 levels via induced miR-199a2 provides an alternative strategy toameliorate PH. Abstract Endothelin-1; a potent vasoconstrictor; plays an important role inpulmonary hypertension (PH) in sickle cell disease (SCD). Our previous studies show thathigher levels of placenta growth factor (PlGF); secreted by erythroid precursor cells;correlate with increased plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and other functional markersof PH in SCD. PlGF-mediated ET-1 expression occurs via activation of hypoxia-inducible …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2014,19,5

MicroRNA 648 targets ET-1 mRNA and is cotranscriptionally regulated with MICAL3 by PAX5,Chen Li; Caryn S Gonsalves; Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo; Punam Malik; Stanley M Tahara; Vijay K Kalra,ABSTRACT Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is associated with high mortality in sickle cellanemia (SCA). Previously; we showed that elevated levels of placenta growth factor (PlGF)in SCA patients correlate with increased levels of the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1(ET-1) and PHT. Moreover; PlGF induced the expression of ET-1 via hypoxia-inducible factor1α. Here; we show a novel example of ET-1 posttranscriptional regulation by PlGF via actionof microRNA 648 (miR-648); which is subject to transcriptional coregulation with its hostgene; MICAL3 (microtubule-associated monooxygenase; calponin; and LIM domaincontaining 3gene). PlGF repressed expression of miR-648 in endothelial cells. Luciferasereporter assays using wild-type and mutant ET-1 3′ untranslated region (UTR) constructs;and transfection of miR-648 mimics showed that miR-648 targets the 3′ UTR of ET-1 …,Molecular and cellular biology,2015,9,18
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α-mediated transcription of miR-301a and miR-454 and their host gene SKA2 regulates endothelin-1 and PAI-1 expressio...,Caryn S Gonsalves; Chen Li; Punam Malik; Stanley M Tahara; Vijay K Kalra,Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) play important roles inpulmonary hypertension (PH) in sickle cell disease (SCD). Our previous studies show higherlevels of placenta growth factor (PlGF) in SCD correlate with increased plasma levels of ET-1; PAI-1; and other physiological markers of PH. PlGF-mediated ET-1 and PAI-1 expressionoccurs via activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). However; relatively little isunderstood regarding post-transcriptional regulation of PlGF-mediated expression of ET-1and PAI-1. Herein; we show PlGF treatment of endothelial cells reduced levels of miR-301aand miR-454 from basal levels. In addition; both miRNAs targeted the 3′-UTRs of ET-1 andPAI-1 mRNAs. These results were corroborated in the mouse model of SCD [Berkeley sicklemice (BK-SS)] and in SCD subjects. Plasma levels of miR-454 in SCD subjects were …,Bioscience reports,2015,6,12
Activated transcription factor 3 in association with histone deacetylase 6 negatively regulates microRNA 199a2 transcription by chromatin remodeling and reduces e...,Chen Li; Yu Zhou; Anastacia Loberg; Stanley M Tahara; Punam Malik; Vijay K Kalra,ABSTRACT Previous studies showed that high levels of placenta growth factor (PlGF)correlated with increased plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1); a potent vasoconstrictor; insickle cell disease (SCD). PlGF-mediated transcription of the ET-1 gene occurs by activationof hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and posttranscriptionally by microRNA 199a2 (miR-199a2); which targets the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of HIF-1α mRNA. However;relatively less is known about how PlGF represses the expression of miR-199a2 located inthe DNM3 opposite strand (DNM3os) transcription unit. Here; we show that PlGF induces theexpression of activated transcription factor 3 (ATF3); which; in association with accessoryproteins (c-Jun dimerization protein 2 [JDP2]; ATF2; and histone deacetylase 6 [HDAC6]); asdetermined by proteomic analysis; binds to the DNM3os promoter. Furthermore; we show …,Molecular and cellular biology,2016,3,6
