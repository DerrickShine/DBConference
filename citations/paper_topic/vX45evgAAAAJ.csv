The new casper: Query processing for location services without compromising privacy,Mohamed F Mokbel; Chi-Yin Chow; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper tackles a major privacy concern in current location-based serviceswhere users have to continuously report their locations to the database server in order toobtain the service. For example; a user asking about the nearest gas station has to reporther exact location. With untrusted servers; reporting the location information may lead toseveral privacy threats. In this paper; we present Casper 1; a new framework in whichmobile and stationary users can entertain location-based services without revealing theirlocation information. Casper consists of two main components; the location anonymizer andthe privacy-aware query processor. The location anonymizer blurs the users' exact locationinformation into cloaked spatial regions based on user-specified privacy requirements. Theprivacy-aware query processor is embedded inside the location-based database server …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,1201,2
Automatic image segmentation by integrating color-edge extraction and seeded region growing,Jianping Fan; David KY Yau; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Walid G Aref,We propose a new automatic image segmentation method. Color edges in an image are firstobtained automatically by combining an improved isotropic edge detector and a fast entropicthresholding technique. After the obtained color edges have provided the major geometricstructures in an image; the centroids between these adjacent edge regions are taken as theinitial seeds for seeded region growing (SRG). These seeds are then replaced by thecentroids of the generated homogeneous image regions by incorporating the requiredadditional pixels step by step. Moreover; the results of color-edge extraction and SRG areintegrated to provide homogeneous image regions with accurate and closed boundaries.We also discuss the application of our image segmentation method to automatic facedetection. Furthermore; semantic human objects are generated by a seeded region …,IEEE transactions on image processing,2001,718,15
SINA: Scalable incremental processing of continuous queries in spatio-temporal databases,Mohamed F Mokbel; Xiaopeing Xiong; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper intoduces the Scalable INcremental hash-based Algorithm (SINA; forshort); a new algorithm for evaluting a set of concurrent continuous spatio-temporal queries.SINA is designed with two goals in mind:(1) Scalability in terms of the number of concurrentcontinuous spatio-temporal queries; and (2) Incremental evaluation of continyous spatio-temporal queries. SINA achieves scalability by empolying a shared execution paradigmwhere the execution of continuous spatio-temporal queries is abstracted as a spatial joinbetween a set of moving objects and a set of moving queries. Incremental evaluation isachived by computing only the updates of the previously reported answer. We introduce twotypes of updaes; namely positive and negative updates. Positive or negative updatesindicate that a certain object should be added to or removed from the previously reported …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,535,1
Supporting top-k join queries in relational databases,Ihab F Ilyas; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract Ranking queries; also known as top-k queries; produce results that are ordered onsome computed score. Typically; these queries involve joins; where users are usuallyinterested only in the top-k join results. Top-k queries are dominant in many emergingapplications; eg; multimedia retrieval by content; Web databases; data mining; middlewares;and most information retrieval applications. Current relational query processors do nothandle ranking queries efficiently; especially when joins are involved. In this paper; weaddress supporting top-k join queries in relational query processors. We introduce a newrank-join algorithm that makes use of the individual orders of its inputs to produce joinresults ordered on a user-specified scoring function. The idea is to rank the join resultsprogressively during the join operation. We introduce two physical query operators based …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2004,453,7
Query indexing and velocity constrained indexing: Scalable techniques for continuous queries on moving objects,Sunil Prabhakar; Yuni Xia; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Walid G Aref; Susanne E Hambrusch,Moving object environments are characterized by large numbers of moving objects andnumerous concurrent continuous queries over these objects. Efficient evaluation of thesequeries in response to the movement of the objects is critical for supporting acceptableresponse times. In such environments; the traditional approach of building an index on theobjects (data) suffers from the need for frequent updates and thereby results in poorperformance. In fact; a brute force; no-index strategy yields better performance in manycases. Neither the traditional approach nor the brute force strategy achieve reasonablequery processing times. This paper develops novel techniques for the efficient and scalableevaluation of multiple continuous queries on moving objects. Our solution leverages twocomplimentary techniques: Query Indexing and Velocity Constrained Indexing (VCI) …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2002,417,10
Spatio-temporal access methods,Mohamed F.  Mokbel; Thanaa M.  Ghanem; Walid G.  Aref,Abstract The rapid increase in spatio-temporal applications calls for new auxiliary indexingstructures. A typical spatio-temporal application is one that tracks the behavior of movingobjects through location-aware devices (eg; GPS). Through the last decade; many spatio-temporal access methods are developed. Spatio-temporal access methods focus on twoorthogonal directions:(1) Indexing the past;(2) Indexing the current and predicted futurepositions. In this short survey; we classify spatio-temporal access methods for each directionbased on their underlying structure with a brief discussion of future research directions.,IEEE Data Eng.

Sea-cnn: Scalable processing of continuous k-nearest neighbor queries in spatio-temporal databases,Xiaopeng Xiong; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Location-aware environments are characterized by a large number of objects and a largenumber of continuous queries. Both the objects and continuous queries may change theirlocations over time. In this paper; we focus on continuous k-nearest neighbor queries(CKNN; for short). We present a new algorithm; termed SEA-CNN; for answeringcontinuously a collection of concurrent CKNN queries. SEA-CNN has two important features:incremental evaluation and shared execution. SEA-CNN achieves both efficiency andscalability in the presence of a set of concurrent queries. Furthermore; SEA-CNN does notmake any assumptions about the movement of objects; eg; the objects velocities and shapesof trajectories; or about the mutability of the objects and/or the queries; ie; moving orstationary queries issued on moving or stationary objects.

Scheduling for shared window joins over data streams,Moustafa A Hammad; Michael J Franklin; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract Continuous Query (CQ) systems typically exploit commonality among queryexpressions to achieve improved efficiency through shared processing. Recently proposedCQ systems have introduced window specifications in order to support unbounded datastreams. There has been; however; little investigation of sharing for windowed queryoperators. In this paper; we address the shared execution of windowed joins; a coreoperator for CQ systems. We show that the strategy used in systems to date has a previouslyunreported performance flaw that can negatively impact queries with relatively smallwindows. We then propose two new execution strategies for shared joins. We evaluate thealternatives using both analytical models and implementation in a DBMS. The results showthat one strategy; called MQT; provides the best performance over a range of workload …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,207,3
Periodicity detection in time series databases,Mohamed G Elfeky; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Periodicity mining is used for predicting trends in time series data. Discovering the rate atwhich the time series is periodic has always been an obstacle for fully automated periodicitymining. Existing periodicity mining algorithms assume that the periodicity; rate (or simply theperiod) is user-specified. This assumption is a considerable limitation; especially in timeseries data where the period is not known a priori. In this paper; we address the problem ofdetecting the periodicity rate of a time series database. Two types of periodicities aredefined; and a scalable; computationally efficient algorithm is proposed for each type. Thealgorithms perform in O (n log n) time for a time series of length n. Moreover; the proposedalgorithms are extended in order to discover the periodic patterns of unknown periods at thesame time without affecting the time complexity. Experimental results show that the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,205,14
Casper*: Query processing for location services without compromising privacy,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract In this article; we present a new privacy-aware query processing framework;Capser*; in which mobile and stationary users can obtain snapshot and/or continuouslocation-based services without revealing their private location information. In particular; wepropose a privacy-aware query processor embedded inside a location-based databaseserver to deal with snapshot and continuous queries based on the knowledge of the user'scloaked location rather than the exact location. Our proposed privacy-aware queryprocessor is completely independent of how we compute the user's cloaked location. Inother words; any existing location anonymization algorithms that blur the user's privatelocation into cloaked rectilinear areas can be employed to protect the user's location privacy.We first propose a privacy-aware query processor that not only supports three new …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,191,20

Doing so taps the wellspring of information technologybenefits that have driven down off-the-shelf component costs and fuelled an unprecedentedimprovement rate in the cost-performance ratio. We can view a digital government (DG) asan amalgam of heterogeneous information systems in which government agencies andpublic and private sectors exchange a high volume of information.

ClassView: hierarchical video shot classification; indexing; and accessing,Jianping Fan; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Xingquan Zhu; Walid G Aref; Lide Wu,Recent advances in digital video compression and networks have made video moreaccessible than ever. However; the existing content-based video retrieval systems still sufferfrom the following problems. 1) Semantics-sensitive video classification problem because ofthe semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic visual concepts;2) Integrated video access problem because of the lack of efficient video database indexing;automatic video annotation; and concept-oriented summary organization techniques. In thispaper; we have proposed a novel framework; called ClassView; to make some advancestoward more efficient video database indexing and access. 1) A hierarchical semantics-sensitive video classifier is proposed to shorten the semantic gap.

R-trees with update memos,Xiaopeng Xiong; Walid G Aref,The problem of frequently updating multi-dimensional indexes arises in many location-dependent applications. While the R-tree and its variants are one of the dominant choicesfor indexing multi-dimensional objects; the R-tree exhibits inferior performance in thepresence of frequent updates. In this paper; we present an R-tree variant; termed the RUM-tree (stands for R-tree with Update Memo) that minimizes the cost of object updates. TheRUM-tree processes updates in a memo-based approach that avoids disk accesses forpurging old entries during an update process. Therefore; the cost of an update operation inthe RUM-tree reduces to the cost of only an insert operation. The removal of old objectentries is carried out by a garbage cleaner inside the RUM-tree. In this paper; we present thedetails of the RUM-tree and study its properties. Theoretical analysis and experimental …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Hash-merge join: A non-blocking join algorithm for producing fast and early join results,Mohamed F Mokbel; Ming Lu; Walid G Aref,We introduce the hash-merge join algorithm (HMJ; for short); a new nonblocking joinalgorithm that deals with data items from remote sources via unpredictable; slow; or burstynetwork traffic. The HMJ algorithm is designed with two goals in mind:(1) minimize the timeto produce the first few results; and (2) produce join results even if the two sources of the joinoperator occasionally get blocked. The HMJ algorithm has two phases: The hashing phaseand the merging phase. The hashing phase employs an in-memory hash-based joinalgorithm that produces join results as quickly as data arrives. The merging phase isresponsible for producing join results if the two sources are blocked. Both phases of the HMJalgorithm are connected via a flushing policy that flushes in-memory parts into disk storageonce the memory is exhausted. Experimental results show that HMJ combines the …,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,152,4

Rank-aware query optimization,Ihab F Ilyas; Rahul Shah; Walid G Aref; Jeffrey Scott Vitter; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract Ranking is an important property that needs to be fully supported by currentrelational query engines. Recently; several rank-join query operators have been proposedbased on rank aggregation algorithms. Rank-join operators progressively rank the joinresults while performing the join operation. The new operators have a direct impact ontraditional query processing and optimization. We introduce a rank-aware query optimizationframework that fully integrates rank-join operators into relational query engines. Theframework is based on extending the System R dynamic programming algorithm in bothenumeration and pruning. We define ranking as an interesting property that triggers thegeneration of rank-aware query plans. Unlike traditional join operators; optimizing for rank-join operators depends on estimating the input cardinality of these operators.

Stream window join: Tracking moving objects in sensor-network databases,Moustafa A Hammad; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,The widespread use of sensor networks presents revolutionary opportunities for life andenvironmental science applications. Many of these applications involve continuous queriesthat require the tracking; monitoring; and correlation of multi-sensor data that representmoving objects. We propose to answer these queries using a multi-way stream window joinoperator. This form of join over multi-sensor data must cope with the infinite nature of sensordata streams and the delays in network transmission. The paper introduces a class of joinalgorithms; termed W-join; for joining multiple infinite data streams. W-join addresses theinfinite nature of the data streams by joining stream data items that lie within a slidingwindow and that match a certain join condition. W-join can be used to track the motion of amoving object or detect the propagation of clouds of hazardous material or pollution spills …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2003. 15th International Conference on,2003,137,12

Analysis of multi-dimensional space-filling curves,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel,Abstract A space-filling curve is a way of mapping the multi-dimensional space into the 1-Dspace. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (or pixel) in the D-dimensional space so that every cell is visited exactly once. There are numerous kinds ofspace-filling curves. The difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to the 1-D space. Selecting the appropriate curve for any application requires knowledge of themapping scheme provided by each space-filling curve. A space-filling curve consists of a setof segments. Each segment connects two consecutive multi-dimensional points. Fivedifferent types of segments are distinguished; namely; Jump; Contiguity; Reverse; Forward;and Still.

Efficient evaluation of continuous range queries on moving objects,D Kalashnikov; Sunil Prabhakar; Susanne Hambrusch; Walid Aref,Abstract In this paper we evaluate several in-memory algorithms for efficient and scalableprocessing of continuous range queries over collections of moving objects. Constantupdates to the index are avoided by query indexing. No constraints are imposed on thespeed or path of moving objects. We present a detailed analysis of a grid approach whichshows the best results for both skewed and uniform data. A sorting based optimization isdeveloped for significantly improving the cache hit ratio. Experimental evaluationestablishes that indexing queries using the Grid index yields orders of magnitude betterperformance than other index structures such as R*-trees.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,117,10
Extending a DBMS with spatial operations,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract A central problem in modern database design is how to resolve spatial operationswith normal database operations in an extended relational database environment. A dataarchitecture that matches the requirements for efficient processing of spatial queries in theextended database environment is proposed. It provides an equal opportunity for both thespatial components and the non-spatial components of the data to participate in queryprocessing and optimization. The notion of extended operators to integrate homogeneouslyboth spatial and non-spatial operations is introduced. Although intended primarily for spatialdata; extended operators also provide a proper interface for integrating multi-media data intoa database environment. The implications of this data architecture are presented. Theyinclude their effects on standard database operations; how spatial operations are …,Symposium on Spatial Databases,1991,112,22
Incremental; online; and merge mining of partial periodic patterns in time-series databases,Walid G Aref; Mohamed G Elfeky; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Mining of periodic patterns in time-series databases is an interesting data mining problem. Itcan be envisioned as a tool for forecasting and prediction of the future behavior of time-series data. Incremental mining refers to the issue of maintaining the discovered patternsover time in the presence of more items being added into the database. Because of themostly append only nature of updating time-series data; incremental mining would be veryeffective and efficient. Several algorithms for incremental mining of partial periodic patternsin time-series databases are proposed and are analyzed empirically. The new algorithmsallow for online adaptation of the thresholds in order to produce interactive mining of partialperiodic patterns. The storage overhead of the incremental online mining algorithms isanalyzed. Results show that the storage overhead for storing the intermediate data …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,110,7
Efficient processing of window queries in the pyramid data structure,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract Window operations serve as the basis of a number of queries that can be posed ina spatial database. Examples of these window-based queries include the exist query (ie;determining whether or not a spatial feature exists inside a window) and the report query;(ie;reporting the identity of all the features that exist inside a window). Algorithms are describedfor answering window queries in &Ogr;(n log log T) time for a window of size nxn in a featurespace (eg; an image) of size T x T (eg; pixel elements). The significance of this result is thateven though the window contains n 2 pixel elements; the worst-case time complexity of thealgorithms is almost linearly proportional (and not quadratic) to the window diameter; anddoes not depend on other factors.

SOLE: scalable on-line execution of continuous queries on spatio-temporal data streams,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper presents the scalable on-line execution (SOLE) algorithm for continuousand on-line evaluation of concurrent continuous spatio-temporal queries over data streams.Incoming spatio-temporal data streams are processed in-memory against a set ofoutstanding continuous queries. The SOLE algorithm utilizes the scarce memory resourceefficiently by keeping track of only the significant objects. In-memory stored objects areexpired (ie; dropped) from memory once they become insignificant. SOLE is a scalablealgorithm where all the continuous outstanding queries share the same buffer pool.

Exploring video content structure for hierarchical summarization,Xingquan Zhu; Xindong Wu; Jianping Fan; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Walid G Aref,Abstract. In this paper; we propose a hierarchical video summarization strategy that exploresvideo content structure to provide the users with a scalable; multilevel video summary. First;video-shot-segmentation and keyframe-extraction algorithms are applied to parse videosequences into physical shots and discrete keyframes. Next; an affinity (self-correlation)matrix is constructed to merge visually similar shots into clusters (supergroups). Since videoshots with high similarities do not necessarily imply that they belong to the same story unit;temporal information is adopted by merging temporally adjacent shots (within a specifieddistance) from the supergroup into each video group. A video-scene-detection algorithm isthus proposed to merge temporally or spatially correlated video groups into scenario units.This is followed by a scene-clustering algorithm that eliminates visual redundancy among …,Multimedia Systems,2004,89,1
Incremental evaluation of sliding-window queries over data streams,Thanaa M Ghanem; Moustafa A Hammad; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Two research efforts have been conducted to realize sliding-window queries in data streammanagement systems; namely; query revaluation and incremental evaluation. In the queryreevaluation method; two consecutive windows are processed independently of each other.On the other hand; in the incremental evaluation method; the query answer for a window isobtained incrementally from the answer of the preceding window. In this paper; we focus onthe incremental evaluation method. Two approaches have been adopted for the incrementalevaluation of sliding-window queries; namely; the input-triggered approach and the negativetuples approach.

Multiple and partial periodicity mining in time series databases,Christos Berberidis; Walid G Aref; Mikhail Atallah; Ioannis Vlahavas; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract. Periodicity search in time series is a problem that has been investigated bymathematicians in various areas; such as statistics; economics; and digital signalprocessing. For large databases of time series data; scalability becomes an issue thattraditional techniques fail to address. In existing time series mining algorithms for detectingperiodic patterns; the period length is userspecified. This is a drawback especially fordatasets where no period length is known in advance. We propose an algorithm that extractsa set of candidate periods featured in a time series that satisfy a minimum confidencethreshold; by utilizing the autocorrelation function and FFT as a filter.

Query processing in broadcasted spatial index trees,Susanne Hambrusch; Chuan-Ming Liu; Walid G Aref; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract The broadcasting of spatial data together with an index structure is an effective wayof disseminating data in a wireless mobile environment. Mobile clients requesting data tuneinto a continuous broadcast only when spatial data of interest and relevance is available onthe channel and thus minimize their power consumption. A mobile client experienceslatency (time elapsed from requesting to receiving data) and tuning time (the amount of timespent listening to the channel). This paper studies the execution of spatial queries onbroadcasted tree-based spatial index structures. The focus is on queries that require apartial traversal of the spatial index; not only a single-path root-to-leaf search.

WARP: time warping for periodicity detection,Mohamed G Elfeky; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Periodicity mining is used for predicting trends in time series data. Periodicity detection is anessential process in periodicity mining to discover potential periodicity rates. Existingperiodicity detection algorithms do not take into account the presence of noise; which isinevitable in almost every real-world time series data. In this paper; we tackle the problem ofperiodicity detection in the presence of noise. We propose a new periodicity detectionalgorithm that deals efficiently with all types of noise. Based on time warping; the proposedalgorithm warps (extends or shrinks) the time axis at various locations to optimally removethe noise. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existingperiodicity detection algorithms in terms of noise resiliency.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,75,7
Exploiting predicate-window semantics over data streams,Thanaa M Ghanem; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract The continuous sliding-window query model is used widely in data streammanagement systems where the focus of a continuous query is limited to a set of the mostrecent tuples. In this paper; we show that an interesting and important class of queries overdata streams cannot be answered using the sliding-window query model. Thus; weintroduce a new model for continuous window queries; termed the predicate-window querymodel that limits the focus of a continuous query to the stream tuples that qualify a certainpredicate. Predicate-window queries have some distinguishing characteristics; eg;(1) Thewindow predicate can be defined over any attribute in the stream tuple (ordered orunordered).(2) Stream tuples qualify and disqualify the window predicate in an out-of-ordermanner. In this paper; we discuss the applicability of the predicate-window query model …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2006,73,7
Databases deepen the web,Thanaa M Ghanem; Walid G Aref,The Web has become the preferred medium for many database applications; such as e-commerce and digital libraries. These applications store information in huge databases thatusers access; query; and update through the Web. Database-driven Web sites have theirown interfaces and access forms for creating HTML pages on the fly. Web databasetechnologies define the way that these forms can connect to and retrieve data from databaseservers. The number of database-driven Web sites is increasing exponentially; and each siteis creating pages dynamically-pages that are hard for traditional search engines to reach.Such search engines crawl and index static HTML pages; they do not send queries to Webdatabases. The information hidden inside Web databases is called the" deep Web" incontrast to the" surface Web" that traditional search engines access easily. We expect …,Computer,2004,72,1

Sp-gist: An extensible database index for supporting space partitioning trees,Walid G Aref; Ihab F Ilyas,Abstract Emerging database applications require the use of new indexing structures beyondB-trees and R-trees. Examples are the kD tree; the trie; the quadtree; and their variants. Theyare often proposed as supporting structures in data mining; GIS; and CAD/CAM applications.A common feature of all these indexes is that they recursively divide the space intopartitions. A new extensible index structure; termed SP-GiST is presented that supports thisclass of data structures; mainly the class of space partitioning unbalanced trees. Simplemethod implementations are provided that demonstrate how SP-GiST can behave as a kDtree; a trie; a quadtree; or any of their variants. Issues related to clustering tree nodes intopages as well as concurrency control for SP-GiST are addressed.

An improved automatic isotropic color edge detection technique,Jianping Fan; Walid G Aref; Mohand-Said Hacid; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract In many image processing applications; edge detection is a useful method forobtaining a simplified image that preserves the domain geometric structures and spatialrelationships among variant image components. For providing automatic edge detection;two problems should be solved: one is feature extraction for calculating the edge strength;another is feature classification for automatic edge detection. For solving these twoproblems; we propose an improved automatic edge detection technique. Three colorcomponents of a color image and more potential edge patterns are integrated for solving thefeature extraction problem. A fast entropic thresholding technique is also developed forsolving the feature classification problem.

Adaptive rank-aware query optimization in relational databases,Ihab F Ilyas; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Hicham G Elmongui; Rahul Shah; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,Abstract Rank-aware query processing has emerged as a key requirement in modernapplications. In these applications; efficient and adaptive evaluation of top-k queries is anintegral part of the application semantics. In this article; we introduce a rank-aware queryoptimization framework that fully integrates rank-join operators into relational query engines.The framework is based on extending the System R dynamic programming algorithm in bothenumeration and pruning. We define ranking as an interesting physical property that triggersthe generation of rank-aware query plans. Unlike traditional join operators; optimizing forrank-join operators depends on estimating the input cardinality of these operators. Weintroduce a probabilistic model for estimating the input cardinality; and hence the cost of arank-join operator.

NILE-PDT: A phenomenon detection and tracking framework for data stream management systems,Mohamed H Ali; Walid G Aref; Raja Bose; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Abdelsalam Helal; Ibrahim Kamel; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract In this demo; we present Nile-PDT; a Phenomenon Detection and Trackingframework using the Nile data stream management system. A phenomenon is characterizedby a group of streams showing similar behavior over a period of time. The functionalities ofNile-PDT is split between the Nile server and the Nile-PDT application client. At the serverside; Nile detects phenomenon candidate members and tracks their propagationincrementally through specific sensor network operators. Phenomenon candidate membersare processed at the client side to detect phenomena of interest to a particular application.Nile-PDT is scalable in the number of sensors; the sensor data rates; and the number ofphenomena. Guided by the detected phenomena; Nile-PDT tunes query processing towardssensors that heavily affect the monitoring of phenomenon propagation.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,62,8

Supporting views in data stream management systems,Thanaa M Ghanem; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Per-Åke Larson; Walid G Aref,Abstract In relational database management systems; views supplement basic queryconstructs to cope with the demand for “higher-level” views of data. Moreover; in traditionalquery optimization; answering a query using a set of existing materialized views can yield amore efficient query execution plan. Due to their effectiveness; views are attractive to datastream management systems. In order to support views over streams; a data streammanagement system should employ a closed (or composable) continuous query language.A closed query language is a language in which query inputs and outputs are interpreted inthe same way; hence allowing query composition. This article introduces the SynchronizedSQL (or SyncSQL) query language that defines a data stream as a sequence of modifyoperations against a relation. SyncSQL enables query composition through the unified …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,59,20
Using convolution to mine obscure periodic patterns in one pass,Mohamed G Elfeky; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract The mining of periodic patterns in time series databases is an interesting datamining problem that can be envisioned as a tool for forecasting and predicting the futurebehavior of time series data. Existing periodic patterns mining algorithms either assume thatthe periodic rate (or simply the period) is user-specified; or try to detect potential values forthe period in a separate phase. The former assumption is a considerable disadvantage;especially in time series databases where the period is not known a priori. The latterapproach results in a multi-pass algorithm; which on the other hand is to be avoided inonline environments (eg; data streams). In this paper; we develop an algorithm that minesperiodic patterns in time series databases with unknown or obscure periods such thatdiscovering the period is part of the mining process. Based on convolution; our algorithm …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,59,20
The similarity join database operator,Yasin N Silva; Walid G Aref; Mohamed H Ali,Similarity joins have been studied as key operations in multiple application domains; eg;record linkage; data cleaning; multimedia and video applications; and phenomena detectionon sensor networks. Multiple similarity join algorithms and implementation techniques havebeen proposed. They range from out-of-database approaches for only in-memory andexternal memory data to techniques that make use of standard database operators toanswer similarity joins. Unfortunately; there has not been much study on the role andimplementation of similarity joins as database physical operators. In this paper; we focus onthe study of similarity joins as first-class database operators.

Scalable spatio-temporal continuous query processing for location-aware services,Xiaopeng Xiong; Mohamed F Mokbel; WC Aref; Susanne E Hambrusch; Sunil Prabhakar,Real-time spatio-temporal query processing needs to effectively handle a large number ofmoving objects and continuous spatio-temporal queries. In this paper; we use sharedexecution as a mechanism to support scalability in location-aware servers. Our main idea isto maintain a query table that stores information about continuous spatio-temporal queries.Then; answering spatio-temporal queries is abstracted as a spatial join among the movingobjects and queries. Three query join policies are proposed aiming to minimize the cost ofthe join operation under the shared execution paradigm; namely the clock-triggered joinpolicy; the incremental join policy; and the hot join policy. We introduce the concept of a no-action region that is used in conjunction with the hot join policy. We propose algorithms thatcalculate the no-action region for objects and queries.

Simultaneous processing of read and write requests using optimized storage partitions for read and write request deadlines,*,The disk scheduling system supports the processing of simultaneous storage device readand write requests in a video server environment; thereby supporting both video-on-demandand non-linear editing applications. Read requests are the result of movie viewing; whilewrite requests are the result of video clip editing or movie authoring procedures. Due to real-time demands of movie viewing; read requests have to be fulfilled within certain deadlines;otherwise they are considered lost. Since the data to be written into the storage device isstored in main memory buffers (or write buffers); write requests can be postponed untilcritical read requests are processed. However; write requests still have to be proceededwithin reasonable delays and without the possibility of indefinite postponement. This is dueto the physical constraint of the limited size of the main memory buffers. The new process …,*,2000,57,15
LUGrid: Update-tolerant grid-based indexing for moving objects,Xiaopeng Xiong; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Indexing moving objects is a fundamental issue in spatiotemporal databases. In this paper;we propose an adaptive Lazy-Update Grid-based index (LUGrid; for short) that minimizesthe cost of object updates. LUGrid is designed with two important features; namely; lazyinsertion and lazy deletion. Lazy insertion reduces the update I/Os by adding an additionalmemory-resident layer over the disk index. Lazy deletion reduces update cost by avoidingdeleting single obsolete entry immediately. Instead; the obsolete entries are removed laterby specially designed mechanisms. LUGrid adapts to object distributions through cellsplitting and merging. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that LUGridoutperforms former work by up to eight times when processing intensive updates; whileyielding similar search performance.,Mobile Data Management; 2006.

A delayin the answer to a query gives invalid and obsolete results; simply because moving objectscan change their locations before the query responds. To handle large numbers of spatio-temporal queries efficiently; we propose the idea of sharing as a means to achievescalability. In this paper; we introduce several types of sharing in the context of continuousspatio-temporal queries.

An access control model for video database systems,Elisa Bertino; Moustafa A Hammad; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,ABSTRACT A novel approach for modeling access control in video databases is presented.The proposed access control mechanism uses both the semantics and the structuralcomposition of video data. The unit of authorization; a video element; can either be asequence of video frames or a video object that appears as part of a frame; eg; the face of ananonymous person in an interview. The components of the access control model are thevideo elements; the potential users; and the mode of operation; eg; viewing; or editing.Video elements are specified either explicitly by their identifiers or implicitly by their semanticcon tents; while users are characterized by the user credentials.

The RUM-tree: supporting frequent updates in R-trees using memos,Yasin N Silva; Xiaopeng Xiong; Walid G Aref,Abstract The problem of frequently updating multi-dimensional indexes arises in manylocation-dependent applications. While the R-tree and its variants are the dominant choicesfor indexing multi-dimensional objects; the R-tree exhibits inferior performance in thepresence of frequent updates. In this paper; we present an R-tree variant; termed the RUM-tree (which stands for R-tree with update memo) that reduces the cost of object updates. TheRUM-tree processes updates in a memo-based approach that avoids disk accesses forpurging old entries during an update process. Therefore; the cost of an update operation inthe RUM-tree is reduced to the cost of only an insert operation. The removal of old objectentries is carried out by a garbage cleaner inside the RUM-tree.

The handwritten trie: Indexing electronic ink,Walid Aref; Daniel Barbará; Padmavathi Vallabhaneni,Abstract The emergence of the pen as the main interface device for personal digitalassistants and pen-computers has made handwritten text; and more generally ink; a first-class object. As for any other type of data; the need of retrieval is a prevailing one. Retrievalof handwritten text is more difficult than that of conventional data since it is necessary toidentify a handwritten word given slightly different variations in its shape. The current way ofaddressing this is by using handwriting recognition; which is prone to errors and limits theexpressiveness of ink. Alternatively; one can retrieve from the database handwritten wordsthat are similar to a query handwritten word using techniques borrowed from pattern andspeech recognition. In particular; Hidden Markov Models (HMM) can be used asrepresentatives of the handwritten words in the database. However; using HMM …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,36,10
Accuracy-constrained privacy-preserving access control mechanism for relational data,Zahid Pervaiz; Walid G Aref; Arif Ghafoor; Nagabhushana Prabhu,Access control mechanisms protect sensitive information from unauthorized users. However;when sensitive information is shared and a Privacy Protection Mechanism (PPM) is not inplace; an authorized user can still compromise the privacy of a person leading to identitydisclosure. A PPM can use suppression and generalization of relational data to anonymizeand satisfy privacy requirements; eg; k-anonymity and l-diversity; against identity andattribute disclosure. However; privacy is achieved at the cost of precision of authorizedinformation. In this paper; we propose an accuracy-constrained privacy-preserving accesscontrol framework.

Efficient processing of proximity queries for large databases,Walid G Aref; Daniel Barbara; Stephen Johnson; Sharad Mehrotra,Emerging multimedia applications require database systems to provide support for newtypes of objects and to process queries that may have no parallel in traditional databaseapplications. One such important class of queries are the proximity queries that aims toretrieve objects in the database that are related by a distance metric in a way that isspecified by the query. The importance of proximity queries has earlier been realized indeveloping constructs for visual languages. In this paper; we present algorithms foranswering a class of proximity queries-fixed-radius nearest-neighbor queries over pointobject. Processing proximity queries using existing query processing techniques results inhigh CPU and I/O costs. We develop new algorithms to answer proximity queries overobjects that lie in the one-dimensional space (eg; words in a document). The algorithms …,Data Engineering; 1995.

Similarity queries: their conceptual evaluation; transformations; and processing,Yasin N Silva; Walid G Aref; Per-Ake Larson; Spencer S Pearson; Mohamed H Ali,Abstract Many application scenarios can significantly benefit from the identification andprocessing of similarities in the data. Even though some work has been done to extend thesemantics of some operators; for example join and selection; to be aware of data similarities;there has not been much study on the role and implementation of similarity-awareoperations as first-class database operators. Furthermore; very little work has addressed theproblem of evaluating and optimizing queries that combine several similarity operations. Thefocus of this paper is the study of similarity queries that contain one or multiple first-classsimilarity database operators such as Similarity Selection; Similarity Join; and SimilarityGroup-by. Particularly; we analyze the implementation techniques of several similarityoperators; introduce a consistent and comprehensive conceptual evaluation model for …,The VLDB Journal,2013,33,7
Security and privacy challenges of a digital government,James BD Joshi; Arif Ghafoor; Walid G Aref; Eugene H Spafford,Abstract A digital government can be viewed as an amalgam of heterogeneous informationsystems that exchange high-volume information among government agencies and publicand private sectors engaged in government business. This gives rise to several dauntingmultidomain security challenges as well as concern for citizen privacy. The success of adigital government infrastructure depends on how well it meets these challenges and itspreparedness against numerous potential threats ranging from simple act of hacking tocyber-terrorism. In this chapter; we outline these crucial security and privacy issues andpresent various solutions that are available and need to be further investigated.,*,2002,33,2
Efficient window block retrieval in quadtree-based spatial databases,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract An algorithm is presented to answer window queries in a quadtree-based spatialdatabase environment by retrieving all of the quadtree blocks in the underlying spatialdatabase that cover the quadtree blocks that comprise the window. It works by decomposingthe window operation into sub-operations over smaller window partitions. These partitionsare the quadtree blocks corresponding to the window. Although a block b in the underlyingspatial database may cover several of the smaller window partitions; b is only retrieved oncerather than multiple times. This is achieved by using an auxiliary main memory data structurecalled the active border which requires O (n) additional storage for a window query of sizen× n. As a result; the algorithm generates an optimal number of disk I/O requests to answer awindow query (ie; one request per covering quadtree block).

Performance of multi-dimensional space-filling curves,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel,Abstract A space-filling curve is a way of mapping the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (or pixel) inthe D-dimensional space so that every cell is visited exactly once. There are numerous kindsof space-filling curves. The difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to theone dimensional space. Selecting the appropriate curve for any application requiresknowledge of the mapping scheme provided by each space-filling curve. A space-fillingcurve consists of a set of segments. Each segment connects two consecutive multi-dimensional points. Five different types of segments are distinguished; namely; Jump;Contiguity; Reverse; Forward; and Still. A description vector V=(J; C; R; F; S); where J; C; R;F; and S; are the percentages of Jump; Contiguity; Reverse; Forward; and Still segments …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2002,32,7
Irregularity in multi-dimensional space-filling curves with applications in multimedia databases,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract A space-filling curve is a way of mapping the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (or pixel) inthe N-dimensional space so that every cell is visited at least once. Thus; a space-filling curveimposes a linear order of the cells in the N-dimensional space. There are numerous kinds ofspace-filling curves. The difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to theone-dimensional space. Selecting the appropriate curve for any application requires a briefknowledge of the mapping scheme provided by each space-filling curve. Irregularity isproposed as a quantitative measure of the quality of the mapping of the space-filling curve.Closed formulas are developed to compute the irregularity for any general dimension D withN points in each dimension for different space-filling curves.

SimDB: a similarity-aware database system,Yasin N Silva; Ahmed M Aly; Walid G Aref; Per-Ake Larson,Abstract The identification and processing of similarities in the data play a key role inmultiple application scenarios. Several types of similarity-aware operations have beenstudied in the literature. However; in most of the previous work; similarity-aware operationsare studied in isolation from other regular or similarity-aware operations. Furthermore; mostof the previous research in the area considers a standalone implementation; ie; without anyintegration with a database system. In this demonstration we present SimDB; a similarity-aware database management system. SimDB supports multiple similarity-aware operationsas first-class database operators. We describe the architectural changes to implement thesimilarity-aware operators. In particular; we present the way conventional operators'implementation machinery is extended to support similarity-aware operators.

Bulk operations for space-partitioning trees,Thanaa M Ghanem; Rahul Shah; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,The emergence of extensible index structures; eg; GiST (generalized search tree)[JMHellerstein et al.(1995)] and SP-GiST (space-partitioning generalized search tree)[W. G Arefet al.;(2001)]; calls for a set of extensible algorithms to support different operations (eg;insertion; deletion; and search). Extensible bulk operations (eg; bulk loading and bulkinsertion) are of the same importance and need to be supported in these index engines. Inthis paper; we propose two extensible buffer-based algorithms for bulk operations in theclass of space-partitioning trees; a class of hierarchical data structures that recursivelydecompose the space into disjoint partitions. The main idea of these algorithms is to build anin-memory tree of the target space-partitioning index. Then; data items are recursivelypartitioned into disk-based buffers using the in-memory tree.

Continuous aggregate nearest neighbor queries,Hicham G Elmongui; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of continuous aggregate nearest-neighbor(CANN) queries for moving objects in spatio-temporal data stream management systems. ACANN query specifies a set of landmarks; an integer k; and an aggregate distance function f(eg; min; max; or sum); where f computes the aggregate distance between a moving objectand each of the landmarks. The answer to this continuous query is the set of k movingobjects that have the smallest aggregate distance f. A CANN query may also be viewed as acombined set of nearest neighbor queries. We introduce several algorithms to continuouslyand incrementally answer CANN queries. Extensive experimentation shows that theproposed operators outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by up to a factor of 3 and incurlow memory overhead.,GeoInformatica,2013,29,7
PLACE*: A distributed spatio-temporal data stream management system for moving objects,Xiaopeng Xiong; Hicham G Elmongui; Xiaoyong Chai; Walid G Aref,In this paper; we introduce PLACE*; a distributed spatio-temporal data stream managementsystem for moving objects. PLACE* supports continuous spatio-temporal queries that hopamong a network of regional servers. To minimize the execution cost; a new Query-Track-Participate (QTP) query processing model is proposed inside PLACE*. In the QTP model; aquery is continuously answered by a querying server; a tracking server; and a set ofparticipating servers. In this paper; we focus on query plan generation; execution andupdate algorithms for continuous range queries in PLACE* using QTP. An extensiveexperimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in PLACE*.,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,28,15

Hashing by proximity to process duplicates in spatial databases,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract In a spatial database; an object may extend arbitrarily in space. As a result; manyspatial data structures (eg; the quadtree; the cell tree; the R+-tree) represent an object bypartitioning it into multiple; yet simple; pieces; each of which is stored separately inside thedata structure. Many operations on these data structures are likely to produce duplicateresults because of the multiplicity of object pieces. A novel approach for duplicateprocessing based on proximity of spatial objects is presented. This is different fromconventional duplicate elimination in database systems because; with spatial databases;different pieces of the same object can span multiple buckets of the underlying datastructure. Example algorithms are presented to perform duplicate processing using proximityfor quadtree representation of line segments and arbitrary rectangles.

Stagger: Periodicity mining of data streams using expanding sliding windows,Mohamed G Elfeky; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Sensor devices are becoming ubiquitous; especially in measurement and monitoringapplications. Because of the real-time; append-only and semi-infinite natures of thegenerated sensor data streams; an online incremental approach is a necessity for miningstream data types. In this paper; we propose STAGGER: a one-pass; online and incrementalalgorithm for mining periodic patterns in data streams. STAGGER does not require that theuser pre-specify the periodicity rate of the data. Instead; STAGGER discovers the potentialperiodicity rates. STAGGER maintains multiple expanding sliding windows staggered overthe stream; where computations are shared among the multiple overlapping windows. Small-length sliding windows are imperative for early and real-time output; yet are limited todiscover short periodicity rates. As streamed data arrives continuously; the sliding …,Data Mining; 2006.

An extensible index for spatial databases,Walid G Aref; Ihab F Ilyas,Emerging database applications require the use of new indexing structures beyond B-treesand R-trees. Examples are the kD tree; the trie; the quadtree; and their variants. They areoften proposed as supporting structures in data mining; GIS; and CAD/CAM applications. Acommon feature of all these indexes is that they recursively divide the spare into partitions. Anovel extensible index structure; termed SP-GiST; is presented that supports this class ofdata structure; mainly the class of space partitioning unbalanced trees. Simple methodimplementations are provided that demonstrate how SP-GiST can behave as a kD tree; atrie; a quadtree; or any of their variants. Issues related to clustering tree nodes into pages aswell as concurrency control for SP-GiST are addressed.

Window query processing in linear quadtrees,Ashraf Aboulnaga; Walid G Aref,Abstract The linear quadtree is a spatial access method that is built by decomposing thespatial objects in a database into quadtree blocks and storing these quadtree blocks in a B-tree. The linear quadtree is very useful for geographic information systems because itprovides good query performance while using existing B-tree implementations. An algorithmand a cost model are presented for processing window queries in linear quadtrees. Thealgorithm can handle query windows of any shape in the general case of spatial databaseswith overlapping objects. The algorithm recursively decomposes the space into quadtreeblocks; and uses the quadtree blocks overlapping the query window to search the B-tree.The cost model estimates the I/O cost of processing window queries using the algorithm. Thecost model is also based on a recursive decomposition of the space; and it uses very …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2001,26,14
Locationspark: A distributed in-memory data management system for big spatial data,Mingjie Tang; Yongyang Yu; Qutaibah M Malluhi; Mourad Ouzzani; Walid G Aref,Abstract We present LocationSpark; a spatial data processing system built on top of ApacheSpark; a widely used distributed data processing system. LocationSpark offers a rich set ofspatial query operators; eg; range search; kNN; spatio-textual operation; spatial-join; andkNN-join. To achieve high performance; LocationSpark employs various spatial indexes forin-memory data; and guarantees that immutable spatial indexes have low overhead withfault tolerance. In addition; we build two new layers over Spark; namely a query schedulerand a query executor. The query scheduler is responsible for mitigating skew in spatialqueries; while the query executor selects the best plan based on the indexes and the natureof the spatial queries. Furthermore; to avoid unnecessary network communication overheadwhen processing overlapped spatial data; We embed an efficient spatial Bloom filter into …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,25,10

On local heuristics to speed up polygon-polygon intersection tests,Wael M Badawy; Walid G Aref,ABSTRACT The polygon-polygon intersection operation is CPU-intensive. Many datastructures look into decomposing the polygons into multiple yet simple pieces to speed upthe polygon-polygon intersection operation. This paper addresses local heuristics that canbe adopted in these data structures by using local information about the simple polygonpieces to decide upon polygon-polygon intersections without having to perform this costlyoperation. The significance and effectiveness of each of the heuristics is studied. The paperalso shows how these heuristics can be put together to perform a polygon join operation.Experiments are given to demonstrate the savings both in CPU and in I/O that result fromthese local heuristics.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,1999,25,7

AQWA: adaptive query workload aware partitioning of big spatial data,Ahmed M Aly; Ahmed R Mahmood; Mohamed S Hassan; Walid G Aref; Mourad Ouzzani; Hazem Elmeleegy; Thamir Qadah,Abstract The unprecedented spread of location-aware devices has resulted in a plethora oflocation-based services in which huge amounts of spatial data need to be efficientlyprocessed by large-scale computing clusters. Existing cluster-based systems for processingspatial data employ static data-partitioning structures that cannot adapt to data changes; andthat are insensitive to the query workload. Hence; these systems are incapable ofconsistently providing good performance. To close this gap; we present AQWA; an adaptiveand query-workload-aware mechanism for partitioning large-scale spatial data. AQWA doesnot assume prior knowledge of the data distribution or the query workload. Instead; as datais consumed and queries are processed; the data partitions are incrementally updated.

Scalable multimedia disk scheduling,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Khaled Elbassioni; Ibrahim Kamel,A new multimedia disk-scheduling algorithm; termed Cascaded-SFC; is presented. TheCascaded-SFC multimedia disk scheduler is applicable in environments where multimediadata requests arrive with different quality of service (QoS) requirements such as real-timedeadline and user priority. Previous work on disk scheduling has focused on optimizing theseek times and/or meeting the real-time deadlines. The Cascaded-SFC disk schedulerprovides a unified framework for multimedia disk scheduling that scales with the number ofscheduling parameters.

Disk scheduling in video editing systems,Walid G.  Aref; Ibrahim Kamel; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Modern video servers support both video-on-demand and nonlinear editing applications.Video-on-demand servers enable the user to view video clips or movies from a videodatabase; while nonlinear editing systems enable the user to manipulate the content of thevideo database.

Video server scheduling for simultaneous read-write requests,*,A process is presented for supporting simultaneous disk read and write requests in a videoserver environment. Read requests are the result of movie viewing; while write requests arethe result of video clip editing or movie authoring procedures. Due to real-time demands ofmovie viewing; read requests have to be fulfilled within certain deadlines; otherwise they areconsidered lost. Since the data to be written into disk is stored in main memory buffers; writerequests can be postponed until critical read requests are processed. However; writerequests still have to be proceeded within reasonable delays and without the possibility ofindefinite postponement. This is due to the physical constraint of the limited size of the mainmemory write buffers. The new process schedules both read and write requestsappropriately; to minimize the amount of disk reads that do not meet their presentation …,*,2001,24,11
Incremental mining for frequent patterns in evolving time series datatabases,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Mourad Ouzzani; Mohamed A Khalil; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract Several emerging applications warrant mining and discovering hidden frequentpatterns in time series databases; eg; sensor networks; environment monitoring; andinventory stock monitoring. Time series databases are characterized by two features:(1) Thecontinuous arrival of data and (2) the time dimension. These features raise new challengesfor data mining such as the need for online processing and incremental evaluation of themining results. In this paper; we address the problem of discovering frequent patterns indatabases with multiple time series. We propose an incremental technique for discoveringthe complete set of frequent patterns; ie; discovering the frequent patterns over the entiretime series in contrast to a sliding window over a portion of the time series. The proposedapproach updates the mining results with the arrival of every new data item by …,*,2008,23,12
Spatio-temporal histograms,Hicham G Elmongui; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper presents a framework for building and continuously maintaining spatio-temporal histograms (ST-Histograms; for short). ST-Histograms are used for selectivityestimation of continuous pipelined query operators. Unlike traditional histograms thatexamine and/or sample all incoming data tuples; ST-Histograms are built by monitoring theactual selectivities of the outstanding continuous queries. ST-Histograms have three mainfeatures:(1) The ST-Histograms are built with (almost) no overhead to the system. We useonly feedback (ie; the actual selectivity) from the existing continuous queries.(2) Rather thanwasting system resources in maintaining accurate histograms for the whole spatial space;we only maintain accurate histograms for that part of the space that is relevant to the currentexisting queries. The rest of the space has less accurate histograms.(3) The ST …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,22,7

Decomposing a window into maximal quadtree blocks,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract Window operations serve as the basis of a number of queries that can be posed ina spatial database. Examples of window-based queries include the exist query (ie;determining whether or not a spatial feature exists inside a window); the report query (ie;report the identity of all the features that exist inside a window); and the select query (ie;determine the locations covered by a given feature inside a window). Often spatialdatabases make use of a quadtree decomposition; which yields a set of maximal blocks; toenable the features to be accessed quickly without having to search the entire database.One way to perform a window query is to decompose the window into its maximal quadtreeblocks.

Supporting electronic ink databases,Walid Aref; Daniel Barbará,Abstract The emergence of the pen as the main interface device for personal digitalassistants and pen-computers has made handwritten text; and more generally ink; a first-class object. As for any other type of data; the need of retrieval is a prevailing one. Retrievalof handwritten text is more difficult than that of conventional data since it is necessary toidentify a handwritten word given slightly different variations in its shape. The current way ofaddressing this is by using handwriting recognition; which is prone to errors and limits theexpressiveness of ink.

An approach to information management in geographical applications,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract The design of an integrated system is described for combining spatial andnonspatial attribute data to allow fast query handling. By fast it is meant that search queriescan be executed in logarithmic time. Nonspatial attribute data is managed by standarddatabase techniques. Efficient and robust spatial data structures are used to store spatialinformation. In addition to the standard access methods usually provided for accessingattribute data (ie through the data base management system); data can also be accessedthrough the spatial data structures in a homogeneous way that is transparent to the user.The design makes use of an SQL-like interface. The SQL query language is extended toprovide efficient access methods to spatial structures; and to match functional and efficiencyrequirements desired from a combination of spatial and nonspatial information.

Hierarchical video summarization for medical data,Xingquan Zhu; Jianping Fan; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Walid G Aref,To provide users with an overview of medical video content at various levels of abstractionwhich can be used for more efficient database browsing and access; a hierarchical videosummarization strategy has been developed and is presented in this paper. To generate anoverview; the key frames of a video are preprocessed to extract special frames (blackframes; slides; clip art; sketch drawings) and special regions (faces; skin or blood-red areas).A shot grouping method is then applied to merge the spatially or temporally related shotsinto groups. The visual features and knowledge from the video shots are integrated to assignthe groups into predefined semantic categories. Based on the video groups and theirsemantic categories; video summaries for different levels are constructed by group merging;hierarchical group clustering and semantic category selection. Based on this strategy; a …,Storage and Retrieval for Media Databases 2002,2001,17,7
Seamless scalable distributed media server,*,The distributed multimedia server employs modular server elements that connect with clientsystems through a high bandwidth network. The server elements are connected ininterleaved fashion with the switching elements and the data representing different mediaselections are arranged in stripe groups distributed across the server elements. The servercan be as small as a single server element or grown incrementally; as needed; byconnecting additional server elements to the system. Multiple copies of hot media selectionsare stored across the distributed architecture within different stripe groups to minimizebottlenecks within the storage subsystem.,*,2000,17,1
Spatial queries with two kNN predicates,Ahmed M Aly; Walid G Aref; Mourad Ouzzani,Abstract The widespread use of location-aware devices has led to countless location-basedservices in which a user query can be arbitrarily complex; ie; one that embeds multiplespatial selection and join predicates. Amongst these predicates; the k-Nearest-Neighbor(kNN) predicate stands as one of the most important and widely used predicates. Unlikerelated research; this paper goes beyond the optimization of queries with single kNNpredicates; and shows how queries with two kNN predicates can be optimized. In particular;the paper addresses the optimization of queries with:(i) two kNN-select predicates;(ii) twokNN-join predicates; and (iii) one kNN-join predicate and one kNN-select predicate. Foreach type of queries; conceptually correct query evaluation plans (QEPs) and newalgorithms that optimize the query execution time are presented.

Efficient query execution on broadcasted index tree structures,Susanne Hambrusch; Chuan-Ming Liu; Walid G Aref; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract The continuous broadcast of data together with an index structure is an effectiveway of disseminating data in a wireless mobile environment. The index allows a mobileclient to tune in only when relevant data is available on the channel and leads to reducedpower consumption for the clients. This paper investigates the execution of queries onbroadcasted index trees when query execution corresponds to a partial traversal of the tree.Queries exhibiting this behavior include range queries and nearest neighbor queries. Wepresent two broadcast schedules for index trees and two query algorithms executed bymobile clients. Our solutions simultaneously minimize tuning time and latency and adapt tothe client's available memory.

Tornado: A distributed spatio-textual stream processing system,Ahmed R Mahmood; Ahmed M Aly; Thamir Qadah; El Kindi Rezig; Anas Daghistani; Amgad Madkour; Ahmed S Abdelhamid; Mohamed S Hassan; Walid G Aref; Saleh Basalamah,Abstract The widespread use of location-aware devices together with the increasedpopularity of micro-blogging applications (eg; Twitter) led to the creation of large streams ofspatio-textual data. In order to serve real-time applications; the processing of these large-scale spatio-textual streams needs to be distributed. However; existing distributed streamprocessing systems (eg; Spark and Storm) are not optimized for spatial/textual content. Inthis demonstration; we introduce Tornado; a distributed in-memory spatio-textual streamprocessing server that extends Storm. To efficiently process spatio-textual streams; Tornadointroduces a spatio-textual indexing layer to the architecture of Storm. The indexing layer isadaptive; ie; dynamically re-distributes the processing across the system according tochanges in the data distribution and/or query workload.

Video query processing in the VDBMS testbed for video database research,Walid Aref; Moustafa Hammad; Ann Christine Catlin; Ihab Ilyas; Thanaa Ghanem; Ahmed Elmagarmid; Mirette Marzouk,Abstract The increased use of video data sets for multimedia-based applications has createda demand for strong video database support; including efficient methods for handling thecontent-based query and retrieval of video data. Video query processing presents significantresearch challenges; mainly associated with the size; complexity and unstructured nature ofvideo data. A video query processor must support video operations for search by contentand streaming; new query types; and the incorporation of video methods and operators ingenerating; optimizing and executing query plans.

Query processing of multi-way stream window joins,Moustafa A Hammad; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract This paper introduces a class of join algorithms; termed W-join; for joining multipleinfinite data streams. W-join addresses the infinite nature of the data streams by joiningstream data items that lie within a sliding window and that match a certain join condition. Inaddition to its general applicability in stream query processing; W-join can be used to trackthe motion of a moving object or detect the propagation of clouds of hazardous material orpollution spills over time in a sensor network environment. We describe two new algorithmsfor W-join and address variations and local/global optimizations related to specifying thenature of the window constraints to fulfill the posed queries. The performance of theproposed algorithms is studied experimentally in a prototype stream database system; usingsynthetic data streams and real time-series data.

Optimizing in-order execution of continuous queries over streamed sensor data,Moustafa Hammad; Walid Aref; Ahmed Elmagarmid,The widespread use of sensor networks in scientific and engineering applications leads toincreased demand on the efficient computation of the collected sensor data. Recentresearch in sensor and stream data systems adopts the notion of sliding windows to processcontinuous queries over infinite sensor readings. Ordered processing of input data isessential during query execution for many application scenarios. In this paper we presentthree approaches for ordered execution of continuous sliding window queries over sensordata. The first approach enforces ordered processing at the input side of the query executionplan. In the second approach we utilize the advantage of out-of-order execution to optimizequery operators and enforce an ordered release of the output results. The third approach isadaptive and switches between the first and second approaches to achieve the best …,*,2004,14,7
Algorithm for fast forward and fast rewind of MPEG streams,*,A transport system allows delivery of MPEG video streams from a network server to a mediaclient while avoiding network delays associated with transition between files contained inthese streams. A buffering system; a transport controller; and a counter allow buffering andinterim delivery of MPEG stream data. The transport controller can either deliver MPEGstream data directly to the media client; or route data through the buffering system. Thebuffering system includes a population buffer for storage of interim MPEG stream data; and atransport buffer for temporary storage of MPEG stream data during continuous delivery.During transitional delivery; the transport controller delivers interim data to the media clientuntil the requested file is available and uses the counter to select the proper start location inthe requested file.,*,2000,14,10
Irregularity in high-dimensional space-filling curves,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract A space-filling curve is a way of mapping the discrete multi-dimensional space intothe one-dimensional space. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (orpixel) in the discrete multi-dimensional space so that every cell is visited exactly once. Thus;a space-filling curve imposes a linear order of the cells in the multi-dimensional space.There are numerous kinds of space-filling curves. The difference between such curves is intheir way of mapping to the one-dimensional space. Selecting the appropriate curve for anyapplication requires knowledge of the mapping scheme provided by each space-fillingcurve. Irregularity is proposed as a quantitative measure for the ordering quality imposed byspace-filling curve mapping. The lower the irregularity the better the space-filling curve inpreserving the order of the discrete multi-dimensional space. Five space-filling curves …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2011,13,4
A distributed database server for continuous media,Walid G Aref; Ann Christine Catlin; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Jianping Fan; J Guo; M Hammad; Ihab F Ilyas; Mirette S Marzouk; Sunil Prabhakar; Abdelmounaam Rezgui; S Teoh; Evimaria Terzi; Y Tu; Athena Vakali; XQ Zhu,In our project; we are adopting a new approach for handling video data.

PREDATORuses Shore as the underlying storage manager. Supporting video operations (storing;searching-by-content and streaming) and new query types (query-by-example and multi-feature similarity searching) requires major changes in many of the traditional systemcomponents. More specifically; the storage and buffer manager has to deal with hugevolumes of data with real-time constraints.

Cascaded spatial join algorithms with spatially sorted output,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract The spatial join is an operation that combines entities from two spatial data sets intoa single entity whenever the combination satisfies the spatial join condition(eg; if theyoverlap in space). Linear quadtrees and the Z-order are two widely-used data structures fororganizing spatial databases. They are based on the concept of recursive decomposition ofspace. For spatial databases using recursive decomposition; algorithms for performingspatial join already exist in the literature. For efficiency purposes; some of these algorithmsrequire that the two input streams of the spatial join be indexed; while other algorithmsrequire that the two input streams be sorted; but not necessarily indexed. These algorithmssuffer from the fact that they produce spatially un-ordered output; ie; their output is not sorted.As a result; they cannot be used efficiently to answer complex spa-t. ial queries that …,Proceedings of the 4th ACM international workshop on Advances in geographic information systems,1996,13,7
Estimating Selectivity Factors of Spatial Operations.,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract Selectivity factors for some widely used spatial operations are de ned in the contextof spatial data structures that partition spatial objects into more than one piece. In relationaldatabases; a selectivity factor helps estimate the size of the output relation (ie; a onedimensional selectivity factor). On the other hand; spatial data sets and spatial operationsrequire selectivity factors of higher dimensionality (eg; two-dimensional selectivity factors).Two types of selectivity factors are de ned for spatial operations: the object-selectivity factorand block-(or piece-) selectivity factor; which estimate the number of objects and object-pieces; respectively; that result from a spatial operation. Both factors are useful for cost-based spatial query optimization purposes. The spatial operations considered are windowintersection and spatial join. Formulas for estimating both types of selectivity factors are …,FMLDO,1993,13,10

Challenges in spatiotemporal stream query optimization,Hicham G Elmongui; Mourad Ouzzani; Walid G Aref,Abstract Simplified technology and low costs have spurred the use of location-detectiondevices in moving objects. Usually; these devices will send the moving objects' locationinformation to a spatio-temporal data stream management system; which will be thenresponsible for answering spatio-temporal queries related to these moving objects. A largespectrum of research have been devoted to continuous spatio-temporal query processing.However; we argue that several outstanding challenges have been either addressedpartially or not at all in the existing literature. In particular; in this paper; we focus on theoptimization of multi-predicate spatio-temporal queries on moving objects. We presentseveral major challenges related to the lack of spatio-temporal pipelined operators; and theimpact of time; space; and their combination on the query plan optimality under different …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2006,12,7
Query processing using negative tuples in stream query engines,T Ghanem; M Hammad; M Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract The concept of Negative Tuples (or delete tuples) has been adopted widely in datastream management s. vstems to evaluate continuous sliding-window queries incrementally.The main idea is to produce a negative tuple for each expired tuple from the sliding\vindow.Thus. various query operators can update their state based on the expired tuples. Negativetv; ples avoid the non-deterministic output delays that result from the commonly used input-triggered approach. However; negative tuples double the number of tuples through thequery pipeline. thus reducing the pipeline bandwidth. In this paper; we put the negativetuples under a magnifying glass where we show its detailed realization in terms of itsgeneration and its processing in various operators. Then; we present several optimizationtechniques that aim to reduce the overhead of the negative tuples approach. These …,*,2004,12,22
Chameleon: Context-awareness inside dbmss,Hicham G Elmongui; Walid G Aref; Mohamed F Mokbel,Context is any information used to characterize the situation of an entity. Examples ofcontexts include time; location; identity; and activity of a user. This paper proposes a generalcontext-aware DBMS; named Chameleon; that will eliminate the need for having specializeddatabase engines; eg; spatial DBMS; temporal DBMS; and Hippocratic DBMS; since space;time; and identity can be treated as contexts in the general context-aware DBMS. InChameleon; we can combine multiple contexts into more complex ones using the proposedcontext composition; eg; a Hippocratic DBMS that also provides spatio-temporal andlocation contextual services. As a proof of concept; we construct two case studies using thesame context-aware DBMS platform within Chameleon.

Realizing privacy-preserving features in hippocratic databases,Yasin Laura-Silva; Walid G Aref,Presenting privacy has become a crucial requirement for operating a business that managespersonal data. Hippocratic databases have been proposed to answer this requirementthrough a database design that includes responsibility for the privacy of data as a foundingtenet. We identify; study; and implement several privacy-preserving features that extend theprevious work on Limiting Disclosure in Hippocratic databases. These features include thesupport of multiple policy versions; retention time; generalization hierarchies; and multipleSQL operations. The proposed features facilitate in making Hippocratic databases one stepcloser to fitting real-world scenarios. We present the design and implementation guidelinesof each of the proposed features. The evaluation of the effect in performance shows that thecost of these extensions is small and scales well to large databases.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,11,4
Scalability management in sensor-network phenomenabases,Mohamed H Ali; Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel,A phenomenon appears in a sensor network when a group of sensors persist to generatesimilar behavior over a period of time. PhenomenaBases (or databases of phenomena) areequipped with phenomena detection and tracking (PDT) techniques that continuously run inthe background of a sensor database system to detect new phenomena and to track alreadyexisting phenomena. The process of phenomena detection and tracking is initiated by amulti-way join operator that comes at the core of PDT techniques to report similar sensorreadings. With the increase in the sensor network size; the join operator (and; consequently;query processing in the PhenomenaBase) face several scalability challenges.

On multi-dimensional sorting orders,Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel,Abstract As multimedia applications grow in complexity; more requirements are imposed onsoftware schedulers. It is not always clear that these schedulers are fair to all aspects of thesystem; or are controllable; in a measurable way; to favor one aspect of the system over theother. The overall goal of this research is to revolutionize the way schedulers are developed.The scheduling problem is formulated as a multi-dimensional sorting problem. Space-fillingcurves are used to define a linear order for sorting and scheduling objects that lie in the multi-dimensional space. The characteristics of various space-filling curves are studied for sortingand scheduling purposes. Performance measures are proposed to compare the bias;among other characteristics; of a space-filling curve towards any of its dimensions.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2000,11,1
Similarity group-by operators for multi-dimensional relational data,Mingjie Tang; Ruby Y Tahboub; Walid G Aref; Mikhail J Atallah; Qutaibah M Malluhi; Mourad Ouzzani; Yasin N Silva,The SQL group-by operator plays an important role in summarizing and aggregating largedatasets in a data analytics stack. While the standard group-by operator; which is based onequality; is useful in several applications; allowing similarity aware grouping provides amore realistic view on real-world data that could lead to better insights. The Similarity SQL-based Group-By operator (SGB; for short) extends the semantics of the standard SQL Group-by by grouping data with similar but not necessarily equal values. While existing similarity-based grouping operators efficiently realize these approximate semantics; they primarilyfocus on one-dimensional attributes and treat multi-dimensional attributes independently.However; correlated attributes; such as in spatial data; are processed independently; andhence; groups in the multi-dimensional space are not detected properly.

Hippocratic PostgreSQL,Jalaja Padma; Yasin N Silva; Muhammad U Arshad; Walid G Aref,Privacy preservation has become an important requirement in information systems that dealwith personal data. In many cases this requirement is imposed by laws that recognize theright of data owners to control whom their information is shared with and the purposes forwhich it can be shared. Hippocratic databases have been proposed as an answer to thisprivacy requirement; they extend the architecture of standard DBMSs with components thatensure personal data is handled in compliance with its associated privacy definitions.Previous work in Hippocratic databases has proposed the design of some of thesecomponents. Unfortunately; there has not been much work done to implement thesecomponents as an integral part of a DBMS and study the problems faced to realize theHippocratic databases.

Spass: Scalable and energy-efficient data acquisition in sensor databases,Mohamed H Ali; Walid G Aref; Cristina Nita-Rotaru,Abstract Scalability and energy management issues are crucial for sensor networkdatabases. In this paper; we introduce the Sharing and PArtitioning of Stream Spectrum(SPASS) protocol as a new approach to provide scalability with respect to the number ofsensors and to manage the power consumption efficiently. The spectrum of a sensor is therange/distribution of values read by that sensor. Close-by sensors tend to give similarreadings and; consequently; exhibit similar spectra. We propose to combine similar spectrainto one global spectrum that is shared by all contributing sensors. Then; the globalspectrum is partitioned among the sensors such that each sensor carries out theresponsibility of managing a partition of the spectrum.

Kangaroo: Workload-aware processing of range data and range queries in hadoop,Ahmed M Aly; Hazem Elmeleegy; Yan Qi; Walid Aref,Abstract Despite the importance and widespread use of range data; eg; time intervals;spatial ranges; etc.; little attention has been devoted to study the processing and querying ofrange data in the context of big data. The main challenge relies in the nature of thetraditional index structures eg; B-Tree and R-Tree; being centralized by nature; and henceare almost crippled when deployed in a distributed environment. To address this challenge;this paper presents Kangaroo; a system built on top of Hadoop to optimize the execution ofrange queries over range data. The main idea behind Kangaroo is to split the data into non-overlapping partitions in a way that minimizes the query execution time. Kangaroo is queryworkload-aware; ie; results in partitioning layouts that minimize the query processing time ofgiven query patterns. In this paper; we study the design challenges Kangaroo addresses …,Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2016,7,15

Spectral LPM: an optimal locality-preserving mapping using the spectral (not fractal) order,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ananth Grama,For the past two decades; fractals (eg; the Hilbert and Peano space-filling curves) have beenconsidered the natural method for providing a locality-preserving mapping. The idea behinda locality-preserving mapping is to map points that are nearby in the multidimensional spaceinto points that are nearby in the one-dimensional space. We argue against the use offractals in locality-preserving mapping algorithms; and present examples with experimentalevidence to show why fractals produce poor locality-preserving mappings. In addition; wepropose an optimal locality-preserving mapping algorithm; termed the spectral locality-preserving mapping algorithm (Spectral LPM; for short); that makes use of the spectrum ofthe multidimensional space. We give a mathematical proof for the optimality of Spectral LPM;and also demonstrate its practical use.,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,7,7

The similarity-aware relational database set operators,Wadha J Al Marri; Qutaibah Malluhi; Mourad Ouzzani; Mingjie Tang; Walid G Aref,Abstract Identifying similarities in large datasets is an essential operation in severalapplications such as bioinformatics; pattern recognition; and data integration. To make arelational database management system similarity-aware; the core relational operators haveto be extended. While similarity-awareness has been introduced in database engines forrelational operators such as joins and group-by; little has been achieved for relational setoperators; namely Intersection; Difference; and Union. In this paper; we propose to extendthe semantics of relational set operators to take into account the similarity of values.

Efficient Processing of Hamming-Distance-Based Similarity-Search Queries Over MapReduce.,Mingjie Tang; Yongyang Yu; Walid G Aref; Qutaibah M Malluhi; Mourad Ouzzani,ABSTRACT Similarity search is crucial to many applications. Of particular interest are twoflavors of the Hamming distance range query; namely; the Hamming select and theHamming join (Hamming-select and Hamming-join; respectively). Hamming distance iswidely used in approximate near neighbor search for high dimensional data; such asimages and document collections. For example; using predefined similarity hash functions;high-dimensional data is mapped into one-dimensional binary codes that are; then linearlyscanned to perform Hamming-distance comparisons.

Exploiting similarity-aware grouping in decision support systems,Yasin N Silva; Muhammad U Arshad; Walid G Aref,Abstract Decision Support Systems (DSS) are information systems that support decisionmaking processes. In many scenarios these systems are built on top of data managed byDBMSs and make extensive use of its underlying grouping and aggregation capabilities; ie;Group-by operation. Unfortunately; the standard grouping operator has the inherentlimitation of being based only on equality; ie; all the tuples in a group share the same valuesof the grouping attributes. Similarity-based Group-by (SGB) has been recently proposed asan extension aimed to overcome this limitation. SGB allows fast formation of groups withsimilar objects under different grouping strategies and the pipelining of results for furtherprocessing. This demonstration presents how SGB can be effectively used to build usefulDSSs. The presented DSS has been built around the data model and queries of the TPC …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,6,7
Broadcasting indexed multidimensional data,Susanne E Hambrusch; Chuan-Ming Liu; Walid G Aref; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract The continuous broadcast of data together with an index structure is an effectiveway of disseminating data in a wireless mobile environment. The index allows a mobileclient to tune in only when relevant data is available on the channel. This mini. mizes thetuning time (ie; the amount of time spent listening to the channel) and thus the powerconsumption experienced by the client.

A Window Retrieval Algorithm for Spatial Databases Using Quadtrees.,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract An algorithm is presented to answer window queries in a quadtree-based spatialdatabase environment by retrieving the covering blocks in the underlying spatial database. Itworks by decomposing the window operation into suboperations over smaller windowpartitions. These partitions are the quadtree blocks corresponding to the window. Although ablock b in the underlying spatial database may cover several of the smaller windowpartitions; b is only retrieved once. As a result; the algorithm generates an optimal number ofdisk I/O requests to answer a window query (ie; one request per covering block). Thealgorithm uses an auxiliary main-memory data structure; called the active border; whichrequires additional storage of O (n); for a window query of size nn. An analysis of thealgorithm's execution time and space requirements are given; as are some experimental …,ACM-GIS,1995,6,7
Query processing and optimization in spatial databases.,Walid Galal Aref,Multimedia applications pose a challenge for database and information retrieval systems.

Precision-bounded access control using sliding-window query views for privacy-preserving data streams,Zahid Pervaiz; Arif Ghafoor; Walid G Aref,Access control mechanisms and Privacy Protection Mechanisms (PPM) have beenproposed for data streams. The access control for a data stream allows roles access totuples satisfying an authorized predicate sliding-window query. Sharing the sensitive streamdata without PPM can compromise the privacy. The PPM meets privacy requirements; eg; k-anonymity or l-diversity by generalization of stream data. Imprecision introduced bygeneralization can be reduced by delaying the publishing of stream data. However; thedelay in sharing the stream tuples to achieve better accuracy can lead to false-negatives ifthe tuples are held by PPM while the query predicate is evaluated. Administrator of anaccess control policy defines the imprecision bound for each query. The challenge for PPMis to optimize the delay in publishing of stream data so that the imprecision bound for the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,5,2
Cost Estimation of Spatial k-Nearest-Neighbor Operators,Ahmed M Aly; Walid G Aref; Mourad Ouzzani,ABSTRACT Advances in geo-sensing technology have led to an unprecedented spread oflocation-aware devices. In turn; this has resulted into a plethora of location-based services inwhich huge amounts of spatial data need to be efficiently consumed by spatial queryprocessors. For a spatial query processor to properly choose among the various queryprocessing strategies; the cost of the spatial operators has to be estimated. In this paper; westudy the problem of estimating the cost of the spatial k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN; for short)operators; namely; k-NN-Select and k-NN-Join. Given a query that has a k-NN operator; theobjective is to estimate the number of blocks that are going to be scanned during theprocessing of this operator. Estimating the cost of a k-NN operator is challenging for severalreasons. For instance; the cost of a k-NN-Select operator is directly affected by the value …,EDBT,2015,5,15
Query processing with K-anonymity,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Jalaja Padma; Yasin N Silva; Pei He; Walid G Aref; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Anonymization techniques are used to ensure the privacy preservation of the dataowners; especially for personal and sensitive data. While in most cases; data reside insidethe database management system; most of the proposed anonymization techniques operateon and anonymize isolated datasets stored outside the DBMS. Hence; most of the desiredfunctionalities of the DBMS are lost; eg; consistency; recoverability; and efficient querying. Inthis paper; we address the challenges involved in enforcing the data privacy inside theDBMS. We implement the k-anonymity algorithm as a relational operator that interacts withother query operators to apply the privacy requirements while querying the data. We studyanonymizing a single table; multiple tables; and complex queries that involve multiplepredicates.

Method for keyword proximity searching in a document database,*,Keyword proximity searching in a document database according to a query conditioninitiates with generation of inverted lists having a location for each instance of the keyword inthe document database. A plane-sweep mode is used to efficiently search the inverted listsuntil an output tuple satisfying proximity criteria in the search query is detected. The methodthen shifts to a nested-loop search mode to enumerate all possible combinations of thekeyword instances that satisfy the proximity search query which are in the neighborhood ofthe output tuple detected in plane-sweep mode. The method alternates between these twomodes of operation until all of the output tuples satisfying the query condition areenumerated.,*,2004,5,7

This demo presentsAQWA; an adaptive and query-workload-aware data partitioning mechanism for processinglarge-scale spatial data. Unlike existing cluster-based systems; eg; SpatialHadoop; thatapply static partitioning of spatial data; AQWA has the ability to react to changes in the query-workload and data distribution. A key feature of AQWA is that it does not assume priorknowledge of the query-workload or data distribution. Instead; AQWA reacts to changes inboth the data and the query-workload by incrementally updating the partitioning of the data.We demonstrate two prototypes of AQWA deployed over Hadoop and Spark.

Handson db: Managing data dependencies involving human actions,Mohamed Eltabakh; Walid Aref; Ahmed Elmagarmid; Mourad Ouzzani,Consider two values; x and y; in the database; where y= F (x). To maintain the consistency ofthe data; whenever x changes; F needs to be executed to re-compute y and update its valuein the database. This is straightforward in the case where F can be executed by the DBMS;eg; SQL or C function. In this paper; we address the more challenging case where F is ahuman action; eg; conducting a wet-lab experiment; taking manual measurements; orcollecting instrument readings. In this case; when x changes; y remains invalid (inconsistentwith the current value of x) until the human action involved in the derivation is performed andits output result is reflected into the database. Many application domains; eg; scientificapplications in biology; chemistry; and physics; contain multiple such derivations anddependencies that involve human actions.

Duplicate Elimination in Space-partitioning Tree Indexes,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Mourad Ouzzani; Walid G Aref,Space-partitioning trees; like the disk-based trie; quadtree; kd-tree and their variants; are afamily of access methods that index multi-dimensional objects. In the case of indexing non-zero extent objects; eg; line segments and rectangles; space-partitioning trees may replicateobjects over multiple space partitions; eg; PMR quadtree; expanded MX-CIF quadtree; andextended kd-tree. As a result; the answer to a query over these indexes may includeduplicates that need to be eliminated; ie; the same object may be reported more than once.In this paper; we propose generic duplicate elimination techniques for the class of space-partitioning trees in the context of SP-GiST; an extensible indexing framework for realizingspace-partitioning trees. The proposed techniques are embedded inside the INDEX-SCANoperator.

On order-independent semantics of the similarity group-by relational database operator,Mingjie Tang; Ruby Y Tahboub; Walid G Aref; Qutaibah M Malluhi; Mourad Ouzzani,Abstract: Similarity group-by (SGB; for short) has been proposed as a relational databaseoperator to match the needs of emerging database applications. Many SGB operators thatextend SQL have been proposed in the literature; eg; similarity operators in the one-dimensional space. These operators have various semantics. Depending on how theseoperators are implemented; some of the implementations may lead to different groupings ofthe data. Hence; if SQL code is ported from one database system to another; it is notguaranteed that the code will produce the same results.

These real-world activities may take long time toprepare for and to perform; and hence introduce inherently long time delays between theupdates in the database. The presence of these long delays between the updates; alongwith the need for the intermediate results to be instantly available; makes supporting real-world activities in the database engine a challenging task. In this paper; we address thesechallenges through a system that enables users to reflect their updates immediately into thedatabase while keeping track of the dependent and potentially invalid data items until theyare re-validated.

In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database.

On query processing and optimality using spectral locality-preserving mappings,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract A locality-preserving mapping (LPM) from the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space is beneficial for many applications (eg; range queries; nearest-neighborqueries; clustering; and declustering) when multi-dimensional data is placed into one-dimensional storage (eg; the disk). The idea behind a locality-preserving mapping is to mappoints that are nearby in the multi-dimensional space into points that are nearby in the one-dimensional space. For the past two decades; fractals (eg; the Hilbert and Peano space-filling curves) have been considered the natural method for providing a locality-preservingmapping to support efficient answer for range queries and similarity search queries. In thispaper; we go beyond the idea of fractals. Instead; we investigate a locality-preservingmapping algorithm (The Spectral LPM) that uses the spectrum of the multi-dimensional …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,3,20

Forexample; there exist several complex variations of the spatio-textual group queries thatretrieve groups of objects that collectively satisfy certain spatial and textual criteria. However;having complex operators is against the spirit of SQL and relational algebra. In contrast tothese complex spatio-textual operators; in relational algebra; simple relational operators areoffered; eg; relational selects; projects; order by; and group by; that are composable to …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,2,7
Graph indexing for shortest-path finding over dynamic sub-graphs,Mohamed S Hassan; Walid G Aref; Ahmed M Aly,Abstract A variety of applications spanning various domains; eg; social networks;transportation; and bioinformatics; have graphs as first-class citizens. These applicationsshare a vital operation; namely; finding the shortest path between two nodes. In manyscenarios; users are interested in filtering the graph before finding the shortest path. Forexample; in social networks; one may need to compute the shortest path between twopersons on a sub-graph containing only family relationships. This paper focuses on dynamicgraphs with labeled edges; where the target is to find a shortest path after filtering someedges based on user-specified query labels. This problem is termed the Edge-ConstrainedShortest Path query (or ECSP; for short).

Approving updates in collaborative databases,Khaleel Mershad; Qutaibah M Malluhi; Mourad Ouzzani; Mingjie Tang; Walid G Aref,Data curation activities in collaborative databases mandate that collaborators interact untilthey converge and agree on the content of their data. Typically; updates by a member of thecollaboration are made visible to all collaborators for comments but at the same time arepending the approval or rejection of the data custodian; eg; the principal scientist orinvestigator (PI). In current database technologies; approval and authorization of updates isbased solely on the identity of the user; eg; via the SQL GRANT and REVOKE commands.However; in collaborative environments; the updated data is open for collaborators fordiscussion and further editing and is finally approved or rejected by the PI based on thecontent of the data and not on the identity of the updater.

Location data management: A tale of two systems and the" next destination"!,Mohamed Mokbel; Chi Yin Chow; Walid Aref,Abstract In early 2000; we had the vision of ubiquitous location services; where each objectis aware of its location; and continuously sends its location to a designated database server.This flood of location data opened the door for a myriad of location-based services that wereconsidered visionary at that time; yet today they are a reality and have become ubiquitous.To realize our early vision; we identified two main challenges that needed to be addressed;namely; scalability and privacy. We have addressed these challenges through two mainsystems; PLACE and Casper. PLACE; developed at Purdue University from 2000 to 2005;set up the environment for built-in database support of scalable and continuous location-based services. The Casper system; developed at University of Minnesota from 2005 to2010; was built inside the PLACE server allowing it to provide its high quality scalable …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,2,20
Learning from Data Streams,João Gama; Pedro Pereira Rodrigues,Abstract In the last two decades; machine learning research and practice has focused onbatch learning usually with small datasets. In batch learning; the whole training data isavailable to the algorithm that outputs a decision model after processing the data eventually(or most of the times) multiple times. The rationale behind this practice is that examples aregenerated at random accordingly to some stationary probability distribution. Also; mostlearners use a greedy; hill-climbing search in the space of models. What distinguishescurrent data sets from earlier ones are the continuous flow of data and the automatic datafeeds. We do not just have people who are entering information into a computer. Instead; wehave computers entering data into each other. Nowadays there are applications in which thedata is modelled best not as persistent tables but rather as transient data streams. In …,*,2009,2,5
Geoinformatica,Walid G Aref; HG Elmongui,Abstract© Springer Science+ Business Media; LLC 2011 Abstract This paper addresses theproblem of continuous aggregate nearestneighbor (CANN) queries for moving objects inspatio-temporal data stream management systems. A CANN query specifies a set oflandmarks; an integer k; and an aggregate distance function f (eg; min; max; or sum); where fcomputes the aggregate distance between a moving object and each of the landmarks. Theanswer to this continuous query is the set of k moving objects that have the smallestaggregate distance f. A CANN query may also be viewed as a combined set of nearestneighbor queries. We introduce several algorithms to continuously and incrementallyanswer CANN queries. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed operatorsoutperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by up to a factor of 3 and incur low memory …,*,2009,2,10
Pipelined spatial join processing for quadtree-based indexes,Walid G Aref,Abstract Spatial join is an important yet costly operation in spatial databases. In order tospeed up the execution of a spatial join; the input tables are often indexed based on theirspatial attributes. The quadtree index structure is a well-known index for organizing spatialdatabase objects. It has been implemented in several database management systems; eg;in Oracle Spatial and in PostgreSQL (via SP-GiST). Queries typically involve multiplepipelined spatial join operators that fit together in a query evaluation plan. In order to extendthe applicability of these spatial joins; they are optimized so that upon receiving sorted input;they produce sorted output for the spatial join operators in the upperlevels of the queryevaluation pipeline. This paper investigates the use of quadtree-based spatial joinalgorithms and how they can be adapted to answer queries that involve multiple …,Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2007,2,10
Data stream management systems and architectures,MA Hammad; TM Ghanem; WG Aref; AK Elmagarmid; MF Mokbel,A growing number of applications in several disciplines—sensor networks; GlobalPositioning Systems (GPSs); Internet; retail companies; and the phone network industry; forexample—deal with a new and challenging form of data; namely data streams. In theseapplications; data evolve over time in an unpredictable and bursty arrival fashion;representing streams of sensor-measured values; locations of moving objects; networktraffic; sales transactions or phone call records. In contrast to conventional datamanagement applications; a major requirement of streaming applications is to continuouslymonitor and possibly react to new; interesting events at the input streams. Since inputstreams are unbounded; stream applications may specify that user queries should processonly recent input data (eg; data items that arrive within the last hour).

Multi-way joins for sensor-network databases,MH Ali; Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel,Abstract. The multi-way join operator serves a wide range of datastreaming applications. Inthis paper: we introduce the SNJoin (or Sensor-Network Join) operator that is speciallydesigned for dynamicallyconfigured large-scale sensor networks. SNJoin is a multi-way joinoperator that scales with respect to the number of data-streaming sources withoutcompromising the output rate. Moreover: in a sensor field with hundreds or thousands ofsensors. every single sensor does not have to participate in the join. Insteatl: bundles ofsensors that experience the same environmental condit; ions may join with each other. TheSNJoin operator joins sensor data partially and updates its result\vith the arrival of newjoining tuples.\We introduce the SNJoin* operator as the distributed variation of the SNJoinoperator. The ultimate goal of the SNJoin* operator is to shift the join query processing …,*,2005,2,20

A Framework for Supporting the Class of Space Partitioning Trees,Walid G Aref; Ihab F Ilyas,Abstract Emerging database applications require the use of new indexing structures beyondB-trees and R-trees. Examples are the kD tree; the trie; the quadtree; and their variants. Theyare often proposed as supporting structures in data mining; GIS; and CAD/CAM applications.A common feature of all these indexes is that they recursively divide the space intopartitions. A new extensible index structure; termed SP-GiST is presented that supports thisclass of data structures; mainly the class of space partitioning unbalanced trees. Simplemethod implementations are provided that demonstrate how SP-GiST can behave as a kDtree; a trie; a quadtree; or any of their variants. Issues related to clustering tree nodes intopages as well as concurrency control for SP-GiST are addressed.

On the analysis of high-dimensional space-filling curves,Walid G Aref; MF Mokbel; I Kamel,Abstract Space-filling curves map the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensionalspace. A space-filling curve acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (orpixel) in the n-dimensional space so that every cell is visited only once; ie; the space-fillingcurve does not self-intersect. Thus; a space-filling curve imposes a linear order of the cells inthe n-dimensional space. This is useful in sorting and/or scheduling of objects that lie in themulti-dimensional space.,*,2001,2,7

AUDIT: approving and tracking updates with dependencies in collaborative databases,Khaleel Mershad; Qutaibah M Malluhi; Mourad Ouzzani; Mingjie Tang; Michael Gribskov; Walid G Aref,Abstract Collaborative databases such as genome databases; often involve extensivecuration activities where collaborators need to interact to be able to converge and agree onthe content of data. In a typical scenario; a member of the collaboration makes someupdates and these become visible to all collaborators for possible comments andmodifications. At the same time; these updates are usually pending the approval or rejectionfrom the data custodian based on the related discussion and the content of the data.Unfortunately; the approval and authorization of updates in current databases is basedsolely on the identity of the user; eg; via the SQL GRANT and REVOKE commands.

ORLF: A flexible framework for online record linkage and fusion,Eduard C Dragut; Mourad Ouzzani; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Walid G Aref,With the exponential growth of data on the Web comes the opportunity to integrate multiplesources to give more accurate answers to user queries. Upon retrieving records frommultiple Web databases; a key task is to merge records that refer to the same real-worldentity. We demonstrate ORLF (Online Record Linkage and Fusion); a flexible query-timerecord linkage and fusion framework. ORLF deduplicates newly arriving query results jointlywith previously processed query results. We use an iterative caching solution that leveragesquery locality to effectively deduplicate newly incoming records with cached records.

Geo-tagging non-spatial concepts,Amgad Madkour; Walid G Aref; Mohamed Mokbel; Saleh Basalamah,Abstract Concept Geo-tagging is the process of assigning a textual identifier that describes areal-world entity to a physical geographic location. A concept can either be a spatial conceptwhere it possesses a spatial presence or be a non-spatial concept where it has no explicitspatial presence. Geo-tagging locations with non-spatial concepts that have no directrelation is a very useful and important operation but is also very challenging. The reason isthat; being a non-spatial concept; eg; crime; makes it hard to geo-tag it. This paper proposesusing the semantic information associated with concepts and locations such as the type as amean for identifying these relations. The co-occurrence of spatial and non-spatial conceptswithin the same textual resources; eg; in the web; can be an indicator of a relationshipbetween these spatial and non-spatial concepts.

Spatial queries with k-nearest-neighbor and relational predicates,Ahmed M Aly; Walid G Aref; Mourad Ouzzani,Abstract The ubiquity of location-aware devices and smartphones has unleashed anunprecedented proliferation of location-based services that require processing queries withboth spatial and relational predicates. Many algorithms and index structures already exist forprocessing k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN; for short) predicates either solely or when combinedwith textual keyword search. Unfortunately; there has not been enough study on how toefficiently process queries where kNN predicates are combined with general relationalpredicates; ie; ones that have selects; joins and group-by's. One major challenge is thatbecause the kNN is a ranking operation; applying a relational predicate before or after akNN predicate in a query evaluation pipeline (QEP; for short) can result in different outputs;and hence leads to different query semantics.

Indexing recent trajectories of moving objects,Ahmed R Mahmood; Walid G Aref; Ahmed M Aly; Saleh Basalamah,Abstract The plethora of lacation-aware devices has led to countless location-basedservices in which huge amounts of spatio-temporal data get created everyday. Severalapplications requie efficient processing of queries on the locations of moving objects overtime; ie; the moving object trajectories. This calls for efficient trajectory-based indexingmethods that capture both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data in a way thatminimizes the number of disk I/Os required for both updating and querying. Motivated byapplications that require only the recent history of a moving object's trajectory; this paperintroduces the trails-tree; a disk-based data structure for indexing recent trajectories. Thetrails-tree maintains a temporal-sliding window over the trajectories and uses:(1) an in-memory memo structure that reduces the I/O cost of updates using a lazy-update …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,1,8
JISC: Adaptive Stream Processing Using Just-In-Time State Completion.,Ahmed M Aly; Walid G Aref; Mourad Ouzzani; Hosam M Mahmoud,ABSTRACT The continuous and dynamic nature of data streams may lead a queryexecution plan (QEP) of a long-running continuous query to become suboptimal duringexecution; and hence will need to be altered. The ability to perform an efficient and flawlesstransition to an equivalent; yet optimal QEP is essential for a data stream query processor.Such transition is challenging for plans with stateful binary operators; such as joins; wherethe states of the QEP have to be maintained during query transition without compromisingthe correctness of the query output. This paper presents Just-In-Time State Completion(JISC); a new technique for query plan migration. JISC does not cause any halt to the queryexecution; and thus allows the query to maintain steady output. JISC is applicable topipelined as well as eddy-based query evaluation frameworks.

Space-Filling Curves for Query Processing,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

Geographic Information Systems,HARRISBURG AREA,In Australia; the establishment of irrigated and non-irrigated dryland agriculture isaccompanied by extensive salinization of productive agricultural land and degradation ofrivers. The cause of dryland soil salinization is the clearance of native vegetation andreplacement with shallow-rooted crops over the last 200 years. It has only become clearlyevident over the last 100 years due to the lag in hydrological response. Nearly one millionhectares of arable land are currently affected and the trend is towards increased salinization.In the state of South Australia dryland soil salinization is one of the most widespread andsignificant forms of land degradation existing.

Duplicate Elimination using Proximity in Spatial Databases,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract A spatial database allows spatial objects to be indexed. In a spatial database; anobject may extend arbitrarily in space. As a result; many spatial data structures (eg; thequadtree; the cell tree; the R+-tree) represent an object by partitioning it into multiple; simplepieces; each of which is stored separately inside the data structure. Many operations onthese data structures are likely to produce duplicate results because of the multiphcity ofobject pieces. A novel approach for eliminating duplicate results based on proximity ofspatial objects is presented. An operation; termed Report-Unique; is defined which reportseach object in the data structure just once; irrespective of the multiplicity of the partitions ofthe object indexed by the underlying representation.

Loading Spatial Features into the Incomplete Pyramid Data Structure,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Spatial data usually is stored in images where spatial features are classified using imageprocessing techniques. However; for efficient processing; spatial features must be loadedinto appropriate incore spatial data structures. The pyramid data structure is of particularinterest because it can handle both overlapping and non-overlapping features. Theincomplete pyramid; a variant of the pyramid; has several advantages over the pyramid inthe context of spatial processing and answering queries on spatial features. Algorithms arepresented for loading overlapping and non-overlapping features into the incompletepyramid from a number of disk-based pointerless quadtree feature representations. Therunning time for these algorithms is linearly proportional to the perimeter of the spatialfeature being loaded and is independent of the pyramid depth.,Geographic Database Management Systems: Workshop Proceedings; Capri; Italy; May 1991,1992,1,7

Pattern-Driven Data Cleaning,El Kindi Rezig; Mourad Ouzzani; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Ahmed R Mahmood,Abstract: Data is inherently dirty and there has been a sustained effort to come up withdifferent approaches to clean it. A large class of data repair algorithms rely on data-qualityrules and integrity constraints to detect and repair the data. A well-studied class of integrityconstraints is Functional Dependencies (FDs; for short) that specify dependencies amongattributes in a relation. In this paper; we address three major challenges in data repairing:(1)Accuracy: Most existing techniques strive to produce repairs that minimize changes to thedata. However; this process may produce incorrect combinations of attribute values (orpatterns). In this work; we formalize the interaction of FD-induced patterns and select repairsthat result in preserving frequent patterns found in the original data.

Many of these algorithms involve a human in theloop; however; this latter is usually coupled to the underlying cleaning algorithms. There iscurrently no end-to-end data cleaning framework that systematically involves humans in thecleaning pipeline regardless of the underlying cleaning algorithms.

A labeled-graph stream refers to a sequence of streamededges that form a labeled graph. Label-aware applications need to filter the graph streambefore performing a graph operation. Due to the large volume and high velocity of thesestreams; it is often more practical to incrementally build a lossy-compressed version of thegraph; and use this lossy version to approximately evaluate graph queries. Challenges arisewhen the queries are unknown in advance but are associated with filtering predicates basedon edge labels. Surprisingly common; and especially challenging; are labeled-graphstreams that have highly skewed label distributions that might also vary over time. This …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06723,2017,*,7

The maturity of RDBMSs motivated academia andindustry to invest efforts in leveraging RDBMSs for graph processing; where efficiency isproven for vital graph queries. However; none of these efforts process graphs natively insidethe RDBMS; which is particularly challenging due to the impedance mismatch between therelational and the graph models.

FAST: Frequency-Aware Spatio-Textual Indexing for In-Memory Continuous Filter Query Processing,Ahmed R Mahmood; Walid G Aref; Ahmed M Aly,Abstract: The ubiquity of spatio-textual data comes from the popularity of GPS-enabled smartdevices; eg; smartphones. These devices provide a platform that supports a wide range ofapplications that generate and process spatio-textual data. These applications need toprocess massive amounts of spatio-textual data in real-time. For example; in location-awaread targeting systems; it is required to disseminate millions of ads and promotions to millionsof users based on the locations and textual profiles of users.

Adaptive Processing of Spatial-Keyword Data Over a Distributed Streaming Cluster,Ahmed R Mahmood; Anas Daghistani; Ahmed M Aly; Walid G Aref; Mingjie Tang; Saleh Basalamah; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract: The widespread use of GPS-enabled smartphones along with the popularity ofmicro-blogging and social networking applications; eg; Twitter and Facebook; has resultedin the generation of huge streams of geo-tagged textual data. Many applications require real-time processing of these streams. For example; location-based e-coupon and ad-targetingsystems enable advertisers to register millions of ads to millions of users. The number ofusers is typically very high and they are continuously moving; and the ads change frequentlyas well. Hence sending the right ad to the matching users is very challenging. Existingstreaming systems are either centralized or are not spatial-keyword aware; and cannotefficiently support the processing of rapidly arriving spatial-keyword data streams. Thispaper presents Tornado; a distributed spatial-keyword stream processing system …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.02533,2017,*,7
A Privacy Mechanism for Access Controlled Graph Data,Muhammad U Arshad; Muhamad Felemban; Zahid Pervaiz; Arif Ghafoor; Walid G Aref,There has been significant interest in the development of anonymization schemes forpublishing graph data. However; privacy is a major concern in dealing with graph data. Inthis paper; an integrated framework for ensuring privacy in the presence of an authorizationmechanism is proposed. Access control mechanisms provide additional safeguard againstdata breaches and ensure that only authorized information is available to end-users basedon their assigned roles. The integrated framework highlights a tradeoff between privacy andauthorized privileges. To attain a pre-specified privacy level; access privileges might need tobe relaxed. For the proposed framework; we formulate the k-anonymous Bi-objective GraphPartitioning (k-BGP) problem and provide its hardness results. Heuristics solutions aredeveloped to solve the constraint problem. The framework provides an anonymous view …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2017,*,7
COACT: a query interface language for collaborative databases,Khaleel Mershad; Qutaibah M Malluhi; Mourad Ouzzani; Mingjie Tang; Michael Gribskov; Walid G Aref; Deo Prakash,Abstract Data curation activities in collaborative databases mandate that collaboratorsinteract until they converge and agree on the content of their data. In a previous work; wepresented a cloud-based collaborative database system that promotes and enablescollaboration and data curation scenarios. Our system classifies different versions of a dataitem to either pending; approved; or rejected. The approval or rejection of a certain version isdone by the database Principle Investigators (or PIs) based on its value. Our system alsoallows collaborators to view the status of each version and help PIs take decisions byproviding feedback based on their experiments and/or opinions. Most importantly; oursystem provided mechanisms for history tracking of different versions to trace themodifications and approval/rejection done by both collaborators and PIs on different …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2017,*,22

Multi-dimensional phenomenon-aware stream query processing,Ashish Bindra; Ankur Teredesai; Mohamed H Ali; Walid G Aref,Abstract Geographically co-located sensors tend to participate in the same environmentalphenomena. Phenomenon-aware stream query processing improves scalability bysubscribing each query only to a subset of sensors that participate in the phenomena ofinterest to that query. In the case of sensors that generate readings with a multi-attributeschema; phenomena may develop across the values of one or more attributes. Howevertracking and detecting phenomena across all attributes does not scale well as thedimensions increase. As the size of sensor network increases; and as the number ofattributes being tracked by a sensor increases this becomes a major bottleneck. In thispaper; we present a novel nd imensional Phenomenon Detection and Tracking mechanism(termed as nd-PDT) over n-ary sensor readings. We reduce the number of dimensions to …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,*,10
Location-aware privacy and more: a systems approach using context-aware database management systems,Walid G Aref; Hicham G Elmongui; Mourad Ouzzani,Abstract When a user issues a query; database engines will usually return results basedsolely on the query and the content of the database. However; query issuers have a"context" which if taken into account will certainly change the outcome of the query. Thus;when responding to the query; the database system can consider the query issuer's contextand return only the objects/tuples in the database that not only satisfy the query predicatesbut also are relevant to the query issuer's context. In this paper; we give an overview ofChameleon; a context-aware database management system. Chameleon introduces SQL-level constructs that describe the" context" in which the query is issued as well as thereciprocal contexts of the objects in the database. By tying the query issuer's contexts withthe corresponding contexts of the objects in the database; Chameleon can retrieve the …,Proceedings of the 2nd SIGSPATIAL ACM GIS 2009 International Workshop on Security and Privacy in GIS and LBS,2009,*,5

Justlike a land registry; it records attributes concerning pieces of land; but while the recordings ofa land registry is based on deeds of conveyance and other rights in land; the cadastre isbased on measurements and other renderings of the location; size; and value of units ofproperty. The cadastre and the land registry in some countries; eg; the Netherlands and NewZealand; are managed within the same governmental organization. From the 1990s; theterm “land administration system” came into use; referring to a vision of a complete andconsistent national information system; comprising the cadastre and the land registry.

We identify; study; and implement several privacy-preserving features thatextend the previous work on Limiting Disclosure in Hippocratic databases. These featuresinclude the support of multiple policy versions; retention time; generalization hierarchies;and multiple SQL operations. The proposed features facilitate in making Hippocraticdatabases one step closer to fitting real-world scenarios. We present the design andimplementation guidelines of each of the proposed features.

Discovering consensus patterns in biological databases,Mohamed Y ElTabakh; Walid G Aref; Mourad Ouzzani; Mohamed H Ali,Abstract Consensus patterns; like motifs and tandem repeats; are highly conserved patternswith very few substitutions where no gaps are allowed. In this paper; we present aprogressive hierarchical clustering technique for discovering consensus patterns inbiological databases over a certain length range. This technique can discover consensuspatterns with various requirements by applying a post-processing phase. The progressivenature of the hierarchical clustering algorithm makes it scalable and efficient. Experiments todiscover motifs and tandem repeats on real biological databases show significantperformance gain over non-progressive clustering techniques.,VLDB Workshop on Data Mining and Bioinformatics,2006,*,7

A Framework for Supporting the Class of Space Partitioning,Walid G Aref; Ihab F Ilyas,Abstract Emerging database applications require the use of new indexing structures beyondB-trees and R-trees. Examples are the kD tree; the trie; the quadtree; and their variants. Theyare often proposed as supporting structures in data mining; GIS; and CAD/CAM applications.A common feature of all these indexes is that they recursively divide the space intopartitions. A new extensible index structure; termed SF-GiST is presented that supports thisclass of data structures; mainly the class of space partitioning unbalanced trees. Simplemethod implementations are provided that demonstrate how SP-GiST can behave as a kDtree; a tria; a quadtree; or any of their variants. Issues related to clustering tree nodes intopages as well as concurrency control for SP-GiST are addressed.

Spatial Relations and Their Algebra,Walid G Aref; Hanan Samet,Abstract Spatial operations are classified in terms of selects and joins; thereby unifyingspatial operations with relational selects and joins. Spatial and non-spatial operators aredefined to act on what is termed a spatial relation. A spatial relation resembles a relation in apure relational environment but is designed so that spatial selects and joins share the samealgebraic properties as relational selects and joins and hence are indistinguishable fromeach other. Therefore; the algebraic transformation rules of relational algebra hold for mixed(spatial and relational) operators as well. This approach permits the usage of a conventionalrelational optimizer in a spatial database environment without a loss of efficiency in spatialquery processing. Moreover; it permits the spatial aspect of the data to participate fully in theoptimization process once an appropriate cost model is developed for estimating the cost …,*,1992,*,7

In line with this notion of freedom; my driving principle is to adopt tradition as aphilosophical method; reflecting the belief that 'what is intelligible'is; itself; encounteredwithin a lived; historical context; and so is; rather like freedom; limited and non-ultimate(chapter 1).Accordingly;(in chapter 2) I argue that Aquinas's notion of substance as acategory can be understood in response to the need for linguistic expressions that a)predicate what a subject term is; ie; give its meaning; and b) have a reference to real-worldobjects; which are themselves examples of whatever is being predicated.

Cassia angustifolia (senna) is anative plant of Yemen; Somalia and Arabia. It is used medicinally in other parts of the world.The practical experiments carried out aim at showing the rate of growth inhibition of thecancer cells after their exposure to the Senna extracts. The hypothesis was: Senna wouldinhibit the growth of the cancer cells. The investigation were specifically viability studies andgrowth analysis of tumor cell lines.

Role Mining on Relational Data,Zahid Pervaiz; Arif Ghafoor; Walid G Aref,ABSTRACT Fine-grained access control for relational data defines user authorizations at thetuple level. Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has been proposed for relational data whereroles are allowed access to tuples based on the authorized view defined by a selectionpredicate. During the last few years; extensive research has been conducted in the area ofrole en gineering. The existing approaches for role engineering are top-down (using domainexperts); bottom-up (role-mining); or a hybrid of both. However; no research has been conducted for role engineering in relational data. In this paper; we address this problem. Thechallenge is to extract an RBAC policy with authorized selection predicates for users givenan existing tuple-level fine-grained access control pol icy. We formulate the problem forrelational data; propose a role mining algorithm and conduct experimental evaluation …,*,*,*,8

SNJoin–A Scalable Join in Sensor-Network PhenomenaBases,Mohamed H Ali; Mourad Ouzzani; Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel,Abstract A phenomenon appears in a sensor network when a group of sensors continuouslygenerate a similar behavior over a period of time. PhenomenaBases (or databases ofphenomena) are equipped with Phenomena Detection and Tracking (PDT) techniques thatcontinuously run in the background of a sensor database system to detect and trackphenomena. The process of phenomena detection and tracking depends mainly on a multi-way join operator which is at the core of PDT techniques to report similar sensor readings.With the increase in the sensor network size and to address periods of heavy loads; the joinoperator and; consequently; query processing in the PhenomenaBase face severalchallenges. In this paper; we present a new join operator for PhenomenaBases calledSNJoin that is specially-designed for dynamically-configured large-scale sensor networks …,*,*,*,15

Autonomous Disks: The Building Block for a Scalable Distributed File System,Cuneyt Akinlar Walid G Aref Ibrahim; Kamel Sarit Mukherjee,Abstract Repository for multimedia data differs from that of the traditional text-based databoth in storage space and streaming bandwidth requirements. Thus; the file systems used inmultimedia environment need to support large volumes and high bandwidth. In this paper;we propose a novel concept called autonomous disks to build scalable distributed filesystems. Autonomous disks are attached to the network and are able to do lightweightprocessing. We propose a file system architecture based on the autonomous disks. Wediscuss different ways to realize autonomous disk; and describe a prototype implementationon Linux platform using PC-based hardware. We present experimental results on theperformance of the proposed file system implemented using the autonomous disks. Weshow that it scales linearly with number of disks and number of clients; and performs …,*,*,*,7
The SkylineJoin Operator,Hicham G Elmongui; Walid G Aref,Abstract—Skyline queries; which are an important tool in multi-criteria decision support;have received considerable attention in the database community. Most of the existing worktends to focus on the efficiency of skyline query execution on a single relation. However; theskyline dimensions may often be stored in several relations. Computing skylines on joinedrelations is very expensive for several reasons including (1) the probable increase in the joincardinality and skyline dimensionality; and (2) the absence of several properties; likeindexes and desired sort order; on the joined tuples. In this paper; we propose theSkylineJoin operator with two key features:(i) it is a progressive operator that returns theinitial results fast; and (ii) it is a binary operator that may be cascaded to compute the skylinewhen the skyline dimensions span more than one relation. We provide a proof of …,*,*,*,11

A Deadline Driven Disk Scheduling Algorithm for Continuous Media Servers,Sameh M Elnikety; Walid G Aref; Mohamed S Abougabal,Abstract Multimedia applications require different levels of service for accessing continuousmedia data (eg; video and audio). To provide such different levels of service; the underlyingcontinuous media server must efficiently support a diverse group of activities like therecording and playback of video streams with different qualities. This translates into diskrequests with different types. For example; some disk requests may have deadlines whileother particular disk requests can be discarded under certain conditions (as in the case ofplaying back a video stream for a video-on-demand application). Existing disk schedulingalgorithms do not support all the types of disk requests required by server-based multimediaapplications. In this paper; we present a novel organization for the disk queue and develop adeadline driven disk scheduling algorithm that is able to efficiently handle all the different …,*,*,*,10
