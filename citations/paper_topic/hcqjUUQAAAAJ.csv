Detecting changes in XML documents,Gregory Cobena; Serge Abiteboul; Amelie Marian,We present a diff algorithm for XML data. This work is motivated by the support for changecontrol in the context of the Xyleme project that is investigating dynamic warehousescapable of storing massive volumes of XML data. Because of the context; our algorithm hasto be very efficient in terms of speed and memory space even at the cost of some loss ofquality. Also; it considers; besides insertions; deletions and updates (standard in diffs); amove operation on subtrees that is essential in the context of XML. Intuitively; our diffalgorithm uses signatures to match (large) subtrees that were left unchanged between theold and new versions. Such exact matchings are then possibly propagated to ancestors anddescendants to obtain more matchings. It also uses XML specific information such as IDattributes. We provide a performance analysis of the algorithm. We show that it runs in …,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,606,12
Evaluating top-k queries over web-accessible databases,Nicolas Bruno; Luis Gravano; Amelie Marian,A query to a Web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords; to which the searchengine responds with the best or" top" k pages for the query. This top-k query model isprevalent over multimedia collections in general; but also over plain relational data forcertain applications. For example; consider a relation with information on availablerestaurants; including their location; price range for one diner; and overall food rating. A userwho queries such a relation might simply specify the user's location and target price range;and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination-of proximity to theuser; closeness of match to the target price range; and overall food rating.

Change-centric management of versions in an XML warehouse,Amélie Marian; Serge Abiteboul; Gregory Cobena; Laurent Mignet,Abstract: We present a change-centric method to manage versions in a Web WareHouse ofXML data. The starting points is a sequence of snapshots of XML documents we obtain fromthe web. By running a di algorithm; we compute the changes between two consecutiveversions. We then represent the sequence using a novel representation of changes basedon completed deltas and persistent identi ers. We present the foundations of the logicalrepresentation and some aspects of the physical storage policy.,VLDB,2001,299,3

Beyond the stars: improving rating predictions using review text content.,Gayatree Ganu; Noemie Elhadad; Amélie Marian,ABSTRACT Online reviews are an important asset for users deciding to buy a product; see amovie; or go to a restaurant; as well as for businesses tracking user feedback. However;most reviews are written in a free-text format; and are therefore difficult for computer systemsto understand; analyze; and aggregate. One consequence of this lack of structure is thatsearching text reviews is often frustrating for users. User experience would be greatlyimproved if the structure and sentiment conveyed in the content of the reviews were takeninto account. Our work focuses on identifying this information from free-form text reviews;and using the knowledge to improve user experience in accessing reviews. Specifically; wefocused on improving recommendation accuracy in a restaurant review scenario. In thispaper; we report on our classification effort; and on the insight on user-reviewing behavior …,WebDB,2009,257,4

Negative facts in theviews may come; eg; from functional dependencies in the underlying database schema. Wewant to predict the truth values of the facts. Beyond simple methods such as voting (typicallyrather accurate); we explore techniques based on" corroboration"; ie; taking into accounttrust in the views. We introduce three fixpoint algorithms corresponding to different levels ofcomplexity of an underlying probabilistic model. They all estimate both truth values of factsand trust in the views. We present experimental studies on synthetic and real-world data.This analysis illustrates how and in which context these methods improve corroborationresults over baseline methods.

-Projecting XML Documents,Amélie Marian; Jérôme Siméon,This chapter presents projection techniques that can be used to support main-memoryXQuery evaluation over large XML documents. The chapter introduces a path analysistechnique that infers the set of paths used for an arbitrary XQuery expression. Theexperiments show that this technique can be used to evaluate queries on files up to twoGigabyte even on machines with limited memory. The chapter reveals that XQuery is notonly useful to query XML in databases; but also to applications that must process XMLdocuments as files or streams. These applications suffer from the limitations of current main-memory XQuery processors; which break for rather small documents. This chapter proposestechniques; based on a notion of projection for XML; which can be used to drastically reducememory requirements in XQuery processors.

Structure and content scoring for XML,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Nick Koudas; Amélie Marian; Divesh Srivastava; David Toman,Abstract XML repositories are usually queried both on structure and content. Due tostructural heterogeneity of XML; queries are often interpreted approximately and theiranswers are returned ranked by scores. Computing answer scores in XML is an active areaof research that oscillates between pure content scoring such as the well-known tf* idf andtaking structure into account. However; none of the existing proposals fully accounts forstructure and combines it with content to score query answers. We propose novel XMLscoring methods that are inspired by tf* idf and that account for both structure and contentwhile considering query relaxations. Twig scoring; accounts for the most structure andcontent and is thus used as our reference method. Path scoring is an approximation thatloosens correlations between query nodes hence reducing the amount of time required to …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,178,10
Optimizing top-k selection queries over multimedia repositories,Surajit Chaudhuri; Luis Gravano; Amelie Marian,Repositories of multimedia objects having multiple types of attributes (eg; image; text) arebecoming increasingly common. A query on these attributes will typically; request not just aset of objects; as in the traditional relational query model (filtering); but also a grade of matchassociated with each object; which indicates how well the object matches the selectioncondition (ranking). Furthermore; unlike in the relational model; users may just want the k top-ranked objects for their selection queries for a relatively small k. In addition to the differencesin the query model; another peculiarity of multimedia repositories is that they may allowaccess to the attributes of each object only through indexes. We investigate how to optimizethe processing of top-k selection queries over multimedia repositories. The accesscharacteristics of the repositories and the above query model lead to novel issues in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,136,23
Adaptive processing of top-k queries in XML,Amelie Marian; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,The ability to compute top-k matches to XML queries is gaining importance due to theincreasing number of large XML repositories. The efficiency of top-k query evaluation relieson using scores to prune irrelevant answers as early as possible in the evaluation process.In this context; evaluating the same query plan for all answers might be too rigid because; atany time in the evaluation; answers have gone through the same number and sequence ofoperations; which limits the speed at which scores grow. Therefore; adaptive queryprocessing that permits different plans for different partial matches and maximizes the bestscores is more appropriate. In this paper; we propose an architecture and adaptivealgorithms for efficiently computing top-k matches to XML queries. Our techniques can beused to evaluate both exact and approximate matches where approximation is defined by …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

Sailing the information ocean with awareness of currents: Discovery and application of source dependence,Laure Berti-Equille; Anish Das Sarma; Amelie Marian; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract: The Web has enabled the availability of a huge amount of useful information; buthas also eased the ability to spread false information and rumors across multiple sources;making it hard to distinguish between what is true and what is not. Recent examples includethe premature Steve Jobs obituary; the second bankruptcy of United airlines; the creation ofBlack Holes by the operation of the Large Hadron Collider; etc. Since it is important to permitthe expression of dissenting and conflicting opinions; it would be a fallacy to try to ensurethat the Web provides only consistent information.

Corroborating Answers from Multiple Web Sources.,Minji Wu; Amélie Marian,ABSTRACT The Internet has changed the way people look for information. Users nowexpect the answers to their questions to be available through a simple web search. Websearch engines are increasingly efficient at identifying the best sources for any givenkeyword query; and are often able to identify the answer within the sources. Unfortunately;many web sources are not trustworthy; because of erroneous; misleading; biased; oroutdated information. In many cases; users are not satisfied with—or do not trust—the resultsfrom any single source and prefer checking several sources for corroborating evidence. Inthis paper; we propose methods to aggregate query results from different sources in order tosave users the hassle of individually checking query-related web sites to corroborateanswers.

Multi-dimensional search for personal information management systems,Christopher Peery; Wei Wang; Amélie Marian; Thu D Nguyen,Abstract With the explosion in the amount of semi-structured data users access and store inpersonal information management systems; there is a need for complex search tools toretrieve often very heterogeneous data in a simple and efficient way.

Processing top-k join queries,Minji Wu; Laure Berti-Equille; Amélie Marian; Cecilia M Procopiuc; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract We consider the problem of efficiently finding the top-k answers for join queries overweb-accessible databases. Classical algorithms for finding top-k answers use branch-and-bound techniques to avoid computing scores of all candidates in identifying the top-kanswers. To be able to apply such techniques; it is critical to efficiently compute (lower andupper) bounds and expected scores of candidate answers in an incremental fashion duringthe evaluation. In this paper; we describe novel techniques for these problems. The firstcontribution of this paper is a method to efficiently compute bounds for the score of a queryresult when tuples in tables from the" FROM" clause are discovered incrementally; througheither sorted or random access. Our second contribution is an algorithm that; given a set ofpartially evaluated candidate answers; determines a good order in which to access the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,23,4

Corroborating Information from Web Sources.,Amélie Marian; Minji Wu,Abstract Information available on the Internet is abundant but often inaccurate. Web sourceshave different degrees of trustworthiness based on their accuracy; freshness; origin or bias.Web users are then left with the daunting task of assessing the correctness of possiblyconflicting answers to their queries. In this paper; we present techniques for corroboratinginformation from different web sources. We discuss techniques that estimates thetruthfulness of answers and the trustworthiness of the sources based on an underlyingprobabilistic model. We show how to apply data corroboration to a web setting where datasources can have multiple forms; all with various quality issues: individual web sites; searchengine query results; user reviews; map and street view data; and social tags.,IEEE Data Eng.

Circumventing data quality problems using multiple join paths.,Yannis Kotidis; Amélie Marian; Divesh Srivastava,ABSTRACT We propose the Multiple Join Path (MJP) framework for obtaining high qualityinformation by linking fields across multiple databases; when the underlying databases havepoor quality data; which are characterized by violations of integrity constraints like keys andfunctional dependencies within and across databases. MJP associates quality scores withcandidate answers by first scoring individual data paths between a pair of field values takinginto account data quality with respect to specified integrity constraints; and thenagglomerating scores across multiple data paths that serve as corroborating evidences for acandidate answer. We address the problem of finding the top-few (highest quality) answersin the MJP framework using novel techniques; and demonstrate the utility of our techniquesusing real data and our Virtual Integration Prototype testbed.,CleanDB,2006,12,22
One size does not fit all: Multi-granularity search of web forums,Gayatree Ganu; Amélie Marian,Abstract Users rely increasingly on online forums; blogs; and mailing lists to exchangeinformation; practical tips; and stories. Although this type of social interaction has becomecentral to our daily lives and decision-making processes; forums are surprisinglytechnologically poor: often there is no choice but to browse through massive numbers ofposts while looking for specific information. A critical challenge then for forum search is toprovide results that are as complete as possible and that do not miss some relevantinformation but that are not too broad. In this paper; we address the problem of presentingtextual search results in a concise manner to answer user needs. Specifically; we propose anew search approach over free-form text in forums that allows for the search results to bereturned at varying granularity levels.

Corroborating Facts from Affirmative Statements.,Minji Wu; Amélie Marian,ABSTRACT Web sources often provide different and even conflicting information. Simplevoting-based strategies have already shown limitations at identifying the correct answer to auser query with the presence of unreliable sources. In order to identify the correct answer;corroboration techniques have been proposed and proved to be effective for such tasks. Inthis paper; we investigate the corroboration problem in which most or all facts have onlyaffirmative statements from sources. A fact is either true or false; and an affirmative statementfrom a source indicates its support for a fact being true. Unfortunately; state-of-the-artcorroboration techniques rely on conflicting information to differentiate the trustworthiness ofthe sources and we demonstrate their limitations in our scenario.

In addition; the file organization that is typical in filesystems is not a practical logical view anymore as applications may store information acrossfiles; or combine different objects into a single file. Users cannot be expected to know orremember the exact location and specific details about the data they are looking for; searchtechniques should allow for some approximation during query processing in order to returnuseful results while accounting for possible errors in the query.

Corroboration de vues discordantes fondées sur la confiance,Alban Galland; Serge Abiteboul; Amélie Marian; Pierre Senellart,Résumé. Cet article traite de la corroboration d'informations; dans le contexte de vuesexprimant des opinions sur des faits de façon éventuellement contradictoire. Il s' agit deprédire si un fait est vrai ou faux. Des méthodes d'agrégation simples comme le votedonnent déja de bons résultats; mais nous présentons dans cet article des algorithmes quitiennent compte de la confiance dans les vues pour améliorer les prédictions. Les troisalgorithmes proposés sont des algorithmes de point fixe correspondanta différents niveauxde complexité du modele probabiliste sous-jacent. Ils estimenta la fois la valeur de véritédes faits et la confiance dans les vues. Cet article présente une étude expérimentale sur desdonnées synthétiques et réelles. Ces expériences montrent dans quelle mesure et dansquel contexte nos algorithmes peuvent améliorer les résultats par rapport au vote. La …,Proc. BDA; Namur; Belgium,2009,1,10
Ranked XML Processing,Amélie Marian; Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,Many organizations; eg; government statistical offices and search engine companies; collectpotentially sensitive information regarding individuals either to publish this data for research;or in return for useful services. While some data collection organizations; like the census; arelegally required not to breach the privacy of the individuals; other data collectionorganizations may not be trusted to uphold privacy. Hence; if U denotes the original datacontaining sensitive information about a set of individuals; then an untrusted data collectoror researcher should only have access to an anonymized version of the data; U*; that doesnot disclose the sensitive information about the individuals. A randomized anonymizationalgorithm R is said to be a privacy preserving randomization method if for every table T; andfor every output T*= R (T); the privacy of all the sensitive information of each individual in …,*,2009,1,23
Semantic Modeling and Inference with Episodic Organization for Managing Personal Digital Traces,Varvara Kalokyri; Alexander Borgida; Amélie Marian; Daniela Vianna,Abstract Many individuals generate a flood of personal digital traces (eg; emails; socialmedia posts; web searches; calendars) as a byproduct of their daily activities. To facilitatequerying and to support natural retrospective and prospective memory of these; a keyproblem is to integrate them in some sensible manner. For this purpose; based on researchin the cognitive sciences; we propose a conceptual modeling language whose novelfeatures include (i) the super-properties “who; what; when; where; why; how” applieduniformly to both documents and autobiographic events; and (ii) the ability to describeprototypical plans (“scripts”) for common everyday events; which in fact generate personaldigital documents as traces. The scripts and wh-questions support the hierarchicalorganization and abstraction of the original data; thus helping end-users query it.

Small Data,Oliver Kennedy; D Richard Hipp; Stratos Idreos; Amélie Marian; Arnab Nandi; Carmela Troncoso; Eugene Wu,Data is becoming increasingly personal. Individuals regularly interact with a wide variety ofstructured data; from SQLite databases on phones; to HR spreadsheets; to personalsensors; to open government data appearing in news articles. Although these workloads areimportant; many of the classical challenges associated with scale and Big Data do not apply.This panel brings together experts in a variety of fields to explore the new opportunities andchallenges presented by" Small Data".,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,*,21

Personalizing Forum Search using Multidimensional Random Walks.,Gayatree Ganu; Amélie Marian,Abstract Online forums are a vital resource for users to ask questions and to participate indiscussions. Yet; the search functionality on such forum sites is very primitive; postscontaining the searched keywords are retrieved in the order of their creation date. In theseinteractive and social web forum sites; users frequently make connections with other usersdue to shared interests; same information needs or similar profiles. A critical challenge then;is to score and rank the forum posts while taking into account these relations between users.In this paper; we present a personalized search over forums that leverages user similaritiesdeveloped via multiple relations linking users. We build a novel multidimensional randomwalk model that uniformly incorporates the heterogeneous user relations to find similarforum participants. We then use this multi-relational user similarity to predict future …,ICWSM,2014,*,23

Top-K Selection Queries on Multimedia Datasets,Amélie Marian,There are two kinds of tables: frequency tables that display the count of respondents at thecrossing of the categorical attributes (in N) and magnitude tables that display information ona numerical attribute at the crossing of the categorical attributes (in R). For example; givensome census microdata containing attributes “Job” and “Town;” one can generate afrequency table displaying the count of respondents doing each job type in each town. If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,*,12
Multi-Dimensional Search in Personal Information File Systems,Christopher Peery; Wei Wang; Amélie Marian; Thu D Nguyen,Abstract With the explosion in the amount of semi-structured data users access and store;there is a need for complex search tools to retrieve often very heterogeneous data in asimple and efficient way. Existing tools usually index text content; allowing for some IR-styleranking on the textual part of the query; but only consider structure (eg; file directory) andmetadata (eg; date; file type) as filtering conditions. We propose a novel multi-dimensionalapproach to semi-structured data searches in personal information systems by allowingusers to provide fuzzy structure and metadata conditions in addition to keyword conditions.Our techniques provide a complex query interface that is more comprehensive than content-only searches as it considers three query dimensions (content; structure; metadata) in thesearch. We propose techniques to individually score each dimension; as well as a …,*,2007,*,18
Evaluation of Top-k Queries over Structured and Semi-structured Data,Amélie Marian,A large amount of structured and semi-structured information is available through theInternet; either through interfaces to web-accessible databases (eg; MapQuest) 1 orexchanged between applications (eg; XML messages in web services). This wealth ofinformation makes it difficult for users to identify relevant data for their (often relatively fuzzy)information needs. This thesis focuses on query processing techniques to efficiently identifythe data that is most relevant to user queries; saving users from having to sort through alarge amount of information to find valuable data. Traditionally; query processing techniquesover structured (eg; relational) and semistructured (eg; XML) data identify the exact matchesfor the queries. This exact-match query model is not appropriate for many databaseapplications and scenarios where queries are inherently fuzzy—often expressing user …,*,2005,*,23
Parallel Probing of Web Databases for Top-k Query Processing,Amélie Marian; Luis Gravano,Abstract A “top-k query” specifies a set of preferred values for the attributes of a relation andexpects as a result the k objects that are “closest” to the given preferences according tosome distance function. In many web applications; the relation attributes are only availablevia probes to autonomous webaccessible sources. Probing these sources sequentially toprocess a top-k query is inefficient; since web accesses exhibit high and variable latency.Fortunately; web sources can be probed in parallel; and each source can typically processconcurrent requests; although sources may impose some restrictions on the type andnumber of probes that they are willing to accept. These characteristics of web sourcesmotivate the introduction of parallel top-k query processing strategies; which are the focus ofthis paper. We present efficient techniques that maximize source-access parallelism to …,*,2003,*,12
Birds of a tag flock together,Serge Abiteboul; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Alban Galland; Amélie Marian; Pierre Senellart,Motivation and context. Recently; extracting knowledge from user-generated social data hasattracted a lot of attention. Several works have focused on modeling user-generated tagssuch as the study of tag clouds [3]; cross-floksonomy analysis [7]; or the use of tag-drivencommunities for content search [4] or recommendation [6]. The huge and increasing amountof raw tags and annotations clearly contains valuable social information and is thus anessential asset for helping community members find information they are interested in. Forexample; the exploration of communities in del. icio. us; a well known social tagging website;can be enhanced through the use of tags; see eg;[1]. Our goal is twofold: extract knowledgefrom this rich social information by clustering social data based on affinity (ie; proximity in thesocial network); and provide better query support and navigation on the semantically …,*,*,*,10
