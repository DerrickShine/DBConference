Effective named entity recognition for idiosyncratic web collections,Roman Prokofyev; Gianluca Demartini; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,Abstract Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays an important role in a variety of onlineinformation management tasks including text categorization; document clustering; andfaceted search. While recent NER systems can achieve near-human performance on certaindocuments like news articles; they still remain highly domain-specific and thus cannoteffectively identify entities such as original technical concepts in scientific documents. In thiswork; we propose novel approaches for NER on distinctive document collections (such asscientific articles) based on n-grams inspection and classification. We design and evaluateseveral entity recognition features---ranging from well-known part-of-speech tags to n-gramco-location statistics and decision trees---to classify candidates. In addition; we show howthe use of external knowledge bases (either specific like DBLP or generic like DBPedia) …,Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web,2014,19,4
SANAPHOR: Ontology-based coreference resolution,Roman Prokofyev; Alberto Tonon; Michael Luggen; Loic Vouilloz; Djellel Eddine Difallah; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,Abstract We tackle the problem of resolving coreferences in textual content by leveragingSemantic Web techniques. Specifically; we focus on noun phrases that coreferenceidentifiable entities that appear in the text; the challenge in this context is to improve thecoreference resolution by leveraging potential semantic annotations that can be added tothe identified mentions. Our system; SANAPHOR; first applies state-of-the-art techniques toextract entities; noun phrases; and candidate coreferences. Then; we propose an approachto type noun phrases using an inverted index built on top of a Knowledge Graph (eg;DBpedia). Finally; we use the semantic relatedness of the introduced types to improve thestate-of-the-art techniques by splitting and merging coreference clusters. We evaluateSANAPHOR on CoNLL datasets; and show how our techniques consistently improve the …,International Semantic Web Conference,2015,14,10
Contextualized ranking of entity types based on knowledge graphs,Alberto Tonon; Michele Catasta; Roman Prokofyev; Gianluca Demartini; Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudre-Mauroux,Abstract A large fraction of online queries targets entities. For this reason; Search EngineResult Pages (SERPs) increasingly contain information about the searched entities such aspictures; short summaries; related entities; and factual information. A key facet that is oftendisplayed on the SERPs and that is instrumental for many applications is the entity type.However; an entity is usually not associated to a single generic type in the backgroundknowledge graph but rather to a set of more specific types; which may be relevant or notgiven the document context. For example; one can find on the Linked Open Data cloud thefact that Tom Hanks is a person; an actor; and a person from Concord; California. All thesetypes are correct but some may be too general to be interesting (eg; person); while othermay be interesting but already known to the user (eg; actor); or may be irrelevant given …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2016,10,10
Tag recommendation for large-scale ontology-based information systems,Roman Prokofyev; Alexey Boyarsky; Oleg Ruchayskiy; Karl Aberer; Gianluca Demartini; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,Abstract We tackle the problem of improving the relevance of automatically selected tags inlarge-scale ontology-based information systems. Contrary to traditional settings where tagscan be chosen arbitrarily; we focus on the problem of recommending tags (eg; concepts)directly from a collaborative; user-driven ontology. We compare the effectiveness of a seriesof approaches to select the best tags ranging from traditional IR techniques such as TF/IDFweighting to novel techniques based on ontological distances and latent Dirichlet allocation.All our experiments are run against a real corpus of tags and documents extracted from theScienceWise portal; which is connected to ArXiv. org and is currently used by growingnumber of researchers. The datasets for the experiments are made available online forreproducibility purposes.,International Semantic Web Conference,2012,10,7
Ontology-based word sense disambiguation for scientific literature,Roman Prokofyev; Gianluca Demartini; Alexey Boyarsky; Oleg Ruchayskiy; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,Abstract Scientific documents often adopt a well-defined vocabulary and avoid the use ofambiguous terms. However; as soon as documents from different research sub-communitiesare considered in combination; many scientific terms become ambiguous as the same termcan refer to different concepts from different sub-communities. The ability to correctly identifythe right sense of a given term can considerably improve the effectiveness of retrievalmodels; and can also support additional features such as search diversification. This is evenmore critical when applied to explorative search systems within the scientific domain. In thispaper; we propose novel semi-supervised methods to term disambiguation leveraging thestructure of a community-based ontology of scientific concepts. Our approach exploits thegraph structure that connects different terms and their definitions to automatically identify …,European conference on information retrieval,2013,8,10
ScienceWISE: a Web-based interactive semantic platform for paper annotation and ontology editing,Anton Astafiev; Roman Prokofyev; Christophe Guéret; Alexey Boyarsky; Oleg Ruchayskiy,Abstract The ScienceWISE system is a collaborative ontology editor and paper annotationtool designed to help researchers in their discovery. In this paper; we describe the systemcurrently deployed at sciencewise. info and the exposition of its data as Linked Data. Duringthe “RDFization” process; we faced issues to encode the knowledge base in SKOS and findresources to link to on the LOD. We discuss these issues and the remaining openchallenges to implement some target features.,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2012,5,10
Analyzing large-scale public campaigns on twitter,Julia Proskurnia; Ruslan Mavlyutov; Roman Prokofyev; Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,Abstract Social media has become an important instrument for running various types ofpublic campaigns and mobilizing people. Yet; the dynamics of public campaigns on socialnetworking platforms still remain largely unexplored. In this paper; we present an in-depthanalysis of over one hundred large-scale campaigns on social media platforms coveringmore than 6 years. In particular; we focus on campaigns related to climate change onTwitter; which promote online activism to encourage; educate; and motivate people to reactto the various issues raised by climate change. We propose a generic framework to identifyboth the type of a given campaign as well as the various actions undertaken throughout itslifespan: official meetings; physical actions; calls for action; publications on climate relatedresearch; etc. We study whether the type of a campaign is correlated to the actions …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2016,2,22
Correct Me If I'm Wrong: Fixing Grammatical Errors by Preposition Ranking,Roman Prokofyev; Ruslan Mavlyutov; Martin Grund; Gianluca Demartini; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,Abstract The detection and correction of grammatical errors still represent very hardproblems for modern error-correction systems. As an example; the top-performing systems atthe preposition correction challenge CoNLL-2013 only achieved a F1 score of 17%. In thispaper; we propose and extensively evaluate a series of approaches for correctingprepositions; analyzing a large body of high-quality textual content to capture languageusage. Leveraging n-gram statistics; association measures; and machine learningtechniques; our system is able to learn which words or phrases govern the usage of aspecific preposition. Our approach makes heavy use of n-gram statistics generated from verylarge textual corpora. In particular; one of our key features is the use of n-gram associationmeasures (eg; Pointwise Mutual Information) between words and prepositions to …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,2,15
SwissLink: High-Precision; Context-Free Entity Linking Exploiting Unambiguous Labels,Roman Prokofyev; Michael Luggen; Djellel Eddine Difallah; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,ABSTRACT Webpages are an abundant source of textual information with manuallyannotated entity links; and are often used as a source of training data for a wide variety ofmachine learning NLP tasks. However; manual annotations such as those found onWikipedia are sparse; noisy; and biased towards popular entities. Existing entity linkingsystems deal with those issues by relying on simple statistics extracted from the data. Whilesuch statistics can effectively deal with noisy annotations; they introduce bias towards headentities and are ineffective for long tail (eg; unpopular) entities. In this work; we first analyzestatistical properties linked to manual annotations by studying a large annotated corpuscomposed of all English Wikipedia webpages; in addition to all pages from theCommonCrawl containing English Wikipedia annotations. We then propose and evaluate …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Semantic Systems,2017,*,10
Entity-centric knowledge discovery for idiosyncratic domains,Roman Prokofyev,Summary Technical and scientific knowledge is produced at an ever-accelerating pace;leading to increasing issues when trying to automatically organize or process it; eg; whensearching for relevant prior work. Knowledge can today be produced both in unstructured(plain text) and structured (metadata or linked data) forms. However; unstructured content isstill themost dominant formused to represent scientific knowledge. In order to facilitate theextraction and discovery of relevant content; new automated and scalable methods forprocessing; structuring and organizing scientific knowledge are called for. In this context; anumber of applications are emerging; ranging fromNamed Entity Recognition (NER) andEntity Linking tools for scientific papers to specific platforms leveraging informationextraction techniques to organize scientific knowledge. In this thesis; we tackle the tasks …,*,2016,*,12
