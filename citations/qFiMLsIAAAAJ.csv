LIRS: an efficient low inter-reference recency set replacement policy to improve buffer cache performance,Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Although LRU replacement policy has been commonly used in the buffer cachemanagement; it is well known for its inability to cope with access patterns with weak locality.Previous work; such as LRU-K and 2Q; attempts to enhance LRU capacity by making use ofadditional history information of previous block references other than only the recencyinformation used in LRU. These algorithms greatly increase complexity and/or can notconsistently provide performance improvement. Many recently proposed policies; such asUBM and SEQ; improve replacement performance by exploiting access regularities inreferences. They only address LRU problems on certain specific and well-defined casessuch as access patterns like sequences and loops. Motivated by the limits of previousstudies; we propose an efficient buffer cache replacement policy; called Low Inter …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2002,534
Measurements; analysis; and modeling of BitTorrent-like systems,Lei Guo; Songqing Chen; Zhen Xiao; Enhua Tan; Xiaoning Ding; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Existing studies on BitTorrent systems are single-torrent based; while more than85% of all peers participate in multiple torrents according to our trace analysis. In addition;these studies are not sufficiently insightful and accurate even for single-torrent models; dueto some unrealistic assumptions. Our analysis of representative Bit-Torrent traffic providesseveral new findings regarding the limitations of BitTorrent systems:(1) Due to theexponentially decreasing peer arrival rate in reality; service availability in such systemsbecomes poor quickly; after which it is difficult for the file to be located and downloaded.(2)Client performance in the BitTorrent-like systems is unstable; and fluctuates widely with thepeer population.(3) Existing systems could provide unfair services to peers; where peerswith high downloading speed tend to download more and upload less.

Understanding intrinsic characteristics and system implications of flash memory based solid state drives,Feng Chen; David A Koufaty; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Flash Memory based Solid State Drive (SSD) has been called a" pivotaltechnology" that could revolutionize data storage systems. Since SSD shares a commoninterface with the traditional hard disk drive (HDD); both physically and logically; an effectiveintegration of SSD into the storage hierarchy is very important. However; details of SSDhardware implementations tend to be hidden behind such narrow interfaces. In fact; sincesophisticated algorithms are usually; of necessity; adopted in SSD controller firmware; morecomplex performance dynamics are to be expected in SSD than in HDD systems. Mostexisting literature or product specifications on SSD just provide high-level descriptions andstandard performance data; such as bandwidth and latency. In order to gain insight into theunique performance characteristics of SSD; we have conducted intensive experiments …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2009,466
Gaining insights into multicore cache partitioning: Bridging the gap between simulation and real systems,Jiang Lin; Qingda Lu; Xiaoning Ding; Zhao Zhang; Xiaodong Zhang; P Sadayappan,Cache partitioning and sharing is critical to the effective utilization of multicore processors.However; almost all existing studies have been evaluated by simulation that often hasseveral limitations; such as excessive simulation time; absence of OS activities andproneness to simulation inaccuracy. To address these issues; we have taken an efficientsoftware approach to supporting both static and dynamic cache partitioning in OS throughmemory address mapping. We have comprehensively evaluated several representativecache partitioning schemes with different optimization objectives; including performance;fairness; and quality of service (QoS). Our software approach makes it possible to run theSPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite to completion.

RCFile: A fast and space-efficient data placement structure in MapReduce-based warehouse systems,Yongqiang He; Rubao Lee; Yin Huai; Zheng Shao; Namit Jain; Xiaodong Zhang; Zhiwei Xu,MapReduce-based data warehouse systems are playing important roles of supporting bigdata analytics to understand quickly the dynamics of user behavior trends and their needs intypical Web service providers and social network sites (eg; Facebook). In such a system; thedata placement structure is a critical factor that can affect the warehouse performance in afundamental way. Based on our observations and analysis of Facebook production systems;we have characterized four requirements for the data placement structure:(1) fast dataloading;(2) fast query processing;(3) highly efficient storage space utilization; and (4) strongadaptivity to highly dynamic workload patterns.

CAFTL: A Content-Aware Flash Translation Layer Enhancing the Lifespan of Flash Memory based Solid State Drives.,Feng Chen; Tian Luo; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Although Flash Memory based Solid State Drive (SSD) exhibits high performanceand low power consumption; a critical concern is its limited lifespan along with theassociated reliability issues. In this paper; we propose to build a Content-Aware FlashTranslation Layer (CAFTL) to enhance the endurance of SSDs at the device level. With noneed of any semantic information from the host; CAFTL can effectively reduce write traffic toflash memory by removing unnecessary duplicate writes and can also substantially extendavailable free flash memory space by coalescing redundant data in SSDs; which furtherimproves the efficiency of garbage collection and wear-leveling.

However; due to its relatively high price and lowcapacity; a major system research issue to address is on how to make SSDs play their mosteffective roles in a high-performance storage system in cost-and performance-effectiveways. In this paper; we will answer several related questions with insights based on thedesign and implementation of a high performance hybrid storage system; called Hystor. Wemake the best use of SSDs in storage systems by achieving a set of optimization objectivesfrom both system deployment and algorithm design perspectives.

A permutation-based page interleaving scheme to reduce row-buffer conflicts and exploit data locality,Zhao Zhang; Zhichun Zhu; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract DRAM row-buffer conflicts occur when a sequence of requests on different rowsgoes to the same memory bank; causing much higher memory access latency than requeststo the same row or to different banks. In this paper; we analyze the sources of row-bufferconflicts in the context of superscalar processors; and propose a permutation-based pageinterleaving scheme to reduce row-buffer conflicts and to exploit data access locality in therow-buffer. Compared with several existing schemes; we show that the permutation-basedscheme dramatically increases the hit rates on DRAM row-buffers and reduces memory stalltime of the SPEC95 and TPC-C workloads. The memory stall times of the workloads arereduced up to 68% and 50%; compared with the conventional cache line and pageinterleaving schemes; respectively.,Proceedings of the 33rd annual ACM/IEEE international symposium on Microarchitecture,2000,223
CLOCK-Pro: An Effective Improvement of the CLOCK Replacement.,Song Jiang; Feng Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract: With the ever-growing performance gap between memory systems and disks; andrapidly improving CPU performance; virtual memory (VM) management becomesincreasingly important for overall system performance. However; one of its criticalcomponents; the page replacement policy; is still dominated by CLOCK; a replacementpolicy developed almost 40 years ago. While pure LRU has an unaffordable cost in VM;CLOCK simulates the LRU replacement algorithm with a low cost acceptable in VMmanagement. Over the last three decades; the inability of LRU as well as CLOCK to handleweak locality accesses has become increasingly serious; and an effective fix becomesincreasingly desirable.,USENIX Annual Technical Conference; General Track,2005,209
Analyzing patterns of user content generation in online social networks,Lei Guo; Enhua Tan; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang; Yihong Eric Zhao,Abstract Various online social networks (OSNs) have been developed rapidly on theInternet. Researchers have analyzed different properties of such OSNs; mainly focusing onthe formation and evolution of the networks as well as the information propagation over thenetworks. In knowledge-sharing OSNs; such as blogs and question answering systems;issues on how users participate in the network and how users" generate/contribute"knowledge are vital to the sustained and healthy growth of the networks. However; relateddiscussions have not been reported in the research literature.

A performance study of BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer systems,Lei Guo; Songqing Chen; Zhen Xiao; Enhua Tan; Xiaoning Ding; Xiaodong Zhang,This paper presents a performance study of BitTorrent-like P2P systems by modeling; basedon extensive measurements and trace analysis. Existing studies on BitTorrent systems aresingle-torrent based and usually assume the process of request arrivals to a torrent isPoisson-like. However; in reality; most BitTorrent peers participate in multiple torrents andfile popularity changes over time. Our study of representative BitTorrent traffic providesinsights into the evolution of single-torrent systems and several new findings regarding thelimitations of BitTorrent systems:(1) Due to the exponentially decreasing peer arrival rate in atorrent; the service availability of the corresponding file becomes poor quickly; andeventually it is hard to locate and download this file.(2) Client performance in the BitTorrent-like system is unstable; and fluctuates significantly with the changes of the number of …,IEEE Journal on selected areas in communications,2007,201
Essential roles of exploiting internal parallelism of flash memory based solid state drives in high-speed data processing,Feng Chen; Rubao Lee; Xiaodong Zhang,Flash memory based solid state drives (SSDs) have shown a great potential to changestorage infrastructure fundamentally through their high performance and low power. Mostrecent studies have mainly focused on addressing the technical limitations caused byspecial requirements for writes in flash memory. However; a unique merit of an SSD is itsrich internal parallelism; which allows us to offset for the most part of the performance lossrelated to technical limitations by significantly increasing data processing throughput. In thiswork we present a comprehensive study of essential roles of internal parallelism of SSDs inhigh-speed data processing. Besides substantially improving I/O bandwidth (eg 7.2×); weshow that by exploiting internal parallelism; SSD performance is no longer highly sensitiveto access patterns; but rather to other factors; such as data access interferences and …,High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA); 2011 IEEE 17th International Symposium on,2011,199
DULO: an effective buffer cache management scheme to exploit both temporal and spatial locality,Song Jiang; Xiaoning Ding; Feng Chen; Enhua Tan; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract: Sequentiality of requested blocks on disks; or their spatial locality; is critical to theperformance of disks; where the throughput of accesses to sequentially placed disk blockscan be an order of magnitude higher than that of accesses to randomly placed blocks.Unfortunately; spatial locality of cached blocks is largely ignored and only temporal localityis considered in system buffer cache management. Thus; disk performance for workloadswithout dominant sequential accesses can be seriously degraded. To address this problem;we propose a scheme called DULO (DUal LOcality); which exploits both temporal andspatial locality in buffer cache management. Leveraging the filtering effect of the buffercache; DULO can influence the I/O request stream by making the requests passed to diskmore sequential; significantly increasing the effectiveness of I/O scheduling and …,Proceedings of the 4th conference on USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies,2005,172
A popularity-based prediction model for web prefetching,Xin Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,The diverse server; client; and unique file object types used today slow Web performance.Caching alone offers limited performance relief because it cannot handle many different filetypes easily. One solution combines caching with Web prefetching: obtaining the Web data aclient might need from data about that client's past surfing activity. The prediction by partialmatch model; for example; makes prefetching decisions by reviewing URLs clients haveaccessed on a particular server; then structuring them in a Markov predictor tree. Theauthors propose a variation of this model that builds common surfing patterns andregularities into the tree.,Computer,2003,171
Ysmart: Yet another sql-to-mapreduce translator,Rubao Lee; Tian Luo; Yin Huai; Fusheng Wang; Yongqiang He; Xiaodong Zhang,MapReduce has become an effective approach to big data analytics in large clustersystems; where SQL-like queries play important roles to interface between users andsystems. However; based on our Facebook daily operation results; certain types of queriesare executed at an unacceptable low speed by Hive (a production SQL-to-MapReducetranslator). In this paper; we demonstrate that existing SQL-to-MapReduce translators thatoperate in a one-operation-to-one-job mode and do not consider query correlations cannotgenerate high-performance MapReduce programs for certain queries; due to the mismatchbetween complex SQL structures and simple MapReduce framework. We propose anddevelop a system called Y Smart; a correlation aware SQL-to-MapReduce translator.

Adaptive and lazy segmentation based proxy caching for streaming media delivery,Songqing Chen; Bo Shen; Susie Wee; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Streaming media objects are often cached in segments. Previous segment-basedcaching strategies cache segments with constant or exponentially increasing lengths andtypically favor caching the beginning segments of media objects. However; these strategiestypically do not consider the fact that most accesses are targeted toward a few popularobjects. In this paper; we argue that neither the use of a predefined segment length nor thefavorable caching of the beginning segments is the best caching strategy for reducingnetwork traffic. We propose an adaptive and lazy segmentation based caching mechanismby delaying the segmentation as late as possible and determining the segment length basedon the client access behaviors in real time. In addition; the admission and eviction ofsegments are carried out adaptively based on an accurate utility function.

DiskSeen: Exploiting Disk Layout and Access History to Enhance I/O Prefetch.,Xiaoning Ding; Song Jiang; Feng Chen; Kei Davis; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract: Current disk prefetch policies in major operating systems track access patterns atthe level of the file abstraction. While this is useful for exploiting application-level accesspatterns; file-level prefetching cannot realize the full performance improvements achievableby prefetching. There are two reasons for this. First; certain prefetch opportunities can onlybe detected by knowing the data layout on disk; such as the contiguous layout of file meta-data or data from multiple files. Second; non-sequential access of disk data (requiring diskhead movement) is much slower than sequential access; and the penalty for mis-prefetchingarandom'block; relative to that of a sequential block; is correspondingly more costly.,USENIX Annual Technical Conference,2007,152
The stretched exponential distribution of internet media access patterns,Lei Guo; Enhua Tan; Songqing Chen; Zhen Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract The commonly agreed Zipf-like access pattern of Web workloads is mainly basedon Internet measurements when text-based content dominated the Web traffic. However;with dramatic increase of media traffic on the Internet; the inconsistency between the accesspatterns of media objects and the Zipf model has been observed in a number of studies. Aninsightful understanding of media access patterns is essential to guide Internet systemdesign and management; including resource provisioning and performance optimizations. Inthis paper; we have studied a large variety of media workloads collected from both client andserver sides in different media systems with different delivery methods. Through extensiveanalysis and modeling; we find:(1) the object reference ranks of all these workloads followthe stretched exponential (SE) distribution despite their different media systems and …,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing,2008,136
ASAP: an AS-aware peer-relay protocol for high quality VoIP,Shansi Ren; Lei Guo; Xiaodong Zhang,Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology has been successfully applied in Internet telephony or Voiceover Internet Protocol (VoIP); such as the Skype system; where P2P is used for bothsearching clients and relaying voice packets. Selecting one or multiple suitable peers torelay voice packets is a critical factor for the quality; scalability and cost of a VoIP system. Inthis paper; we first present two sets of intensive Internet measurement results to confirm thebenefits gained by peer relays in VoIP; and to investigate the performance of the Skypesystem. We obtain the following results:(1) many relay peer selections are suboptimal;(2) thewaiting time to select a relay node can be quite long; and (3) there are a large number ofunnecessary probes; resulting in heavy network traffic to limit scalability of the VoIP system.Our further analysis shows that two main reasons cause these problems.

Improving distributed workload performance by sharing both CPU and memory resources,Xiaodong Zhang; Yanxia Qu; Li Xiao,We develop and examine job migration policies by considering effective usage of globalmemory in addition to CPU load sharing in distributed systems. When a node is identified forlacking sufficient memory space to serve jobs; one or more jobs of the node will be migratedto remote nodes with low memory allocations. If the memory space is sufficiently large thejobs will be scheduled by a CPU-based load sharing policy. Following the principle ofsharing both CPU and memory resources; we present several load sharing alternatives. Outobjective is to reduce the number of page faults caused by unbalanced memory allocationsfor jobs among distributed nodes; so that overall performance of a distributed system can besignificantly improved. We have conducted trace-driven simulations to compare CPU-basedload sharing policies with our policies. We show that our load sharing policies not only …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2000.

LDPC-in-SSD: making advanced error correction codes work effectively in solid state drives.,Kai Zhao; Wenzhe Zhao; Hongbin Sun; Tong Zhang; Xiaodong Zhang; Nanning Zheng,Abstract Conventional error correction codes (ECCs); such as the commonly used BCHcode; have become increasingly inadequate for solid state drives (SSDs) as the capacity ofNAND flash memory continues to increase and its reliability continues to degrade. It is highlydesirable to deploy a much more powerful ECC; such as low-density parity-check (LDPC)code; to significantly improve the reliability of SSDs. Although LDPC code has had itssuccess in commercial hard disk drives; to fully exploit its error correction capability in SSDsdemands unconventional fine-grained flash memory sensing; leading to an increasedmemory read latency. To address this important but largely unexplored issue; this paperpresents three techniques to mitigate the LDPC-induced response time delay so that SSDscan benefit its strong error correction capability to the full extent.

Lightflood: an efficient flooding scheme for file search in unstructured peer-to-peer systems,Song Jiang; Lei Guo; Xiaodong Zhang," Flooding" is a fundamental operation in unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharingsystems; such as Gnutella. Although it is effective in content search; flooding is veryinefficient because it results in a great amount of redundant messages. Our study shows thatmore than 70% of the generated messages are redundant for a flooding with a TTL of 7 in amoderately connected network. Existing efforts to address this problem have been focusedon limiting the use of flooding operations. We propose LightFlood; an efficient floodingscheme; with the objective of minimizing the number of redundant messages and retainingthe same message propagating scope as that of standard flooding. By constructing a tree-like suboverlay within the existing P2P overlay called FloodNet; the flooding operation inLightFlood is divided into two stages. In the first stage; a message is propagated by using …,Parallel Processing; 2003. Proceedings. 2003 International Conference on,2003,118

Lightflood: Minimizing redundant messages and maximizing scope of peer-to-peer search,Song Jiang; Lei Guo; Xiaodong Zhang; Haodong Wang,Flooding is a fundamental file search operation in unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) filesharing systems; in which a peer starts the file search procedure by broadcasting a query toits neighbors; who continue to propagate it to their neighbors. This procedure repeats until atime-to-live (TTL) counter is decremented to 0. Flooding can seriously limit systemscalability; because the number of redundant query messages grows exponentially duringthe message propagation. Our study shows that more than 70 percent of the generatedmessages are redundant in a flooding with a TTL of 7 in a moderately connected Gnutellanetwork. Existing efforts to address this issue have been focused on limiting the use of theflooding operation.

Delving into internet streaming media delivery: a quality and resource utilization perspective,Lei Guo; Enhua Tan; Songqing Chen; Zhen Xiao; Oliver Spatscheck; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Modern Internet streaming services have utilized various techniques to improve thequality of streaming media delivery. Despite the characterization of media access patternsand user behaviors in many measurement studies; few studies have focused on thestreaming techniques themselves; particularly on the quality of streaming experiences theyoffer end users and on the resources of the media systems that they consume. In order togain insights into current streaming services techniques and thus provide guidance ondesigning resource-efficient and high quality streaming media systems; we have collected alarge streaming media workload from thousands of broadband home users and businessusers hosted by a major ISP; and analyzed the most commonly used streaming techniquessuch as automatic protocol switch; Fast Streaming; MBR encoding and rate adaptation …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement,2006,102
PSM-throttling: Minimizing energy consumption for bulk data communications in WLANs,Enhua Tan; Lei Guo; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,While the 802.11 power saving mode (PSM) and its enhancements can reduce powerconsumption by putting the wireless network interface (WNI) into sleep as much as possible;they either require additional infrastructure support; or may degrade the transmissionthroughput and cause additional transmission delay. These schemes are not suitable forlong and bulk data transmissions with strict QoS requirements on wireless devices. Withincreasingly abundant bandwidth available on the Internet; we have observed that TCPcongestion control is often not a constraint of bulk data transmissions as bandwidth throttlingis widely used in practice. In this paper; instead of further manipulating the trade-off betweenthe power saving and the incurred delay; we effectively explore the power saving potentialby considering the bandwidth throttling on streaming/downloading servers.

Design and analysis of sensing scheduling algorithms under partial coverage for object detection in sensor networks,Shansi Ren; Qun Li; Haining Wang; Xin Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Object detection quality and network lifetime are two conflicting aspects of a sensor network;but both are critical to many sensor applications such as military surveillance. Partialcoverage; where a sensing field is partially sensed by active sensors at any time; is anappropriate approach to balancing the two conflicting design requirements of monitoringapplications. Under partial coverage; we develop an analytical framework for objectdetection in sensor networks; and mathematically analyze average-case object detectionquality in random and synchronized sensing scheduling protocols. Our analytical frameworkfacilitates performance evaluation of a sensing schedule; network deployment; and sensingscheduling protocol design.

SmartSaver: turning flash drive into a disk energy saver for mobile computers,Feng Chen; Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract In a mobile computer the hard disk consumes a considerable amount of energy.Existing dynamic power management policies usually take conservative approaches to savedisk energy; and disk energy consumption remains a serious issue. Meanwhile; the flashdrive is becoming a must-have portable storage device for almost every laptop user ontravel. In this paper; we propose to make another highly desired use of the flash drive---saving disk energy. This is achieved by using the flash drive as a standby buffer for cachingand prefetching disk data. Our design significantly extends disk idle times with careful anddeliberate consideration of the particular characteristics of the flash drive. Trace-drivensimulations show that up to 41% of disk energy can be saved with a relatively small amountof data written to the flash drive.,Proceedings of the 2006 international symposium on Low power electronics and design,2006,91
SCOPE: Scalable consistency maintenance in structured P2P systems,Xin Chen; Shansi Ren; Haining Wang,While current peer-to-peer (P2P) systems facilitate static file sharing; newly developedapplications demand that P2P systems be able to manage dynamically changing files.Maintaining consistency between frequently updated files and their replicas is afundamental reliability requirement for a P2P system. In this paper; we present SCOPE; astructured P2P system supporting consistency among a large number of replicas. Bybuilding a replica-partition-tree (RPT) for each key; SCOPE keeps track of the locations ofreplicas and then propagates update notifications. Our theoretical analyses andexperimental results demonstrate that SCOPE can effectively maintain replica consistencywhile preventing hot spot and node-failure problems. Its efficiency in maintenance andfailure-recovery is particularly attractive to the deployment of large-scale P2P systems.,INFOCOM 2005. 24th Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies.

TopBT: a topology-aware and infrastructure-independent bittorrent client,Shansi Ren; Enhua Tan; Tian Luo; Songqing Chen; Lei Guo; Xiaodong Zhang,BitTorrent (BT) has carried out a significant and continuously increasing portion of Internettraffic. While several designs have been recently proposed and implemented to improve theresource utilization by bridging the application layer (overlay) and the network layer(underlay); these designs are largely dependent on Internet infrastructures; such as ISPsand CDNs. In addition; they also demand large-scale deployments of their systems to workeffectively. Consequently; they require multiefforts far beyond individual users' ability to bewidely used in the Internet.

Segment-based streaming media proxy: modeling and optimization,Songqing Chen; Bo Shen; Susie Wee; Xiaodong Zhang,Researchers often use segment-based proxy caching strategies to deliver streaming mediaby partially caching media objects. The existing strategies mainly consider increasing thebyte hit ratio and/or reducing the client perceived startup latency (denoted by the metricdelayed startup ratio). However; these efforts do not guarantee continuous media deliverybecause the to-be-viewed object segments may not be cached in the proxy when they aredemanded. The potential consequence is playback jitter at the client side due to proxy delayin fetching the uncached segments; which we call proxy jitter. Thus; for the best interests ofclients; a correct model for streaming proxy system design should aim to minimize proxy jittersubject to reducing the delayed startup ratio and increasing the byte hit ratio.

Server-based proxies are cost-effective but notscalable due to the limited proxy capacity in storage and bandwidth; and its centralizedcontrol also brings a single point of failure. Client-based P2P networks are scalable; but donot guarantee high-quality; streaming service due to the transient nature of peers. Toaddress these limitations; we present a novel and efficient design of a scalable and reliablemedia proxy system assisted by P2P networks; called PROP. In the PROP system; theclients' machines in an intranet are self-organized into a structured P2P system to provide …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,84
Two fast and high-associativity cache schemes,Chenxi Zhang; Xiaodong Zhang; Yong Yan,In the race to improve cache performance; many researchers have proposed schemes thatincrease a cache's associativity. The associativity of a cache is the number of places in thecache where a block may reside. In a direct-mapped cache; which has an associativity of 1;there is only one location to search for a match for each reference. In a cache withassociativity n-an n-way set-associative cache-there are n locations. Increasing associativityreduces the miss rate by decreasing the number of conflict; or interference; references. Thecolumn-associative cache and the predictive sequential associative cache seem to haveachieved near-optimal performance for an associativity of two. Increasing associativitybeyond two; therefore; is one of the most important ways to further improve cacheperformance. We propose two schemes for implementing associativity greater than two …,IEEE micro,1997,84
Latency metric: An experimental method for measuring and evaluating parallel program and architecture scalability,XD Zhang; Yong Yan; KQ He,Abstract Latency measures the delay caused by communication between processors andmemory modules over the network in a parallel system. Using intensive measurements andsimulation; we show that network latency forms a major obstacle to improving parallelcomputing performance and scalability. We present an experimental metric; using networklatency to measure and evaluate the scalability of parallel programs and architectures. Thislatency metric is an extension to the isoefficiency function [Grama et al.; IEEE Parallel Distrib.Technology 1; 3 (1993); 12-21] and iso-speed metric [Sun and Rover; IEEE Trans. ParallelDistrib. Systems 5; 6 (1994); 599-613]. We give a measurement method for using this latencymetric; and report the experimental results of evaluating the scalabilities of several scientificcomputing algorithms on the KSR-1 shared-memory architecture.

Low-cost and reliable mutual anonymity protocols in peer-to-peer networks,Li Xiao; Zhichen Xu; Xiaodong Zhang,We present several protocols to achieve mutual communication anonymity between aninformation requester and a provider in a P2P information-sharing environment; such thatneither the requester nor the provider can identify each other; and no other peers canidentify the two communicating parties with certainty. Most existing solutions achieve mutualanonymity in pure P2P systems without any trusted central controls. Compared with twosuch representative ones; our protocols improve efficiency in two different ways. First;utilizing trusted third parties and aiming at both reliability and low-cost; we propose a groupof mutual anonymity protocols. We show that with some limited central support; our protocolscan accomplish the goals of anonymity; efficiency; and reliability. Second; we propose amutual anonymity protocol which relies solely on self-organizations among peers without …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2003,79
Adaptively scheduling parallel loops in distributed shared-memory systems,Yong Yan; Canming Jin; Xiaodong Zhang,Using runtime information of load distributions and processor affinity; the authors propose anadaptive scheduling algorithm and its variations from different control mechanisms. Theproposed algorithm applies different degrees of aggressiveness to adjust loop schedulinggranularities; aiming at improving the execution performance of parallel loops by makingscheduling decisions that match the real workload distributions at runtime. Theyexperimentally compared the performance of the algorithm and its variations with severalexisting scheduling algorithms on two parallel machines: the KSR-1 and the ConvexExemplar. The kernel application programs used for performance evaluation were carefullyselected for different classes of parallel loops. The results show that using runtimeinformation to adaptively adjust scheduling granularity is an effective way to handle loops …,Ieee transactions on parallel and distributed systems,1997,75
Analysis of multimedia workloads with implications for Internet streaming,Lei Guo; Songqing Chen; Zhen Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we study the media workload collected from a large number ofcommercial Web sites hosted by a major ISP and that collected from a large group of homeusers connected to the Internet via a well-known cable company. Some of our key findingsare:(1) Surprisingly; the majority of media contents are still delivered via downloading fromWeb servers.(2) A substantial percentage of media downloading connections are abortedbefore completion due to the long waiting time.(3) A hybrid approach; pseudo streaming; isused by clients to imitate real streaming.(4) The mismatch between the downloading rateand the client playback speed in pseudo streaming is common; which either causes frequentplayback delays to the clients; or unnecessary traffic to the Internet.(5) Compared withstreaming; downloading and pseudo streaming are neither bandwidth efficient nor …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,74
Coordinating parallel processes on networks of workstations,Xing Du; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract The network of workstations (NOW) we consider for scheduling is heterogeneousand nondedicated; where computing power varies among the workstations and local andparallel jobs may interact with each other in execution. An effective NOW schedulingscheme needs sufficient information about system heterogeneity and job interactions. Weuse the measured power weight of each workstation to quantify the differences of computingcapability in the system. Without a processing power usage agreement between paralleljobs and local user jobs in a workstation; job interactions are unpredictable; andperformance of either type of jobs may not be guaranteed. Using the quantified anddeterministic system information; we design a scheduling scheme calledself-coordinatedlocal schedulingon a heterogeneous NOW.

Major technical advancements in Apache Hive,Yin Huai; Ashutosh Chauhan; Alan Gates; Gunther Hagleitner; N. Eric Hanson; Owen O'Malley; Jitendra Pandey; Yuan Yuan; Rubao Lee; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Apache Hive is a widely used data warehouse system for Apache Hadoop; and hasbeen adopted by many organizations for various big data analytics applications. Closelyworking with many users and organizations; we have identified several shortcomings of Hivein its file formats; query planning; and query execution; which are key factors determining theperformance of Hive. In order to make Hive continuously satisfy the requests andrequirements of processing increasingly high volumes data in a scalable and efficient way;we have set two goals related to storage and runtime performance in our efforts onadvancing Hive.

The Yin and Yang of processing data warehousing queries on GPU devices,Yuan Yuan; Rubao Lee; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Database community has made significant research efforts to optimize queryprocessing on GPUs in the past few years. However; we can hardly find that GPUs havebeen truly adopted in major warehousing production systems. Preparing to merge GPUs tothe warehousing systems; we have identified and addressed several critical issues in athree-dimensional study of warehousing queries on GPUs by varying query characteristics;software techniques; and GPU hardware configurations. We also propose an analyticalmodel to understand and predict the query performance on GPUs. Based on our study; wepresent our performance insights for warehousing query execution on GPUs.

SAT-Match: a self-adaptive topology matching method to achieve low lookup latency in structured P2P overlay networks,Shansi Ren; Lei Guo; Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Summary form only given. A peer-to-peer (P2P) system is built upon an overlay networkwhose topology is independent of the underlying physical network. A well-routed messagepath in an overlay network with a small number of logical hops can result in a long delay andexcessive traffic due to undesirably long distances in some physical links. We propose aneffective method; called SAT-Match; to adoptively construct structured P2P overlay networks;aiming at significantly reducing the lookup routing latency. In this method; each joining peeris initially guided to find a physically close neighbor to connect with. After then; its overlaylocation is adoptively adjusted whenever a location mismatch is detected. The topologymatching optimization in our method solely relies on local neighborhood information.Compared with existing topology matching methods; our method addresses their three …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2004.

MCC-DB: minimizing cache conflicts in multi-core processors for databases,Rubao Lee; Xiaoning Ding; Feng Chen; Qingda Lu; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract In a typical commercial multi-core processor; the last level cache (LLC) is shared bytwo or more cores. Existing studies have shown that the shared LLC is beneficial toconcurrent query processes with commonly shared data sets. However; the shared LLC canalso be a performance bottleneck to concurrent queries; each of which has private datastructures; such as a hash table for the widely used hash join operator; causing seriouscache conflicts. We show that cache conflicts on multi-core processors can significantlydegrade overall database performance. In this paper; we propose a hybrid system methodcalled MCC-DB for accelerating executions of warehouse-style queries; which relies on theDBMS knowledge of data access patterns to minimize LLC conflicts in multi-core systemsthrough an enhanced OS facility of cache partitioning. MCC-DB consists of three …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,65
ULC: A file block placement and replacement protocol to effectively exploit hierarchical locality in multi-level buffer caches,Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,In a large client/server cluster system; file blocks are cached in a multilevel storagehierarchy. Existing file block placement and replacement are either conducted on each levelof the hierarchy independently; or by applying an LRU policy on more than one levels. Onemajor limitation of these schemes is that hierarchical locality of file blocks with nonuniformstrengths is ignored; resulting in many unnecessary block misses; or additionalcommunication overhead. To address this issue; we propose a client-directed; coordinatedfile block placement and replacement protocol; where the nonuniform strengths of localityare dynamically identified on the client level to direct servers on placing or replacing fileblocks accordingly on different levels of the buffer caches. In other words; the caching layoutof the blocks in the hierarchy dynamically matches the locality of block accesses. The …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2004.

Soft-olp: Improving hardware cache performance through software-controlled object-level partitioning,Qingda Lu; Jiang Lin; Xiaoning Ding; Zhao Zhang; Xiaodong Zhang; P Sadayappan,Performance degradation of memory-intensive programs caused by the LRU policy'sinability to handle weak-locality data accesses in the last level cache is increasingly seriousfor two reasons. First; the last-level cache remains in the CPU's critical path; where onlysimple management mechanisms; such as LRU; can be used; precluding somesophisticated hardware mechanisms to address the problem. Second; the commonly usedshared cache structure of multi-core processors has made this critical path even moreperformance-sensitive due to intensive inter-thread contention for shared cache resources.Researchers have recently made efforts to address the problem with the LRU policy bypartitioning the cache using hardware or OS facilities guided by run-time locality information.Such approaches often rely on special hardware support or lack enough accuracy.

Effective load sharing on heterogeneous networks of workstations,Li Xiao; Xiadong Zhang; Yanxia Qu,We consider networks of workstations which are not only time-sharing; but alsoheterogeneous with a large variation in the computing power and memory capacities ofdifferent workstations. Many load sharing schemes mainly target sharing CPU resources;and have been intensively evaluated in homogeneous distributed environments. Howeverthe penalties of data accesses and movement in modern computer systems; such as pagefaults; have grown to the point where the overall performance of distributed systems cannotbe further improved without serious considerations concerning memory resources in thedesign of load sharing policies. Considering both system heterogeneity and effective usageof memory resources; we design and evaluate load sharing policies in order to minimizeboth CPU idle times and the number of page faults in heterogeneous distributed systems …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2000.

Designs of high quality streaming proxy systems,Songqing Chen; Bo Shen; Susie Wee; Xiaodong Zhang,Researchers often use segment-based proxy caching strategies to deliver streaming mediaby partially caching media objects. The existing strategies mainly consider increasing thebyte hit ratio and/or reducing the client perceived startup latency (denoted by the metricdelayed startup ratio). However; these efforts do not guarantee continuous media deliverybecause the to-be-viewed object segments may not be cached in the proxy when they aredemanded. The potential consequence is playback jitter at the client side due to proxy delayin fetching the uncached segments; which we call proxy jitter. Thus; for the best interests ofclients; a correct model for streaming proxy system design should aim to minimize proxy jittersubject to reducing the delayed startup ratio and increasing the byte hit ratio. However; wehave observed two major pairs of conflicting interests inherent in this model:(1) one …,INFOCOM 2004.

Making LRU friendly to weak locality workloads: A novel replacement algorithm to improve buffer cache performance,Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Although the LRU replacement algorithm has been widely used in buffer cachemanagement; it is well-known for its inability to cope with access patterns with weak locality.Previously proposed algorithms to improve LRU greatly increase complexity and/or cannotprovide consistently improved performance. Some of the algorithms only address LRUproblems on certain specific and predefined cases. Motivated by the limitations of existingalgorithms; we propose a general and efficient replacement algorithm; called Low Inter-reference Recency Set (LIRS). LIRS effectively addresses the limitations of LRU by usingrecency to evaluate Inter-Reference Recency (IRR) of accessed blocks for making areplacement decision. This is in contrast to what LRU does: directly using recency to predictthe next reference time. Meanwhile; LIRS mostly retains the simple assumption adopted …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2005,61
Improving memory performance of sorting algorithms,Li Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang; Stefan A Kubricht,Abstract Memory hierarchy considerations during sorting algorithm design andimplementation play an important role in significantly improving execution performance.Existing algorithms mainly attempt to reduce capacity misses on direct-mapped caches. Toreduce other types of cache misses that occur in the more common set-associative cachesand the TLB; we restructure the mergesort and quicksort algorithms further by integratingtiling; padding; and buffering techniques and by repartitioning the data set. Our study showsthat substantial performance improvements can be obtained using our new methods.,Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA),2000,61
STEP: Sequentiality and thrashing detection based prefetching to improve performance of networked storage servers,Shuang Liang; Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,State-of-the-art networked storage servers are equipped with increasingly powerfulcomputing capability and large DRAM memory as storage caches. However; theircontribution to the performance improvement of networked storage system has becomeincreasingly limited. This is because the client-side memory sizes are also increasing; whichreduces capacity misses in the client buffer caches as well as access locality in the storageservers; thus weakening the caching effectiveness of server storage caches. Proactivecaching in storage servers is highly desirable to reduce cold misses in clients. We proposean effective way to improve the utilization of storage server resources through prefetching instorage servers for clients. In particular; our design well utilizes two unique strengths ofnetworked storage servers which are not leveraged in existing storage server prefetching …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2007.

ULCC: a user-level facility for optimizing shared cache performance on multicores,Xiaoning Ding; Kaibo Wang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Scientific applications face serious performance challenges on multicoreprocessors; one of which is caused by access contention in last level shared caches frommultiple running threads. The contention increases the number of long latency memoryaccesses; and consequently increases application execution times. Optimizing sharedcache performance is critical to reduce significantly execution times of multi-threadedprograms on multicores. However; there are two unique problems to be solved beforeimplementing cache optimization techniques on multicores at the user level. First; availablecache space for each running thread in a last level cache is difficult to predict due to accesscontention in the shared space; which makes cache conscious algorithms for single coresineffective on multicores. Second; at the user level; programmers are not able to allocate …,Acm sigplan notices,2011,58
On reliable and scalable peer-to-peer web document sharing,Li Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang; Zhichen Xu,We propose a peer-to-peer Web document sharing technique; called a" browser-awareproxy server". In this design; a proxy server connecting to a group of networked clientsmaintains an index file of data objects of all the clients' browser caches. If a user requestmisses in its local browser cache and the proxy cache; the browser-aware proxy serversearches the index file; attempting to find it in another client's browser cache before sendingthe request to an upper-level proxy or to the Web server. If such a hit is found in a client; thisclient directly forwards the data object to the requesting client; or the proxy server fetches thedata object from this client and then forwards it to the requesting client. Trace-drivensimulations show that the amount of sharable data in browser caches is significant and canbe utilized for peer-to-peer document sharing to improve Web caching performance and …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium.; Proceedings International; IPDPS 2002; Abstracts and CD-ROM,2001,54
Unik: Unsupervised social network spam detection,Enhua Tan; Lei Guo; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang; Yihong Zhao,Abstract Social network spam increases explosively with the rapid development and wideusage of various social networks on the Internet. To timely detect spam in large socialnetwork sites; it is desirable to discover unsupervised schemes that can save the trainingcost of supervised schemes. In this work; we first show several limitations of existingunsupervised detection schemes. The main reason behind the limitations is that existingschemes heavily rely on spamming patterns that are constantly changing to avoid detection.Motivated by our observations; we first propose a sybil defense based spam detectionscheme SD2 that remarkably outperforms existing schemes by taking the social networkrelationship into consideration. In order to make it highly robust in facing an increased levelof spam attacks; we further design an unsupervised spam detection scheme; called UNIK …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,53
S-CAVE: effective SSD caching to improve virtual machine storage performance,Tian Luo; Siyuan Ma; Rubao Lee; Xiaodong Zhang; Deng Liu; Li Zhou,Abstract A unique challenge for SSD storage caching management in a virtual machine(VM) environment is to accomplish the dual objectives: maximizing utilization of shared SSDcache devices and ensuring performance isolation among VMs. In this paper; we presentour design and implementation of S-CAVE; a hypervisor-based SSD caching facility; whicheffectively manages a storage cache in a Multi-VM environment by collecting and exploitingruntime information from both VMs and storage devices. Due to a hypervisor's uniqueposition between VMs and hardware resources; S-CAVE does not require any modificationto guest OSes; user applications; or the underlying storage system. A critical issue toaddress in S-CAVE is how to allocate limited and shared SSD cache space among multipleVMs to achieve the dual goals. This is accomplished in two steps.

Access-mode predictions for low-power cache design,Zhichun Zhu; Xiaodong Zhang,The successful pursuit of high per- formance on computer systems has produced the negativeby-product of high power dissi- pation. Circuit-level techniques alone can no longer keep powerdissipation under a rea- sonable level. Researchers have made efforts to reduce power dissipationat the architec- tural level by producing such schemes as reducing on-chip cache powerconsump- tion—a major power consumer in micro- processors.1 For example; experts believethat the processor power consumed by on-chip caches will increase from the 15 percent in Compaq'sAlpha 21264 to 26 percent in future Alpha 21464 processors.2 A set-associative cache is commonlyused in modern computer systems for its ability to reduce cache conflict misses.

System and method for streaming media objects,*,A method and system for streaming media objects. A streaming system includes a group ofend nodes and at least one core node connected via an overlay network. The end nodescache segments of media objects and stream the media objects to a client segment bysegment. Each end node stores segment indices for locating segments cached on endnodes or a core node in the system. The core node is a dedicated proxy which fetchesmedia objects from a remote media server and streams the media objects to a client whenthe media objects are unavailable from the end nodes.,*,2012,49
Cooperative relay service in a wireless LAN,Lei Guo; Xiaoning Ding; Haining Wang; Qun Li; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,As a family of wireless local area network (WLAN) protocols between physical layer andhigher layer protocols; IEEE 802.11 has to accommodate the features and requirements ofboth ends. However; current practice has addressed the problems of these two layersseparately and is far from satisfactory. On one end; due to varying channel conditions;WLANs have to provide multiple physical channel rates to support various signal qualities. Alow channel rate station not only suffers low throughput; but also significantly degrades thethroughput of other stations. On the other end; the power saving mechanism of 802.11 isineffective in TCP-based communications; in which the wireless network interface (WNI) hasto stay awake to quickly acknowledge senders; and hence; the energy is wasted on channellistening during idle awake time.

Popularity-based PPM: An effective web prefetching technique for high accuracy and low storage,Xin Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Prediction by partial match (PPM) is a commonly used technique in Web prefetching; whereprefetching decisions are made based on historical URLs in a dynamically maintainedMarkov prediction tree. Existing approaches either widely store the URL nodes by buildingthe tree with a fixed height in each branch; or only store the branches with frequentlyaccessed URLs. Building the popularity information into the Markov prediction tree; wepropose a new prefetching model; called popularity-based PPM. In this model; the tree isdynamically updated with a variable height in each set of branches where a popular URLcan lead a set of long branches; and a less popular document leads a set of short ones.Since majority root nodes are popular URLs in our approach; the space allocation for storingnodes are effectively utilized.

Cached DRAM for ILP processor memory access latency reduction,Zhao Zhang; Zhichun Zhu; Xiaodong Zhang,As the speed gap between processor and memory widens; data-intensive applica- tions suchas commercial workloads increase demands on main memory systems. Conse- quently; memorystall time—both latency time and bandwidth time—can increase dra- matically; significantly impedingthe perfor- mance of these applications. DRAM latency; or the minimum time for a DRAM tophysi- cally read or write data; mainly determines latency time. The data transfer rate throughthe memory bus determines bandwidth time. Burger; Goodman; and Kägi show that mem- orybandwidth is a major performance bot- tleneck in memory systems.1 More recently; Cuppu etal. indicate that with improvements in bus technology; the most advanced mem- ory systems;such as synchronous DRAM (SDRAM); enhanced SDRAM; and Rambus DRAM; have significantlyreduced bandwidth time.2 However; DRAM speed has improved little.

Enabling software management for multicore caches with a lightweight hardware support,Jiang Lin; Qingda Lu; Xiaoning Ding; Zhao Zhang; Xiaodong Zhang; P Sadayappan,Abstract The management of shared caches in multicore processors is a critical andchallenging task. Many hardware and OS-based methods have been proposed. However;they may be hardly adopted in practice due to their non-trivial overheads; high complexities;and/or limited abilities to handle increasingly complicated scenarios of cache contentioncaused by many-cores. In order to turn cache partitioning methods into reality in themanagement of multicore processors; we propose to provide an affordable and lightweighthardware support to coordinate with OS-based cache management policies. The proposedmethods are scalable to many-cores; and perform comparably with other proposedhardware solutions; but have much lower overheads; therefore can be easily adopted incommodity processors.

Scap: Smart caching inwireless access points to improve p2p streaming,Enhua Tan; Lei Guo; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,The increasing number of wireless users in Internet P2P applications causes two newperformance problems due to the requirement of uploading the downloaded traffic for otherpeers; limited bandwidth of wireless communications; and resource competition between theaccess point and wireless stations.

Memory hierarchy considerations for cost-effective cluster computing,Xing Du; Xiaodong Zhang; Zhichun Zhu,Using off-the-shelf commodity workstations and PCs to build a cluster for parallel computinghas become a common practice. The cost-effectiveness of a cluster computing platform for agiven budget and for certain types of applications is mainly determined by its memoryhierarchy and the interconnection network configurations of the cluster. Finding such a cost-effective solution from exhaustive simulations would be highly time-consuming andpredictions from measurements on existing clusters would be impractical. We present ananalytical model for evaluating the performance impact of memory hierarchies and networkson cluster computing.

FloodTrail: an efficient file search technique in unstructured peer-to-peer systems,Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Searching efficiency is a decisive factor concerning scalability in large-scale peer-to-peer(P2P) file sharing systems. While flooding is the most commonly used and user-performanceoriented method to broadcast query across unstructured P2P networks; it generates a largenumber of redundant messages. Our study shows that more than 70% of messages areredundant using flooding in a moderately connected network; which imposes anincreasingly excessive burden on the underlying infrastructure; hindering the growth andscalability of P2P systems. To reduce the use of flooding as well as its associated overhead;we utilize access trails left by a standard flooding; which is a collection of P2P links used bynon-redundant messages. Thus the multiple queries following the flooding can bebroadcasted along the trail to achieve two goals:(1) The ability of flooding to achieve short …,Global Telecommunications Conference; 2003.

In-memory key-value stores have several uniqueproperties that include (1) data intensive operations demanding high memory bandwidth forfast data accesses;(2) high data parallelism and simple computing operations demandingmany slim parallel computing units; and (3) a large working set. As data volume continues toincrease; our experiments show that conventional and general-purpose multicore systemsare increasingly mismatched to the special properties of key-value stores because they donot provide massive data parallelism and high memory bandwidth; the powerful but thelimited number of computing cores do not satisfy the demand of the unique data processingtask; and the cache hierarchy may not well benefit to the large working set.

DOT: a matrix model for analyzing; optimizing and deploying software for big data analytics in distributed systems,Yin Huai; Rubao Lee; Simon Zhang; Cathy H Xia; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Traditional parallel processing models; such as BSP; are" scale up" based; aimingto achieve high performance by increasing computing power; interconnection networkbandwidth; and memory/storage capacity within dedicated systems; while big data analyticstasks aiming for high throughput demand that large distributed systems" scale out" bycontinuously adding computing and storage resources through networks. Each one of the"scale up" model and" scale out" model has a different set of performance requirements andsystem bottlenecks. In this paper; we develop a general model that abstracts criticalcomputation and communication behavior and computation-communication interactions forbig data analytics in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner.

A locality-aware cooperative cache management protocol to improve network file system performance,Song Jiang; Fabrizio Petrini; Xiaoning Ding; Xiaodong Zhang,In a distributed environment the utilization of file buffer caches in different clients may varygreatly. Cooperative caching is used to increase cache utilization by coordinating the usageof distributed caches. Existing cooperative caching protocols mainly address organizationalissues; paying little attention to exploiting locality of file access patterns. We propose alocality-aware cooperative caching protocol; called LAC; that is based on analysis andmanipulation of data block reuse distance to effectively predict cache utilization and theprobability of data reuse. Using a dynamically controlled synchronization technique; wemake local information consistently comparable among clients. The system is highlyscalable in the sense that global coordination is achieved without centralized control.,Distributed Computing Systems; 2006.

Incorporating job migration and network RAM to share cluster memory resources,Li Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang; Stefan A Kubricht,Job migrations and network RAM are two approaches for effectively using global memoryresources in a workstation cluster; aimed at reducing page faults in each local workstationand improving the overall performance of cluster computing. Using either remote executionsor pre-emptive migrations; a load-sharing system is able to migrate a job from a workstationwithout sufficient memory space to a lightly loaded workstation with a large idle memoryspace for the migrated job. In a network RAM system; if a job cannot find sufficient memoryspace for its working sets; it utilizes idle memory space from other workstations in the clusterthrough remote paging. Conducting trace-driven simulations; we have compared theperformance and tradeoffs of the two approaches and their impacts on job execution timeand cluster scalability.

DISC: Dynamic interleaved segment caching for interactive streaming,Lei Guo; Songqing Chen; Zhen Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang,Streaming media objects have become widely used on the Internet; and the demand ofinteractive requests to these objects has increased dramatically. Typical interactive requestsinclude fast forward and direct jumps. Unfortunately; most of existing streaming proxies aredesigned for sequential accesses; and only a few solutions have been proposed to maintainadditional data structures in the proxy to support some interactive operations (such as fastforward) other than jumps; which are among the most common interactive requests from theclients. Focusing on interactive accesses; in this paper; we present an analysis of streamingmedia workload collected from thousands of broadband users hosted by a major ISP. Ouranalysis shows that jump accesses (48%) and pauses (51%) are the dominant clientinteractive requests and that jump accesses often suffer serious delays due to slow …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2005.

Analyzing object detection quality under probabilistic coverage in sensor networks,Shansi Ren; Qun Li; Haining Wang; Xin Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Object detection quality and network lifetime are two conflicting aspects of a sensornetwork; but both are critical to many sensor applications such as military surveillance.Probabilistic coverage is an appropriate approach to balancing the conflicting designrequirements of monitoring applications. Under probabilistic coverage; we present ananalytical model to analyze object detection quality with respect to different networkconditions and sensor scheduling schemes. Our analytical model facilitates performanceevaluation of a sensing schedule; network deployment; and sensing scheduling protocoldesign.

Fine-grain priority scheduling on multi-channel memory systems,Zhichun Zhu; Zhao Zhang; Xiaodong Zhang,Configurations of contemporary DRAM memory systems become increasingly complex. Arecent study shows that the application performance is highly sensitive to choices ofconfigurations. In this study we show that; by utilizing fine-grain priority access scheduling;we are able to find a workload independent configuration that achieves optimal performanceon a multichannel memory system. Our approach can well utilize the available highconcurrency and high bandwidth on such memory systems; and effectively reduce thememory stall time of memory-intensive applications. Conducting execution-driven simulationof a 4-way issue; a 2 GHz processor; we show that the average performance improvementfor fifteen memory-intensive SPEC2000 programs by using an optimized fine-grain priorityscheduling is about 13% and 8% for a 2-channel and a 4-channel Direct Rambus DRAM …,High-Performance Computer Architecture; 2002.

Exploiting content localities for efficient search in P2P systems,Lei Guo; Song Jiang; Li Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Existing P2P search algorithms generally target either the performance objective ofimproving search quality from a client's perspective; or the objective of reducing search costfrom an Internet management perspective. We believe that the essential issue to beconsidered for designing and optimizing search algorithms in unstructured P2P networks isthe trade-off between the two performance objectives. Motivated by our observations; thelocality of content serving in the peer community and the localities of search interests ofindividual peers; we propose CAC-SPIRP; a fast and low cost P2P searching algorithm.

The first component aims to reduce the search cost byconstructing a CAC (C ontent A bundant C luster); where content-abundant peers self-identify; and self-organize themselves into an inter-connected cluster providing a pool of …,International Symposium on Distributed Computing,2004,35
SProxy: A caching infrastructure to support internet streaming,Songqing Chen; Bo Shen; Susie Wee; Xiaodong Zhang,Many algorithmic efforts have been made to address technical issues in designing astreaming media caching proxy. Typical of those are segment-based caching approachesthat efficiently cache large media objects in segments which reduces the startup latencywhile ensuring continuous streaming. However; few systems have been practicallyimplemented and deployed. The implementation and deployment efforts are hindered byseveral factors: 1) streaming of media content in complicated data formats is difficult; 2)typical streaming protocols such as RTP often run on UDP; in practice; UDP traffic is likely tobe blocked by firewalls at the client side due to security considerations; and 3) coordinationbetween caching discrete object segments and streaming continuous media data ischallenging. To address these problems; we have designed and implemented a segment …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2007,34
Method for prioritizing content,*,Methods and systems for prioritizing content are described. A request for a first contentobject is received at a caching proxy. A search of an access log of the proxy cache for aportion of the first content object is then performed. The size of the portion of the first contentobject on the proxy cache is calculated and the normally utilized size of the segment of thefirst content object is derived. A comparison is then made between the size of the portion ofthe first content object on the proxy cache and the normally utilized size of the first contentobject requested.,*,2007,34
Fast and low-cost search schemes by exploiting localities in P2P networks,Lei Guo; Song Jiang; Li Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Existing peer-to-peer (P2P) search algorithms generally target either theperformance objective of improving search quality from a client's perspective; or theobjective of reducing search cost from an Internet management perspective. Most existingwork of designing and optimizing search algorithms in unstructured P2P networksaddresses the trade-off between the two performance objectives. In contrast; our goal in thisstudy is to attempt to achieve both objectives.

Coordinated data prefetching by utilizing reference information at both proxy and web servers,Xin Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Existing prefetching techniques rely on server-based; proxy-based; or client-basedreference access information. Although Web servers may provide accurate accessinformation; our studies show that significant communication overhead can be involved bysending unnecessary reference information to clients or/and proxy servers. Our study alsoshows that prediction accuracy of proxy-based prefetching can be significantly limitedwithout input of Web servers. We propose a coordinated proxy-server prefetching techniquethat adaptively utilizes the reference information and coordinates prefetching activities atboth proxy and web servers. In our design; the reference access information stored in proxyservers will be the main source serving data prefetching for groups of clients; each of whomshares the common surfing interests.

Mutual anonymity protocols for hybrid peer-to-peer systems,Li Xiao; Zhichen Xu; Xiaodong Zhang,In a hybrid peer-to-peer (P2P) system; some operations are intentionally centralized; suchas indexing of peers' files. We present several protocols to achieve mutual communicationanonymity between an information requester and a provider in a hybrid P2P information-sharing environment with trusted index servers such that neither the requester; nor theprovider can identify each other and no other peers can identify the two communicatingparties with certainty. Some existing protocols provide solutions to achieve mutualanonymity in pure P2P systems without any trusted central controls. Compared with tworepresentative protocols; our proposed mutual anonymity protocols improve efficiency byutilizing trusted third parties and aiming at both reliability and low-cost. We show that withsome limited central support; our protocols can accomplish the goals of anonymity …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2003. Proceedings. 23rd International Conference on,2003,33
Comparative modeling and evaluation of CC-NUMA and COMA on hierarchical ring architectures,Xiaodong Zhang; Yong Yan,Parallel computing performance on scalable shared-memory architectures is affected by thestructure of the interconnection networks linking processors to memory modules and on theefficiency of the memory/cache management systems. Cache Coherence NonuniformMemory Access (CC-NUMA) and Cache Only Memory Access (COMA) are two effectivememory systems; and the hierarchical ring structure is an efficient interconnection network inhardware.

Parallel methods for solving nonlinear block bordered systems of equations,Xiaodong Zhang; Richard H Byrd; Robert B Schnabel,A group of parallel algorithms; and their implementation for solving a special class ofnonlinear equations; are discussed. The type of sparsity occurring in these problems; whicharise in VLSI design; structural engineering; and many other areas; is called a blockbordered structure. The explicit method and several implicit methods are described; and thenew corrected implicit method for solving block bordered nonlinear problems is presented.The relationship between the two types of methods is analyzed; and some computationalcomparisons are performed.

SRM-buffer: an OS buffer management technique to prevent last level cache from thrashing in multicores,Xiaoning Ding; Kaibo Wang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Buffer caches in operating systems keep active file blocks in memory to reduce diskaccesses. Related studies have been focused on how to minimize buffer misses and thecaused performance degradation. However; the side effects and performance implications ofaccessing the data in buffer caches (ie buffer cache hits) have not been paid attention. In thispaper; we show that accessing buffer caches can cause serious performance degradationon multicores; particularly with shared last level caches (LLCs). There are two reasons forthis problem. First; data in files normally have weaker localities than data objects in virtualmemory spaces. Second; due to the shared structure of LLCs on multicore processors; anapplication accessing the data in a buffer cache may flush the to-be-reused data of its co-running applications from the shared LLC and significantly slow down these applications …,Proceedings of the sixth conference on Computer systems,2011,31
Coordinated multilevel buffer cache management with consistent access locality quantification,Song Jiang; Kei Davis; Xiaodong Zhang,This paper proposes a protocol for effective coordinated buffer cache management in amultilevel cache hierarchy typical of a client/server system. Currently; such cachehierarchies are managed suboptimally-decisions about block placement and replacementare made locally at each level of the hierarchy without coordination between levels. Thoughstraightforward; this approach has several weaknesses: 1) Blocks may be redundantlycached; reducing the effective total cache size; 2) weakened locality at lower-level cachesmakes recency-based replacement algorithms such as LRU less effective; and 3) high-levelcaches cannot effectively identify blocks with strong locality and may place them in low-levelcaches; The fundamental reason for these weaknesses is that the locality informationembedded in the streams of access requests from clients is not consistently analyzed and …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2007,31
Dynamic load sharing with unknown memory demands in clusters,Songqing Chen; Li Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang,A compute farm is a pool of clustered workstations to provide high performance computingservices for CPU-intensive; memory-intensive; and I/O active jobs in a batch mode. Existingload sharing schemes with memory considerations assume jobs' memory demand sizes areknown in advance or predictable based on users' hints. This assumption can greatly simplifythe designs and implementations of load sharing schemes; but is not desirable in practice. Inorder to address this concern; we present three new results and contributions in this study.Conducting Linux kernel instrumentation; we have collected different types of workloadexecution traces to quantitatively characterize job interactions; and modeled page faultbehavior as a function of the overloaded memory sizes and the amount of jobs' I/O activities.Based on experimental results and collected dynamic system information; we have built a …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2001. 21st International Conference on.,2001,31

Adaptive memory allocations in clusters to handle unexpectedly large data-intensive jobs,Li Xiao; Songquing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,In a cluster system with dynamic load sharing support; a job submission or migration to aworkstation is determined by the availability of CPU and memory resources of theworkstation at the time (L. Xiao et al.; 2002). In such a system; a small number of runningjobs with unexpectedly large memory allocation requirements may significantly increase thequeuing delay times of the rest of jobs with normal memory requirements; slowing downexecution of each individual job and decreasing the system throughput. We call thisphenomenon the job blocking problem because the big jobs block the execution pace ofmajority jobs in the cluster. Since the memory demand of jobs may not be known in advanceand may change dynamically; the possibility of unsuitable job submissions/migrations tocause the blocking problem is high; and existing load sharing schemes are unable to …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2004,29
Cacheminer: A runtime approach to exploit cache locality on SMP,Yong Yan; Xiaodong Zhang,Exploiting cache locality of parallel programs at runtime is a complementary approach to acompiler optimization. This is particularly important for those applications with dynamicmemory access patterns. We propose a memory-layout oriented technique to exploit cachelocality of parallel loops at runtime on Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) systems. Guided byapplication-dependent and targeted architecture-dependent hints; our system; calledCacheminer; reorganizes and partitions a parallel loop using the memory-access space ofits execution. Through effective runtime transformations; our system maximizes the datareuse in each partitioned data region assigned in a cache; and minimizes the data sharingamong the partitioned data regions assigned to all caches. The executions of tasks in thepartitions are scheduled in an adaptive and locality-presented way to minimize the …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2000,29
Design and optimization of large size and low overhead off-chip caches,Zhao Zhang; Zhichun Zhu; Xiaodong Zhang,Large off-chip L3 caches can significantly improve the performance of memory-intensiveapplications. However; conventional L3 SRAM caches are facing two issues as thoseapplications require increasingly large caches. First; an SRAM cache has a limited size dueto the low density and high cost of SRAM and; thus; cannot hold the working sets of manymemory-intensive applications. Second; since the tag checking overhead of large caches isnontrivial; the existence of L3 caches increases the cache miss penalty and may even harmthe performance of some memory-intensive applications. To address these two issues; wepresent a new memory hierarchy design that uses cached DRAM to construct a large sizeand low overhead off-chip cache. The high density DRAM portion in the cached DRAM canhold large working sets; while the small SRAM portion exploits the spatial locality …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2004,28

GDM: device memory management for gpgpu computing,Kaibo Wang; Xiaoning Ding; Rubao Lee; Shinpei Kato; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract GPGPUs are evolving from dedicated accelerators towards mainstream commoditycomputing resources. During the transition; the lack of system management of devicememory space on GPGPUs has become a major hurdle. In existing GPGPU systems; devicememory space is still managed explicitly by individual applications; which not only increasesthe burden of programmers but can also cause application crashes; hangs; or lowperformance. In this paper; we present the design and implementation of GDM; a fullyfunctional GPGPU device memory manager to address the above problems and unleash thecomputing power of GPGPUs in general-purpose environments. To effectively coordinatethe device memory usage of different applications; GDM takes control over device memoryallocations and data transfers to and from device memory; leveraging a buffer allocated in …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2014,27
Bws: balanced work stealing for time-sharing multicores,Xiaoning Ding; Kaibo Wang; Phillip B Gibbons; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Running multithreaded programs in multicore systems has become a commonpractice for many application domains. Work stealing is a widely-adopted and effectiveapproach for managing and scheduling the concurrent tasks of such programs. Existingwork-stealing schedulers; however; are not effective when multiple applications time-share asingle multicore---their management of steal-attempting threads often causes unbalancedsystem effects that hurt both workload throughput and fairness. In this paper; we presentBWS (Balanced Work Stealing); a work-stealing scheduler for time-sharing multicoresystems that leverages new; lightweight operating system support. BWS improves systemthroughput and fairness via two means.

Whileapplication problems have a large number of possible causes; failures due to runtimeinteractions with the system environment (eg; configuration files; resource limitations; accesspermissions) are one of the most common categories.

Concurrent analytical query processing with GPUs,Kaibo Wang; Kai Zhang; Yuan Yuan; Siyuan Ma; Rubao Lee; Xiaoning Ding; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract In current databases; GPUs are used as dedicated accelerators to process eachindividual query. Sharing GPUs among concurrent queries is not supported; causing seriousresource underutilization. Based on the profiling of an open-source GPU query enginerunning commonly used single-query data warehousing workloads; we observe that theutilization of main GPU resources is only up to 25%. The underutilization leads to low systemthroughput. To address the problem; this paper proposes concurrent query execution as aneffective solution. To efficiently share GPUs among concurrent queries for high throughput;the major challenge is to provide software support to control and resolve resourcecontention incurred by the sharing. Our solution relies on GPU query scheduling and devicememory swapping policies to address this challenge. We have implemented a prototype …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,25
Investigating performance insights of segment-based proxy caching of streaming media strategies,Songqing Chen; Bo Shen; Susie J Wee; Xiaodong Zhang,In general; existing segment-based caching strategies target one of the following twoperformance objectives:(1) reducing client startup delay by giving a high priority to cache thebeginning segments of media objects; or (2) reducing server traffic by caching popularsegments of media objects. Our previous study has shown that the approach targeting thesecond objective has several advantages over the first one. However; we have alsoobserved that the effort of improving server traffic reduction can increase client startup delay;which may potentially offset the overall performance gain. Little work so far has consideredthese two objectives in concert. In this paper; we first build an analytical model for these twotypes of typical segment-based caching approaches. The analysis on the model reveals thenature of the trade-off between two performance objectives and the bounds of each are …,Multimedia Computing and Networking 2004,2003,25
A framework of performance prediction of parallel computing on nondedicated heterogeneous NOW,Xiaodong Zhang; Yong Yan,Abstract We study performance predictions for parallel computing on nondedicatedheterogeneous networks of workstations (NOW). Our approach is based on a two-levelmodel. On the top level a semi-deterministic task graph is used to capture the parallelexecution behavior including the variances of communications and synchronizations. On thebottom level; a discrete time model is used to quantify e ects from nondedicatedheterogeneous network systems. An iterative process is used to determine the interactive eects between network contention and task execution. We validated the prediction modelusing experiments on a nondedicated heterogeneous network of workstations.,ICPP (1),1995,25

Building a large and efficient hybrid peer-to-peer Internet caching system,Li Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang; Artur Andrzejak; Songqing Chen,Proxy hit ratios tend to decrease as the demand and supply of Web contents are becomingmore diverse. By case studies; we quantitatively confirm this trend and observe significantdocument duplications among a proxy and its client browsers' caches. One reason behindthis trend is that the client/server Web caching model does not support direct resourcesharing among clients; causing the Web contents and the network bandwidths amongclients to be relatively underutilized. To address these limits and improve Web cachingperformance; we have extensively enhanced and deployed our browsers-aware framework;a peer-to-peer Web caching management scheme. We make the browsers and their proxyshare the contents to exploit the neglected but rich data locality in browsers and reducedocument duplications among the proxy and browsers' caches to effectively utilize the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,24
Efficient distributed disk caching in data grid management,Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Effectively utilizing disk caches is critical for delivering and sharing data in data-gridsconsidering the large sizes of requested files and excessively prolonged file transmissiontime. An essential component in the disk cache management is its replacement policy thatdetermines which file (s) are least valuable and should be evicted to create space forincoming files. Though a large number of replacement algorithms for data objects of differentsizes have been proposed recently in the domain of Web-caching and disk caching in datagrids; they inherit the shortcomings of the LRU and LFU replacements in characterizationaccess patterns. In order to address this limit; we propose a technique to measure relativefile access locality strength-how soon a file is to be re-accessed before being evictedcompared with other files.

TPF: a dynamic system thrashing protection facility,Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Operating system designers attempt to keep high CPU utilization by maintaining anoptimal multiprogramming level (MPL). Although running more processes makes it lesslikely to leave the CPU idle; too many processes adversely incur serious memorycompetition; and even introduce thrashing; which eventually lowers CPU utilization. Acommon practice to address the problem is to lower the MPL with the aid of processswapping out/in operations. This approach is expensive and is only used when the systembegins serious thrashing. The objective of our study is to provide highly responsive and cost-effective thrashing protection by adaptively conducting priority page replacement in a timelymanner. We have designed a dynamic system Thrashing Protection Facility (TPF) in thesystem kernel. Once TPF detects system thrashing; one of the active processes will be …,Software: Practice and Experience,2002,23

SRB: Shared running buffers in proxy to exploit memory locality of multiple streaming media sessions,Songqing Chen; Bo Shen; Yong Yan; Sujoy Basu; Xiaodong Zhang,With the falling price of the memory; an increasing number of multimedia servers andproxies are now equipped with a large DRAM memory space. Caching media objects in thememory of a proxy helps to reduce network traffic; disk I/O bandwidth requirement; and datadelivery latency. The running buffer approach and its alternatives are representativetechniques to cache streaming data in the memory. However; there are two limits in theexisting techniques. First; although multiple running buffers for the same media object co-exist in a given processing period; data sharing among the multiple buffers is notconsidered. Second; user access patterns are not insightfully considered in the buffermanagement. In this paper; we propose two techniques based on shared running buffers(SRB) in the proxy to address these limits. Considering user access patterns and …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2004.

Triangular decomposition methods for solving reducible nonlinear systems of equations,John E Dennis; Jr; José Mario Martínez; Xiaodong Zhang,This paper generalizes to the nonlinear case a standard way to solve general sparsesystems of linear equations. In particular; Duff [J. Inst. Math. Appl.; 19 (1977); pp. 339–342]has suggested that row and column interchanges be applied to permute the coefficientmatrix of a linear system into block lower triangular forma The linear system then can besolved by using the associated block Gauss–Seidel or forward block substitution scheme.This is the approach taken in the Harwell MA28 routine. If more than one matrix with thesame sparsity pattern is to be factored; then the reordering need not be redone. In extendingthis approach to nonlinear problems; it is necessary to assume as in the linear case thatcomponent equations can be evaluated separately from equations in other blocks. Thealgorithm for doing the reordering is very fast; and if the equations can be put into block …,SIAM Journal on Optimization,1994,22
Evaluating and designing software mutual exclusion algorithms on shared-memory multiprocessors,Xiaodong Zhang; Yong Yan; Robert Castaneda,Performance evaluations of software-based mutual exclusion algorithms must take intoaccount the effects of architectures and systems. We demonstrate a framework for suchevaluation; and use the framework as a basis for designing more efficient algorithms. Wepropose a comprehensive performance evaluation framework that examines the overheadpatterns inherent in the mutual exclusion algorithms and in the architectures on which thealgorithms run. We used this framework to evaluate several representative mutual exclusionalgorithms on the BBN TC2000 and KSR-1.

Spammer behavior analysis and detection in user generated content on social networks,Enhua Tan; Lei Guo; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang; Yihong Zhao,Spam content is surging with an explosive increase of user generated content (UGC) on theInternet. Spammers often insert popular keywords or simply copy and paste recent articlesfrom the Web with spam links inserted; attempting to disable content-based detection. Inorder to effectively detect spam in user generated content; we first conduct a comprehensiveanalysis of spamming activities on a large commercial UGC site in 325 days covering over 6million posts and nearly 400 thousand users. Our analysis shows that UGC spammersexhibit unique non-textual patterns; such as posting activities; advertised spam link metrics;and spam hosting behaviors. Based on these non-textual features; we show via severalclassification methods that a high detection rate could be achieved offline. These resultsfurther motivate us to develop a runtime scheme; BARS; to detect spam posts based on …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2012 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2012,20
Token-ordered LRU: an effective page replacement policy and its implementation in Linux systems,Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Most computer systems use a global page replacement policy based on the LRUprinciple to approximately select a Least Recently Used page for a replacement in the entireuser memory space. During execution interactions; a memory page can be marked as LRUeven when its program is conducting page faults. We define the LRU pages under such acondition as false LRU pages because these LRU pages are not produced by programmemory reference delays; which is inconsistent with the LRU principle. False LRU pagescan significantly increase page faults; even cause system thrashing. This poses a moreserious risk in a large parallel systems with distributed memories because of the existence ofcoordination among processes running on individual node. In the case; the processthrashing in a single node or a small number of nodes could severely affect other nodes …,Performance Evaluation,2005,20
Caching for bursts (C-Burst): let hard disks sleep well and work energetically,Feng Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract High energy consumption has become a critical challenge in all kinds of computersystems. Hardware-supported Dynamic Power Management (DPM) provides a mechanismto save disk energy by transitioning an idle disk to a low-power mode. However; theachievable disk energy saving is mainly dependent on the pattern of I/O requests received atthe disk. In particular; for a given number of requests; a bursty disk access pattern serves asa foundation for energy optimization. Aggressive prefetching has been used to increase diskaccess burstiness and extend disk idle intervals; while caching; a critical component inbuffer cache management; has not been paid a specific attention. In the absence ofcooperation from caching; the attempt to create bursty disk accesses would often bedisturbed due to improper replacement decision made by energy unaware caching …,Proceedings of the 2008 international symposium on Low Power Electronics & Design,2008,19
Maintaining strong cache consistency for the domain name system,Xin Chen; Haining Wang; Shansi Ren; Xiaodong Zhang,Effective caching in the domain name system (DNS) is critical to its performance andscalability. Existing DNS only supports weak cache consistency by using the time-to-live(TTL) mechanism; which functions reasonably well in normal situations. However;maintaining strong cache consistency in DNS as an indispensable exceptional handlingmechanism has become more and more demanding for three important objectives: 1) toquickly respond and handle exceptions such as sudden and dramatic Internet failurescaused by natural and human disasters; 2) to adapt increasingly frequent changes ofInternet Protocol (IP) addresses due to the introduction of dynamic DNS techniques forvarious stationed and mobile devices on the Internet; and 3) to provide fine-grain controls forcontent delivery services to timely balance server load distributions.

Spin-lock synchronization on the butterfly and KSR1,Xiaodong Zhang; Robert Castañeda; Elisa W Chan,The drawbacks of the simple spin-lock limit its effective use to small critical sections.Applications with large critical sections and a large number of processors require moreefficient algorithms to minimize processor and network overheads. Variations on the spin-lock have been tested on the Sequent Symmetry; a bus-based shared-memorymultiprocessor. Algorithms for scalable synchronization have also been tested on the BBNButterfly I; a large-scale shared-memory multiprocessor with a multistage interconnectionnetwork (MIN). We have extended the investigation to the BBN GP1000 and TC2000; bothMIN-based multiprocessors with network contention heavier than that on the Butterfly I.

CUBS: Coordinated upload bandwidth sharing in residential networks,Enhua Tan; Lei Guo; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Millions of residential users are widely served by cable or DSL connections with modestupload bandwidth and relatively high download bandwidth. For the increasingly importantand demanding P2P applications such as VoIP; BitTorrent; and Internet streaming; stable orhigh upload bandwidth is required. Inadequate upload bandwidth degrades theperformance of these applications among residential users. On the other hand; our Internetmeasurements show that plenty of idle upload bandwidth (from 50% to 80%) is alwaysavailable in a local residential network. Based on this observation; we propose a systemprototype to Coordinate Upload Bandwidth Sharing (CUBS) among neighboring residentialusers. Specifically; the idle upload bandwidth of neighbors can be used upon a request froma demanding user. Since it has become a common practice to deploy wireless access …,Network Protocols; 2009.

Coordinated data prefetching for web contents,Xin Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract With the development of active proxy; the functions of a proxy have been enhancedbeyond simply storing Web contents. Web prefetching activity in proxy is such an example toreduce client-perceived latency. In this paper; we propose a coordinated proxy–serverprefetching technique that adaptively utilizes the access information and coordinatesprefetching activities at both proxy and Web servers. In our design; the access informationstored in proxies will be the main source serving data prefetching for groups of clientssharing common surfing interests. The access information in the Web server will be used toserve data prefetching only for data objects that are not qualified for proxy-basedprefetching. Conducting trace-driven simulations; we show that both hit ratios and byte hitratios contributed from coordinated proxy–server prefetching are 30–75% higher than …,Computer Communications,2005,18
Splitter: a proxy-based approach for post-migration testing of web applications,Xiaoning Ding; Hai Huang; Yaoping Ruan; Anees Shaikh; Brian Peterson; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract The benefits of virtualized IT environments; such as compute clouds; have drawninterested enterprises to migrate their applications onto new platforms to gain theadvantages of reduced hardware and energy costs; increased flexibility and deploymentspeed; and reduced management complexity. However; the process of migrating a complexapplication takes a considerable amount of effort; particularly when performing post-migration testing to verify that the application still functions correctly in the targetenvironment. The traditional approach of test case generation and execution can take weeksand synthetic test cases may not adequately reflect actual application usage. In this paper;we propose and evaluate a black-box approach for post-migration testing of Webapplications without manually creating test cases.

Evaluation and measurement of multiprocessor latency patterns,Xiaodong Zhang; Yong Yan; Keqiang He,Network latency; the delay caused by communication between processors and memorymodules over the network in a multiprocessor system; is a major source of degraded parallelcomputing performance. We first give an overview of an experimental metric which usesnetwork latency to measure and evaluate the scalability of parallel programs andarchitectures. We put emphasis on evaluation of latency sources and their methods inprogram execution. We report experimental results of evaluating the scalability of severalscientific computing algorithms on the KSR-1. In comparison; we also present preliminaryexperiments on the CM-5 multicomputer architecture. Our comparisons indicate that the CM-5 has less network latency effects and is a more scalable architecture the the KSR-1.

Design and analysis of wave sensing scheduling protocols for object-tracking applications,Shansi Ren; Qun Li; Haining Wang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Many sensor network applications demand tightly-bounded object detection quality.To meet such stringent requirements; we develop three sensing scheduling protocols toguarantee worst-case detection quality in a sensor network while reducing sensing powerconsumption. Our protocols emulate a line sweeping through all points in the sensing fieldperiodically. Nodes wake up when the sweeping line comes close; and then go to sleepwhen the line moves forward. In this way; any object can be detected within a certain period.We prove the correctness of the protocols and evaluate their performances by theoreticalanalyses and simulation.,International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems,2005,15
Adaptive and virtual reconfigurations for effective dynamic job scheduling in cluster systems,Songqing Chen; Li Xiao; Xiaodong Zhang,In a cluster system with dynamic load sharing support; a job submission or migration to aworkstation is determined by the availability of CPU and memory resources of theworkstation at the time. In such a system; a small number of running jobs with unexpectedlylarge memory allocation requirements may significantly increase the queuing delay times ofthe rest of jobs with normal memory requirements; slowing down executions of individualjobs and decreasing the system throughput. We call this phenomenon as the job blockingproblem because the big jobs block the execution pace of majority jobs in the cluster. Wepropose a software method incorporating with dynamic load sharing; which adaptivelyreserves a small set of workstations through virtual cluster reconfiguration to provide specialservices to the jobs demanding large memory allocations.

Understanding insights into the basic structure and essential issues of table placement methods in clusters,Yin Huai; Siyuan Ma; Rubao Lee; Owen O'Malley; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract A table placement method is a critical component in big data analytics ondistributed systems. It determines the way how data values in a two-dimensional table areorganized and stored in the underlying cluster. Based on Hadoop computing environments;several table placement methods have been proposed and implemented. However; acomprehensive and systematic study to understand; to compare; and to evaluate differenttable placement methods has not been done. Thus; it is highly desirable to gain importantinsights into the basic structure and essential issues of table placement methods in thecontext of big data processing infrastructures. In this paper; we present such a study. Thebasic structure of a data placement method consists of three core operations: rowreordering; table partitioning; and data packing.

Exploiting Idle Communication Power to Improve Wireless Network Performance and Energy Efficiency.,Lei Guo; Xiaoning Ding; Haining Wang; Qun Li; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract—As a family of wireless local area network (WLAN) protocols between physicallayer and higher-layer protocols; IEEE 802.11 has to accommodate the features andrequirements of both ends. However; current practice has addressed the problemsseparately and is far from being satisfactory. On one end; due to varying channel conditions;WLANs have to provide multiple data channel rates to support various signal qualities. A lowchannel rate station not only suffers low throughput; but also significantly degrades thethroughput of other stations. On the other end; TCP is not energy efficient running on 802.11.In a TCP session; a wireless network interface (WNI) has to stay awake to generate timelyacknowledgments; and hence; the energy is wasted by channel listening during idle awaketime.

Adaptive Page Replacement to Protect Thrashing in Linux.,Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract: Analyzing the variations of page replacement implementations in recent Linuxkernel versions of 2.0; 2.2; and 2.4; we compare their abilities to deal with system thrashing.We show that although the page implementation in Kernel 2.2 is relatively effective to protectthrashing among the three versions; none of them have adaptive ability; and thus theprotection is limited. By running several groups of memory-intensive application programson Kernel 2.2; we observe serious thrashing when memory shortage attains a certain level.,Annual Linux Showcase & Conference,2001,14
Breaking address mapping symmetry at multi-levels of memory hierarchy to reduce DRAM row-buffer conflicts,Zhao Zhang; Zhichun Zhu; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract DRAM row-buffers have become a critical level of cache in the memory hierarchy toexploit spatial locality in the cache miss stream. Row-buffer conflicts occur when a sequenceof requests on different pages goes to the same memory bank; causing higher memoryaccess latency than requests to the same row or to different banks. In this study; we firstshow that the address mapping symmetry between the cache and DRAM is the inherentsource of row-buffer conflicts. Breaking the symmetry to reduce the conflicts and to retain thespatial locality; we propose and evaluate a permutation-based page interleaving scheme.We have also evaluated and compared two representative cache mapping schemes thatbreak the symmetry at the cache level. We show that the proposed page interleavingscheme outperforms all other mapping schemes based on its overall performance and on …,The Journal of Instruction-Level Parallelism,2001,14
Comparative performance evaluation of hot spot contention between MIN-based and ring-based shared-memory architectures,Xiaodong Zhang; Yong Yan; Robert Castañeda,Hot spot contention on a network-based shared-memory architecture occurs when a largenumber of processors try to access a globally shared variable across the network. Whilemultistage interconnection network (MIN) and hierarchical ring (HR) structures are twoimportant bases on which to build large scale shared-memory multiprocessors; the differentinterconnection networks and cache/memory systems of the two architectures respond verydifferently to network bottleneck situations. In this paper; we present a comparativeperformance evaluation of hot spot effects on the MIN-based and HR-based shared-memoryarchitectures. Both nonblocking MIN-based and HR-based architectures are classified; andanalytical models are described for understanding network differences and for evaluatinghot spot performance on both architectures.

Distributed computation of electromagnetic scattering problems using finite-difference time-domain decompositions,Sandy T Nguyen; Brian J Zook; Xiaodong Zhang,Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) is an important numerical method for solvingelectromagnetic scattering problems. Solutions for these problems are computationallyintensive; In addition; large problems require large amounts of memory; making distributedmemory desirable. This paper describes distributed FDTD methods and theirimplementations on a distributed workstation network using PVM. We examine theparallelism of the methods and evaluate computing performance by studying loadbalancing; communication pattern variations; and scalability of the programs on thedistributed network systems.

BP-Wrapper: A system framework making any replacement algorithms (almost) lock contention free,Xiaoning Ding; Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,In a high-end database system; the execution concurrency level rises continuously in amultiprocessor environment due to the increase in number of concurrent transactions andthe introduction of multi-core processors. A new challenge for buffer management to addressis to retain its scalability in responding to the highly concurrent data processing demandsand environment. The page replacement algorithm; a major component in the buffermanagement; can seriously degrade the system's performance if the algorithm is notimplemented in a scalable way. A lock-protected data structure is used in most replacementalgorithms; where high contention is caused by concurrent accesses. A common practice isto modify a replacement algorithm to reduce the contention; such as to approximate the LRUreplacement with the clock algorithm. Unfortunately; this type of modification usually hurts …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,13
Characterizing and scheduling communication interactions of parallel and local jobs on networks of workstations,Yingfei Dong; Xing Du; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Networks of workstations (NOWS) are cost-effective platforms to perform parallelcomputation. Usually; a NOW is not dedicated to parallel jobs. Local users may run someapplications in their workstations which involve communications as well. This paperexamines the effects of communication interactions of parallel and local jobs on anondedicated NOW. Three representative communication patterns of parallel jobs areconsidered. A quantitative model to characterize the interactions is proposed. Measurementresults on a NOW support the analytical model and indicate that the network interface in theTCP/IP protocol forms a communication bottleneck during interactions because a standardnetwork interface with a single input/output queue is not able to distinguish communicationrequests from parallel and local jobs. Therefore; small but important communication …,Computer Communications,1998,13
Cache-optimal methods for bit-reversals,Zhao Zhang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Bit-reversals are representative and important data reordering operations in manyscientific computations. Performance degradation is mainly caused by cache conflict misses.Bit-reversals are often repeatedly used as fundamental subroutines for many scientificprograms. Thus; in order to gain the best performance; cache-optimal methods and theirimplementations should be carefully and precisely done at the programming level. This typeof performance programming for some special programs; such as the data reorderings; maysignificantly outperform an optimization from an automatic tool; such as a compiler. In thispaper; we examine different methods using techniques of blocking; buffering; and paddingfor efficient implementations.

A fast token-chasing mutual exclusion algorithm in arbitrary network topologies,Yong Yan; Xiaodong Zhang; Haixu Yang,Abstract We present a simple and efficient mutual exclusion algorithm whose optimalmessage passing complexity isO (N); whereNis the number of processors in the network.The message complexity is measured by counting the number of communication hops in anetwork for a given topology. This algorithm reduces its message passing complexity by atoken-chasing method; and enhances its effectiveness by dynamically adjusting stateinformation stored in each processor. Moreover; this algorithm shortens the request delay byfully taking advantage of the network dynamic status information. The performance of thealgorithm is also modeled for analytical evaluation. We have conducted a group ofexperiments on a network of workstations for comparisons between our algorithm and twoother existing mutual exclusion algorithms.

MESA: reducing cache conflicts by integrating static and run-time methods,Xiaoning Ding; Dimitrios S Nikolopoulos; Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,The paper proposes MESA (Multicoloring with Embedded Skewed Associativity); a novelcache indexing scheme that integrates dynamic page coloring with static skewedassociativity to reduce conflicts in L2/L3 caches with a small degree of associativity. MESAassociates multiple cache pages (colors) with each virtual memory page and uses two-levelskewed associativity; first to map a page to a different color in each bank of the cache; andthen to disperse the lines of a page across the banks and within the colors of the page.MESA is a multi-grained cache indexing scheme that combines the best of two worlds; pagecoloring and skewed associativity. We also propose a novel cache management schemebased on page remapping; which uses cache miss imbalance between colors in each bankas the metric to track conflicts and trigger remapping. We evaluate MESA using 24 …,Performance Analysis of Systems and Software; 2006 IEEE International Symposium on,2006,11

Communication and computation patterns of large scale image convolutions on parallel architectures,Sandra G Dykes; Xiaodong Zhang; Yan Zhou; Haixu Yang,Segmentation and other image processing operations rely on convolution calculations withheavy computational and memory access demands. The article presents an analysis of atexture segmentation application containing a 96/spl times/96 convolution. Sequentialexecution required several hours an single processor systems with over 99% of the timespent performing the large convolution. 70% to 75% of execution time is attributable tocache misses within the convolution.

Architectural effects of symmetric multiprocessors on TPC-C commercial workload,Xing Du; Xiaodong Zhang; Yingfei Dong; Lin Zhang,Abstract Commercial transaction processing applications are an important workload runningon symmetric multiprocessor systems (SMPs). They differ dramatically from scientific;numeric-intensive; and engineering applications because they are I/O bound; and theycontain more system software activities. Most SMP servers available in the market havebeen designed and optimized for scientific and engineering workloads. A major challenge ofstudying architectural effects on the performance of a commercial workload is the lack ofeasy access to large-scale and complex database engines running on a multiprocessorsystem with powerful I/O facilities.

Folding spatial image filters on the CM-5,Sandra G Dykes; Xiaodong Zhang,This paper presents an efficient data-parallel algorithm for general convolutions; andcompares its performance on the CM-5 to FFT frequency filtering. Sequential FFT filters arefaster than sequential convolutions for windows beyond a very small size; typically 6/spltimes/6 pixels. Our folded convolution algorithm shifts the convolution/FFT performancecrossover to much larger filter sizes. For 256/spl times/256 images on a 512 node CM-5; thefolded convolution is faster than FFT-filtering up to 36/spl times/36 windows.

BCC: Reducing False Aborts in Optimistic Concurrency Control with Low Cost for In-Memory Databases,Yuan Yuan; Kaibo Wang; Rubao Lee; Xiaoning Ding; Jing Xing; Spyros Blanas; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract The Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) method has been commonly used for in-memory databases to ensure transaction serializability---a transaction will be aborted if itsread set has been changed during execution. This simple criterion to abort transactionscauses a large proportion of false positives; leading to excessive transaction aborts.Transactions aborted false-positively (ie false aborts) waste system resources and cansignificantly degrade system throughput (as much as 3.68 x based on our experiments)when data contention is intensive. Modern in-memory databases run on systems withincreasingly parallel hardware and handle workloads with growing concurrency. They mustefficiently deal with data contention in the presence of greater concurrency by minimizingfalse aborts.

Cost-aware caching algorithms for distributed storage servers,Shuang Liang; Ke Chen; Song Jiang; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract We study replacement algorithms for non-uniform access caches that are used indistributed storage systems. Considering access latencies as major costs of datamanagement in such a system; we show that the total cost of any replacement algorithm isbounded by the total costs of evicted blocks plus the total cost of the optimal off-linealgorithm (OPT). We propose two off-line heuristics: MIN-d and MIN-cod; as well as an on-line algorithm: HD-cod; which can be run efficiently and perform well at the same time. Oursimulation results with Storage Performance Council (SPC)'s storage server traces showthat:(1) for off-line workloads; MIN-cod performs as well as OPT in some cases; all is at mostthree times worse in all test case;(2) for on-line workloads; HD-cod performs closely to thebest algorithms in all cases; and is the single algorithm that performs well in all test cases …,International Symposium on Distributed Computing,2007,8
Streaming flow analyses for prefetching in segment-based proxy caching to improve delivery quality,Songqing Chen; Bo Shen; Susie Wee; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Segment-based proxy caching schemes have been effectively used to deliverstreaming media objects. However; this approach does not always guarantee continuousdelivery because the to-be-viewed segments may not be cached in the proxy in time. Thepotential consequence is the playback jitter at the client side due to the proxy delay infetching these uncached segments; thus we call the problem proxy jitter.

The impact of memory hierarchies on cluster computing,Xing Du; Xiaodong Zhang,Using of-the-shelf commodity workstations and PCs to build a cluster for parallel computinghas become a common practice. A choice of a cost-effective cluster computing platform for agiven budget and for certain types of application workloads is mainly determined by itsmemory hierarchy and interconnection network of the cluster. Finding such a solution fromexhaustive simulations would be highly time-consuming and expensive; and predictionsfrom measurements on existing clusters would be impractical. We present an analyticalmodel for evaluating performance impact of memory hierarchies and networks on clustercomputing. The model covers the memory hierarchy of a single SMP; a cluster ofworkstations/PCs; or a cluster of SMPs by changing various modeling and architecturalparameters. Network variations covering bus and switch networks are also included in the …,Parallel Processing; 1999. 13th International and 10th Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing; 1999. 1999 IPPS/SPDP.

Lock bypassing: An efficient algorithm for concurrently accessing priority heaps,Yong Yan; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract The heap representation of priority queues is one of the most widely used datastructures in the design of parallel algorithms. Efficiently exploiting the parallelism of apriority heap has significant influence on the efficiency of a wide range of applications andparallel algorithms. In this paper; we propose an aggressive priority heap operatingalgorithm; called the lock bypassing algorithm (LB) on shared memory systems. Thisalgorithm minimizes interference of concurrent enqueue and dequeue operations on priorityheaps while keeping the strict priority property: a dequeue always returns the minimum of aheap. The unique idea that distinguishes the LB algorithm from previous concurrentalgorithms on priority heaps is the use of locking-on-demand and lock-bypassing techniquesto minimize locking granularity and to maximize parallelism. The LB algorithm allows an …,Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA),1998,8
Multi-column implementations for cache associativity,Chenxi Zhang; Xiaodong Zhang; Yong Yan,We propose two schemes for implementing higher associativity: the sequential multi-columncache; which is an extension of the column associative cache; and the parallel multi-columncache. In order to achieve the same access cycle time as that of a direct-mapped cache;data memory in the cache is organized into one bank in both schemes. We use the multipleMRU block technique to increase the first hit ratio; thus reducing the average access time.While the parallel multi-column cache performs the tag checking in parallel; the sequentialmulti-column cache sequentially searches through places in a set; and uses indexinformation to filter out unnecessary probes. In the case of an associativity of 4; they bothachieve the low miss rate of a 4-way set-associative cache. Our simulation results usingATUM traces show that both schemes can effectively reduce the average access time.,Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors; 1997. ICCD'97.

Profit-effective parallel computing,Yong Yan; Xiaodong Zhang,Researchers widely use speedup; efficiency; and scalability to assess parallel computingperformance. These metrics encourage researchers to use any novel technique to design orimprove a parallel system; without paying enough attention to the cost increase that such atechnique incurs. However; as national-defense applications are downsizing; commercialapplications are the dominant users of parallel systems. Customers and vendors areparticularly concerned with whether a parallel system can make a profit. Our major goal is toinvestigate financially justified parallel computing. To evaluate parallel computing'seffectiveness; we use a simple profitup metric to measure how performance; cost; andbusiness production affect profit. We focus on investigating the relationship between cost-effective parallel computing and profit-effective parallel computing.,IEEE Concurrency,1999,7
Multiprocessor scalability predictions through detailed program execution analysis,Xiaodong Zhang; Zhichen Xu,Abstract Scalability measures the ability of a parallel system to improve performance as thesize of an application problem and the number of processors involved increase. There aresome limits to existing scalability studies. First; the problem size in a computation is not well-defined. Second; the methods used to differentiate algorithmic and architectural scalabilitiesare not effective enough. Thh-dly; most approaches to scalability study are either highly time-consuming or restricted to simple problem/architecture structures. A major effort of this workis to address these limits. We have extended the latency metric[11] for more complex scalingof problems; and to possibly isolate the scalability of an algorithm from a parallel system.The scalability y prediction is based on a semi-empirical approach[10] that significantlyreduces the time and cost of measurements and simulation.

Accurately modeling workload interactions for deploying prefetching in Web servers,Xin Cheng; Xiaodong Zhang,Although Web prefetching is regarded as an effective method to improve client accessperformance; the associated overhead prevents it from being widely deployed. Specifically;a major weakness in existing Web servers is that prefetching activities are scheduledindependently of dynamically changing server workloads. Without proper control andcoordination between the two kinds of activities; prefetching can negatively affect the Webservices and degrade Web access performance. We first develop an open queuing model tocharacterize detailed transactions in Web servers. Using this model; we analyze serverresource utilization and average response time with different request arrival rates whenprefetching is involved under different kinds of Web services.

On scalable and locality-aware web document sharing,Li Xiao; Xin Chen; Xiaodong Zhang; Yunhao Liu,Abstract We propose a scalable Web document sharing infrastructure model calledBrowsers-Aware Proxy Server. In this design; a proxy server connecting to a group ofnetworked clients maintains an index file of data objects of all clients' browser caches. If auser request misses in its local browser cache and the proxy cache; the browsers-awareproxy server will search the index file attempting to find it in another client's browser cachebefore sending the request to an upper level proxy or the Web server. If such a request doeshit in a remote client; this client will directly forward the data object to the requesting client; orthe proxy server fetches the data object from this client and then forwards it to the requestingclient. The contributions of this caching model are twofold. First; we show that the amount ofsharable data in browser caches is significant and can be utilized for document sharing …,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,2003,6

An empirical study of a segment-based streaming proxy in an enterprise environment,Sumit Roy; Bo Shen; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Streaming media workloads have a number of desirable properties that make themgood candidates for caching via proxy systems. The content does not get modified; andaccess patterns exhibit some locality of reference. However; media files tend to be muchlarger in size than traditional web pages; and users tend to view video clips only partially.Hence; segment-based strategies have been proposed to deliver large streaming mediaobjects via a web-proxy. In this work; we evaluate the performance of such a segment-basedstreaming proxy using extensive trace driven simulation. We use representative workloadsfrom enterprise media server logs; and evaluate the caching system performance regardingdifferent cache sizes; different segment sizes; and different prefetching methods.

This paper proposes a memory-layoutoriented approach to exploit cache locality for parallel loops at run-time on symmetric multi-processor (SMP) systems. Guided by application-dependent hints and the targeted cachearchitecture; it reorganizes and partitions a parallel loop through shrinking and partitioningthe memory-access space of the loop at run-time. In the generated task partitions; the datasharing among partitions is minimized and the data reuse in a partition is maximized.

A semi-empirical approach to scalability study,Xiaodong Zhang; Zhichen Xu,A major limitation in existing scalability studies is the lack of effective ways to preciselypredict the scalabilities. Experimental and simulation methods are highly time consuming.Pure analytical methods usually focus on asymptotic behaviors of a parallel system; and areonly applicable to simple problem/architecture structures. Secondly; how to evaluate thescalability of applications and systems as independently as possible is a complex issue. In[1]; algorithm scalability is defined as the maximum achievable speedup on an architecturewith an idealized communication structure.

Bcc: Reducing false aborts in optimistic concurrency control with affordable cost for in-memory databases,Yuan Yuan; Kaibo Wang; Rubao Lee; Xiaoning Ding; Xiaodong Zhang,Optimistic concurrency control (OCC)[8] has been implemented in the recent in-memorydatabases for high performance and scalability [9; 5; 13; 14; 15; 10]. With the OCC method; adatabase executes each transaction in three phases: read; validation and write. In the readphase; the database keeps track of what the transaction reads into a read set and buffers thetransaction's writes into a write set. In the validation phase; the database validates if nochange has happened to the transaction's read set. Only when the validation succeeds willthe database install the transaction's writes to the database storage. Otherwise the databasewill abort the transaction. OCC is optimistic in the transaction read phase. Transactions inthe read phase cannot block the execution of other transactions. With the non-blockingfeature; we have witnessed throughputs of over 500;000 transactions per second …,system,1976,1
A distributed in-memory key-value store system on heterogeneous CPU–GPU cluster,Kai Zhang; Kaibo Wang; Yuan Yuan; Lei Guo; Rubao Li; Xiaodong Zhang; Bingsheng He; Jiayu Hu; Bei Hua,Abstract In-memory key-value stores play a critical role in many data-intensive applicationsto provide high-throughput and low latency data accesses. In-memory key-value stores haveseveral unique properties that include (1) data-intensive operations demanding highmemory bandwidth for fast data accesses;(2) high data parallelism and simple computingoperations demanding many slim parallel computing units; and (3) a large working set.However; our experiments show that homogeneous multicore CPU systems are increasinglymismatched to the special properties of key-value stores because they do not providemassive data parallelism and high memory bandwidth; the powerful but the limited numberof computing cores does not satisfy the demand of the unique data processing task; and thecache hierarchy may not well benefit to the large working set.

Enabling Effective Utilization of GPUs for Data Management Systems,Xiaodong Zhang,The research and development of today's data management systems for both transactionprocessing and data analytics are driven by an inevitable technology trend; namelyinmemory computing; and by an increasingly high demand of online applications frombillions of concurrent users. This requires that a data management system must be able toprovide both high throughput transactions and fast data analytics execution. GPU can playan important role in data management systems for both high throughput transactions andhigh performance data analytics. However; several fundamental challenges must beaddressed before GPU can be integrated into data management production systems. First;the low bandwidth PCIe connection between CPU host memory and GPU device memory isa bottleneck to limit GPUs to achieve their full potential for high performance data …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,*

LSbM-tree: Re-Enabling Buffer Caching in Data Management for Mixed Reads and Writes,Dejun Teng; Lei Guo; Rubao Lee; Feng Chen; Siyuan Ma; Yanfeng Zhang; Xiaodong Zhang,LSM-tree has been widely used in data management production systems for write-intensiveworkloads. However; as read and write workloads co-exist under LSM-tree; data accessescan experience long latency and low throughput due to the interferences to buffer cachingfrom the compaction; a major and frequent operation in LSM-tree. After a compaction; theexisting data blocks are reorganized and written to other locations on disks. As a result; therelated data blocks that have been loaded in the buffer cache are invalidated since theirreferencing addresses are changed; causing serious performance degradations. In order tore-enable high-speed buffer caching during intensive writes; we propose Log-Structuredbuffered-Merge tree (simplified as LSbM-tree) by adding a compaction buffer on disks; tominimize the cache invalidations on buffer cache caused by compactions.

SideWalk: A Facility of Lightweight Out-of-Band Communications for Augmenting Distributed Data Processing Flows,Yin Huai; Yuan Yuan; Rubao Lee; Xiaodong Zhang,The foundation of a data processing engine running on a large cluster is its programmingmodel that defines data processing operations and data movements. A special kind ofcommunication activities that are not normally defined in the programming model but areoften used in ad hoc ways in system development; is called out-of-band communications.The existing ad hoc solutions of out-of-band communications are often hard to reuse; error-prone; and not free from unwanted side effects. To address these issues; we have designedand implemented a standalone facility of out-of-band communications called SideWalk. Withthis facility; users can add out-of-band communication operations into their distributed dataflows through a set of reusable APIs. These APIs have well defined semantics and thus;users' chances of writing error-prone programs with SideWalk are minimized.

Peer‐to‐Peer Communication,Lei Guo; Xiaodong Zhang,A peer-to-peer (P2P) system is a type of distributed system constructed at the application leveland running at the edge of the Internet; usually on personal computers such as desktops andlaptops of millions of users. Each end point in a P2P system is called a peer. Peers communicatethrough peer-to-peer protocols; which are on top of the Transmission Control Protocol and InternetProtocol. Peer-to-peer communication mainly refers to the commu- nication protocols ofpeer-to-peer systems. Peer-to-peer communication is different from a tradi- tional client–servermodel. In peer-to-peer communication; peers in the system are symmetric: Each peer is botha client that requests information and services and a server that produces and/or provides informationand services. A peer in peer-to-peer systems is also known as a servent; abbreviated from thecombination of the words ''server'' and ''client.''

DiskSeen: A Prefetch Policy Based on Disk Layout and Access History,MARION KEI DAVIS; XIAONING DING; SONG JIANG; FENG CHEN; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract Current disk pre fetch policies in major operating systems track access patterns atthe level of the file abstraction. While this is sensible for exploiting application-level accesspatterns; file-level prefetching is not sufficient to realize the full performance improvementsachievable by prefetching. There are two reasons for this. First; certain prefetch opportunitiescan only be detected by knowing data layout on disk; such as the contiguous layout of filemeta-data and data from multiple files. Second; non-sequential access of disk data(requiring disk head movement) is much slower than sequential access; and the penalty formis-prefetching a'random'block; relative to that of a sequential block; is correspondinglymore costly. To overcome the inherent limitations of prefetching at the logical file level; wepropose to perform prefetching directly at the level of disk layout; and in a portable way …,*,2007,*

A comparative evaluation of hierarchical network architecture of the HP-Convex Exemplar,Robert Castañeda; Xiaodong Zhang; James M Hoover,The Convex Exemplar (SPP1000 and SPP2000 series) is a new commercial distributedshared-memory architecture. Using a set of system kernels and two application programs;we examine performance effects on network latency; hot spot contention; cache coherenceand overall scaling capability; which result both from the choice of the network structure aswell as from its CC-NUMA memory system feature. Since the KSR-1 was also targeted atscalable cache coherent shared-memory systems by using hierarchical interconnectionnetworks; we compared the architecture and performance results with the KSR-1. Ourexperiments indicate that the memory access latency of the Exemplar is comparatively lowdue to its fast processor node and the unique network/system structure. In addition; theCoherent Toroidal Interconnect (CTI) rings are efficient in handling cache coherence …,Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors; 1997. ICCD'97.

PSM~-thirottling: Mnimizing Energy onsu tion,Enhua Tani; Songqing Chen; Xiaodong Zhang,Abstract-While the 802.11 power saving mode (PSM) and its enhancements can reducepower consumption by putting the wireless network interface (WNI) into sleep as much aspossible; they either require additional infrastructure support; or may degrade thetransmission throughput and cause additional transmission delay. These schemes are notsuitable for long and bulk data transmissions with strict QoS requirements on wirelessdevices. With increasingly abundant bandwidth available on the Internet; we have observedthat TCP congestion control is often not a constraint of bulk data transmissions as bandwidththrottling is widely used in practice. In this paper; instead of further manipulating the trade-offbetween the power saving and the incurred delay; we effectively explore the power savingpotential by considering the bandwidth throttling on streaming/downloading servers.
