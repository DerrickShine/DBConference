Yago: a core of semantic knowledge,Fabian M Suchanek; Gjergji Kasneci; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract We present YAGO; a light-weight and extensible ontology with high coverage andquality. YAGO builds on entities and relations and currently contains more than 1 millionentities and 5 million facts. This includes the Is-A hierarchy as well as non-taxonomicrelations between entities (such as HASONEPRIZE). The facts have been automaticallyextracted from Wikipedia and unified with WordNet; using a carefully designed combinationof rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper. The resulting knowledge baseis a major step beyond WordNet: in quality by adding knowledge about individuals likepersons; organizations; products; etc. with their semantic relationships-and in quantity byincreasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluationof fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95%. YAGO is based on a logically clean …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,2475
Yago: A large ontology from wikipedia and wordnet,Fabian M Suchanek; Gjergji Kasneci; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract This article presents YAGO; a large ontology with high coverage and precision.YAGO has been automatically derived from Wikipedia and WordNet. It comprises entitiesand relations; and currently contains more than 1.7 million entities and 15 million facts.These include the taxonomic Is-A hierarchy as well as semantic relations between entities.The facts for YAGO have been extracted from the category system and the infoboxes ofWikipedia and have been combined with taxonomic relations from WordNet. Type checkingtechniques help us keep YAGO's precision at 95%—as proven by an extensive evaluationstudy. YAGO is based on a clean logical model with a decidable consistency. Furthermore; itallows representing n-ary relations in a natural way while maintaining compatibility withRDFS. A powerful query model facilitates access to YAGO's data.,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2008,748
Naga: Searching and ranking knowledge,Gjergji Kasneci; Fabian M Suchanek; Georgiana Ifrim; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,The Web has the potential to become the world's largest knowledge base. In order tounleash this potential; the wealth of information available on the Web needs to be extractedand organized. There is a need for new querying techniques that are simple and yet moreexpressive than those provided by standard keyword-based search engines. Searching forknowledge rather than Web pages needs to consider inherent semantic structures likeentities (person; organization; etc.) and relationships (isA; locatedIn; etc.). In this paper; wepropose NAGA; a new semantic search engine. NAGA builds on a knowledge base; which isorganized as a graph with typed edges; and consists of millions of entities and relationshipsextracted from Web-based corpora. A graph-based query language enables the formulationof queries with additional semantic information. We introduce a novel scoring model …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Star: Steiner-tree approximation in relationship graphs,Gjergji Kasneci; Maya Ramanath; Mauro Sozio; Fabian M Suchanek; Gerhard Weikum,Large graphs and networks are abundant in modern information systems: entity-relationshipgraphs over relational data or Web-extracted entities; biological networks; social onlinecommunities; knowledge bases; and many more. Often such data comes with expressivenode and edge labels that allow an interpretation as a semantic graph; and edge weightsthat reflect the strengths of semantic relations between entities. Finding close relationshipsbetween a given set of two; three; or more entities is an important building block for manysearch; ranking; and analysis tasks. From an algorithmic point of view; this translates intocomputing the best Steiner trees between the given nodes; a classical NP-hard problem. Inthis paper; we present a new approximation algorithm; coined STAR; for relationship queriesover large relationship graphs. We prove that for n query entities; STAR yields an O (log …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,131
YAWN: A Semantically Annotated Wikipedia XML Corpus.,Ralf Schenkel; Fabian M Suchanek; Gjergji Kasneci,Abstract: The paper presents YAWN; a system to convert the well-known and widely usedWikipedia collection into an XML corpus with semantically rich; self-explaining tags. Weintroduce algorithms to annotate pages and links with concepts from the WordNet thesaurus.This annotation process exploits categorical information in Wikipedia; which is a high-quality; manually assigned source of information; extracts additional information from lists;and utilizes the invocations of templates with named parameters. We give examples howsuch annotations can be exploited for high-precision queries.,BTW,2007,118
The YAGO-NAGA approach to knowledge discovery,Gjergji Kasneci; Maya Ramanath; Fabian Suchanek; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract This paper gives an overview on the YAGO-NAGA approach to informationextraction for building a conveniently searchable; large-scale; highly accurate knowledgebase of common facts. YAGO harvests infoboxes and category names of Wikipedia for factsabout individual entities; and it reconciles these with the taxonomic backbone of WordNet inorder to ensure that all entities have proper classes and the class system is consistent.Currently; the YAGO knowledge base contains about 19 million instances of binary relationsfor about 1.95 million entities. Based on intensive sampling; its accuracy is estimated to beabove 95 percent. The paper presents the architecture of the YAGO extractor toolkit; itsdistinctive approach to consistency checking; its provisions for maintenance and furthergrowth; and the query engine for YAGO; coined NAGA. It also discusses ongoing work on …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2009,114
Analyzing and predicting viral tweets,Maximilian Jenders; Gjergji Kasneci; Felix Naumann,Abstract Twitter and other microblogging services have become indispensable sources ofinformation in today's web. Understanding the main factors that make certain pieces ofinformation spread quickly in these platforms can be decisive for the analysis of opinionformation and many other opinion mining tasks. This paper addresses important questionsconcerning the spread of information on Twitter. What makes Twitter users retweet a tweet?Is it possible to predict whether a tweet will become" viral"; ie; will be frequently retweeted?To answer these questions we provide an extensive analysis of a wide range of tweet anduser features regarding their influence on the spread of tweets. The most impactful featuresare chosen to build a learning model that predicts viral tweets with high accuracy. Allexperiments are performed on a real-world dataset; extracted through a public Twitter API …,Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web,2013,75
Ming: mining informative entity relationship subgraphs,Gjergji Kasneci; Shady Elbassuoni; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Many modern applications are faced with the task of knowledge discovery in entity-relationship graphs; such as domain-specific knowledge bases or social networks. Miningan" informative" subgraph that can explain the relations between k (>= 2) given entities ofinterest is a frequent knowledge discovery scenario on such graphs. We present MING; aprincipled method for extracting an informative subgraph for given query nodes. MING buildson a new notion of informativeness of nodes. This is used in a random-walk-with-restartsprocess to compute the informativeness of entire subgraphs.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,67
Database and information-retrieval methods for knowledge discovery,Gerhard Weikum; Gjergji Kasneci; Maya Ramanath; Fabian Suchanek,Our aim here is to advocate for the integration of database systems (DB) and information-retrieval(IR) methods to address applications that are emerging from the ongoing explosion and diversificationof digital information. One grand goal of such an endeavor is the automatic building and maintenanceof a comprehensive knowledge base of facts from encyclopedic sources and the scientificliterature. Facts should be represented in terms of typed entities and relationships and allowexpressive queries that return ranked results with precision in an efficient and scalablemanner. We thus explore how DB and IR methods might contribute toward this ambitiousgoal … DB and IR are separate fields in computer science due to historical accident.

Sigma: Simple greedy matching for aligning large knowledge bases,Simon Lacoste-Julien; Konstantina Palla; Alex Davies; Gjergji Kasneci; Thore Graepel; Zoubin Ghahramani,Abstract The Internet has enabled the creation of a growing number of large-scaleknowledge bases in a variety of domains containing complementary information. Tools forautomatically aligning these knowledge bases would make it possible to unify many sourcesof structured knowledge and answer complex queries. However; the efficient alignment oflarge-scale knowledge bases still poses a considerable challenge. Here; we present SimpleGreedy Matching (SiGMa); a simple algorithm for aligning knowledge bases with millions ofentities and facts. SiGMa is an iterative propagation algorithm that leverages both thestructural information from the relationship graph and flexible similarity measures betweenentity properties in a greedy local search; which makes it scalable. Despite its greedy nature;our experiments indicate that SiGMa can efficiently match some of the world's largest …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,61
Crowd iq: aggregating opinions to boost performance,Yoram Bachrach; Thore Graepel; Gjergji Kasneci; Michal Kosinski; Jurgen Van Gael,Abstract We show how the quality of decisions based on the aggregated opinions of thecrowd can be conveniently studied using a sample of individual responses to a standard IQquestionnaire. We aggregated the responses to the IQ questionnaire using simple majorityvoting and a machine learning approach based on a probabilistic graphical model. Thescore for the aggregated questionnaire; Crowd IQ; serves as a quality measure of decisionsbased on aggregating opinions; which also allows quantifying individual and crowdperformance on the same scale. We show that Crowd IQ grows quickly with the size of thecrowd but saturates; and that for small homogeneous crowds the Crowd IQ significantlyexceeds the IQ of even their most intelligent member. We investigate alternative ways ofaggregating the responses and the impact of the aggregation method on the resulting …,Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems-Volume 1,2012,50
Bayesian online clustering of eye movement data,Enkelejda Tafaj; Gjergji Kasneci; Wolfgang Rosenstiel; Martin Bogdan,Abstract The task of automatically tracking the visual attention in dynamic visual scenes ishighly challenging. To approach it; we propose a Bayesian online learning algorithm. As thevisual scene changes and new objects appear; based on a mixture model; the algorithm canidentify and tell visual saccades (transitions) from visual fixation clusters (regions of interest).The approach is evaluated on real-world data; collected from eye-tracking experiments indriving sessions.,Proceedings of the symposium on eye tracking research and applications,2012,47
Cobayes: bayesian knowledge corroboration with assessors of unknown areas of expertise,Gjergji Kasneci; Jurgen Van Gael; David Stern; Thore Graepel,Abstract Our work aims at building probabilistic tools for constructing and maintaining large-scale knowledge bases containing entity-relationship-entity triples (statements) extractedfrom the Web. In order to mitigate the uncertainty inherent in information extraction andintegration we propose leveraging the" wisdom of the crowds" by aggregating truthassessments that users provide about statements. The suggested method; CoBayes;operates on a collection of statements; a set of deduction rules (eg transitivity); a set of users;and a set of truth assessments of users about statements. We propose a joint probabilisticmodel of the truth values of statements and the expertise of users for assessing statements.The truth values of statements are interconnected through derivations based on thededuction rules. The correctness of a user's assessment for a given statement is modeled …,Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2011,46
Crowd IQ: Measuring the intelligence of crowdsourcing platforms,Michal Kosinski; Yoram Bachrach; Gjergji Kasneci; Jurgen Van-Gael; Thore Graepel,Abstract We measure crowdsourcing performance based on a standard IQ questionnaire;and examine Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) performance under different conditions.These include variations of the payment amount offered; the way incorrect responses affectworkers' reputations; threshold reputation scores of participating AMT workers; and thenumber of workers per task. We show that crowds composed of workers of high reputationachieve higher performance than low reputation crowds; and the effect of the amount ofpayment is non-monotone---both paying too much and too little affects performance.Furthermore; higher performance is achieved when the task is designed such that incorrectresponses can decrease workers' reputation scores. Using majority vote to aggregatemultiple responses to the same task can significantly improve performance; which can be …,Proceedings of the 4th annual ACM web science conference,2012,43
Active knowledge: dynamically enriching RDF knowledge bases by web services,Nicoleta Preda; Gjergji Kasneci; Fabian M Suchanek; Thomas Neumann; Wenjun Yuan; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract The proliferation of knowledge-sharing communities and the advances ininformation extraction have enabled the construction of large knowledge bases using theRDF data model to represent entities and relationships. However; as the Web and its latentlyembedded facts evolve; a knowledge base can never be complete and up-to-date. On theother hand; a rapidly increasing suite of Web services provide access to timely and high-quality information; but this is encapsulated by the service interface. We propose to leveragethe information that could be dynamically obtained from Web services in order to enrich RDFknowledge bases on the fly whenever the knowledge base does not suffice to answer a userquery. To this end; we develop a sound framework for appropriately generating queries toencapsulated Web services and efficient algorithms for query execution and result …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,43
NAGA: harvesting; searching and ranking knowledge,Gjergji Kasneci; Fabian M Suchanek; Georgiana Ifrim; Shady Elbassuoni; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract The presence of encyclopedic Web sources; such as Wikipedia; the Internet MovieDatabase (IMDB); World Factbook; etc. calls for new querying techniques that are simpleand yet more expressive than those provided by standard keyword-based search engines.Searching for explicit knowledge needs to consider inherent semantic structures involvingentities and relationships. In this demonstration proposal; we describe a semantic searchsystem named NAGA. NAGA operates on a knowledge graph; which contains millions ofentities and relationships derived from various encyclopedic Web sources; such as the onesabove. NAGA's graph-based query language is geared towards expressing queries withadditional semantic information. Its scoring model is based on the principles of generativelanguage models; and formalizes several desiderata such as confidence; informativeness …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,37
Online classification of eye tracking data for automated analysis of traffic hazard perception,Enkelejda Tafaj; Thomas C Kübler; Gjergji Kasneci; Wolfgang Rosenstiel; Martin Bogdan,Abstract Complex and hazardous driving situations often arise with the delayed perceptionof traffic objects. To automatically detect whether such objects have been perceived by thedriver; there is a need for techniques that can reliably recognize whether the driver's eyeshave fixated or are pursuing the hazardous object (ie; detecting fixations; saccades; andsmooth pursuits from raw eye tracking data). This paper presents a system for analyzing thedriver's visual behavior based on an adaptive online algorithm for detecting anddistinguishing between fixation clusters; saccades; and smooth pursuits.,*,2013,30
Automated feature generation from structured knowledge,Weiwei Cheng; Gjergji Kasneci; Thore Graepel; David Stern; Ralf Herbrich,Abstract The prediction accuracy of any learning algorithm highly depends on the quality ofthe selected features; but often; the task of feature construction and selection is tedious andnonscalable. In recent years; however; there have been numerous projects with the goal ofconstructing general-purpose or domain-specific knowledge bases with entity-relationship-entity triples extracted from various Web sources or collected from user communities; egYAGO; DBpedia; Freebase; UMLS; etc. This paper advocates the simple and yet far-reaching idea that the structured knowledge contained in such knowledge bases can beexploited to automatically extract features for general learning tasks. We introduce anexpressive graph-based language for extracting features from such knowledge bases and atheoretical framework for constructing feature vectors from the extracted features.

Bayesian knowledge corroboration with logical rules and user feedback,Gjergji Kasneci; Jurgen Van Gael; Ralf Herbrich; Thore Graepel,Abstract Current knowledge bases suffer from either low coverage or low accuracy. Theunderlying hypothesis of this work is that user feedback can greatly improve the quality ofautomatically extracted knowledge bases. The feedback could help quantify the uncertaintyassociated with the stored statements and would enable mechanisms for searching; rankingand reasoning at entity-relationship level. Most importantly; a principled model for exploitinguser feedback to learn the truth values of statements in the knowledge base would be amajor step forward in addressing the issue of knowledge base curation. We present a familyof probabilistic graphical models that builds on user feedback and logical inference rulesderived from the popular Semantic-Web formalism of RDFS [1]. Through internal inferenceand belief propagation; these models can learn both; the truth values of the statements in …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2010,26
Latent topics in graph-structured data,Christoph Böhm; Gjergji Kasneci; Felix Naumann,Abstract Large amounts of graph-structured data are emerging from various avenues;ranging from natural and life sciences to social and semantic web communities. We addressthe problem of discovering subgraphs of entities that reflect latent topics in graph-structureddata. These topics are structured meta-information providing further insights into the data.The presented approach effectively detects such topics by exploiting only the structure of theunderlying graph; thus avoiding the dependency on textual labels; which are a scarce assetin prevalent graph datasets. The viability of our approach is demonstrated in experiments onreal-world datasets.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,24
Graffiti: graph-based classification in heterogeneous networks,Ralitsa Angelova; Gjergji Kasneci; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract We address the problem of multi-label classification in heterogeneous graphs;where nodes belong to different types and different types have different sets of classificationlabels. We present a novel approach that aims to classify nodes based on theirneighborhoods. We model the mutual influence of nodes as a random walk in which therandom surfer aims at distributing class labels to nodes while walking through the graph.When viewing class labels as “colors”; the random surfer is essentially spraying differentnode types with different color palettes; hence the name Graffiti of our method. In contrast toprevious work on topic-based random surfer models; our approach captures and exploits themutual influence of nodes of the same type based on their connections to nodes of othertypes. We show important properties of our algorithm such as convergence and scalability …,World Wide Web,2012,23
Temporal anomaly detection in business processes,Andreas Rogge-Solti; Gjergji Kasneci,Abstract The analysis of business processes is often challenging not only because ofintricate dependencies between process activities but also because of various sources offaults within the activities. The automated detection of potential business process anomaliescould immensely help business analysts and other process participants detect andunderstand the causes of process errors. This work focuses on temporal anomalies; ie;anomalies concerning the runtime of activities within a process. To detect such anomalies;we propose a Bayesian model that can be automatically inferred form the Petri netrepresentation of a business process. Probabilistic inference on the above model allows thedetection of non-obvious and interdependent temporal anomalies.,International Conference on Business Process Management,2014,22
The applicability of probabilistic methods to the online recognition of fixations and saccades in dynamic scenes,Enkelejda Kasneci; Gjergji Kasneci; Thomas C Kübler; Wolfgang Rosenstiel,Abstract In many applications involving scanpath analysis; especially when dynamic scenesare viewed; consecutive fixations and saccades; have to be identified and extracted fromraw eye-tracking data in an online fashion. Since probabilistic methods can adapt not only tothe individual viewing behavior; but also to changes in the scene; they are best suited forsuch tasks. In this paper we analyze the applicability of two types of main-streamprobabilistic models to the identification of fixations and saccades in dynamic scenes:(1)Hidden Markov Models and (2) Bayesian Online Mixture Models. We analyze and comparethe classification performance of the models on eye-tracking data collected during real-worlddriving experiments.,Proceedings of the Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications,2014,21
BEL: Bagging for entity linking,Zhe Zuo; Gjergji Kasneci; Toni Gruetze; Felix Naumann,Abstract With recent advances in the areas of knowledge engineering and informationextraction; the task of linking textual mentions of named entities to corresponding ones in aknowledge base has received much attention. The rich; structured information in state-of-the-art knowledge bases can be leveraged to facilitate this task. Although recent approachesachieve satisfactory accuracy results; they typically suffer from at least one of the followingissues:(1) the linking quality is highly sensitive to the amount of textual information; typically;long textual fragments are needed to capture the context of a mention;(2) the disambiguationuncertainty is not explicitly addressed and often only implicitly represented by the ranking ofentities to which a mention could be linked;(3) complex; joint reasoning negatively affectsthe efficiency. We propose an entity linking technique that addresses the above issues by …,Proceedings of COLING 2014; the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,2014,16
PupilNet: convolutional neural networks for robust pupil detection,Wolfgang Fuhl; Thiago Santini; Gjergji Kasneci; Enkelejda Kasneci,Abstract: Real-time; accurate; and robust pupil detection is an essential prerequisite forpervasive video-based eye-tracking. However; automated pupil detection in real-worldscenarios has proven to be an intricate challenge due to fast illumination changes; pupilocclusion; non centered and off-axis eye recording; and physiological eye characteristics. Inthis paper; we propose and evaluate a method based on a novel dual convolutional neuralnetwork pipeline. In its first stage the pipeline performs coarse pupil position identificationusing a convolutional neural network and subregions from a downscaled input image todecrease computational costs. Using subregions derived from a small window around theinitial pupil position estimate; the second pipeline stage employs another convolutionalneural network to refine this position; resulting in an increased pupil detection rate up to …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1601.04902,2016,14

If a userposes a query that cannot be answered by the local database alone; ANGIE calls theappropriate Web services to retrieve the missing information. This information is integratedseamlessly and transparently into the local database; so that the user can query and browsethe knowledge base while appropriate Web services are called automatically in thebackground.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,14
Vuvuzelas & active learning for online classification,Ulrich Paquet; Jurgen Van Gael; David Stern; Gjergji Kasneci; Ralf Herbrich; Thore Graepel,Abstract Many online service systems leverage user-generated content from Web 2.0 styleplatforms such as Wikipedia; Twitter; Facebook; and many more. Often; the value lies in thefreshness of this information (eg tweets; event-based articles; blog posts; etc.). Thisfreshness poses a challenge for supervised learning models as they frequently have to dealwith previously unseen features. In this paper we address the problem of onlineclassification for tweets; namely; how can a classifier be updated in an online manner; sothat it can correctly classify the latest “hype” on Twitter? We propose a two-step strategy tosolve this problem. The first step follows an active learning strategy that enables theselection of tweets for which a label would be most useful; the selected tweet is thenforwarded to Amazon Mechanical Turk where it is labeled by multiple users.

We address this limitation with NAGA 1; a new semanticsearch engine. NAGA builds on a large semantic knowledge base of binary relationships(facts) derived from the Web. NAGA provides a simple; yet expressive query language toquery this knowledge base. The results are then ranked with an intuitive scoring mechanism.We show the effectiveness and utility of NAGA by comparing its output with that of Googleonsome interesting queries.,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,12

The complexity of reasoning about pattern-based XML schemas,Gjergji Kasneci; Thomas Schwentick,Abstract In a recent paper; Martens et al. introduced a specification mechanism for XML treelanguages; based on rules of the form (r; s); wherer; s are regular expressions. Sets of suchrules can be interpreted in an existential or a universal fashion. An XML tree is existentiallyvalid with respect to a rule set; if for each node there is a rule such that the root path of thenode matches r and the children sequence of the node matchess. It is universally valid ifeach node matching r also matchess. This paper investigates the complexity of reasoningabout such rule sets; in particular the satisfiability and the implication problem. Whereas; ingeneral these reasoning problems are complete for EXPTIME; two important fragments areidentified with PSPACE and PTIME complexity; respectively.,Proceedings of the twenty-sixth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2007,10
CohEEL: Coherent and efficient named entity linking through random walks,Toni Gruetze; Gjergji Kasneci; Zhe Zuo; Felix Naumann,Abstract In recent years; the ever-growing amount of documents on the Web as well as indigital libraries led to a considerable increase of valuable textual information about entities.Harvesting entity knowledge from these large text collections is a major challenge. Itrequires the linkage of textual mentions within the documents with their real-world entities.This process is called entity linking. Solutions to this entity linking problem have typicallyaimed at balancing the rate of linking correctness (precision) and the linking coverage rate(recall). While entity links in texts could be used to improve various Information Retrievaltasks; such as text summarization; document classification; or topic-based clustering; thelinking precision is the decisive factor. For example; for topic-based clustering a method thatproduces mostly correct links would be more desirable than a high-coverage method that …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2016,8
Tweet-recommender: finding relevant tweets for news articles,Ralf Krestel; Thomas Werkmeister; Timur Pratama Wiradarma; Gjergji Kasneci,Abstract Twitter has become a prime source for disseminating news and opinions. However;the length of tweets prohibits detailed descriptions; instead; tweets sometimes contain URLsthat link to detailed news articles.

Aggregating physiological and eye tracking signals to predict perception in the absence of ground truth,Enkelejda Kasneci; Thomas Kübler; Klaus Broelemann; Gjergji Kasneci,Abstract Today's driving assistance systems build on numerous sensors to provideassistance for specific tasks. In order to not patronize the driver; intensity and timing ofcritical responses by such systems is determined based on parameters derived from vehicledynamics and scene recognition. However; to date; information on object perception by thedriver is not considered by such systems. With advances in eye-tracking technology; apowerful tool to assess the driver's visual perception has become available; which; in manystudies; has been integrated with physiological signals; ie; galvanic skin response and EEG;for reliable prediction of object perception. We address the problem of aggregating binarysignals from physiological sensors and eye tracking to predict a driver's visual perception ofscene hazards. In the absence of ground truth; it is crucial to use an aggregation scheme …,Computers in Human Behavior,2017,6
Bootstrapping Wikipedia to answer ambiguous person name queries,Toni Gruetze; Gjergji Kasneci; Zhe Zuo; Felix Naumann,Some of the main ranking features of today's search engines reflect result popularity and arebased on ranking models; such as PageRank; implicit feedback aggregation; and more.While such features yield satisfactory results for a wide range of queries; they aggravate theproblem of search for ambiguous entities: Searching for a person yields satisfactory resultsonly if the person in question is represented by a high-ranked Web page and all requiredinformation are contained in this page. Otherwise; the user has to either reformulate/refinethe query or manually inspect low-ranked results to find the person in question. A possibleapproach to solve this problem is to cluster the results; so that each cluster represents one ofthe persons occurring in the answer set. However clustering search results has proven to bea difficult endeavor by itself; where the clusters are typically of moderate quality.

A serendipity model for news recommendation,Maximilian Jenders; T Lindhauer; Gjergji Kasneci; Ralf Krestel; Felix Naumann,Abstract Recommendation algorithms typically work by suggesting items that are similar tothe ones that a user likes; or items that similar users like. We propose a content-basedrecommendation technique with the focus on serendipity of news recommendations.Serendipitous recommendations have the characteristic of being unexpected yet fortunateand interesting to the user; and thus might yield higher user satisfaction. In our work; weexplore the concept of serendipity in the area of news articles and propose a generalframework that incorporates the benefits of serendipity-and similarity-basedrecommendation techniques.

Assigning global relevance scores to DBpedia facts,Philipp Langer; Patrick Schulze; Stefan George; Matthias Kohnen; Tobias Metzke; Ziawasch Abedjan; Gjergji Kasneci,Knowledge bases have become ubiquitous assets in today's Web. They provide access tobillions of statements about real-world entities derived from governmental; institutional;product-oriented; bibliographic; bio-chemical; and many other domain-oriented and general-purpose datasets. The sheer amount of statements that can be retrieved for a given entitycalls for ranking techniques that return the most salient; ie; globally relevant; statements astop results. In this paper we analyze and compare various strategies for assigning globalrelevance scores to DBpedia facts with the goal to derive the best one among thesestrategies. Some of these strategies build on complementary aspects such as frequency andinverse document frequency; yet others combine structural information about the underlyingknowledge graph with Web-based co-occurrence statistics for entity pairs.

Licon: A linear weighting scheme for the contribution ofinput variables in deep artificial neural networks,Gjergji Kasneci; Thomas Gottron,Abstract In recent years artificial neural networks have become the method of choice formany pattern recognition tasks. Despite their overwhelming success; a rigorous and easy tointerpret mathematical explanation of the influence of input variables on a output producedby a neural network is still missing. We propose a generic framework as well as a concretemethod for quantifying the influence of individual input signals on the output computed by adeep neural network. Inspired by the variable weighting scheme in the log-linearcombination of variables in logistic regression; the proposed method provides linear modelsfor specific observations of the input variables. This linear model locally approximates thebehaviour of the neural network and can be used to quantify the influence of input variablesin a principled way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,2

DBrev: Dreaming of a Database Revolution.,Gjergji Kasneci; Jurgen Van Gael; Thore Graepel,ABSTRACT The database community has provided excellent frameworks for efficientquerying and online transaction or analytical processing. The main assumption underlyingmost of these frameworks is that there is no uncertainty regarding the stored data. However;in recent years; many important applications have emerged that need to manage noisy;corrupted; or incomplete data. This includes; eg; anonymized data; data derived from sensorsystems; or data from information extraction and integration systems. For such applicationsthe assumption of logical consistency may not be valid and needs to be revised. Inparticular; techniques like probabilistic modelling and statistical inference may be necessaryto be able to draw meaningful conclusions from the underlying data.

LTD-RBM: Robust and Fast Latent Truth Discovery Using Restricted Boltzmann Machines,Klaus Broelemann; Thomas Gottron; Gjergji Kasneci,We address the problem of latent truth discovery; LTD for short; where the goal is to discoverthe underlying true values of entity attributes in the presence of noisy; conflicting orincomplete information. Despite a multitude of algorithms addressing the LTD problem; onlylittle is known about their overall performance with respect to effectiveness; efficiency androbustness. The LTD model proposed in this paper is based on Restricted BoltzmannMachines; thus coined LTD-RBM. In extensive experiments on various heterogeneous andpublicly available datasets; LTD-RBM is superior to state-of-the-art LTD techniques in termsof an overall consideration of effectiveness; efficiency and robustness.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1
Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Robust and Fast Latent Truth Discovery,Klaus Broelemann; Thomas Gottron; Gjergji Kasneci,Abstract: We address the problem of latent truth discovery; LTD for short; where the goal is todiscover the underlying true values of entity attributes in the presence of noisy; conflicting orincomplete information. Despite a multitude of algorithms to address the LTD problem thatcan be found in literature; only little is known about their overall performance with respect toeffectiveness (in terms of truth discovery capabilities); efficiency and robustness. A practicalLTD approach should satisfy all these characteristics so that it can be applied toheterogeneous datasets of varying quality and degrees of cleanliness. We propose a novelalgorithm for LTD that satisfies the above requirements. The proposed model is based onRestricted Boltzmann Machines; thus coined LTD-RBM. In extensive experiments on variousheterogeneous and publicly available datasets; LTD-RBM is superior to state-of-the-art …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00283,2017,*
PupilNet v2. 0: Convolutional Neural Networks for CPU based real time Robust Pupil Detection,Wolfgang Fuhl; Thiago Santini; Gjergji Kasneci; Wolfgang Rosenstiel; Enkelejda Kasneci,Abstract: Real-time; accurate; and robust pupil detection is an essential prerequisite forpervasive video-based eye-tracking. However; automated pupil detection in realworldscenarios has proven to be an intricate challenge due to fast illumination changes; pupilocclusion; non-centered and off-axis eye recording; as well as physiological eyecharacteristics. In this paper; we approach this challenge through: I) a convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) running in real time on a single core; II) a novel computational intensive twostage CNN for accuracy improvement; and III) a fast propability distribution based refinementmethod as a practical alternative to II. We evaluate the proposed approaches against thestate-of-the-art pupil detection algorithms; improving the detection rate up to~ 9% percentpoints on average over all data sets (~ 7% on one CPU core 7ms). This evaluation was …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.00112,2017,*
