Automatic subspace clustering of high dimensional data for data mining applications,Rakesh Agrawal; Johannes Gehrke; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Prabhakar Raghavan,Abstract Data mining applications place special requirements on clustering algorithmsincluding: the ability to find clusters embedded in subspaces of high dimensional data;scalability; end-user comprehensibility of the results; non-presumption of any canonical datadistribution; and insensitivity to the order of input records. We present CLIQUE; a clusteringalgorithm that satisfies each of these requirements. CLIQUE identifies dense clusters insubspaces of maximum dimensionality. It generates cluster descriptions in the form of DNFexpressions that are minimized for ease of comprehension. It produces identical resultsirrespective of the order in which input records are presented and does not presume anyspecific mathematical form for data distribution. Through experiments; we show that CLIQUEefficiently finds accurate cluster in large high dimensional datasets.,ACM Sigmod Record,1998,3209
Discovering similar multidimensional trajectories,Michail Vlachos; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,We investigate techniques for analysis and retrieval of object trajectories in two or threedimensional space. Such data usually contain a large amount of noise; that has madepreviously used metrics fail. Therefore; we formalize non-metric similarity functions based onthe longest common subsequence (LCSS); which are very robust to noise and furthermoreprovide an intuitive notion of similarity between trajectories by giving more weight to similarportions of the sequences. Stretching of sequences in time is allowed; as well as globaltranslation of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that compute thesesimilarity measures are also provided. We compare these new methods to the widely usedEuclidean and time warping distance functions (for real and synthetic data) and show thesuperiority of our approach; especially in the strong presence of noise. We prove a …,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,1235
Mining process models from workflow logs,Rakesh Agrawal; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Frank Leymann,Abstract Modern enterprises increasingly use the workflow paradigm to prescribe howbusiness processes should be performed. Processes are typically modeled as annotatedactivity graphs. We present an approach for a system that constructs process models fromlogs of past; unstructured executions of the given process. The graph so produced conformsto the dependencies and past executions present in the log. By providing models thatcapture the previous executions of the process; this technique allows easier introduction of aworkflow system and evaluation and evolution of existing process models. We also presentresults from applying the algorithm to synthetic data sets as well as process logs obtainedfrom an IBM Flowmark installation.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1998,997

A local search mechanism for peer-to-peer networks,Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti,Abstract One important problem in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is searching and retrievingthe correct information. However; existing searching mechanisms in pure peer-to-peernetworks are inefficient due to the decentralized nature of such networks. We propose twomechanisms for information retrieval in pure peer-to-peer networks. The first; the modifiedBreadth-First Search (BFS) mechanism; is an extension of the current Gnuttela protocol;allows searching with keywords; and is designed to minimize the number of messages thatare needed to search the network. The second; the Intelligent Search mechanism; uses thepast behavior of the P2P network to further improve the scalability of the search procedure.In this algorithm; each peer autonomously decides which of its peers are most likely toanswer a given query. The algorithm is entirely distributed; and therefore scales well with …,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,559
On indexing mobile objects,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract We show how to index mobile objects in one and two dimensions using efficientdynamic external memory data structures. The problem is motivated by real life applicationsin traffic monitoring; intelligent navigation and mobile communications domains. For the l-dimensional case; we give (i) a dynamic; external memory algorithm with guaranteed worstcase performance and linear space and (ii) a practical approximation algorithm also in thedynamic; external memory setting; which has linear space and expected logarithmic querytime. We also give an algorithm with guaranteed logarithmic query time for a restrictedversion of the problem. We present extensions of our techniques to two dimensions.

We describe a new algorithm thatdirectly exploits all user-specified constraints including minimum support; minimumconfidence; and a new constraint that ensures every mined rule offers a predictiveadvantage over any of its simplifications. Our algorithm maintains efficiency even at lowsupports on data that is dense (eg relational data).

Our specific area of interest is theefficient retrieval and analysis of trajectory similarities. Trajectory datasets are very commonin environmental applications; mobility experiments; video surveillance and are especiallyimportant for the discovery of certain biological patterns.

Sensors at different locations can generate streaming data; which can beanalyzed in real-time to identify events of interest. In this paper; we propose a framework thatcomputes in a distributed fashion an approximation of multi-dimensional data distributions inorder to enable complex applications in resource-constrained sensor networks. We motivateour technique in the context of the problem of outlier detection. We demonstrate how ourframework can be extended in order to identify either distance-or density-based outliers in asingle pass over the data; and with limited memory requirements.

Finding similar time series,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Similarity of objects is one of the crucial concepts in several applications; includingdata mining. For complex objects; similarity is nontrivial to define. In this paper we presentan intuitive model for measuring the similarity between two time series. The model takes intoaccount outliers; different scaling functions; and variable sampling rates. Using methodsfrom computational geometry; we show that this notion of similarity can be computed inpolynomial time. Using statistical approximation techniques; the algorithms can be speededup considerably.

Expression of fatty acid sensing G-protein coupled receptors in peripartal Holstein cows,Alea Agrawal; Abdulrahman Alharthi; Mario Vailati-Riboni; Zheng Zhou; Juan J Loor,G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR); also referred as Free Fatty Acid Receptors (FFAR); arewidely studied within human medicine as drug targets for metabolic disorders. To combatmetabolic disorders prevalent in dairy cows during the transition period; which co-occur withnegative energy balance and changes to lipid and glucose metabolism; it may be helpful toidentify locations and roles of FFAR and other members of the GPCR family in bovinetissues.

Locally adaptive metric nearest-neighbor classification,Carlotta Domeniconi; Jing Peng; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Nearest-neighbor classification assumes locally constant class conditional probabilities.This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with finite samples due to the curse ofdimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under these conditions when using thenearest-neighbor rule. We propose a locally adaptive nearest-neighbor classificationmethod to try to minimize bias. We use a chi-squared distance analysis to compute a flexiblemetric for producing neighborhoods that are highly adaptive to query locations.Neighborhoods are elongated along less relevant feature dimensions and constricted alongmost influential ones. As a result; the class conditional probabilities are smoother in themodified neighborhoods; whereby better classification performance can be achieved.

Identifying similarities; periodicities and bursts for online search queries,Michail Vlachos; Christopher Meek; Zografoula Vagena; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We present several methods for mining knowledge from the query logs of the MSNsearch engine. Using the query logs; we build a time series for each query word or phrase(eg;'Thanksgiving'or'Christmas gifts') where the elements of the time series are the numberof times that a query is issued on a day. All of the methods we describe use sequences ofthis form and can be applied to time series data generally. Our primary goal is the discoveryof semantically similar queries and we do so by identifying queries with similar demandpatterns. Utilizing the best Fourier coefficients and the energy of the omitted components; weimprove upon the state-of-the-art in time-series similarity matching. The extracted sequencefeatures are then organized in an efficient metric tree index structure. We also demonstratehow to efficiently and accurately discover the important periods in a time-series.

Indexing large human-motion databases,Eamonn Keogh; Themistoklis Palpanas; Victor B Zordan; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Marc Cardle,Abstract Data-driven animation has become the industry standard for computer games andmany animated movies and special effects. In particular; motion capture data recorded fromlive actors; is the most promising approach offered thus far for animating realistic humancharacters. However; the manipulation of such data for general use and re-use is not yet asolved problem. Many of the existing techniques dealing with editing motion rely on indexingfor annotation; segmentation; and re-ordering of the data. Euclidean distance isinappropriate for solving these indexing problems because of the inherent variability foundin human motion. The limitations of Euclidean distance stems from the fact that it is verysensitive to distortions in the time axis. A partial solution to this problem; Dynamic TimeWarping (DTW); aligns the time axis before calculating the Euclidean distance.

Data mining; hypergraph transversals; and machine learning,Dimitrios Gunopulos; Heikki Mannila; Roni Khardon; Hannu Toivonen,Abstract Several data mining problems can be formulated as problems of finding maximallyspecific sentences that are interesting in a database. We first show that this problem has aclose relationship with the hypergraph transversal problem. We then analyze two algorithmsthat have been previously used in data mining; proving upper bounds on their complexity.The first algorithm is useful when the maximally specific interesting sentences are “small”.We show that this algorithm can also be used to efficiently solve a special case of thehypergraph transversal problem; improving on previous results. The second algorithmutilizes a subroutine for hypergraph transversals; and is applicable in more generalsituations; with complexity close to a lower bound for the problem.

Locally adaptive metrics for clustering high dimensional data,Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Sheng Ma; Bojun Yan; Muna Al-Razgan; Dimitris Papadopoulos,Abstract Clustering suffers from the curse of dimensionality; and similarity functions that useall input features with equal relevance may not be effective. We introduce an algorithm thatdiscovers clusters in subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions via localweightings of features. This approach avoids the risk of loss of information encountered inglobal dimensionality reduction techniques; and does not assume any data distributionmodel. Our method associates to each cluster a weight vector; whose values capture therelevance of features within the corresponding cluster. We experimentally demonstrate thegain in perfomance our method achieves with respect to competitive methods; using bothsynthetic and real datasets. In particular; our results show the feasibility of the proposedtechnique to perform simultaneous clustering of genes and conditions in gene expression …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2007,232
Approximating multi-dimensional aggregate range queries over real attributes,Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlotta Domeniconi,Abstract Finding approximate answers to multi-dimensional range queries over real valuedattributes has significant applications in data exploration and database query optimization.In this paper we consider the following problem: given a table of d attributes whose domainis the real numbers; and a query that specifies a range in each dimension; find a goodapproximation of the number of records in the table that satisfy the query. We present a newhistogram technique that is designed to approximate the density of multi-dimensionaldatasets with real attributes. Our technique finds buckets of variable size; and allows thebuckets to overlap. Overlapping buckets allow more efficient approximation of the density.The size of the cells is based on the local density of the data. This technique leads to a fasterand more compact approximation of the data distribution. We also show how to …,Acm Sigmod Record,2000,226
Efficient biased sampling for approximate clustering and outlier detection in large data sets,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas; Stefan Berchtold,We investigate the use of biased sampling according to the density of the data set to speedup the operation of general data mining tasks; such as clustering and outlier detection inlarge multidimensional data sets. In density-biased sampling; the probability that a givenpoint will be included in the sample depends on the local density of the data set. Wepropose a general technique for density-biased sampling that can factor in userrequirements to sample for properties of interest and can be tuned for specific data miningtasks. This allows great flexibility and improved accuracy of the results over simple randomsampling. We describe our approach in detail; we analytically evaluate it; and show how itcan be optimized for approximate clustering and outlier detection.

Efficient indexing of spatiotemporal objects,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Spatiotemporal objects ie; objects which change their position and/or extent overtime; appear in many applications. This paper addresses the problem of indexing largevolumes of such data. We consider general object movements and extent changes. Wefurther concentrate on “snapshot” as well as small “interval” historical queries on thegathered data. The obvious approach that approximates spatiotemporal objects with MBRsand uses a traditional multidimensional access method to index them is inefficient. Objectsthat “live” for long time intervals have large MBRs which introduce a lot of empty space.Clustering long intervals has been dealt in temporal databases by the use of partiallypersistent indices. What differentiates this problem from traditional temporal indexing is thatobjects are allowed to move/change during their lifetime. Better methods are thus needed …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,192
Incremental support vector machine construction,Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos,SVMs (support vector machines) suffer from the problem of large memory requirement andCPU time when trained in batch mode on large data sets. We overcome these limitations;and at the same time make SVMs suitable for learning with data streams; by constructingincremental learning algorithms. We first introduce and compare different incrementallearning techniques; and show that they are capable of producing performance resultssimilar to the batch algorithm; and in some cases superior condensation properties. We thenconsider the problem of training SVMs using stream data. Our objective is to maintain anupdated representation of recent batches of data. We apply incremental schemes to theproblem and show that their accuracy is comparable to the batch algorithm.,Data Mining; 2001. ICDM 2001; Proceedings IEEE International Conference on,2001,192
Answering top-k queries using views,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas; Dimitris Tsirogiannis,Abstract The problem of obtaining efficient answers to top-k queries has attracted a lot ofresearch attention. Several algorithms and numerous variants of the top-k retrieval problemhave been introduced in recent years. The general form of this problem requests the khighest ranked values from a relation; using monotone combining functions on (a subset of)its attributes. In this paper we explore space performance tradeoffs related to this problem. Inparticular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in thiscontext is a materialized version of a previously posed query; requesting a number ofhighest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subsetof the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of suchviews. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,190
Distributed deviation detection in sensor networks,Themistoklis Palpanas; Dimitris Papadopoulos; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Sensor networks have recently attracted much attention; because of their potentialapplications in a number of different settings.

We advocate their use on the basis thatthey provide an efficient mapping procedure from the original dimension of the data; to alower intrinsic dimension. We depict how they can accurately capture the user's perceptionof similarity in high-dimensional data for visualization purposes. Moreover; we exploit thelow-dimensional mapping provided by these embeddings; to develop new classificationtechniques; and we show experimentally that the classification accuracy is comparable(albeit using fewer dimensions) to a number of other classification procedures.,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,189

MicroHash: An Efficient Index Structure for Flash-Based Sensor Devices.,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Song Lin; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Walid A Najjar,Abstract In this paper we propose the MicroHash index; which is an efficient externalmemory structure for Wireless Sensor Devices (WSDs). The most prevalent storage mediumfor WSDs is flash memory. Our index structure exploits the asymmetric read/write and wearcharacteristics of flash memory in order to offer high performance indexing and searchingcapabilities in the presence of a low energy budget which is typical for the devices underdiscussion. A key idea behind MicroHash is to eliminate expensive random accessdeletions. We have implemented MicroHash in nesC; the programming language of theTinyOS [7] operating system. Our trace-driven experimentation with several real datasetsreveals that our index structure offers excellent search performance at a small cost ofconstructing and maintaining the index.,FAST,2005,184
Iterative incremental clustering of time series,Jessica Lin; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We present a novel anytime version of partitional clustering algorithm; such as k-Means and EM; for time series. The algorithm works by leveraging off the multi-resolutionproperty of wavelets. The dilemma of choosing the initial centers is mitigated by initializingthe centers at each approximation level; using the final centers returned by the coarserrepresentations. In addition to casting the clustering algorithms as anytime algorithms; thisapproach has two other very desirable properties. By working at lower dimensionalities wecan efficiently avoid local minima. Therefore; the quality of the clustering is usually betterthan the batch algorithm. In addition; even if the algorithm is run to completion; our approachis much faster than its batch counterpart. We explain; and empirically demonstrate thesesurprising and desirable properties with comprehensive experiments on several publicly …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,184

We considerthe problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activationstate; under a given information-propagation model. We call these nodes effectors. Weformally define the k-Effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs.We show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only NP-hard to solve optimally; but alsoNP-hard to approximate. We also show that; for some special cases; the problem can besolved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. To the best ofour knowledge; this is the first work to consider the k-Effectors problem in networks.

Online amnesic approximation of streaming time series,Themistoklis Palpanas; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Wagner Truppel,The past decade has seen a wealth of research on time series representations; because themanipulation; storage; and indexing of large volumes of raw time series data is impractical.The vast majority of research has concentrated on representations that are calculated inbatch mode and represent each value with approximately equal fidelity. However; theincreasing deployment of mobile devices and real time sensors has brought home the needfor representations that can be incrementally updated; and can approximate the data withfidelity proportional to its age. The latter property allows us to answer queries about therecent past with greater precision; since in many domains recent information is more usefulthan older information. We call such representations amnesic. While there has beenprevious work on amnesic representations; the class of amnesic functions possible was …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Efficient mining of spatiotemporal patterns,IIias Tsoukatos; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract The problem of mining spatiotemporal patterns is finding sequences of events thatoccur frequently in spatiotemporal datasets. Spatiotemporal datasets store the evolution ofobjects over time. Examples include sequences of sensor images of a geographical region;data that describes the location and movement of individual objects over time; or data thatdescribes the evolution of natural phenomena; such as forest coverage. The discoveredpatterns are sequences of events that occur most frequently. In this paper; we presentDFS_MINE; a new algorithm for fast mining of frequent spatiotemporal patterns inenvironmental data. DFS_MINE; as its name suggests; uses a Depth-First-Search-likeapproach to the problem which allows very fast discoveries of long sequential patterns.DFS_MINE performs database scans to discover frequent sequences rather than relying …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,158
A wavelet-based anytime algorithm for k-means clustering of time series,Michail Vlachos; Jessica Lin; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract The emergence of the field of data mining in the last decade has sparked anincreasing interest in clustering of tiate series. Although there has been much research onclustering in general; most classic machine learning and data mining algorithms do not workwell for time series due to their unique structure. In particular; the high dimensionaliF; veryhigh feature correlation; and the (typically) large amount of noise that characterize timeseries data present a difficult challenge. In this work we address these challenges byintroducing a novel anytiate version of k-Means clustering algorithm for time series. Thealgorithm works by leveraging off the multi-resolution property of wavelets. In particular; aninitial clustering is perforated with a very coarse resolution representation of the data.

In this paper we present a randomizedalgorithm that can be used to compute the representation of a theory in terms of the mostspecific sentences of that theory. In addition to randomization; the algorithm uses ageneralization of the concept of hypergraph transversal. We apply the general algorithm; fordiscovering maximal frequent sets in 0/1 data; and for computing minimal keys in relations.We present some empirical results on the performance of these methods on real data. Wealso show some complexity theoretic evidence of the hardness of these problems.,International conference on database theory,1997,137

A nunber of newalgorithms have been introduced to classify; cluster; segment; index; discover rules; anddetect anomalies/novelties in time series. While these many different techniques used tosolve these problems use a multitude of different techniques; they all have one commonfactor; they require some high level representation of the data; rather than the original rawdata. These high level representation are necessary as a feature extraction step; or simply tomake the storage; transmission; and computation of massive dataset feasible.

Nearest neighbor queries in a mobile environment,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Nearest neighbor queries have received much interest in recent years due to theirincreased importance in advanced database applications. However; past work hasaddressed such queries in a static setting. In this paper we consider instead a dynamicsetting where data objects move continuously. Such a mobile spatiotemporal environment ismotivated by real life applications in traffic management; intelligent navigation and cellularcommunication systems. We consider two versions of nearest neighbor queries dependingon whether the temporal predicate is a single time instant or an interval. For example:“findthe closest object to a given object o after 10 minutes from now”; or;“find the object that willbe the closest to object o between 10 and 15 minutes from now”. Since data objects movecontinuously it is inefficient to update the database about their position at each time …,*,1999,132
Indexing animated objects using spatiotemporal access methods,George Kollios; Vassilis J.  Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Alex Delis; Marios Hadjieleftheriou,We present an approach for indexing animated objects and efficiently answering queriesabout their position in time and space. In particular; we consider an animated movie as aspatiotemporal evolution. A movie is viewed as an ordered sequence of frames; where eachframe is a 2D space occupied by the objects that appear in that frame. The queries ofinterest are range queries of the form;" find the objects that appear in area S between framesf/sub i/and f/sub j//sup"/as well as nearest neighbor queries such as;" find the q nearestobjects to a given position A between frames f/sub i/and f/sub j//sup"/. The straightforwardapproach to index such objects considers the frame sequence as another dimension anduses a 3D access method (such as an R-Tree or its variants). This; however; assigns long"lifetime" intervals to objects that appear through many consecutive frames. Long intervals …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2001,127
Adaptive nearest neighbor classification using support vector machines,Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing method to addressclassification problems. It relies on the assumption of locally constant class conditionalprobabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a finite number ofexamples due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a technique that computes alocally flexible metric by means of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The maximum marginboundary found by the SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over thequery's neighborhood. Such direction provides a local weighting scheme for input features.We present experimental evidence of classification performance improvement over the SVMalgorithm alone and over a variety of adaptive learning schemes; by using both simulatedand real data sets.,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2002,111
System and method for organizing repositories of semi-structured documents such as email,*,A user can easily organize computerized document folders by associating a few sampledocuments in the document database with each folder. The present invention learns folderprofiles based on the sample documents and moves the remaining documents into thefolders accordingly. In this way; the user can construct new folders; or rearrange existingfolders; or cause the computer to automatically rearrange and maintain the folders. This isparticularly useful for managing a database of perhaps thousands of emails.,*,2003,110
Efficient aggregation over objects with extent,Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We examine the problem of efficiently computing sum/count/avg aggregates overobjects with non-zero extent. Recent work on computing multi-dimensional aggregates hasconcentrated on objects with zero extent (points) on a multi-dimensional grid; or one-dimensional intervals. However; in many spatial and/or spatio-temporal applications objectshave extent in various dimensions; while they can be located anywhere in the applicationspace. The aggregation predicate is typically described by a multi-dimensional box (box-sum aggregation). We examine two variations of the problem. In the simple case an object'svalue contributes to the aggregation result as a whole as long as the object intersects thequery box. More complex is the functional box-sum aggregation introduced in this paper;where objects participate in the aggregation proportionally to the size of their intersection …,Proceedings of the twenty-first ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2002,108
On-line discovery of dense areas in spatio-temporal databases,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Moving object databases have received considerable attention recently. Previouswork has concentrated mainly on modeling and indexing problems; as well as queryselectivity estimation. Here we introduce a novel problem; that of addressing density-basedqueries in the spatio-temporal domain. For example:“Find all regions that will contain morethan 500 objects; ten minutes from now”. The user may also be interested in finding the timeperiod (interval) that the query answer remains valid. We formally define a new class ofdensity-based queries and give approximate; on-line techniques that answer themefficiently. Typically the threshold above which a region is considered to be dense is part ofthe query. The difficulty of the problem lies in the fact that the spatial and temporal predicatesare not specified by the query. The techniques we introduce find all candidate dense …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,106
Large margin nearest neighbor classifiers,Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Jing Peng,The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing approach to addressingclassification problems. It relies on the assumption of locally constant class conditionalprobabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a finite number ofexamples due to the curse of dimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under theseconditions when using the nearest neighbor rule. The employment of a locally adaptivemetric becomes crucial in order to keep class conditional probabilities close to uniform;thereby minimizing the bias of estimates. We propose a technique that computes a locallyflexible metric by means of support vector machines (SVMs). The decision functionconstructed by SVMs is used to determine the most discriminant direction in a neighborhoodaround the query. Such a direction provides a local feature weighting scheme.

Rotation invariant distance measures for trajectories,Michail Vlachos; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Gautam Das,Abstract For the discovery of similar patterns in 1D time-series; it is very typical to perform anormalization of the data (for example a transformation so that the data follow a zero meanand unit standard deviation). Such transformations can reveal latent patterns and are verycommonly used in datamining applications. However; when dealing with multidimensionaltime-series; which appear naturally in applications such as video-tracking; motion-captureetc; similar motion patterns can also be expressed at different orientations. It is thereforeimperative to provide support for additional transformations; such as rotation. In this work; wetransform the positional information of moving data; into a space that is translation; scale androtation invariant. Our distance measure in the new space is able to detect elastic matchesand can be efficiently lower bounded; thus being computationally tractable.

Episode matching,Gautam Das; Rudolf Fleischer; Leszek Gasieniec; Dimitris Gunopulos; Juha Kärkkäinen,Abstract Given two words; text T of length n and episode P of length m; the episode matchingproblem is to find all minimal length substrings of text T that contain episode P as asubsequence. The respective optimization problem is to find the smallest number w; st text Thas a subword of length w which contains episode P. In this paper; we introduce a fewefficient off-line as well as on-line algorithms for the entire problem; where by on-linealgorithms we mean algorithms which search from left to right consecutive text symbols onlyonce. We present two alphabet independent algorithms which work in time O (nm). The off-line algorithm operates in O (1) additional space while the on-line algorithm pays for itsproperty with O (m) additional space. Two other on-line algorithms have subquadratic timecomplexity. One of them works in time O (nm/log m) and O (m) additional space. The other …,Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching,1997,99
Discovering frequent arrangements of temporal intervals,Panagiotis Papapetrou; George Kollios; Stan Sclaroff; Dimitrios Gunopulos,In this paper we study a new problem in temporal pattern mining: discovering frequentarrangements of temporal intervals. We assume that the database consists of sequences ofevents; where an event occurs during a time-interval. The goal is to mine arrangements ofevent intervals that appear frequently in the database. There are many applications wherethese type of patterns can be useful; including data network; scientific; and financialapplications. Efficient methods to find frequent arrangements of temporal intervals usingboth breadth first and depth first search techniques are described.

Ad-hoc top-k query answering for data streams,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas; Nikos Sarkas,Abstract A top-k query retrieves the k highest scoring tuples from a data set with respect to ascoring function defined on the attributes of a tuple. The efficient evaluation of top-k querieshas been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem; in avariety of settings; have been studied. However; techniques developed for conventional;centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamicenvironments and on-line applications; like data streams. Recently; techniques supportingtop-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictivehowever; as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (asopposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometricrepresentation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction.

Robust similarity measures for mobile object trajectories,Michail Vlachos; Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios,We investigate techniques for similarity analysis of spatio-temporal trajectories for mobileobjects. Such data may contain a large number of outliers; which degrade the performanceof Euclidean and time warping distance. Therefore; we propose the use of non-metricdistance functions based on the longest common subsequence (LCSS); in conjunction witha sigmoidal matching function. Finally; we compare these new methods to various L/subp/norms and also to time warping distance (for real and synthetic data) and presentexperimental results that validate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach; especially inthe presence of noise.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2002.

Efficient computation of temporal aggregates with range predicates,Donhui Zhang; Alexander Markowetz; Vassilis Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract A temporal aggregation query is an important but costly operation for applicationsthat maintain time-evolving data (data warehouses; temporal databases; etc.). Due to thelarge volume of such data; performance improvements for temporal aggregation queries arecritical. In this paper we examine techniques to compute temporal aggregates that includekey-range predicates (range temporal aggregates). In particular we concentrate on SUM;COUNT and AVG aggregates. This problem is novel; to handle arbitrary key ranges;previous methods would need to keep a separate index for every possible key range. Wepropose an approach based on a new index structure called the Multiversion SB-Tree;which incorporates features from both the SB-Tree and the Multiversion B-Tree; to handlearbitrary key-range temporal SUM; COUNT and AVG queries.

Selectivity estimators for multidimensional range queries over real attributes,Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlotta Domeniconi,Abstract. Estimating the selectivity of multidimensional range queries over real valuedattributes has significant applications in data exploration and database query optimization.In this paper; we consider the following problem: given a table of d attributes whose domainis the real numbers and a query that specifies a range in each dimension; find a goodapproximation of the number of records in the table that satisfy the query. The simplestapproach to tackle this problem is to assume that the attributes are independent. Moreaccurate estimators try to capture the joint data distribution of the attributes. In databases;such estimators include the construction of multidimensional histograms; random sampling;or the wavelet transform. In statistics; kernel estimation techniques are being used. Manytraditional approaches assume that attribute values come from discrete; finite domains …,The VLDB Journal,2005,88
The threshold join algorithm for top-k queries in distributed sensor networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Zografoula Vagena; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki; V Tsotras; Michail Vlachos; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In this paper we present the Threshold Join Algorithm (TJA); which is an efficientTOP-k query processing algorithm for distributed sensor networks. The objective of a top-kquery is to find the k highest ranked answers to a user defined similarity function. Theevaluation of such a query in a sensor network environment is associated with the transfer ofdata over an extremely expensive communication medium. TJA uses a non-uniformthreshold on the queried attribute in order to minimize the number of tuples that have to betransferred towards the querying node. Additionally; TJA resolves queries in the networkrather than in a centralized fashion; which minimizes even more the consumption ofbandwidth and delay. Our preliminary experimental results; using our trace driven simulator;show that TJA is both practical and efficient.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Data management for sensor networks,2005,87
On burstiness-aware search for document sequences,Theodoros Lappas; Benjamin Arai; Manolis Platakis; Dimitrios Kotsakos; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract As the number and size of large timestamped collections (eg sequences of digitizednewspapers; periodicals; blogs) increase; the problem of efficiently indexing and searchingsuch data becomes more important. Term burstiness has been extensively researched as amechanism to address event detection in the context of such collections. In this paper; weexplore how burstiness information can be further utilized to enhance the search process.We present a novel approach to model the burstiness of a term; using discrepancy theoryconcepts. This allows us to build a parameter-free; linear-time approach to identify the timeintervals of maximum burstiness for a given term. Finally; we describe the first burstiness-driven search framework and thoroughly evaluate our approach in the context of differentscenarios.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,85
Correlating synchronous and asynchronous data streams,Sudipto Guha; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas,Abstract In a variety of modern mining applications; data are commonly viewed as infinitetime ordered data streams rather as finite data sets stored on disk.

Our algorithms andtechniques are applicable in the case of both synchronous and asynchronous datastreaming environments.

Feature selection for the naive bayesian classifier using decision trees,Chotirat" ann" Ratanamahatana; Dimitrios Gunopulos,It is known that Naive Bayesian classifier (NB) works very well on some domains; and poorlyon others. The performance of NB suffers in domains that involve correlated features. C4. 5decision trees; on the other hand; typically perform better than the Naive Bayesian algorithmon such domains. This paper describes a Selective Bayesian classifier (SBC) that simplyuses only those features that C4. 5 would use in its decision tree when learning a smallexample of a training set; a combination of the two different natures of classifiers.Experiments conducted on ten data sets indicate that SBC performs markedly better than NBon all domains; and SBC outperforms C4. 5 on many data sets of which C4. 5 outperformNB.

Dimensionality reduction by random projection and latent semantic indexing,Jessica Lin; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Document categorization and classification is of seminal importance for informationretrieval. During the past decade the growth of Internet has fundamentally changed the waysthat information is shared; and it has made clear that efficient methods for searching andexploring vast amounts of data should be put forward. The largest challenges associatedwith information retrieval are synonymy and high dimensionality. An elegant and accuratetechnique to solve both problems has been presented in the form of Latent SemanticAnalysis (LSI). However; its high computational cost makes it infeasible for large databases.Therefore other models such as random projection have been proposed. A suggestion forcombining these two approaches has also been proposed. However; best to our knowledge;no empirical results have been presented on this “hybrid” method.

Indexing spatiotemporal archives,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Spatiotemporal objects–that is; objects that evolve over time–appear in manyapplications. Due to the nature of such applications; storing the evolution of objects throughtime in order to answer historical queries (queries that refer to past states of the evolution)requires a very large specialized database; what is termed in this article a spatiotemporalarchive. Efficient processing of historical queries on spatiotemporal archives requiresequally sophisticated indexing schemes. Typical spatiotemporal indexing techniquesrepresent the objects using minimum bounding regions (MBR) extended with a temporaldimension; which are then indexed using traditional multidimensional index structures.However; rough MBR approximations introduce excessive overlap between index nodes;which deteriorates query performance.

Time series similarity measures and time series indexing,Dimitrios Gunopulos; Gautam Das,Abstract Time series is the simplest form of temporal data. A time series is a sequence of realnumbers collected regularly in time; where each number represents a value. Time seriesdata come up in a variety of domains; including stock market analysis; environmental data;telecommunications data; medical data and financial data. Web data that count the numberof clicks on given cites; or model the usage of different pages are also modeled as timeseries. Therefore time series account for a large fraction of the data stored in commercialdatabases. There is recently increasing recognition of this fact; and support for time series asa different data type in commercial data bases management systems is increasing. IBM DB2for example implements support for time series using data-blades. The pervasiveness andimportance of time series data has sparked a lot of research work on the topic.

On the spatiotemporal burstiness of terms,Theodoros Lappas; Marcos R Vieira; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Thousands of documents are made available to the users via the web on a dailybasis. One of the most extensively studied problems in the context of such documentstreams is burst identification. Given a term t; a burst is generally exhibited when anunusually high frequency is observed for t. While spatial and temporal burstiness have beenstudied individually in the past; our work is the first to simultaneously track and measurespatiotemporal term burstiness. In addition; we use the mined burstiness information towardan efficient document-search engine: given a user's query of terms; our engine returns aranked list of documents discussing influential events with a strong spatiotemporal impact.We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods with an extensive experimental evaluation onreal and synthetic datasets.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,75
Approximate embedding-based subsequence matching of time series,Vassilis Athitsos; Panagiotis Papapetrou; Michalis Potamias; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract A method for approximate subsequence matching is introduced; that significantlyimproves the efficiency of subsequence matching in large time series data sets under thedynamic time warping (DTW) distance measure. Our method is called EBSM; shorthand forEmbedding-Based Subsequence Matching. The key idea is to convert subsequencematching to vector matching using an embedding. This embedding maps each databasetime series into a sequence of vectors; so that every step of every time series in the databaseis mapped to a vector. The embedding is computed by applying full dynamic time warpingbetween reference objects and each database time series. At runtime; given a query object;an embedding of that object is computed in the same manner; by running dynamic timewarping between the reference objects and the query.

Elastic translation invariant matching of trajectories,Michail Vlachos; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We investigate techniques for analysis and retrieval of object trajectories. Weassume that a trajectory is a sequence of two or three dimensional points. Trajectorydatasets are very common in environmental applications; mobility experiments; videosurveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns.Such kind of data usually contain a great amount of noise; that makes all previously usedmetrics fail. Therefore; here we formalize non-metric similarity functions based on theLongest Common Subsequence (LCSS); which are very robust to noise and furthermoreprovide an intuitive notion of similarity between trajectories by giving more weight to thesimilar portions of the sequences. Stretching of sequences in time is allowed; as well asglobal translating of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that …,Machine Learning,2005,72

Uncertainty handling and quality assessment in data mining,Michalis Vazirgiannis; Maria Halkidi; Dimitrious Gunopulos,The recent explosive growth of our ability to generate and store data has created a need fornew; scalable and efficient; tools for data analysis. The main focus of the discipline ofknowledge discovery in databases is to address this need. Knowledge discovery indatabases is the fusion of many areas that are concerned with different aspects of datahandling and data analysis; including databases; machine learning; statistics; andalgorithms. Each of these areas addresses a different part of the problem; and placesdifferent emphasis on different requirements. For example; database techniques aredesigned to efficiently handle relatively simple queries on large amounts of data stored inexternal (disk) storage.

Embedding-based subsequence matching in time-series databases,Panagiotis Papapetrou; Vassilis Athitsos; Michalis Potamias; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We propose an embedding-based framework for subsequence matching in time-series databases that improves the efficiency of processing subsequence matching queriesunder the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure. This framework partiallyreduces subsequence matching to vector matching; using an embedding that maps eachquery sequence to a vector and each database time series into a sequence of vectors. Thedatabase embedding is computed offline; as a preprocessing step. At runtime; given a queryobject; an embedding of that object is computed online. Relatively few areas of interest areefficiently identified in the database sequences by comparing the embedding of the querywith the database vectors. Those areas of interest are then fully explored using the exactDTW-based subsequence matching algorithm. We apply the proposed framework to …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,63
An adaptive metric machine for pattern classification,Carlotta Domeniconi; Jing Peng; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Nearest neighbor classification assumes locally constant class conditionalprobabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with finite samples due tothe curse of dimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under these conditions whenusing the nearest neighbor rule. We propose a locally adaptive nearest neighborclassification method to try to minimize bias. We use a Chi-squared distance analysis tocompute a flexible metric for producing neighborhoods that are elongated along lessrelevant feature dimensions and constricted along most influential ones. As a result; theclass conditional probabilities tend to be smoother in the modified neighborhoods; wherebybetter classification performance can be achieved. The efficacy of our method is validatedand compared against other techniques using a variety of real world data.,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2001,62
Streaming time series summarization using user-defined amnesic functions,Themis Palpanas; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,The past decade has seen a wealth of research on time series representations. The vastmajority of research has concentrated on representations that are calculated in batch modeand represent each value with approximately equal fidelity. However; the increasingdeployment of mobile devices and real time sensors has brought home the need forrepresentations that can be incrementally updated; and can approximate the data withfidelity proportional to its age. The latter property allows us to answer queries about therecent past with greater precision; since in many domains recent information is more usefulthan older information. We call such representations amnesic. While there has beenprevious work on amnesic representations; the class of amnesic functions possible wasdictated by the representation itself.

In this paper we initiate a formal study of indexing techniques for setvalue attributes based on similarity; for suitably defined notions of similarity between sets.Such techniques are necessary in modern applications such as recommendations throughcollaborative filtering and automated advertising. Our techniques are probabilistic andapproximate in nature. As a design principle we create structures that make use of wellknown and widely used data structuring techniques; as a means to ease integration withexisting infrastructure. We show how the problem of indexing a collection of sets based onsimilarity can be reduced to the problem of indexing suitably encoded (in a way that …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,59

Efficient confident search in large review corpora,Theodoros Lappas; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Given an extensive corpus of reviews on an item; a potential customer goes throughthe expressed opinions and collects information; in order to form an educated opinion and;ultimately; make a purchase decision. This task is often hindered by false reviews; that fail tocapture the true quality of the item's attributes. These reviews may be based on insufficientinformation or may even be fraudulent; submitted to manipulate the item's reputation. In thispaper; we formalize the Confident Search paradigm for review corpora. We then present acomplete search framework which; given a set of item attributes; is able to efficiently searchthrough a large corpus and select a compact set of high-quality reviews that accuratelycaptures the overall consensus of the reviewers on the specified attributes. We alsointroduce CREST (Confident REview Search Tool); a user-friendly implementation of our …,Joint European conference on machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases,2010,57
Anytime measures for top-k algorithms,Benjamin Arai; Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas,Abstract Top-k queries on large multi-attribute data sets are fundamental operations ininformation retrieval and ranking applications. In this paper; we initiate research on theanytime behavior of top-k algorithms. In particular; given specific top-k algorithms (TA andTA-Sorted) we are interested in studying their progress toward identification of the correctresult at any point during the algorithms' execution. We adopt a probabilistic approachwhere we seek to report at any point of operation of the algorithm the confidence that the top-k result has been identified. Such a functionality can be a valuable asset when one isinterested in reducing the runtime cost of top-k computations. We present a thoroughexperimental evaluation to validate our techniques using both synthetic and real data sets.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,57

Fast motion capture matching with replicated motion editing,Marc Cardle; Michail Vlachos; Stephen Brooks; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,The possibility of storing large quantities of human motion capture; or 'mocap'; has resultedin a growing demand for content-based retrieval of motion sequences without usingannotations or other meta-data. We address the issue of rapidly retrieving perceptuallysimilar occurrences of a particular motion in a long mocap sequence or unstructured mocapdatabase for the purpose of replicating editing operations with minimal user-input. One ormore editing operations on a given motion are made to affect all similar matching motions.This general approach is applied to standard mocap editing operations such astimewarping; filtering or motion-warping. The style of interaction lies between automationand complete user control.

Distributed spatio-temporal similarity search,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Song Lin; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract In this paper we introduce the distributed spatio-temporal similarity search problem:given a query trajectory Q; we want to find the trajectories that follow a motion similar to Q;when each of the target trajectories is segmented across a number of distributed nodes. Wepropose two novel algorithms; UB-K and UBLB-K; which combine local computations oflower and upper bounds on the matching between the distributed subsequences and Q.Such an operation generates the desired result without pulling together all the distributedsubsequences over the fundamentally expensive communication medium. Our solutions findapplications in a wide array of domains; such as cellular networks; wild life monitoring andvideo surveillance. Our experimental evaluation using realistic data demonstrates that ourframework is both efficient and robust to a variety of conditions.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,40

High performance; low power sensor platforms featuring gigabyte scale storage,A Mitra; A Banerjee; W Najjar; D Zeinalipour-Yazti; V Kalogeraki; D Gunopulos,Abstract Sensor applications have now touched onto the realms of real-time data processinginvolving algorithms as sophisticated as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT); Finite ImpulseResponse (FIR) filtering and Cepstrum. Moreover since typical sensor networks employdevices based on a simplistic microcontroller; it would be rather inefficient vis-àvis utilizationof energy resources to employ it for applications other than the most mundane" Sense andSend".

The distributed nature of these systems; where nodes are typically locatedacross different networks and domains; inherently hinders the efficient retrieval ofinformation. In this paper; we consider the effects of topologically aware overlay constructiontechniques on efficient p2p keyword search algorithms. We present the peer fusion(pFusion) architecture that aims to efficiently integrate heterogeneous information that isgeographically scattered on peers of different networks. Our approach builds on work inunstructured p2p systems and uses only local knowledge.

Efficient and effective explanation of change in hierarchical summaries,Deepak Agarwal; Dhiman Barman; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Neal E Young; Flip Korn; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Dimension attributes in data warehouses are typically hierarchical (eg; geographiclocations in sales data; URLs in Web traffic logs). OLAP tools are used to summarize themeasure attributes (eg; total sales) along a dimension hierarchy; and to characterizechanges (eg; trends and anomalies) in a hierarchical summary over time. When thenumberof changes identified is large (eg; total sales in many stores differed from their expectedvalues); a parsimonious explanation of the most significant changes is desirable. In thispaper; we propose a natural model of parsimonious explanation; as a composition of nodeweights along the root-to-leaf paths in a dimension hierarchy; which permits changes to beaggregated with maximal generalization along the dimension hierarchy. We formalize thismodel of explaining changes in hierarchical summaries and investigate the problem of …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2007,33
Efficient indexing data structures for flash-based sensor devices,Song Lin; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Walid A Najjar,Abstract Flash memory is the most prevalent storage medium found on modern wirelesssensor devices (WSDs). In this article we present two external memory index structures forthe efficient retrieval of records stored on the local flash memory of a WSD. Our indexstructures; MicroHash and MicroGF (micro grid files); exploit the asymmetric read/write andwear characteristics of flash memory in order to offer high-performance indexing andsearching capabilities in the presence of a low-energy budget; which is typical for thedevices under discussion. Both structures organize data and index pages on the flash mediausing a sorted by timestamp file organization. A key idea behind these index structures isthat expensive random access deletions are completely eliminated.

Data acquisition in sensor networks with large memories,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Som Neema; V Kalogeraki; D Gunopulos; Walid Najjar,Sensor Networks will soon become ubiquitous; making them essential tools for monitoringthe activity and evolution of our surrounding environment. However such environments areexpected to generate vast amounts of temporal data that needs to be processed in a power-effective manner. To this date sensor nodes feature small amounts of memory which mostlylimits their capabilities to queries that only refer to the current point in time. In this paper weinitiate a study on the deployment of large memories at sensor nodes. Such an approachgives birth to an array of new temporal and top-k queries which have been extensivelystudied by the database community.

Approximating aggregation queries in peer-to-peer networks,Benjamin Arai; Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki,Peer-to-peer databases are becoming prevalent on the Internet for distribution and sharingof documents; applications; and other digital media. The problem of answering large scale;ad-hoc analysis queries―eg; aggregation queries―on these databases poses uniquechallenges. Exact solutions can be time consuming and difficult to implement given thedistributed and dynamic nature of peer-to-peer databases. In this paper we present novelsampling-based techniques for approximate answering of ad-hoc aggregation queries insuch databases.

Region sampling: Continuous adaptive sampling on sensor networks,Song Lin; Benjamin Arai; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Gautam Das,Satisfying energy constraints while meeting performance requirements is a primary concernwhen a sensor network is being deployed.

Phase transition in the family of p-resistances,Morteza Alamgir; Ulrike V Luxburg,Abstract We study the family of p-resistances on graphs for p≥ 1. This family generalizes thestandard resistance distance. We prove that for any fixed graph; for p= 1; the p-resistancecoincides with the shortest path distance; for p= 2 it coincides with the standard resistancedistance; and for p→∞ it converges to the inverse of the minimal st-cut in the graph.Secondly; we consider the special case of random geometric graphs (such as k-nearestneighbor graphs) when the number n of vertices in the graph tends to infinity. We prove thatan interesting phase-transition takes place. There exist two critical thresholds p^* and p^**such that if p< p^*; then the p-resistance depends on meaningful global properties of thegraph; whereas if p> p^**; it only depends on trivial local quantities and does not convey anyuseful information. We can explicitly compute the critical values: p^*= 1+ 1/(d-1) and p …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2011,29

On computing temporal aggregates with range predicates,Donghui Zhang; Alexander Markowetz; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract Computing temporal aggregates is an important but costly operation forapplications that maintain time-evolving data (data warehouses; temporal databases; etc.)Due to the large volume of such data; performance improvements for temporal aggregatequeries are critical. Previous approaches have aggregate predicates that involve only thetime dimension. In this article we examine techniques to compute temporal aggregates thatinclude key-range predicates as well (range-temporal aggregates). In particular weconcentrate on the SUM aggregate; while COUNT is a special case. To handle arbitrary keyranges; previous methods would need to keep a separate index for every possible keyrange.

Minimum-hot-spot query trees for wireless sensor networks,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We propose a distributed algorithm to construct a balanced communication tree thatserves in gathering data from the network nodes to a sink. Our algorithm constructs a near-optimally balanced communication tree with minimum overhead. The balancing of the nodedegrees results in the minimization of packet collisions during query execution; that wouldotherwise require numerous retransmissions and reduce the lifetime of the network. Wecompare our simple distributed algorithm against previous work and a centralized solutionand show that for most network layouts it outperforms competition and achieves tree balancevery close to the centralized algorithm. It also has the smallest energy overhead possible toconstruct the tree; increasing the lifetime of the network even more.,Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access,2010,26
Reference-based alignment in large sequence databases,Panagiotis Papapetrou; Vassilis Athitsos; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract This paper introduces a novel method; called Reference-Based String Alignment(RBSA); that speeds up retrieval of optimal subsequence matches in large databases ofsequences under the edit distance and the Smith-Waterman similarity measure. RBSAoperates using the assumption that the optimal match deviates by a relatively small amountfrom the query; an amount that does not exceed a prespecified fraction of the query length.RBSA has an exact version that guarantees no false dismissals and can handle largequeries efficiently. An approximate version of RBSA is also described; that achievessignificant additional improvements over the exact version; with negligible losses in retrievalaccuracy. RBSA performs filtering of candidate matches using precomputed alignmentscores between the database sequence and a set of fixed-length reference sequences.

Efficient and domain-invariant competitor mining,Theodoros Lappas; George Valkanas; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract In any competitive business; success is based on the ability to make an item moreappealing to customers than the competition. A number of questions arise in the context ofthis task: how do we formalize and quantify the competitiveness relationship between twoitems? Who are the true competitors of a given item? What are the features of an item thatmost affect its competitiveness?

Every blog post in theBlogosphere has a well defined timestamp; which is not taken into account by searchengines. By conducting research regarding this feature of the Blogosphere; we can attemptto discover bursty terms and correlations between them during a time interval. We applyKleinberg's automaton on extracted titles of blog posts to discover bursty terms; we introducea novel representation of a term's burstiness evolution called State Series and we employ aEuclidean-based distance metric to discover potential correlations between terms withouttaking into account their context.

Location extraction from social networks with commodity software and online data,George Valkanas; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Location is prevalent in most applications nowadays; and is considered a first class citizen insocial networks. Locational information is of great significance since it can be used to mapinformation from the online back to the physical world; to contextualize information; or toprovide localized recommendations through Location-Based Services (LBS); and can beextended to trajectories and itineraries by adding a time-dimension. Despite all that; locationextraction in social networks usually relies on GPS-enabled devices; that provide accurategeodetic coordinates. Nevertheless; most users provide general textual information abouttheir surroundings; such as the city they live in; county or state (or equivalents); without usinga GPS-enabled device; which is still valuable information for a number of applications.

In particular; given specific top-k algorithms (TA and TA-Sorted) we are interested in studying their progress towardidentification of the correct result at any point during the algorithms' execution. We adopt aprobabilistic approach where we seek to report at any point of operation of the algorithm theconfidence that the top-k result has been identified. Such a functionality can be a valuableasset when one is interested in reducing the runtime cost of top-k computations. We presenta thorough experimental evaluation to validate our techniques using both synthetic and realdata sets.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,22
Indexing time-series under conditions of noise,Michail Vlachos; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Gautam Das,Abstract We present techniques for the analysis and retrieval of time-series under conditionsof noise. This is an important topic because the data obtained using various sensors(examples include GPS data or video tracking data) are typically noisy. The performance ofpreviously used measures is generally degraded under noisy conditions. Here we formalizenon-metric similarity functions based on the Longest Common Subsequence that are veryrobust to noise. Furthermore they provide an intuitive notion of similarity between time-seriesby giving more weight to the similar portions of the sequences. Stretching of sequences intime is allowed; as well as global translating of the sequences in space. Efficientapproximate algorithms that compute these similarity measures are also provided. Wecompare these new methods to the widely used Euclidean and Time Warping distance …,*,2004,22

Self-adaptive event recognition for intelligent transport management,Alexander Artikis; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Intelligent transport management involves the use of voluminous amounts of uncertainsensor data to identify and effectively manage issues of congestion and quality of service. Inparticular; urban traffic has been in the eye of the storm for many years now and gathersincreasing interest as cities become bigger; crowded; and “smart”. In this work we tackle theissue of uncertainty in transportation systems stream reporting. The variety of existing datasources opens new opportunities for testing the validity of sensor reports and self-adaptingthe recognition of complex events as a result. We report on the use of a logic-based eventreasoning tool to identify regions of uncertainty within a stream and demonstrate our methodwith a real-world use-case from the city of Dublin.

A subsequence matching with gaps-range-tolerances framework: a query-by-humming application,Alexios Kotsifakos; Panagiotis Papapetrou; Jaakko Hollmén; Dimitrios Gunopulos,ABSTRACT We propose a novel subsequence matching framework that allows for gaps inboth the query and target sequences; variable matching tolerance levels efficiently tuned foreach query and target sequence; and also constrains the maximum match length. Using thisframework; a space and time efficient dynamic programming method is developed: given ashort query sequence and a large database; our method identifies the subsequence of thedatabase that best matches the query; and further bounds the number of consecutive gapsin both sequences. In addition; it allows the user to constrain the minimum number ofmatching elements between a query and a database sequence. We show that the proposedmethod is highly applicable to music retrieval.

Discovering hot topics in the blogosphere,M Platakis; D Kotsakos; D Gunopulos,Abstract Over the last few years; blogs (web logs) have gained massive popularity and havebecome one of the most influential web social media in our times. Every blog post in theblogosphere has a well defined timestamp; which is not taken into account by searchengines. By conducting research regarding this feature of the Blogosphere; we couldattempt to discover hot topics during a time interval. We present Kleinberg's algorithm aboutfinding bursty and hierarchical streams; we apply it on titles of blog posts to discover burstyterms and compare the results to that produced by Blogscope; an online system for theanalysis of the Blogosphere.

Operator placement for snapshot multi-predicate queries in wireless sensor networks,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Huseyin Hakkoymaz; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,This work aims at minimize the cost of answering snapshot multi-predicate queries in high-communication-cost networks. High-communication-cost (HCC) networks is a family ofnetworks where communicating data is very demanding in resources; for example inwireless sensor networks transmitting data drains the battery life of sensors involved. Theimportant class of multi-predicate queries in horizontally or vertically distributed databases isaddressed. We show that minimizing the communication cost for multi-predicate queries isNP-hard and we propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal solutionfor small problem instances. We also propose a low complexity; approximate; heuristicalgorithm for solving larger problem instances efficiently and running it on nodes with lowcomputational power (eg sensors).

Organizing such information in centralizedrepositories at all times will be both impractical and expensive. In this paper we discuss thechallenges from storing sensor readings In-situ (at the generating sensor). This creates anetwork of tiny databases as opposed to the prevalent model of a centralized database thatcollects readings from many sensors. We also discuss some of the inherent problems ofsuch a setting; including the lack of efficient distributed query processing algorithms for …,Panhellenic Conference on Informatics,2005,19

SkyDiver: a framework for skyline diversification,George Valkanas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Skyline queries have attracted considerable attention by the database communityduring the last decade; due to their applicability in a series of domains. However; mostexisting works tackle the problem from an efficiency standpoint; ie; returning the skyline asquickly as possible. The user is then presented with the entire skyline set; which may be inseveral cases overwhelming; therefore requiring manual inspection to come up with themost informative data points. To overcome this shortcoming; we propose a novel approachin selecting the k most diverse skyline points; ie; the ones that best capture the differentaspects of both the skyline and the dataset they belong to. We present a novel formulation ofdiversification which; in contrast to previous proposals; is intuitive; because it is based solelyon the domination relationships among points.

Due to the resource limitation of sensornodes (processing; memory; bandwidth; and energy); the collected information of sensornodes has to be compressed quickly and precisely for transmission. In this paper; wepropose a new technique--the ALVQ (Adoptive Learning Vector Quantization) algorithm tocompress this historical information. The ALVQ algorithm constructs a codebook to capturethe prominent features of the data and with these features all the other data can be piece-wise encoded for compression.

Traditional CEP systems; such as Esper; lack the requiredscalability and processing capability to cope with the constantly increasing amount of datathat needs to be processed. Furthermore; user defined rules are static so changes in themonitored environment cannot be easily detected. In this paper we investigate thedevelopment of a scalable and dynamic traffic management system. Our work makesseveral contributions: We propose a novel system that combines Esper with a streamprocessing framework; Storm; in order to parallelize the processing of larger amounts ofdata.

A novel distributed framework for optimizing query routing trees in wireless sensor networks via optimal operator placement,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract In this paper; we focus the attention on the operator placement problem in WirelessSensor Networks (WSN). This problem is very relevant for in-network query processing overWSN; where query routing trees are decomposed into three sub-components that must beprocessed at query time; namely operator tree; operator placement assignment scheme androuting scheme. In particular; the operator placement assignment defines on which node ofthe network each (query) operator will be hosted and executed. Hence; operator placementplays a key role in the context of query optimization issues in WSN research. In line with thismain motivation; in this paper we present an optimal distributed algorithm to adapt theplacement of a single operator in high communication cost networks; such as a wirelesssensor network.

Efficient data sampling in heterogeneous peer-to-peer networks,Benjamin Arai; Song Lin; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Performing data-mining tasks such as clustering; classification; and prediction on largedatasets is an arduous task and; many times; it is an infeasible task given current hardwarelimitations. The distributed nature of peer-to-peer databases further complicates this issue byintroducing an access overhead cost in addition to the cost of sending individual tuples overthe network. We propose a two-level sampling approach focusing on peer-to-peerdatabases for maximizing sample quality given a user-defined communication budget.Given that individual peers may have varying cardinality we propose an algorithm fordetermining the optimal sample rate (the percentage of tuples to sample from a peer) foreach peer. We do this by analyzing the variance of individual peers; ultimately minimizingthe total variance of the entire sample. By performing local optimization of individual peer …,Data Mining; 2007.

Thisassumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with finite samples due to the curse ofdimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under these conditions when using thenearest neighbor rule. We propose a locally adaptive nearest neighbor classification methodto try to minimize bias. We use a Chi-squared distance analysis to compute a flexible metricfor producing neighborhoods that are highly adaptive to query locations. Neighborhoods areelongated along less relevant feature dimensions and constricted along most influentialones. As a result; the class conditional probabilities tend to be smoother in the modifiedneighborhoods; whereby better classification performance can be achieved.

Computing the rectangle discrepancy,David P Dobkin; Dimitrios Gunopulos,This is the animation of an algorithm that computes the rectangle discrepancy of a two-dimensional point set. Our main motivation comes from sampling problems in computergraphics. Supersampling is one of the most general ways of attacking antialiasing. In thisapproach we sample the picture at a very high rate; and then we resample by averagingsupersamples within the pixel area to compute the pixel value. Ray tracing; a techniqueused to produce realistic images of computer modeled scenes; is another instance ofsupersampling. Here we sample the radiance at a set of points in each pixel. Thediscrepancy theory provides a measure of the quality of the sampling patterns. The rectanglediscrepancy in particular gives a good measure on how well a sample pattern; when appliedto the area of one or more pixels; captures small details in the picture.

Metric-Based Top-k Dominating Queries.,Eleftherios Tiakas; George Valkanas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Dimitrios Gunopulos,ABSTRACT Top-k dominating queries combine the natural idea of selecting the k best itemswith a comprehensive “goodness” criterion based on dominance. A point p1 dominates p2 ifp1 is as good as p2 in all attributes and is strictly better in at least one. Existing worksaddress the problem in settings where data objects are multidimensional points. However;there are domains where we only have access to the distance between two objects. In caseslike these; attributes reflect distances from a set of input objects and are dynamicallygenerated as the input objects change. Consequently; prior works from the literature can notbe applied; despite the fact that the dominance relation is still meaningful and valid. For thisreason; in this work; we present the first study for processing top-k dominating queries overdistance-based dynamic asttribute vectors; defined over a metric space.

The ability of storing large amounts of data in sensor devices necessitatesthe need for efficient indexing structures to locate required information.

Efficient local flexible nearest neighbor classification,Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing method to addressclassification problems. It relies on the assumption of locally constant class conditionalprobabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a finite number ofexamples due to the curse of dimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under theseconditions when using the nearest neighbor rule. The employment of a local adaptive metricbecomes crucial in order to keep class conditional probabilities close to uniform; andtherefore to minimize the bias of estimates. We propose a technique that computes a locallyflexible metric by means of Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

Efficient event detection by exploiting crowds,Ioannis Boutsis; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Encouraging users to participate in community-based sensing and collection for thepurpose of identifying events of interest for the community has found important applicationsin the recent years in a wide variety of domains including entertainment; transportation andenvironmental monitoring. One important challenge in these settings is how significantevents can be detected by exploiting the data sensed; gathered and shared by the crowd;while respecting the resource costs. In this paper we investigate the use of dynamicclustering and sampling techniques that allow us to significantly reduce utilization costs byclustering low-level streams of events based on their geo-spatial locations and thenselectively retrieving the ones that depict the highest interest. Our experimental resultsillustrate that our approach is practical; efficient and depicts good performance.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Distributed event-based systems,2013,11
Clustering gene expression data in SQL using locally adaptive metrics,Dimitris Papadopoulos; Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Sheng Ma,Abstract The clustering problem concerns the discovery of homogeneous groups of dataaccording to a certain similarity measure. Clustering suffers from the curse of dimensionality.It is not meaningful to look for clusters in high dimensional spaces as the average density ofpoints anywhere in input space is likely to be low. As a consequence; distance functions thatequally use all input features may be ineffective. We introduce an algorithm that discoversclusters in subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions via local weightingsof features. This approach avoids the risk of loss of information encountered in globaldimensionality reduction techniques. Our method associates to each cluster a weight vector;whose values capture the relevance of features within the corresponding cluster. In thispaper we present an efficient SQL implementation of our algorithm; that enables the …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGMOD workshop on Research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,2003,11

Our framework;coined Smart Trace; exploits opportunistic and participatory sensing in order to quicklyanswer queries of the form:" Report the users that move more similar to Q; where Q is somequery trace". Smart Trace; relies on an in-situ data storage model; where geo-location datais recorded locally on smart phones for both performance and data-disclosure reasons.Smart Trace then deploys an efficient top-K query processing algorithm that exploitsdistributed trajectory similarity measures; resilient to spatial and temporal noise; in order toderive the most relevant answers to Q quickly and efficiently.

Parsimonious explanations of change in hierarchical data,Dhiman Barman; Flip Korn; Divesh Srivastava; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Neal Young; Deepak Agarwal,Dimension attributes in data warehouses are typically hierarchical; and a variety of OLAPapplications (such as point-of-sales analysis and decision support) call for summarizing themeasure attributes in fact tables along the hierarchies of these attributes. For example; thetotal sales at different stores can be summarized hierarchically by geographic location (eg;state/city/zip_code/store); by time (eg; year/month/day/hour); or by product category (eg;clothing/outerwear/jackets/brand). Existing OLAP tools help to summarize and navigate thedata at different levels of aggregation (eg; jackets sold in each state during December 2006)via drill-down and roll-up operators. OLAP tools are also used to characterize changes inthese hierarchical summaries over time (eg; the sales in December 2006 compared to salesin December 2005 over different locations) to detect anomalies and characterize trends …,Data Engineering; 2007.

Generating feature spaces for linear algorithms with regularized sparse kernel slow feature analysis,Wendelin Böhmer; Steffen Grünewälder; Hannes Nickisch; Klaus Obermayer,Abstract Without non-linear basis functions many problems can not be solved by linearalgorithms. This article proposes a method to automatically construct such basis functionswith slow feature analysis (SFA). Non-linear optimization of this unsupervised learningmethod generates an orthogonal basis on the unknown latent space for a given time series.In contrast to methods like PCA; SFA is thus well suited for techniques that make direct useof the latent space. Real-world time series can be complex; and current SFA algorithms areeither not powerful enough or tend to over-fit. We make use of the kernel trick in combinationwith sparsification to develop a kernelized SFA algorithm which provides a powerful functionclass for large data sets. Sparsity is achieved by a novel matching pursuit approach that canbe applied to other tasks as well. For small data sets; however; the kernel SFA approach …,Machine Learning,2012,9
Interactive recommendations in social endorsement networks,Theodoros Lappas; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract An increasing number of social networking platforms are giving users the option toendorse entities that they find appealing; such as videos; photos; or even other users. Wedefine this model as a Social Endorsement Network; visualized as a bipartite graph withedges (endorsements) from users to endorsed entities. In this work; we formalize theproblem of interactive recommendations in social endorsement networks: given a query oftags and a social endorsement network; the problem is to recommend entities that match thequery and also share a significant number of common endorsers.

Mining twitter data with resource constraints,George Valkanas; Ioannis Katakis; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Antony Stefanidis,Abstract Social media analysis constitutes a scientific field that is rapidly gaining ground dueto its numerous research challenges and practical applications; as well as theunprecedented availability of data in real time. Several of these applications have significantsocial and economical impact; such as journalism; crisis management; advertising; etc.However; two issues regarding these applications have to be confronted. The first one is thefinancial cost. Despite the abundance of information; it typically comes at a premium price;and only a fraction is provided free of charge. For example; Twitter; a predominant socialmedia online service; grants researchers and practitioners free access to only a smallproportion (1%) of its publicly available stream. The second issue is the computational cost.Even when the full stream is available; off the shelf approaches are unable to operate in …,Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)-Volume 01,2014,8
A burstiness-aware approach for document dating,Dimitrios Kotsakos; Theodoros Lappas; Dimitrios Kotzias; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract A large number of mainstream applications; like temporal search; event detection;and trend identification; assume knowledge of the timestamp of every document in a giventextual collection. In many cases; however; the required timestamps are either unavailableor ambiguous. A charac-teristic instance of this problem emerges in the context of largerepositories of old digitized documents. For such doc-uments; the timestamp may becorrupted during the digiti-zation process; or may simply be unavailable.

Addressing the Sparsity of Location Information on Twitter.,Dimitrios Kotzias; Theodoros Lappas; Dimitrios Gunopulos,ABSTRACT Micro-blogging services such as Twitter have gained enormous popularity overthe last few years leading to massive volumes of user generated content. In combinationwith the proliferation of smart-phones; this information is generated live from a multitude ofcontent contributors. Interestingly; the content and timestamp of tweets is not the onlyinformation that can produce useful knowledge. The location information of users is of greatsignificance since it can be utilized in a variety of applications such as emergencyidentification; tracking the spread of a disease and advertising. Unfortunately; informationregarding location is very rare since many users do not accurately specify their location; andfewer posts have geographic coordinates.

City-scale map creation and updating using GPS collections,Chen Chen; Cewu Lu; Qixing Huang; Qiang Yang; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Leonidas Guibas,Abstract Applications such as autonomous driving or real-time route recommendationsrequire up-to-date and accurate digital maps. However; manually creating and updatingsuch maps is too costly to meet the rising demands. As large collections of GPS trajectoriesbecome widely available; constructing and updating maps using such trajectory collectionscan greatly reduce the cost of such maps. Unfortunately; due to GPS noise and varyingtrajectory sampling rates; inferring maps from GPS trajectories can be very challenging. Inthis paper; we present a framework to create up-to-date maps with rich knowledge from GPStrajectory collections. Starting from an unstructured GPS point cloud; we discover roadsegments using novel graph-based clustering techniques with prior knowledge on roaddesign.

Handling multimedia objects in peer-to-peer networks,Vana Kalogeraki; Alex Delis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Video-on-demand systems and services [4; 2] are predominantly offered over dedicatedprivate networks with the help of large servers [3; 13]. Such systems are restricted by thenumber of concurrent accesses allowed as well as load balancing issues that ensue whenthe demand for video objects is skewed [1; 13]. The widespread usage of broadbandnetworks in connection with the low-cost commodity hardware may offer alternative avenuesfor the delivery of video streams and other multimedia objects. This goal can be achievedwith the help of multiple; independent; and inexpensive computing nodes that function usinga peer-to-peer P2P protocol [9; 8; 7].

Dynamic load balancing techniques for distributed complex event processing systems,Nikos Zacheilas; Nikolas Zygouras; Nikolaos Panagiotou; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Applying real-time; cost-effective Complex Event processing (CEP) in the cloud hasbeen an important goal in recent years. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS)have been widely adopted by major computing companies such as Facebook and Twitter forperforming scalable event processing in streaming data. However; dynamically balancingthe load of the DSPS'components can be particularly challenging due to the high volume ofdata; the components' state management needs; and the low latency processingrequirements. Systems should be able to cope with these challenges and adapt to dynamicand unpredictable load changes in real-time. Our approach makes the followingcontributions:(i) we formulate the load balancing problem in distributed CEP systems as aninstance of the job-shop scheduling problem; and (ii) we present a novel framework that …,*,2016,4
Scaling log-linear analysis to datasets with thousands of variables,François Petitjean; Geoffrey I Webb,Abstract Association discovery is a fundamental data mining task. The primary statisticalapproach to association discovery between variables is log-linear analysis. Classicalapproaches to log-linear analysis do not scale beyond about ten variables. We haverecently shown that; if we ensure that the graph supporting the log-linear model is chordal;log-linear analysis can be applied to datasets with hundreds of variables without sacrificingthe statistical soundness [21]. However; further scalability remained limited; because state-of-the-art techniques have to examine every edge at every step of the search. This papermakes the following contributions: 1) we prove that only a very small subset of edges has tobe considered at each step of the search; 2) we demonstrate how to efficiently find thissubset of edges and 3) we show how to efficiently keep track of the best edges to be …,*,2015,4
Skyline Ranking à la IR.,George Valkanas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Dimitrios Gunopulos,ABSTRACT Skyline queries have emerged as an expressive and informative tool; withminimal user input and thus; they have gained widespread attention. However; previousresearch works tackle the problem from an efficiency standpoint; ie; returning the skyline asfast as possible; leaving it to the user to manually inspect the entire skyline result. Clearly;this is impractical; even with a few dozen points. The techniques addressing this issue arecomputationally expensive; mapping to NP-Hard problems or having exponential complexityO (2d) with respect to data dimensionality d. Moreover; the result is a set; lacking any quality-based ranking. In this paper; we propose a novel IR-style ranking mechanism for skylinepoints; based on the renowned tf-idf weighting scheme. We present efficient algorithms tocompute the quality of a skyline point according to our technique; and induce a total …,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2014,4
Event Detection from Social Media Data.,George Valkanas; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Microblogging platforms; such as Twitter; Tumblr etc.; have been established as keycomponents in the contemporary Web ecosystem. Users constantly post snippets ofinformation regarding their actions; interests or perception of their surroundings; which iswhy they have been attributed the term Live Web. Nevertheless; research on such platformshas been quite limited when it comes to identifying events; but is rapidly gaining ground.Event identification is a key step to news reporting; proactive or reactive crisis managementat multiple scales; efficient resource allocation; etc. In this paper; we focus on the problem ofautomatically identifying events as they occur; in such a user-driven; fast paced andvoluminous setting.

Local feature selection for classification,Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos,In a classification problem; we are given C classes and M training observations. The trainingobservations consist of N feature measurements x=(x1;···; xN) T∈ N and the known classlabels y= 1;...; C. The goal is to predict the class label of a given query x0. The K nearestneighbor classification method [10; 14] is a simple and appealing approach to this problem:It finds the K nearest neighbors of x0 in the training set; and then predicts the class label ofx0 as the most frequent one occurring in the K neighbors. Such a method producescontinuous and overlapping; rather than fixed; neighborhoods and uses a differentneighborhood for each individual query so that all points in the neighborhood are close tothe query; to the extent possible. It is based on the assumption of smoothness of the targetfunctions; which translates to locally constant class posterior probabilities for a …,Computational Methods of Feature Selection,2007,4
Distributed middleware architectures for scalable media services,Vana Kalogeraki; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Alex Delis,Abstract The fusion of Multimedia and Internet technology has introduced an ever-increasingdemand for large-scale reliable media services. This exposes the scalability limitations ofcurrent middleware architectures; as they traditionally operate on either very large-serverconfigurations or on tightly coupled distributed systems. On the other hand; the wideavailability of high-speed networks and the widespread deployment of powerful personalcomputing units by end users; has emphasized the advantages of the peer-to-peer (P2P)computing model. In this paper; we evaluate a number of different middleware architecturesthat facilitate the timely and reliable delivery of media services in P2P networks. Ourevaluated architectures exploit features including availability of high-performance links;replication and caching of popular items and finally state-of-the-art search techniques …,Journal of network and computer applications,2007,4
Selective Bayesian classifier: feature selection for the Naive Bayesian classifier using decision trees,C Ratanamahatana; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract It is known that Naive Bayesian classifier (NB) works very well on some domains;and poorly on some. The performance of NB suffers in domains that involve correlatedfeatures. C4. 5 decision trees; on the other hand; typically perform better than the NaiveBayesian algorithm on such domains. This paper describes a Selective Bayesian classifier(SBC) that simply uses only those features that C4. 5 would use in its decision tree whenlearning a small example of a training set; a combination of the two different natures ofclassifiers. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets indicate that SBC performs reliablybetter than NB on all domains; and SBC outperforms C4. 5 on many datasets of which C4. 5outperform NB. SBC also can eliminate; on most cases; more than half of the originalattributes; which can greatly reduce the size of the training and test data; as well as the …,WIT Transactions on Information and Communication Technologies,2002,4

This problem appears in real-life applications; such aspredicting future congestion areas in a highway system; or allocating more bandwidth forcells where high concentration of mobile phones is impending. We address the problem inexternal memory and present dynamic solutions; both for the one-dimensional; as well asthe two-dimensional cases.

Data mining techniques for geospatial applications,Dimitrios Gunopulos,Data mining is emerging as a new active area of research. The area combines methods andtools from the fields of databases; statistics and machine learning. Data mining techniqueshave been applied to many real-life applications; and new applications continue to driveresearch in the area. To date; most data mining research considers relational andtransactional data. Despite the importance and the proliferation of geospatial datasets; onlyrecently has work appeared on mining spatial data. Examples of geospatial data includedata that describe the evolution of natural phenomena; earth science data that describespatiotemporal phenomena in the atmosphere; two-or three-dimensional sequences ofimages of geographical regions; or data that describe the location of individuals in thegeographic space as a function of time.

Indexing Animated Objects.,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract We examine the problem of indexing objects in animated movies. We consider ananimated movie as consisting of a frame sequence where each frame is described byobjects in a 2-dimensional space. The queries of interest are of the form:\nd the objects thatwere in area S between frames fi and fj". The straightforward approach to index such objectsis to consider the frame sequence as another dimension and use a 3-dimensional accessmethod (like an R-tree) to index all objects. Instead we propose to reduce the problem to apartial-persistence problem; that is; use a 2-dimensional access method that is madepartially persistent. We show that this approach leads to faster query time while still usingspace proportional to the total number of changes in the frame evolution.,Multimedia Information Systems,1999,4
Time-series similarity problems and well-separated geometric sets,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Given a pair of nonidentical complex objects; de ning (and determining) how similarthey are to each other is a nontrivial problem. In data mining applications; one frequentlyneeds to determine the similarity between two time series. We analyze a model of time-series similarity that allows outliers; and di erent scaling functions. We present deterministicand randomized algorithms for computing this notion of similarity. The algorithms are basedon nontrivial tools and methods from computational geometry. In particular; we useproperties of families of well-separated geometric sets. The randomized algorithm hasprovably good performance and also works extremely e ciently in practice.,13th Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry. Association for Computing Machinery,1997,4
Induction of shallow decision trees,David Dobkin; Truxton Fulton; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Simon Kasif; Steven Salzberg,Abstract In this paper we describe e cient algorithms that induce shallow (ie; low depth)decision trees. A key feature of these algorithms is their ability to induce decision trees overreal-valued data that have multiple branches at each node (in contrast to algorithms that usebinary splits). As a special case; we describe e cient algorithms for computing the optimalpartitioning of one dimensional data. These algorithms can be used to discretize numericaldatasets either for decision trees or other machine learning methods. We examine theempirical performance of our algorithms on several benchmarks. Several of the algorithmscan be shown theoretically to converge quickly to the best xed-depth decision tree. We alsopresent algorithms to learn\exact" decision trees of minimal depth that correctly classify alltraining examples.

Geometric problems in machine learning,David Dobkin; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We present some problems with geometric characterizations that arise naturally inpractical applications of machine learning. Our motivation comes from a well knownmachine learning problem; the problem of computing decision trees. Typically one is given adataset of positive and negative points; and has to compute a decision tree that fits it. Thepoints are in a low dimensional space; and the data are collected experimentally. Mostpractical solutions use heuristic algorithms. To compute decision trees quickly; one has tosolve optimization problems in one or more dimensions efficiently. In this paper we givegeometric characterizations for these problems. We present a selection of algorithms forsome of them. These algorithms are motivated from practice; and have been in many casesimplemented and used as well. In addition; they are theoretically interesting; and typically …,*,1996,4
Home is where your friends are: Utilizing the social graph to locate twitter users in a city,Dimitrios Kotzias; Theodoros Lappas; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Micro-blogging services such as Twitter have gained enormous popularity over thelast few years leading to massive volumes of user generated content. A portion of thiscontent is shared via geo-aware mobile devices; such as smartphones. Pieces ofinformation shared on such a device can be tagged with the user׳ s location; conditional onthe user׳ s settings. These geostamps enable a number of mainstream applications; such asemergency response; disease tracking; news reporting; and advertising. Unfortunately;informative geostamps are typically sparse; since content is often shared via devices that donot support geo-tagging; such as desktop or laptop computers. In addition; even if a mobiledevice is used; a flawed geo-location service can lead to missing geostamps; or geostampsthat are too general to be informative. In this work; we address this sparsity issue via a …,Information Systems,2016,3
Sensorbench: benchmarking approaches to processing wireless sensor network data,Ixent Galpin; Alan B Stokes; George Valkanas; Alasdair JG Gray; Norman W Paton; Alvaro AA Fernandes; Kai-Uwe Sattler; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Wireless sensor networks enable cost-effective data collection for tasks such asprecision agriculture and environment monitoring. However; the resource-constrainednature of sensor nodes; which often have both limited computational capabilities and batterylifetimes; means that applications that use them must make judicious use of these resources.Research that seeks to support data intensive sensor applications has explored a range ofapproaches and developed many different techniques; including bespoke algorithms forspecific analyses and generic sensor network query processors.

STEM: A spatio-temporal miner for bursty activity,Theodoros Lappas; Marcos R Vieira; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Burst identification has been extensively studied in the context of documentstreams; where a burst is generally exhibited when an unusually high frequency is observedfor a term t. Previous works have focused exclusively on either temporal or spatial burstinesspatterns. The former represents bursty timeframes within a single stream; while the lattercharacterizes sets of streams that simultaneously exhibited a bursty behavior for a user-specified timeframe. Our previous work was the first to study the spatiotemporal burstiness ofterms. In this context; a burstiness pattern consists of both a timeframe and a set of streams;both of which need to be identified automatically. In this paper we describe STEM (Spatio-TEmporal Miner); a system for finding spatiotemporal burstiness patterns in a collection ofspatially distributed frequency streams.

Applying electromagnetic field theory concepts to clustering with constraints,Huseyin Hakkoymaz; Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Heikki Mannila,Abstract This work shows how concepts from the electromagnetic field theory can beefficiently used in clustering with constraints. The proposed framework transforms vectordata into a fully connected graph; or just works straight on the given graph data. Userconstraints are represented by electromagnetic fields that affect the weight of the graph'sedges. A clustering algorithm is then applied on the adjusted graph; using k-distinct shortestpaths as the distance measure. Our framework provides better accuracy compared to MPCK-Means; SS-Kernel-KMeans and Kmeans+ Diagonal Metric even when very few constraintsare used; significantly improves clustering performance on some datasets that othermethods fail to partition successfully; and can cluster both vector and graph datasets. Allthese advantages are demonstrated through thorough experimental evaluation.,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2009,3
Multiresolution clustering of time series and application to images,Jessica Lin; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Summary. Clustering is vital in the process of condensing and outlining information; since it canprovide a synopsis of the stored data. However; the high dimensionality of multime- dia datatoday presents an insurmountable challenge for clustering algorithms. Based on the well-knownfact that time series and image histograms can both be represented accurately in a lower resolutionusing orthonormal decompositions; we present an anytime version of the k-means algorithm.The algorithm works by leveraging off the multiresolution property of wavelets. The dilemmaof choosing the initial centers for k-means is mitigated by assign- ing the final centers at eachapproximation level as the initial centers for the subsequent; finer approximation. In additionto casting k-means as an anytime algorithm; our approach has two other very desirableproperties. We observe that even by working at coarser ap- proximations; the achieved …,*,2007,3

Efficient parameter learning of Bayesian network classifiers,Nayyar A Zaidi; Geoffrey I Webb; Mark J Carman; François Petitjean; Wray Buntine; Mike Hynes; Hans De Sterck,Abstract Recent advances have demonstrated substantial benefits from learning with bothgenerative and discriminative parameters. On the one hand; generative approachesaddress the estimation of the parameters of the joint distribution—P (y; x) P (y; x); which formost network types is very computationally efficient (a notable exception to this are Markovnetworks) and on the other hand; discriminative approaches address the estimation of theparameters of the posterior distribution—and; are more effective for classification; since theyfit P (y| x) P (y| x) directly. However; discriminative approaches are less computationallyefficient as the normalization factor in the conditional log-likelihood precludes the derivationof closed-form estimation of parameters.

Mining Competitors from Large Unstructured Datasets,George Valkanas; Theodoros Lappas; Dimitrios Gunopulos,In any competitive business; success is based on the ability to make an item more appealingto customers than the competition. A number of questions arise in the context of this task:how do we formalize and quantify the competitiveness between two items? Who are themain competitors of a given item? What are the features of an item that most affect itscompetitiveness? Despite the impact and relevance of this problem to many domains; only alimited amount of work has been devoted toward an effective solution. In this paper; wepresent a formal definition of the competitiveness between two items; based on the marketsegments that they can both cover.

Knowledge-based trajectory completion from sparse GPS samples,Yang Li; Yangyan Li; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Leonidas Guibas,Abstract Traffic trajectories collected from GPS-enabled mobile devices or vehicles arewidely used in urban planning; traffic management; and location based services. Theirperformance often relies on having dense trajectories. However; due to the power andbandwidth limitation on these devices; collecting dense trajectory is too costly on a largescale. We show that by exploiting structural regularity in large trajectory data; the completegeometry of trajectories can be inferred from sparse GPS samples without information aboutthe underlying road network-a process called trajectory completion. In this paper; we presenta knowledge-based approach for completing traffic trajectories. Our method extracts anetwork of road junctions and estimates traffic flows across junctions.

Real-time and cost-effective limitation of misinformation propagation,Iouliana Litou; Vana Kalogeraki; Ioannis Katakis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Online Social Networks (OSNs) constitute one of the most important communicationchannels and are widely utilized as news sources. Information spreads widely and rapidly inOSNs through the word-of-mouth effect. However; it is not uncommon for misinformation topropagate in the network. Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects;especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events.Therefore; it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation. Towards this goal;we suggest a novel propagation model; namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model;that effectively captures the way contradictory information; ie; misinformation and credibleinformation; propagates in the network.

Language agnostic meme-filtering for hashtag-based social network analysis,Dimitrios Kotsakos; Panos Sakkos; Ioannis Katakis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Users in social networks utilize hashtags for a variety of reasons. In many cases;hashtags serve retrieval purposes by labeling the content they accompany. More often thannot; hashtags are used to promote content; ideas; or conversations producing viral memes.This paper addresses a specific case of hashtag classification: meme-filtering. We argue thathashtags that are correlated with memes may hinder many valuable social media algorithmslike trend detection and event identification. We propose and evaluate a set of language-agnostic features that aid the separation of these two classes: meme-hashtags and event-hashtags. The proposed approach is evaluated on two large datasets of Twitter messageswritten in English and German. A proof-of-concept application of the meme-filteringapproach to the problem of event detection is presented.,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2015,2

We present their strengthsand their drawbacks and identify that continuous subset queries can be further optimized.We propose a framework for answering continuous subset queries with multiple operatorsthat can adapt to network and data changes. A query routing tree can be broken down intoan operator tree; an operator placement assignment and a routing scheme. The operatortree defines the order in which the operators will be applied to the data and how the resultswill be pipelined from one operator to the other.

Applying LVQ techniques to compress historical information in sensor networks,Song Lin; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Stefano Lonardi; Vana Kalogeraki,Summary form only given. In the emerging area of wireless sensor networks; a typicalchallenge is to retrieve historical information from the sensor nodes. We propose a newtechnique; called adaptive learning vector quantization (ALVQ); to compress this historicalinformation. Our technique is based on the following two observations:(1) in sensornetworks; the historical information exhibits similar patterns over time; and (2) differentmeasurements are intrinsically correlated.

Learning patterns for discovering domain-oriented opinion words,Pantelis Agathangelou; Ioannis Katakis; Ioannis Koutoulakis; Fotis Kokkoras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Sentiment analysis is a challenging task that attracted increasing interest during thelast years. The availability of online data along with the business interest to keep up withconsumer feedback generates a constant demand for online analysis of user-generatedcontent. A key role to this task plays the utilization of domain-specific lexicons of opinionwords that enables algorithms to classify short snippets of text into sentiment classes(positive; negative). This process is known as dictionary-based sentiment analysis. Therelated work tends to solve this lexicon identification problem by either exploiting a corpusand a thesaurus or by manually defining a set of patterns that will extract opinion words. Inthis work; we propose an unsupervised approach for discovering patterns that will extractdomain-specific dictionary. Our approach (DidaxTo) utilizes opinion modifiers; sentiment …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2017,1
On topic aware recommendation to increase popularity in microblogging services (short paper),Iouliana Litou; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract The flourish of Web-based Online Social Networks (OSNs) has led to numerousapplications that exploit social relationships to boost the influence of content in the network.However; existing approaches focus on the social ties and ignore how the topic of a postand its structure relate to its popularity. Our work assists in filling this gap. The contribution ofthis work is two-fold:(i) we develop a scheme that automatically identifies the topic of a post;specifically tweets; in real-time without human participation in the process; and then (ii)based on the topic of the tweet and prior related posts; we recommend appropriate structuralproperties to increase the popularity of the particular tweet. By exploiting Wikipedia; ourmodel requires no training or expensive feature engineering for the classification of tweets totopics.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2016,1
Processing top-k dominating queries in metric spaces,Eleftherios Tiakas; George Valkanas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Top-k dominating queries combine the natural idea of selecting the k best itemswith a comprehensive “goodness” criterion based on dominance. A point p 1 dominates p 2if p 1 is as good as p 2 in all attributes and is strictly better in at least one. Existing worksaddress the problem in settings where data objects are multidimensional points. However;there are domains where we only have access to the distance between two objects. In caseslike these; attributes reflect distances from a set of input objects and are dynamicallygenerated as the input objects change. Consequently; prior works from the literature cannotbe applied; despite the fact that the dominance relation is still meaningful and valid. For thisreason; in this work; we present the first study for processing top-k dominating queries overdistance-based dynamic attribute vectors; defined over a metric space. We propose four …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,1
First Story Detection using Entities and Relations,Nikolaos Panagiotou; Cem Akkaya; Kostas Tsioutsiouliklis; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,News portals; such as Yahoo News or Google News; collect large amounts of documentsfrom a variety of sources on a daily basis. Only a small portion of these documents can beselected and displayed on the homepage. Thus; there is a strong preference for major;recent events. In this work; we propose a scalable and accurate First Story Detection (FSD)pipeline that identifies fresh news. In comparison to other FSD systems; our method relies onrelation extraction methods exploiting entities and their relations. We evaluate our pipelineusing two distinct datasets from Yahoo News and Google News. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that our method improves over the state-of-the-art systems on both datasetswith constant space and time requirements.,Proceedings of COLING 2016; the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,2016,1
Evaluating Distance Measures for Trajectories in the Mobile Setting.,Nikolaos Larios; Christos Mitatakis; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Mobile devices; such as smartphones allow us to use computationally expensivealgorithms and techniques. In this paper; we study algorithms in order to solve the problemof finding the most similar trajectory within a number of trajectories. We built a framework thatenables the user to compare a trajectory Q with trajectories that have been generated andstored on mobile devices. The system returns to the user the most similar trajectory based onthe algorithm that has been selected. The algorithms for the measurement of the trajectorysimilarity have been implemented for mobile devices running Android OS. We evaluate ouralgorithms with real geospatial data.,MUD@ ICML,2015,1
Predicting download directories for web resources,George Valkanas; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Browsing the web is one of the most common activities that users engage innowadays; and downloading web resources of interest; such as images; documents; music;etc.; is part of this process. However; users would rather temporarily save that resource to adefault path that they have easy access to (eg their" Desktop") than select the actualdirectory where they would eventually place it. This clearly implies that existing userinterfaces are not as effective for this particular task as the users would like them to be.Instead of proposing a different User Interface; in this paper; we try to address the problem atits core; and propose a methodology to suggest the most likely directory where the file would(eventually) be saved by the user. By doing so; future interfaces can also benefit from ourtechnique. We provide a formal definition of the problem and propose a classification …,Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Web Intelligence; Mining and Semantics (WIMS14),2014,1
Finding representative objects using link analysis ranking,Panagiotis Papapetrou; Tatiana Chistiakova; Jaakko Hollmén; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Link analysis ranking methods are widely used for summarizing the connectivitystructure of large networks. We explore a weighted version of two common link analysisranking algorithms; PageRank and HITS; and study their applicability to assistiveenvironment data. Based on these methods; we propose a novel approach for identifyingrepresentative objects in large datasets; given their similarity matrix. The novelty of ourapproach is that it takes into account both the pair-wise similarities between the objects; aswell as the origin and" evolution path" of these similarities within the dataset. The key step ofour method is to define a complete graph; where each object is represented by a node andeach edge in the graph is given a weight equal to the pairwise similarity value of the twoadjacent nodes. Nodes with high ranking scores correspond to representative objects …,Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments,2012,1

Trajectories; discovering similar,George Kollios; Michail Vlachos; Dimitris Gunopulos,Geographic information is inherently spatial and temporal. Geographic applications oftendemand an integrative approach to examine changes and interactions over space and time.Temporal geographic information systems (GIS) are defined here as GIS capable ofincorporating temporality into geospatial databases and enabling spatiotemporal query;analysis; and modeling. Adding time into geospatial databases is a far from trivial task.Currently; commercial or public-domain temporal GIS support cell-based spatial data (ie;rasters) or spatial data objects with one or restricted sets of simple geometries; mostly point-or line-based data only. Research-grade temporal GIS remain limited to pilot studies orprototypes. While comprehensive temporal GIS are still unavailable; much progress hasbeen made to advance the conceptualization; representation; and reasoning of changes …,*,2008,1

Workflow process models: discovering decision point locations by analyzing data dependencies,Sharmila Subramaniam; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Fabio Casati; Umeshwar Dayal; Mehmet Sayal; Malu Castellanos,Abstract Workflow technologies are being increasingly used by business enterprises toenhance their process and service efficiency. Workflow process models; which form thebackbone of process automation; are manually designed. This process entails assumptionsand errors. This leads to inaccurate models and inefficient process executions along withcomplexity in understanding of the process itself. In this work we present a novel techniquefor improving the accuracy and thereby the efficiency of Workflow models. Our methodattempts to precisely position the decision points in a process model through data miningtechniques. We implement methods to discover efficient positions for decision points; andtransform the model graph to enable removal of redundant tasks.,Temporal data mining: algorithms; theory and applications (TDM 2005),2005,1

Time-Decaying Representations of Streaming Time Series,Themistoklis Palpanas; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Wagner Truppel,Abstract. During the last years we have witnessed a wealth of research on approximaterepresentations for time series. The vast majority of the proposed approaches representeach value with approximately equal fidelity; which may not be always desirable. Forexample; mobile devices and real time sensors have brought home the need forrepresentations that can approximate the data with fidelity proportional to its age. We callsuch time-decaying representations amnesic. In this work; we introduce a novelrepresentation of time series that can represent arbitrary; user-specified time-decayingfunctions. We propose online algorithms for our representation; and discuss their properties.The algorithms we describe are designed to work on both the entire stream of data; or on asliding window of the data stream.

Low-Rank Methods in Event Detection,Jakub Marecek; Stathis Maroulis; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract: We present low-rank methods for event detection. We assume that normalobservation come from a low-rank subspace; prior to being corrupted by a uniformlydistributed noise. Correspondingly; we aim at recovering a representation of the subspace;and perform event detection by running point-to-subspace distance query in $\ell^\infty $; foreach incoming observation. In particular; we use a variant of matrix completion underinterval uncertainty on a suitable flattening $ M\in R^{m\times n} $ of the input data to obtaina low-rank model $ M\approx L\times R $; $ L\in R^{m\times r} $; $ R\in R^{r\times n} $; $ r\llm $. On-line; we compute the distance of each incoming $ x\in R^ n $ to the space spannedby $ R $. For the distance computation; we present a constant-time algorithm with a one-sided error bounded by a function of the number of coordinates employed.

Social Event Scheduling,Nikos Bikakis; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract: A major challenge for social event organizers (eg; event planning companies;venues) is attracting the maximum number of participants; since it has great impact on thesuccess of the event; and; consequently; the expected gains (eg; revenue; artist/brandpublicity). In this paper; we introduce the Social Event Scheduling (SES) problem; whichschedules a set of social events considering user preferences and behavior; events'spatiotemporal conflicts; and competing events; in order to maximize the overall number ofparticipants. We show that SES is strongly NP-hard; even in highly restricted instances. Tocope with the hardness of the SES problem we design a greedy approximation algorithm.Finally; we evaluate our method experimentally using a real dataset.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.09973,2018,*
Urban Travel Time Prediction using a Small Number of GPS Floating Cars,Yang Li; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Cewu Lu; Leonidas Guibas,Abstract Predicting the travel time of a path is an important task in route planning andnavigation applications. As more GPS floating car data has been collected to monitor urbantraffic; GPS trajectories of floating cars have been frequently used to predict path travel time.However; most trajectory-based methods rely on deploying GPS devices and collect real-time data on a large taxi fleet; which can be expensive and unreliable in smaller cities. Thiswork deals with the problem of predicting path travel time when only a small number of GPSfloating cars are available. We developed an algorithm that learns local congestion patternsof a compact set of frequently shared paths from historical data. Given a travel timeprediction query; we identify the current congestion patterns around the query path fromrecent trajectories; then infer its travel time in the near future.

The vast amount of the generated location data is particularlydifficult to be processed; interpreted and analyzed; due to its complexity. Nevertheless; inmany cases a considerable number of moving objects share common paths and their wholetrajectory can be decomposed as a sequence of such commonly accessed paths; referredas corridors.

An efficient technique for event location identification using multiple sources of urban data,Dimitrios Tomaras; Vana Kalogeraki; Nikolas Zygouras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract The proliferation of smart technologies has produced significant changes in the waypeople interact in a city. Smart traffic monitoring systems allow citizens and city operators toacquire a real-time view of the city traffic state. Furthermore; alternative means of transport;such as bike sharing systems; have enjoyed tremendous success in many major citiesaround the world today and provide real-time information regarding the mobility of the users.Such sources of urban data may act as human mobility sensors. Detecting the location andextent of large events in urban environments is a challenging problem. Previous workfocuses mainly on identifying traffic flows and extract possible event sources. However;these solutions lack the ability to capture large areas of events; as they rely only on single-source data to identify user mobility or focus on identifying single locations rather than …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Recommendations for Location-based Services and Social Networks,2017,*

Efficient and timely misinformation blocking under varying cost constraints,Iouliana Litou; Vana Kalogeraki; Ioannis Katakis; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Online Social Networks (OSNs) constitute one of the most important communicationchannels and are widely utilized as news sources. Information spreads widely and rapidly inOSNs through the word-of-mouth effect. However; it is not uncommon for misinformation topropagate in the network. Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects;especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events.Therefore; it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation. Towards this goal;we suggest a novel propagation model; namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model;that effectively captures the way contradictory information; ie; misinformation and credibleinformation; propagates in the network. The DLT model considers the probability of a useralternating between competing beliefs; assisting in either the propagation of …,Online Social Networks and Media,2017,*

Mining hidden constrained streams in practice: Informed search in dynamic filter spaces,Nikolaos Panagiotou; Ioannis Katakis; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki; Elizabeth Daly; Jia Yuan Yu; Brendan O Brien,In this paper we tackle the recently proposed problem of hidden streams. In many situations;the data stream that we are interested in; is not directly accessible. Instead; part of the datacan be accessed only through applying filters (eg keyword filtering). In fact this is the case ofthe most discussed social stream today; Twitter. The problem in this case is how to retrieveas many relevant documents as possible by applying the most appropriate set of filters to theoriginal stream and; at the same time; respect a number of constrains (eg maximum numberof filters that can be applied).

Declarative In-Network Sensor Data Analysis,George Valkanas; Ixent Galpin; Alasdair JG Gray; Alvaro AA Fernandes; Norman W Paton; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract. Bridging data analysis techniques with classic query processing has long been ofinterest in the database community. Most approaches; however; are usually developed witha specific domain in mind; eg relational; streaming etc.; use their own query language; orfocus on specific techniques. In this paper; we propose a simple; yet effective; extension tostandard or commonly used declarative processing languages to support data mining. Ourapproach is independent of a particular domain; and by utilizing a query refactoringtechnique; optimization issues are taken care of by the underlying query processing engine;which is already in place and knows best the setting's particularities. Therefore; ourapproach promotes ease of programmability; development; and use of the data miningtechniques; with minimal modifications in the query processing stack. We demonstrate …,WORKSHOP ON LANGUAGES FOR DATA MINING AND MACHINE LEARNING,2013,*

Data streams are characterised by theirenormous size (potentially infinite); rapid arrival rate and their transient nature (in terms ofdata distributions). Since the data streams are open-ended by definition (ie; they have andinfinite size as data keeps arriving); these operators would go into a perpetual wait state.Moreover; these conventional operators are designed to give the exact answers and alwaysmake a complete iteration over all the available data whenever they are invoked; hence; areextremely resource intensive; not in terms of time and space. In the context of stream mining;where resources are limited; the algorithms make a trade off of accuracy for efficiency. Theanswers provided by the streaming algorithms are approximation of the original answers(with error bounds). Please find a list of articles that proposes new techniques that aim at …,*,2012,*

Evaluation of the SemsorGrid4Env SNDM Software Platform,Alasdair JG Gray; Ixent Galpin; Alvaro AA Fernandes; Norman W Paton; George Valkanas; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Josep Rodrıguez; Juanjo Aparicio,Executive Summary One of the features of the SemSorGrid4Env architecture is the ability forusers to pose declarative queries in order to receive the data that they require. That is; theuser need not worry about where; when; or how data is gathered; they need only state theirdata needs. Work Package 2 (WP2) aims to support this vision by providing animplementation of the streaming data service through which users can pose declarativequeries in SNEEql. It is also intended to enhance the querying capabilities through dataanalysis functionality being made available directly in the query. Sensor networks fall intotwo different categories. The first type of sensor network has fixed functionality with a streamof data being generated at a fixed rate. In order to query this stream of data; the stream mustbe processed outwith of the sensor network; called out-of-network evaluation. The second …,*,2011,*

Embedding-based Subsequence Matching in Time Series Databases,VASSILIS ATHITSOS; MICHALIS POTAMIAS; GEORGE KOLLIOS; DIMITRIOS GUNOPULOS,We propose an embedding-based framework for subsequence matching in time seriesdatabases that improves the efficiency of processing subsequence matching queries underthe Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure. This framework partially reducessubsequence matching to vector matching; using an embedding that maps each querysequence to a vector and each database time series into a sequence of vectors. Thedatabase embedding is computed off-line; as a preprocessing step. At runtime; given aquery object; an embedding of that object is computed online. Relatively few areas ofinterest are efficiently identified in the database sequences by comparing the embedding ofthe query with the database vectors. Those areas of interest are then fully explored using theexact DTW-based subsequence matching algorithm. We apply the proposed framework …,*,2011,*

Workflow models are the fundamental components of workflowmanagement systems; and are used for defining; scheduling; and ordering of workflowtasks. Since the control flow specifications of workflows are manually designed; they entailassumptions and errors; leading to inaccurate workflow models.

SSDBM 2003,Silvia Nittel; Dimitrios Gunopulos,In most cases unique identifiers are required to join data from different databases. If globalunique keys are absent or corrupted the supplement of data extracted from different sourcesbecomes difficult. The main question is: does a given record relates to an entity; which isidentical to an entity corresponding to another record; or not? This leads to a classificationproblem with at least two classes: identical and not identical. Classifying pairs of recordsneeds a three-step procedure. The first step is to define suitable common properties(attributes) of data for all different sources. Secondly; to allow comparisons the values of therecords are transformed to these common properties. Finally; the classification is performedon an almost finite subset; the range of an appropriate comparison function. Differentclassification techniques can be applied like Association Rules; Classification Trees …,*,2003,*

An Active Learning Framework Incorporating User Input For Mining Urban Data,Nikolas Zygouras; Nikolaos Panagiotou; Nikos Zacheilas; Ioannis Boutsis; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,ABSTRACT Analyzing and detecting events from ubiquitous sensors across the city hasbeen an important goal in recent years. Different techniques that are able to automaticallydetect events by monitoring urban sensor's data have been efficiently applied in severalsmart cities to improve the citizens everyday life. However; the analysis of such voluminousdata streams often interferes with several constraints that arise in smart cities scenarios. Forexample it is impossible to hire human oracles that will monitor each data streamcontinuously to provide knowledge to these models and to annotate past instances. Thus;the development of novel techniques is required in order to build efficient supervisedlearning models that will be able to cope with urban data deluge. Our approach makes thefollowing contributions:(i) we formulate the problem of building supervised learning …,*,*,*
On Topic Aware Recommendation to Increase Popularity in Microblogging Services,Iouliana Litou; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract. The flourish of Web-based Online Social Networks (OSNs) has led to numerousapplications that exploit social relationships to boost the influence of content in the network.However; existing approaches focus on the social ties and ignore how the topic of a postand its structure relate to its popularity. Our work assists in filling this gap. The contribution ofthis work is two-fold:(i) we develop a scheme that automatically identifies the topic of a post;specifically tweets; in real-time without human participation in the process; and then (ii)based on the topic of the tweet and prior related posts; we recommend appropriate structuralproperties to increase the popularity of the particular tweet. By exploiting Wikipedia; ourmodel requires no training or expensive feature engineering for the classification of tweets totopics.,*,*,*

On the Spatiotemporal Burstiness of Terms,Marcos R Vieira; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Thousands of documents are made available to the users via the web on a dailybasis. One of the most extensively studied problems in the context of such documentstreams is burst identification. Given a term t; a burst is generally exhibited when anunusually high frequency is observed for t. While spatial and temporal burstiness have beenstudied individually in the past; our work is the first to simultaneously track and measurespatiotemporal term burstiness. In addition; we use the mined burstiness information towardan efficient document-search engine: given a user's query of terms; our engine returns aranked list of documents discussing influential events with a strong spatiotemporal impact.We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods with an extensive experimental evaluation onreal and synthetic datasets. 1.,*,*,*

Efficient Indexing for Spatiotemporal Applications,Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Indexing spatiotemporal data is an important problem for many applications (global change;transportation; social and multimedia applications). The goal of this project is to provideefficient access methods for data whose geometry changes over time. Two time-varyingspatial attributes are considered; the object position and extent. Based on the rate by whichthese spatial attributes change; the discrete and continuous spatiotemporal environmentsare identified. In the discrete environment; spatiotemporal data changes in discrete steps.Efficient ways to answer historical queries on any past state of such spatiotemporal data areexamined. In particular; selection; neighbor; aggregate; join and similarity queries areaddressed using a" partial persistence" methodology. In the continuous spatiotemporalenvironment; data changes continuously. Instead of keeping the data position/extent at …,*,*,*
Efﬁcient Local Flexible Nearest Neighbor Classiﬁcation,Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing method to addressclassiﬁcation problems. It relies on the assumption of locally constant class conditionalprobabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a ﬁnite number ofexamples due to the curse of dimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under theseconditions when using the nearest neigh—bor rule. The employment of a local adaptivemetric becomes crucial in order to keep class conditional probabilities close to uniform7 andtherefore to minimize the bias of estimates. We propose a technique that computes a locallyﬁexible metric by means of Support Vector Machines (SVMS). The maximum mar—ginboundary found by the SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over thequery's neighborhood. Such di—rection provides a local weighting scheme for input …,*,*,*

Efficient Ad-hoc Approximate Query Processing in Peer-to-Peer Databases1,Benjamin Arai; Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki,ABSTRACT Peer-to-peer databases are becoming prevalent on the Internet for distributionand sharing of documents; applications; and other digital media. The problem of answeringlarge scale; ad-hoc analysis queries–eg; aggregation queries–on these databases posesunique challenges. Exact solutions can be time consuming and difficult to implement giventhe distributed and dynamic nature of peer-to-peer databases. In this paper we presentnovel sampling-based techniques for approximate answering of ad-hoc aggregation queriesin such databases. Computing a high-quality random sample of the database efficiently inthe P2P environment is complicated due to several factors–the data is distributed (usually inuneven quantities) across many peers; within each peer the data is often highly correlated;and moreover; even collecting a random sample of the peers is difficult to accomplish.

Multi-Resolution K-Means Clustering of Time Series and Application to Images,Michail Vlachos Jessica Lin Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,ABSTRACT Clustering is vital in the process of condensing and outlining information; sinceit can provide a synopsis of the stored data. However; the high dimensionality of multimediadata today presents an insurmountable challenge for clustering algorithms. Based on thewell known fact that time series and image histograms can both be represented accurately ina lower resolution using orthonormal decompositions; we present an anytime version of thek-Means algorithm. The algorithm works by leveraging the multi-resolution property ofwavelets. The dilemma of choosing the initial centers for k-Means is mitigated by assigningthe final centers at each approximation level as the initial centers for the subsequent; finerapproximation. This process is repeated until the clustering results stabilize or until the finest“approximation” level is reached. In addition to casting k-Means as an anytime algorithm …,*,*,*

A Wavelet-Based Anytime Algorithm for K-Means Clustering of Time Series,Michail Vlachos Jessica Lin Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,ABSTRACT The emergence of the field of data mining in the last decade has sparked anincreasing interest in clustering of time series. Although there has been much research onclustering in general; most classic machine learning and data mining algorithms do not workwell for time series due to their unique structure. In particular; the high dimensionality; veryhigh feature correlation; and the (typically) large amount of noise that characterize timeseries data present a difficult challenge. In this work we address these challenges byintroducing a novel anytime version of k-Means clustering algorithm for time series. Thealgorithm works by leveraging off the multi-resolution property of wavelets. In particular; aninitial clustering is performed with a very coarse resolution representation of the data. Theresults obtained from this “quick and dirty” clustering are used to initialize a clustering at a …,*,*,*

Fast Motion Capture Matching with Replicated Motion Editing,Marc Cardle Michail Vlachos Stephen Brooks; Dimitrios Gunopulos,The possibility of storing large quantities of human motion capture; or” mocap '; has resultedin a growing demand for content-based retrieval of motion sequences without usingannotations or other meta-data. We address the issue of rapidly retrieving perceptuallysimilar occurrences of a particular motion in a long mocap sequence or unstructured mocapdatabase for the purpose of replicating editing operations with minimal user-input. One ormore editing operations on a given motion are made to affect all similar matching motions.This general approach is applied to standard mocap editing operations such astimewarping; filtering or motion-warping.

In density-biased sampling; the probability that a givenpoint will be included in the sample depends on the local density of the dataset. We proposea general technique for density-biased sampling that can factor in user requirements tosample for properties of interest; and can be tuned for specific data mining tasks. This allowsgreat flexibility; and improved accuracy of the results over simple random sampling. Wedescribe our approach in detail; we analytically evaluate it; and show how it can beoptimized for approximate clustering and outlier detection. Finally we present a thoroughexperimental evaluation of the proposed method; applying density-biased sampling on …,*,*,*
Temporal Aggregation with Range Predicates,Donghui Zhang; Alexander Markowetz; Vassilis Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract A temporal aggregation query is an important but costly operation for applicationsthat maintain time-evolving data (data warehouses; temporal databases; etc.). Due to thelarge volume of such data; performance improvements for temporal aggregation queries arecritical. Previous approaches have aggregate predicates that involve only the timedimension. In this paper we examine techniques to compute temporal aggregates thatinclude key-range predicates as well (range-temporal aggregates). In particular weconcentrate on the SUM aggregate; while COUNT is a special case. This problem is novel;to handle arbitrary key ranges; previous methods would need to keep a separate index forevery possible key range. We propose an approach based on a new index structure calledthe Multiversion SB-Tree; which incorporates features from both the SB-Tree and the …,*,*,*

Multidimensional Membership Queries for Temporal Databases,Lifei Tan; Vassilis J Tsotras; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Consider a dynamic set of multidimensional objects S; that evolves over time. Atemporal membership query asks whether an object with given key attributes was in the setS at some time t. This paper provides efficient solutions to this temporal query. In particular;we present partially persistent extensions to (i) a hashing based scheme-the BANG file and(ii) the hB-tree. The performance of both methods is compared with a persistent R-tree andan ephemeral R tree. Our experiments show the efficiency of the proposed methods.,*,*,*
Locally Adaptive Metrics for Clustering,Carlotta Domeniconi; Bojun Yan; Dimitris Papadopoulos; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Sheng Ma,Abstract Clustering suffers from the curse of dimensionality; and similarity functions that useall input features with equal relevance may not be effective. We introduce an algorithm thatdiscovers clusters in subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions via localweightings of features. This approach avoids the risk of loss of information encountered inglobal dimensionality reduction techniques; and does not assume any data distributionmodel. Our method associates to each cluster a weight vector; whose values capture therelevance of features within the corresponding cluster. We experimentally demonstrate thegain in perfomance our method achieves; using both synthetic and real data sets. Inparticular; our results show the feasibility of the proposed technique to perform simultaneousclustering of genes and conditions in microarray data.,*,*,*
